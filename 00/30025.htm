    <title>XBox One controller - left joystick stuck - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBox One controller - left joystick stuck</h2>
                    <p>Since purchasing an XBox in December, I've had ongoing problems with my controller. The left joystick continues to get stuck in the depressed position, and I have to manually pull it out. When I play Madden, this keeps me from running to the right - the
 player just stops on screen because the left joystick is "pressed" down. The only way to unlock the player is to pull the joystick back into its original position. This happens on every single play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already returned one controller to Microsoft to be replaced -- of course, I had to pay a shipping fee -- and both the replacement controller, and another that I purchased have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone recommend a fix to deal with the sticky joystick so I can enjoy my games without buying another $50 controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

Thanks. I opened one of them up since it wasn't under warranty and used compressed air. It didn't help at all. But the fact that this has happened across three separate controllers is a problem.

<h2>            Help running batch file from USB</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to run a batch file from a flash drive that I insert into my Vista machine. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using a PNY Mini Attache 4GB USB Flash drive. &nbsp;In notepad, I created the following text file:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>[autorun]</div>
<div>open = mybatchfile.bat</div>
<div>label = Z</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and I saved this file as autorun.inf in the root directory of the flash drive. &nbsp;I also created this file in notepad:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>@echo off</div>
<div>echo TEST</div>
<div>pause</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and saved this file as mybatchfile.bat in the root directory of the flash drive. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I insert the flash drive, the normal Autoplay dialogue box pops up with the normal options to Open folder to view files and Speed up my system. &nbsp;The flash drive is also relabeled as Z. &nbsp;I know the autorun.inf file is being read because the drive is
 renamed to Z in the dialogue box, but there is no option to run the batch file. &nbsp;Why isn't there an option to run the batch file in the dialogue box?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Relevant details:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Windows Vista Home Premium edition with service pack 1. &nbsp;I have autoplay enabled for all media devices. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anybody could help me resolve this I would really appreciate it. &nbsp;I have spent hours trying to get to the bottom of this but I am unfortunately no Billy Gates. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<br />

            <p>The feature you are talking about is Autorun. Autoplay is a seperate feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Using the Registry to Disable AutoRun
<p>There are two registry values that can be used to persistently disable AutoRun: NoDriveAutoRun and NoDriveTypeAutoRun. The first value disables AutoRun for specified drive letters and the second disables AutoRun for a class of drives. If either of these
 values is set to disable AutoRun for a particular device, it will be disabled.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> The NoDriveAutoRun and NoDriveTypeAutoRun values should only be modified by system administrators to change the value for the entire system for testing or administrative purposes. Applications should not modify these values, as there is no way
 to reliably restore them to their original values.</p>
<p>The NoDriveAutoRun value disables AutoRun for specified drive letters. It is a
<b>REG_DWORD</b> data value, found under the <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</b> key. The first bit of the value corresponds to A:, the second to B:, and so on. To disable AutoRun for one or more drive letters,
 set the corresponding bits. For example, to disable the A: and C: drives, set NoDriveAutoRun to 0x00000005.
</p>
<p>The NoDriveTypeAutoRun value disables AutoRun for a class of drives. It is a <b>
REG_DWORD</b> or 4-byte <b>REG_BINARY</b> data value, found under the <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</b> key. By setting the bits of this value's first byte, different drives can be excluded from working with
 AutoRun.</p>
<p>The following table gives the bits and bitmask constants that can be set in the first byte of NoDriveTypeAutoRun to disable AutoRun for a particular drive type. For Microsoft® Windows NT and Windows&nbsp;2000, you must restart Windows Explorer before the changes
 take effect.</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Bit Number </th>
<th>Bitmask Constant </th>
<th>Description </th>

AutoRun for Other Types of Storage Media
<p>AutoRun is primarily intended for public distribution of applications on CD-ROM and DVD-ROM. However, it is often useful to enable AutoRun on other types of removable storage media. This feature is typically used to simplify the debugging of AutoRun.inf
 files. AutoRun only works on removable storage devices when the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device must have AutoRun-compatible drivers. To be AutoRun-compatible, a driver must notify the system that a disk has been inserted by sending a
WM_DEVICECHANGE message. </li><li>The root directory of the inserted media must contain an Autorun.inf file. </li><li>The device must not have AutoRun disabled through the registry.
</li><li>The foreground application has not suppressed AutoRun. </li></ul>
<p><b>Note</b> This feature should not be used to distribute applications on floppy disks. Because implementing AutoRun on a floppy disk provides an easy way to spread computer viruses, users should be suspicious of any publicly distributed floppy disk that
 contains an Autorun.inf file.</p>
<p>Normally, AutoRun starts automatically, but it can also be started manually. If the device meets the criteria listed above, the drive letter's shortcut menu will include an
<b>AutoPlay</b> command. To run AutoRun manually, either right-click the drive icon and select
<b>AutoPlay</b> from the shortcut menu or double-click the drive icon. If the drivers are not AutoRun-compatible, the shortcut menu will not have an
<b>AutoPlay</b> item and AutoRun cannot be started.</p>
<p>AutoRun-compatible drivers are provided with some floppy disk drives, as well as some other types of removable media such as Compact Flash cards. AutoRun also works with network drives that are mapped to a drive letter with Windows Explorer or mounted with
 the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). As with mounted hardware, a mounted network drive must have an Autorun.inf file in its root directory, and must not be disabled through the
registry.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>George Beach</strong>, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Which update was installed recently?<br />
<br />
Refer the link mentioned below to check the updates which are installed on the computer.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Refer the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div><strong>Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>There are various reasons for the sound from speakers to crackle. One could be the sound card driver isn’t up to date. Updating the same could fix the issue. Other possible reasons for the crackling sound could be electrical interference, dust, etc.<br />
<br />
Refer the following Microsoft article that contains solutions to some common sound problems on your computer:<br />
<strong>Tips for fixing common sound problems</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</a>
<br />
<br />
Try these steps and check if that makes things any better:<br />
<br />
1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, and select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Select <strong>Hardware and Sound </strong>and click <strong>Sound</strong>.<br />
3. Under the <strong>Playback tab</strong>, select <strong>Speakers </strong>and click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </div>
<div>4. Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.<br />
5. Uncheck the Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device option.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you may also put the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue recurs.<br />
<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />
<br />
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>Dustin, is this on a Dell Inspiron? (as in the original post)...</p>
<p>There was a specific issue with a driver update that affected Dell pcs - mine was one of them, but it was resolved.</p>
<p>If you are using a Dell you need to go to their website and check if all the audio drivers are installed. If not the problem may still be driver related and you should check the manufacturer's website. - R.</p>

            <p><em>"Should I just delete that folder???"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- You should not&nbsp; "just delete" any folder that contains an installed software. Software should be uninstalled</p>
<p>via <em>Programs and Features </em>so you are not left with orphaned folders and registry keys.</p>
<p>Orphaned registry keys could cause issues when trying to reinstall a software.</p>
<p>(Well, sometimes software leaves folders behind anyway, but uninstalling properly is still best practice.
</p>
<p>- There is one folder you can delete. The drivers get unpacked to a folder in C:\ titled
<em>AMD</em>. </p>
<p>You can delete the driver sub-folders once the driver has been installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you leave the CAP sub-folders. (the CAP files are the profiles for games) until you verify at the
</p>
<p>AMD forums if these are the only location&nbsp; for the game profiles.</p>
<p>I don't use AMD for gaming these days and don't know if the profiles are installed&nbsp; in another location, or not.
</p>
<p>I expect they are, but whatever the case, they don't use much disk space. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Hydra-vision also allows for several 'virtual' desktops on the one monitor.</p>
<p>I don't have Hydra-vision, and on my current AMD install, and haven't for some years. I was thinking it was</p>
<p>part of the AMD driver package that I stopped installing, but it's looking like it may be a separate package
</p>
<p>these days.</p>
<p>- If you are using a laptop or OEM ( DELL, HP, etc.) PC they may have installed Hydra-vision as part of their</p>
<p>software package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You&nbsp; should be able to find Hydra-Vision in Programs and Features &gt; <em>AMD Catalyst Install Manager.</em></p>
<p>- Double click on AMDCIM and a window will open, Select the first option - <em>
Uninstall Manager.</em></p>
<p>- Click Next . In the next Windows select - <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Custom</span>
</em>and click Next.</p>
<p>- Hydra Vision should on the list in the next Window. </p>
<p>Tick the box next to <em>Hydra-Vision</em> and click on Next to proceed with uninstalling Hydra-Vision.</p>

            In that case, I suggest you test with another user profile and see if the same problem occurs. (Inability to save settings is sometimes an indication of a corrupted profile). If that works correctly see -<br />
Fix a corrupted user profile<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile<br />
<br />
You might also try selective startup (run msconfig) to see if a program is changing your settings.<br />

<h2>            Mouse Scroll issues after December update. Continuous scrolling. Changed mouse settings to 4 lines at a time. Didn&#39;t work. Help.</h2>
                    Something in Windows Update in Dec. changed scrolling on my Windows 10/Toshiba laptop. I've tried changing mouse settings, the scrolling options, as mentioned in prior forums, but nothing has worked.&nbsp; My only fix last month was to uninstall the Dec update.&nbsp;
 There must be another work around.&nbsp; Or maybe it's not the mouse, it's something else?&nbsp; Not a techie, but can follow directions and get around machine ok.&nbsp; thanks.

            Hi GrannyNannyNW,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />General troubleshooting steps
<br />A. Reboot your computer. Generally, rebooting solves many problems.
<br />B. Try a different USB port
<br />C. In case of wireless mouse, pair it again with the computer
<br />D. In case of wireless mouse, check if batteries are not weak.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1 - Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt;  Click Hardware and Devices &gt; Click Run the troubleshooter and follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2 - Take actions related to mouse (Check after each step A, B and C)
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Expand Mice and Other Pointing Devices  &gt; Right click on the mouse listed there &gt;
<br />
<br />A.  Roll back - Click Properties &gt; Roll Back  - Under Drive tab, if Rollback Driver is enabled click it &gt; Reboot
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall - Uninstall &gt; Reboot and the driver will be automatically installed
<br />
<br />C. Update - Update Driver &gt; Click Update Driver Software &gt; Click Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Click Let my pick from a list of device drivers on my computer &gt; Choose the driver &gt; Click Next to update &gt; Reboot
<br />If this does not work, select Search automatically for the updated driver in place of Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Reboot
<br />

<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

    <title>Live Tiles On The Desktop&#8212;Concept - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zkedem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Tiles On The Desktop&#8212;Concept</h2>
                    <p>Many Windows 10 users (including myself) have asked for the ability to pin Live Tiles to the desktop, and not just to the Start Menu. So I got to work on what such a system would look like. The mockups below were created using Windows 7 and Omnimo UI (<a href="http://omnimo.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://omnimo.info/</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please excuse the Basic theme. This is due to the technical restrictions of working with virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Figure 1</p>

<p class="contentStandard">Here we see the traditional desktop icons harmonizing with the Live Tiles on the desktop. Icons and Live Tiles can be split into blocks or interspersed with each other, even hidden or disabled. The solid color background used here
 was chosen for its resemblance to that of Windows 10 Setup.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

<p class="contentStandard">With the Live Tiles on the desktop, it may no longer be necessary to have them in the Start menu.</p>

<p class="contentStandard">Both Win32 and UWP app windows harmonize perfectly with the new design. Again, please excuse the Windows 7 Basic Theme as I did all this in VirtualBox.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like you're having challenges with your network configuration. We would like to know what activity or application are you using which requires that specific port. Also, we want to verify if your system is connected to a domain or corporate environment.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ramon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>I wanted to connect to my dongle(Modem) and was getting the following error:"The modem or connecting device is already in use or not configured properly.". When I raised this issue with the MS community, I was asked to check if my TCP 1723 was being used
 by any other application, if yes I was suppose to kill that application and then the issue would be resolved. But instead after checking, I found that my TCP 1723 was not listening at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not connected to any domain or corporate environment and am using my laptop only for personal use. This requires me to connect to internet and sometimes to VPN, both of which I'm unable to do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards</p>
<p>Mukul</p>

<p>To further isolate the problem, we would like to ask these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Was it working before?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried to use a different user account, and check if it makes a difference?</li><li>Have you tried connecting the device to a different computer, and see if the issue persists?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Yes, the device was working initially.</p>
<p>I've not made any significant changes to the computer which I remember.</p>
<p>Have tried using a different account.</p>
<p>Have tried connecting the dongle to a different laptop and it works perfectly fine(Same version of windows)</p>

<p>Hey mate, to be clear, is the issue you're experiencing not having a text reply box? If so, please try using a different browser. Or, if you're in IE, make sure 'Compatibility View' is enabled.

                    Hello all, somehow I've accidentally assigned for my computer to go into sleep mode as soon as I push the "k" on the keyboard. How can I remove this setting? I have Windows 10 64-bit.

<p>Hi Hoolia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to provide you with a desirable outcome in disabling the "sleep mode" key that you've accidentally assigned, may we know how you have exactly designated the shortcut key? Did you happen to create a shortcut or hotkey to enable this setting?
 If so, please provide the exact procedures that happened.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. For proper isolation, we advise replicating the issue by creating or testing with another user profile and check if the same behavior occurs. If the same thing happens, we recommend that you put your system in the
<strong>clean boot</strong> state and monitor the results. To do so, kindly access this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to perform a clean boot
 in Windows</strong></a> and follow the procedures. This process gets rid of software conflicts and identifies any third party applications that can bring up the issue you are experiencing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After troubleshooting, refer to this section: "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" from the article to boot the computer in normal startup once the issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response so we can move forward to resolving your concern.</p>

    <title>Duplicate Screen to a Projector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> futile32  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate Screen to a Projector</h2>
                    <p>I've tried hooking up a 1280x720 projector and a 1920x1080 projector to the Surface 3 today (via a DP to HDMI adapter). The output appears fine if I do Extend, however if I set it to "Duplicate" which is how we use our laptops to present to customers, nothing
 happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing its because the Surface is set at such a high resolution and the Projector won't match it, but I'm unsure why the surface won't reduce its own resolution to help accommodate the use of the projector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions, its kind of a deal breaker for us if this behavior can't be resolved.</p>

<h2>            Tex-to-Speech does not read first 2-3 words of each line.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop PC running Windows 10 smoothly. However, I have discovered to my dismay that while using Text-to-Speech using DSpeech software, it would not read the first 2 to 3 words of each line.&nbsp;Even while previewing voice in the Speech Properties Window,
 it will start speaking only from "Microsoft Zira Desktop - English (United States) as the computer's default voice" leaving out the first two words: "You have selected".
</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>

</p><p>My CPU is hooked to a Sony Bravia LED TV through an HDMI interface and the sound output is through its in-built speakers. Everything seems OK with the speech or sound settings/output as I can hear all types of sounds/music&nbsp;&nbsp;normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your esteemed assistance to resolve this nagging issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am trying to install iTunes 9.2.1 (for Vista 64 bit) on my Vista x64 bit laptop. Every time I try and download it, though, it gives me this error: "An error occurred during the installation of assembly 'Microsoft.VC80.CRT,version="8.0.50727.4053",type=*win32",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",processorArchitecture="x86".
 Please refer to Help and Support for more information. HRESULT: 0x80070002"<br />
<br />
Here is a picture:<br />

<br />
I have tried solving this using various methods like using 7-zip, downloading Microsoft Visual c++ 2005, etc., but they don't seem to work..I don't have iTunes on my PC yet, just the set-up because the installation keeps failing. Can someone please help me?
 I am desperate..</p>

<p>Hello myducks,</p>
<p>To answer your question about SFC command, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><span>First, let's run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
</span><span>Open an elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.&nbsp;<br />
At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
<br />
<strong>SFC /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Then reboot your system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to&nbsp;Knowledge base (KB) article if you find corrupt files:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>KB article 929833</span></a> -</span><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system
 files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you were able to run SFC successfully, next run chkdsk:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>In this forum, we cannot connect to your computer remotely to help troubleshoot your issue. However, if you feel you need further support you might want to open a paid support case with Microsoft. I will include the support options below so you can choose
 for yourself.<br />

    <title>how to fix clipboard when it does not copy and paste - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbenblue  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to fix clipboard when it does not copy and paste</h2>
                    <p>I cannot copy and paste on my computer. When&nbsp;I open the clipboard viewer and copy some text it shows up in the clipboard viewer but&nbsp;disappears right away.
</p>
<p>I have Windows XP SP3. A friend of mine found a article somewhere that said when the remote assistance is checked it affects the copy and paste function. I have unchecked this. Also I downloaded a program called Logmein tried to uninstall it&nbsp;but cannot.
 I uninstalled it through Add/Remove Programs and tried through Microsofts Fix it Install/Uninstall wizard but it does not show up in the list of programs. Help me please solve both problems. they may be related.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            I had a big problem with Office 365 clipboard that is finally resolved, but Office Support never located the problem after many chat/desktop-sharing sessions. The clipboard would copy 'text only' and no images, but now works perfectly. The issue was the
 installation of a new firewall. The solution was to set firewall permissions for Office 365 and the Office clipboard began working fine.

            The first step in resolving this issue for me was to disable all firewalls to then test the clipboard functions. If this step works, then open your firewall manager and add Office to the permissions list and save the setting.&nbsp;

<h3> janet320  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer freezes&#47;hangs when i move or copy a folder to any USB stick&#47;drive</h2>
                    This only happens when i try to paste/move a <b>folder </b>(with or without files) into my USB thumb drive.&nbsp; I tried using 3 different USB sticks with 1GB, 8GB and 16GB storage sizes and it's all the same so i'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the
 USB drives.&nbsp; I also tried putting the USB drives in the other USB ports of my PC and same thing happens.<br />
<br />
However if i just copy files (without folders) it would work ok.&nbsp; I can delete, create files/folders directly in the USB drive (basically everything even format) but just can't get to copy folders in it.&nbsp; Can someone help please?<br />
<br />
Btw, this doesn't happen on my other PC (which runs on Win 7) so not sure if it has something to do with the OS.<br />

<br />
<br />Sure! You will get calls from your Skype client as long as you are on mobile data or Wi-fi. If not, your calls will get to the voicemail (if you have it). To return a call you will need to have credit or a subscription for outbound calling for the region the person is calling from.

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />As long as you have Skype Credit or an Active Subscription to the specific country that you are calling, (and of course, an active Internet connection), you will be able to make the call.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

    <title>Tv Connection Via S-Video - Scart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tv Connection Via S-Video - Scart</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm currently running windows XP and trying to connect a television to my PC for videos/films etc. I recently downgraded from Windows 7 to improve performance and that seems to be the problem. I first plugged in the television via the S-Video port on
 my graphics card, the bios display shows on the television, right up to the beginning of the login screen and then it switches back to my lcd monitor. I visit properties/display/settings and it doesn't recognize my television? I'm wondering if you guys can
 help, this is a real ball bust!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Aye, i've got the latest drivers. I've connected my TV via S-Video and the boot screen shows on the TV, but after that it switches to my ATI Radeon plug and play monitor and i see no other display on my TV. After visiting properties it doesnt even recognize
 my television, i find this a bit wierd as it is obviously recognizing it because it boots on the TV.

    <title>Possible Agent on Xbox hint from SentUAmessage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Possible Agent on Xbox hint from SentUAmessage&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When watching SentUAmessage on the dashboard earlier there was someone asking a question about Max Payne 3. After they answered the question, Mr Pointy Head (I think?) went on to talk briefly about Agent&nbsp; then stopped and moved onto another question.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously as of now Agent is a PS3 exclusive that was announced back in 2007, then revealed at E3 2009 (well a logo was anyway) since then though nothing has been seen or heared from the game. Could this little joke/hint mean that Agent could be coming to
 Xbox? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know some don't watch it, but if you want to see the part I'm talking about skip to about 8 minutes</p>

<p>I don't think it was officialy. People began to think that it might be after Jack Tretton, when interviewed at E3 about whether Agent was still exclusive or not he couldn't give an instant yes or no, just that it's up to Rockstar to announce something and
 that he wasn't sure from what I remember.</p>

<p>It possibly could happen and I think it will. L.A. Noire was originally a PS3 exclusive but they decided to bring it to Xbox.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Unexpected Shutdown&#34; random glitch or problem&#63;</h2>
                    My windows RT 64 GB tablet just randomly shut down. Upon reviewing the event log it catagorized the event as an "unexpected shutdown". The device would also not turn on for about 1-2 min. Is this a random fluke or is it a problem?

            Greetings,<br />
<br />
JasonMorton and Wpb211, I would suggest trying a Refresh on your Surface just to re-write the windows files and see if that stops whatever is causing the issue, and delete the Windows.old folder that will show up on the C drive afterwards.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The benefit to the Refresh is that it won't mess with your user files, and gives us a clean set of Windows files to see if it was something buried within the Windows Folder that caused the problem.
