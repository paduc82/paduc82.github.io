<h2>            Remote desktop in Vista Home Basic </h2>
                    To whom it may concern,<br />
<br />
I often connect to my home computer from my laptop from work. My laptop runs XP professional and I have resently installed Vista Home Basic on my home pc. Being new to Vista i have been having difficulties enabling remote desktop connection. In XP i would right
 click on My Computer, select properties, and navigate to the remote tab. Here I would find 2 options, 1 to enable remote assistance and one to enable remote desktop. I have been able to navigate to the remote settings in Vista but can only find the option
 to enable Remote Assistance. I thought the Remote Desktop option might not be available do to a GPO that was set but when I access the mmc I cannot add the GPO snap in (it is not available). Could some one please assist me by educating me how I can enable
 remote desktop in Vista Home Basic?

<p><span>Hello, mherber2</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>Neither Windows Vista Home Premium nor Home Basic include that functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to use either the Business or Ultimate version to be able to connect to the machine remotely through Remote Desktop. The same applies for accessing the Group Policy
 editor.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>

In this case you would also be aware that you must have some boot medium to be used in case you need to repair your installation. It's called a Windows Repair CD and you burn it via the Control Panel / Backup and Restore. Borrow one from a friend or buy one
 from http://systemdiscs.com/, then boot your machine with it. It will put you into the Windows Repair Environment from where you can repair the boot environment.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

<h3> tjas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety &#34;My Parent Is Here&#34; no longer working</h2>
                    I'm running windows 8.1, and have local accounts set up for all users, including two child accounts.
<div>Previously, the Family Safety features have been working great. &nbsp;If one of my children click on a website that is not allowed, or try to run an app on the machine that I haven't allowed, it would block them, but you would have the option to click on "My
 parent is here".&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you clicked on that, it would bring up a box allowing me to enter in the password of my administrator account, and once I put in the password, the website would be allowed, or the app would be allowed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now for some reason that I haven't been able to fix, whenever you click on "My parent is here" basically nothing happens. &nbsp;The box goes away, it never brings up the screen where I can put in my password - and most importantly - as soon as this happens,
 it seems that all filters are now OFF.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In other words, as soon as you click on "my parent is here" and nothing happens - any website or program you want can be accessed with no filtering at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've run multiple virus/malware programs, did end up cleaning off a found Conduit Search (cltmngui.exe), following steps found here: http://malwaretips.com/blogs/conduit-search-removal/&nbsp;hoping that would help in case it had anything to do with the problem,
 but it hasn't appeared to change the behavior at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have run the Family Safety Troubleshooter, and it does come up with "Family Safety Files are Corrupt" &nbsp;Every time I "fix" this and it erases all the files in the c:\programdata\microsoft\windows\parentalcontrols folder, or if I manually delete the
 files themselves, even after restart if I run the troubleshooter again it will continue to say "Family Safety Files are Corrupt"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know if that has anything to do with my problem, and I don't know what else to try at this point. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated, thank you!<br />
<br />

            Thank you very much for the quick reply and the suggestions. &nbsp;I gave them a try, but unfortunately, they had no effect.
<div><br />
<div>When I ran the SFC, the report came back with the following: "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, then I followed your advice to turn off the family safety, restart the computer, and then turn it back on. &nbsp;The behavior is still the same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, prior to trying these, and prior to your response, I tried creating a new test user child account, and the new account also had the same issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd appreciate any additional suggestions or help, thank you!<br />
<br />

</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the 'Windows 10 Fall Creators' update im having a problem with a lot of my software.<br />
<br />
When i have a program that is using a 'SysListView32' component where you can select multiple files.<br />
You will notice if you scroll down to the middle of the list by mousewheel or the scrollbars itself, and then try to select multple items,&nbsp;<br />
that the mouse starts to go by itself to the bottom or top of your screen.<br />
If you then try to keep holding down left button and moving in a direction, you see it's resisting, it wants to go to the bottom or top of screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Results:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Windows 10 Fall Creators version:&nbsp;</strong><br />
1709 &nbsp;(16299.19)<br />
<br />
<strong>Test environment:&nbsp;</strong><br />
1 PC: Clean installation Windows 10 Pro, nothing installed except WinRar. To be totally sure.<br />
4 PC: They had nothing in common with eachother, only that they all using a 1920x1080 screen and Intel i7 (860 up to 6700k) generation cpu<br />
<br />
<strong>Results:</strong><br />
All the 5 PC's ive tested now when i scroll down to middle of list (SysListView32) at 'Icon' mode (but also 'Details' mode), and i try to select multiple items/files by mouse, the mouse starts to go to bottom or top of screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Happens with:</strong><br />
'Microsoft Windows Explorer', 'WinRar', 'WinZip', '7z', 'Ws FTP Pro'. they all have this bug now.<br />
More applications i did not test with, it's obvious its the SysListView32 object.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows 10 Fall Creators version (Insiders edition):</strong><br />
1709 &nbsp;(17025.1000) and (<span>17035)</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Test environment:&nbsp;</strong><br />
1 PC: Clean installation Windows 10 Pro Insiders, updated with latest updates, nothing installed except WinRar to test.<br />
<br />
<strong>Results:</strong><br />
For 'Microsoft Windows Explorer' the bug has been solved.<br />
BUT. the bug remains for:&nbsp;<br />
'WinRar', 'WinZip', '7z', 'Ws FTP Pro', and any non-Microsoft software for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Systems used:</strong><br />
I7 860 up to 6700k, 6 up to 16 GB, Nvidia 660TI up to 780TI, 1920x1080 monitors, SSD drives, Logitech mices (gaming and non-gaming).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've even tested it to create a 'SysListView32' object with the 'CreateWindowEx' and stripped it to the bone.<br />
Not even subclassed it or anything, and added 100 items to the list so that the listview gets scrollbars, then if you scroll to middle and try to select multiple items you see this bug happens.<br />
Somewhere Windows 10 Fall Creators update is calling a 'SetCursorPos' API with the wrong coordinates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can someone&nbsp;<strong>please confirm</strong>&nbsp;this is a bug after the Fall Creators update?<br />
Because this never happened before from Windows 10 all the way down to Windows XP.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>You can test it yourself by having the Fall Creators update, then install rarlab.com (WinRar).</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then add 100 small files to a archive, then open the created archive with WinRar. Scroll down to middle of list, and then try to select multiple items. You will notice the mouse starts to go all over the screen

<p>I will be waiting for information. Because this bug is very nasty, i can't use my software this way anymore if mouse starts to go all over the screen while trying to select files in a listview. - I have more forums where people reporting the exact same problem
 if you like:</p>

<p>
</p><p>And here is a video someone created about it (its pitty he only showing it with a horizontal scrollbar, but it shows exactly my problem with jumping mouse):</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxuxdo4l1K0&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS:</p>
<p>Some Forum members are saying that this problem is fixed prolly to confort you - But it is not! - I've also tested it with clean installation of Windows 10 Pro Insiders (<span>17035)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>My PC system to reproduce this bug.</strong>&nbsp;(tested with resolution: 1920x1080, clean installation Windows 10 Pro (and Insiders) as described here above in my other posts, only used Windows drivers for my hardware, but also WITH hardware drivers
 it has this bug):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Asus Z170 Pro motherboard (bios version 3501 - 06/23/2017)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Intel i7 6700K (not overclocked or anything, default bios settings mostly)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;16 GB ram(corsair, product: CMK16GX4M2B3200C16, within Asus bios set to XMP profile)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Gigabyte GTX 780 TI (no driver installed, i used the Windows driver)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Logitech G502 mouse (no logitech driver installed)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Samsung 1920x1080 (full hd, 27inch) 120 hz monitor</p>
<p>(but it also happens with my Asus 1920x1080, 27inch, 144 hz monitor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: I've gotten a HP 8300 (i7 3770) to test, its a new installation of Windows 10 Pro and i never touched it before, all i did was install WinRar (64 bit version) to test.
</p>
<p>But it does have the same bug with WinRar and 7z and WS_FTP Pro and other software using the SysListView32.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Also, i could fix this issue in my own software by subclassing the SysListView32 (not the owner form) and then wait for the 'WM_CAPTURECHANGED" (comes right after the WM_LBUTTONDOWN or WM_RBUTTONDOWN) and then pass focus (SetFocus api) to parent form hwnd
 and then SysListView32 hwnd again (2 lines of source), and return 0 in WindowProc function for the message. - then mouse does not jump to screen corners anymore. Also i have to dig deeper into the side effects of it (if any).</p>
<p>But still, it should'nt do this (that mouse goes to wrong coordinates if you dont process the WM_CAPTURECHANGED message).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in my case i can fix it for my own software so i'm all happy and its backwards compatible.</p>
<p>From Windows XP all the way up to Windows 10 this always worked perfect. It started to go wrong after the Fall Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i think its best we wait for Microsoft to fix this bug 100% before 7z or WinRar does updates to fix a known bug that is in much more software that using the syslistview32 object (spares us reporting a bug report to Windows with specific versions of 7z
 or WinRar so they can test it easily to reproduce).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only Microsoft would confirm this bug, or say they can reproduce it and that they working on it.</p>
<p>I can wait. but not to long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amen</p>

Scroll down in WMP and then try to select multiple songs, albums or whatever (depending on what you're showing in WMP). The cursor will jump to the left upper corner in my case. Sometimes you need to try selecting it more than once.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue here. This is very annoying. Normal working with Windows in this state becomes an absolute nuisance. Essential programs such as the SpeedCommander are affected. (Explorer with two windows - highly recommended)<br />
<br />
The developers know that it is an update problem of Windows.<br />
<br />
My colleagues two places further on the Mac laugh at me already. Great feeling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>..</p>
<p>installed the update 2 days ago</p>

<p>After a short test within our company - all computers with the last update are affected. Everyone has the same problem now.</p>

                    When I start up the computer from shut down Windows 8 loads at a resolution of 600x800.&nbsp; When I try to adjust it the only other option is 640x480.&nbsp; After several reboots (4x to 8x) Windows will finally load correctly with my normal resolution of 1920x1200.

<h3> callumduncan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete a corrupt in-progress download from the windows store&#63;</h2>
                    My forza 7 download has been stuck around 68GB and it keeps stopping because the files are corrupt and I need a clean install. When I click the X it just stops and and when I hit install it just resumes from the 68GB and fails again because it doesnt delete
 the already existing download. I've already tried wsreset and the windows store fixer thing. I just need to know where the download is located so I can delete it.

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try this 2 paths and see if you see something there:
<br />
<br />The Apps are installed in the
<br />
<br />C:\Program Files\WindowsApps folder
<br />
<br />The user configuration files for each app are installed in the
<br />
<br />C:\Users\user name\AppData\Local\Packages folder
<br />
<br />Erase everything there, restart the computer and see if you're still stuck at 68 gb.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            It depends on what you want to get accomplished first. Adobe flash player is needed for various online games and videos and will not speed up the download for java. Java has uses that generally revolve around a more specific idea than adobe flash player,
 and was probably required by your computer for usage in direct relation to your question. It will also not speed up the download for adobe flash player. Neither of them are unbeneficial based on perspective, but I personally think that Adobe has more uses
 in more common situations than java.

            Hi Tom1395,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It sounds like the cable you're using is causing the issue or you're connecting to the wrong port.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp; Make sure you're connecting the cable to the right port, if yes, then change the cable and check the result<br />
a. VGA Port or connection is used for External monitors (analog).<br />
b. DVI Port or connection is used for External monitors (analog). <br />
c. HDMI sends HDTV/Blu‑ray video to high-definition monitors, transmits both the video and audio signals.<br />

<p>Not sure, but you can turn off notifications so you willn't get an notifications when your exfriends sign in.
</p>
<p>By going to setting then Preferences press A on "Notifications" and then change the setting to the ones you want.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion but that would disable all online notifications for all friends. Just wanted to know why I'm still getting notifications for blocked and removed users and how to prevent it.

<p>I'm having the exact same problem. All the forum and reddit posts I've seen about this usually contain a couple suggestions -- that don't work, and then the thread goes quiet and the problem unresolved. For reference, the forum and reddit links are listed
 below just in case someone can get something useful out of it and maybe help get this problem fixed.</p>
<p>Here's what I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I confirmed that the friends I've removed were not listed under my Friends, Favorites, or Followers.
</li><li>Re-adding one of the friends and then deleting. </li><li>Blocking one of the friends. </li><li>Removing my Xbox Live account from my console, then re-adding it, and then restarting the console.
</li></ul>
<p>The first Xbox support tech I spoke to suggested the last item on the list. After that didn't work, I contacted support again and this is what was suggested:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete profile </li><li>Go offline mode </li><li>Perform hard reset </li><li>Disconnect all cables from the back of the console </li><li>Wait 2-3 mins </li><li>Turn on console </li><li>Re-connect to the network </li><li>Download profile </li></ol>
<p>This sounds pretty similar to what the first tech said just with a couple extra steps, so we'll see if it helps. I'm trying this tonight but I have no way of actually confirming if it worked. If I don't get the notifications for a few days I'll assume it
 worked and report back here.<span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to know if you have tried exactly the way it was mentioned in the previous post.</p>
<p>If still the issue persists, then I would suggest you to contact the printer manufacturer (Epson), as they are the ones that provide the drivers.</p>

<h2>            How do I uninstall windows 10, and go back to windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I have installed the windows 10, but it's too complicated for me. I like the way it use to be, at least, that's what I'm use to.
<br />
<br />
Anyways, if anyone can help me, would be much appreciated!<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm sorry for the windows topic, I couldn't find anything that really fits my question.

<h2>            Notifications on Skype App</h2>
                    <p>I have used the old version of Skype for years and never had any issues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>An update ran on my computer and now i have the new "APP".&nbsp; </p>
<p>I use a USB sound bar for notifications and cannot get it to work in Skype.&nbsp; In the settings I selected the Sound Bar and then ran "Test audio".&nbsp; It worked fine.&nbsp; I exited the settings and then did a test call to my Skype phone number.&nbsp; The notification
 popped up in the Skype list, but no sound from the Sound Bar.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I attempted a legacy speaker that uses the builtin audio card, again the test works, but no notification sounds when I call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to find the old Skype Desktop version, but have not been successful.</p>

<h2>            How do I defeat the Windows password&#63;</h2>
                    I am the only user on this system and everytime I power up the computer I have to put in a stoopid password. This is especially annoying when it resets on its own then does snot run scheduled events until I this password.&nbsp; What can I do to have the system
 fully power up without intervention.
