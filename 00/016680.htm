<h2>            Outlook 2016 -  Something went wrong and your search couldn&#39;t be completed</h2>
                    <p>After the automatic installation of Windows upgrade to version 1709 for x64-based systems (KB4041994) on 10/26/2017, outlook started giving the error message of "Something went wrong and your search couldn't be completed" when I search emails.
</p>
<p>It slowly searches all the emails instead of using the search index built earlier.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that some users had the same problem after June'17 update and a patch was released.
</p>
<p>I also saw a post on October 24, 2017 by a technician (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6d4ee510-b2f4-40b1-a978-f7e691059390">Joanna 777</a>) saying that the issue resolved but there was no link to the
 solution.:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems Joanna is referring to the issue during June 2017 that caused the same error message. However, despite their similarity, the root cause might be different.</p>

<p>I am also having the same issue on several user's computers. We've tried re-indexing, repairing Outlook, and completely wiping out the profile and starting over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate what NYer posted, it appears that search still works but is not using the index-- instant search results are not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that&nbsp;<span>KB4041994 has caused an issue with Indexing Outlook messages. When I rebuilt the index, even making sure that Outlook was selected as an indexing target, the index contained DRASTICALLY fewer items than
 expected-- 18,000 instead of the over 120,000 expected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What was the purpose of&nbsp;</span><span>KB4041994? It is not posted anywhere.</span></p>

</p><p>Same problem as many others.&nbsp; I reported this issue (seems like) over a year ago.&nbsp; Worked with a gal from Microsoft.&nbsp; Got the search working, but still got the error message.&nbsp; She told me (back then) that Microsoft was testing a fix.&nbsp; I guest it was one
 hell of a long test because it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND, I completely reinstalled Office365 a week ago, after 1709 was applied to my machine - NO CHANGE.&nbsp; Is anybody actually working to resolve the 'root' cause'???</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 - Color Scheme changed &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent Windows 10 update, the color scheme on Outlook 2016 (Office 365) desktop changed. I took one a majority of white color in the background with pastel type colors, thinly lined Icons. Is this the new normal? Its incredible hard on my
 eyes. Its as if someone change the contrasting.</p>
<p>It reminds me of one of the horrible Windows 95 desktop color schemes like monochromatic but with color.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can go back to the former color scheme or customize this?</p>

<p>Hi Amacpa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the details you posted in your reply. Based on the screenshot you provided, you are using the version 1809 (Build 10827.20138) or higher version of Outlook client, right?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, based on my test, there is no option to change the header back to the blue. If you think it's better to use&nbsp;the previous appearance of Outlook, we recommend you to submit your feedback to our&nbsp;development team in this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows</a>.
 We highly appreciate your time and understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Moreover, if you think it is better to use the blue appearance, as a temporary workaround, you can revert to an earlier version of Outlook and wait for the next update. You just need to do following simply steps to rever to an earlier version of Outlook
 2016:</p>
<p>1. Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click cmd.exe, and then click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run following command:</p>
<p><em>cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Run following command (based on my test, the version 1808 (Build 10730.20102) is showing the blue appearance):</p>
<p><span><em>officec2rclient.exe /update user updatetoversion=</em><em>16.0.</em></span><em>10730.20102</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2770432/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2013-or-office-2016-clic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to revert to an earlier version of Office 2013 or Office 2016 Click-to-Run</a>.<br />

<br />
As I suggested the first time that "LS" posted this question 6 days ago (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/86220271-a324-45d3-839b-04d0bc5f47e2?threadId=58822ff8-5a6c-4c70-953b-4ee84709d21b">click here</a>).<br />
<br />
But I also pointed out that the following link seems to download a well-known virus, at least one time on my computer (I'm certainly not going to test it again :-&gt;):&nbsp;
[ERRATA]</span>.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Don't go there</span>.&nbsp; (NIS noted the threat interactively, but the virus was still downloaded :-&lt;.)<br />
<br />
@LS:&nbsp; It is "bad form" to multi-post the same question.&nbsp; If you did not like a response in the first discussion, it is incumbent on you to post a reply indicating what more you wanted.&nbsp; If you lost track of your first posting, simply click on your name in the
 upper right.&nbsp; That will take you to your profile page, which displays a list of discussions that you started.<br />

    <title>OneNote inserted a printout are huge. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murteira  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote inserted a printout are huge.</h2>
                    <p>I have used onenote 2013, onenote free app and now onenote 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use it for my college lectures as I like to to insert a printout of my lecture slides on to onenote and then write my notes next to the printout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what always frustrated me with the 2013 version was how when inserted a printout it came out huge which made writing my notes next to it difficult as I can't resize the pages in one go and when you have around 200 lecture slides in one lecture I obviously
 do not have the patience to minimize all of them individually. </p>
<p>I realised though that when onenote the app came out that as long as I converted it to a pdf file and inserted the printout into the text box i could minimize them that way but the problem with the onenote app is that its doesn't have all the tools and to
 convert files into a pdf is not only timeconsuming but also means that if I want to watch a link or audio file the lecturer may have put on the slide it is no longer in the pdf link on the top of the printout so i need to keep 2 versions of each lecture which
 is a waste of space and time.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now that the 2016 version has come out I am happy a lot of its improvements as I can insert a printout of any file but I still cannot change the size without editing each one individually and even if they are pdf's they no longer resize by inserting them
 into a text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for this lengthy message buts its just to show you that I've tried many ways to try and get around this problem, even looking at message boards (many people have my same problem so I find it difficult to understand why this wasn't sorted out in
 the update especially when it was in the free app) and if this problem isn't fixed I think I'm going to have to stop using OneNote because its becoming too troublesome to use.</p>

<p>Starting with a cell containing the number 450, compare it to a column of ranges e.g. 0-10, 30-70,300-500 etc . Find the range that includes 450 and allocate a score representative of that range e.g. 300-500 could have an associated score of 8. Starting
 with 450 I want to be able to enter 8 in another cell. Any ideas would be most gratefully accepted!</p>

    <title>Nokia N8 SMS Notification For Windows Live Messenger Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia N8 SMS Notification For Windows Live Messenger Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,<br />
<br />
I have searched the answer on the forums but could not find it therefore am making this my first post, thank you for setting up this forum.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I signed in to Windows Live Messenger and went in to 'hide but stay logged in and receive messages' mode, I would receive an SMS showing message received from WLM followed by some squares. I would hear the SMS aleart and read the message that
 WLM has sent an SMS. After this I would go back to my Windows Live Messenger and read the message sent and or chat to whoever.<br />
<br />
It was not a network message from my service provider but rather from the Nokia N8 itself letting my know someone sent me a WLM message and that I needed to go to WLM to read it.<br />
<br />
Now I am not receiving an SMS, instead, I am receiving a display notice showing an offline message was received and if I want to read it. This option is no good to me because the phone screen is dark with screensaver mode.<br />
<br />
The only alternative is to stay signed but use the slide button on the right to put the phone is screensaver mode. If that happens I get the usual 'alert' when someone signs in and sends messages but there is no SMS.<br />
<br />
Please can someone explain how I set it up so that I stay signed in and logged in to Windows Live Messenger but in hidden mode but also receive an SMS when I receive an SMS notification from WLM too.<br />
<br />
The version of WLM I am using is the default one: V3 Ref:3.3.48r-2270 (Miyowa 2009)<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>

            as far i know there is not any WLM currently supported for symbian 3 which is the n8<br />
<br />
perhaps you have installed a version for symbian s60 5th edition which will work with n8 but may have some bugs or errors like the one you mentioned<br />
<br />
i had as well a version from the 5th edition and was not working good so i unistall it and i use nimbuzz<br />
<br />
just wait if any other n8 user has got any WLM in their phone to advise you but for sure WLM is not supported by symbian 3 yet so errors may possible

<p><strong>babis3g:</strong> "just wait if any other n8 user has got any WLM in their phone to advise you but for sure WLM is not supported by symbian 3 yet so errors may possible"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply babis3g but as mentioned in my first post, the version of WLM I am using is standard and supplied in the phone on my network: "3" or "three.co.uk". The version of WLM I am using is the default one: V3 Ref:3.3.48r-2270 (Miyowa 2009).
 It works fine, no problem whatsoever except that when I stay logged in but 'hide' in order to save battery, sometimes I receive an SMS when I receive a WLM message and sometimes I do not. The SMS is from 'WLM' and followed by some empty squares with no legible
 text but it is enough for me to know I should go back to WLM and continue chatting. From what I can see the SMS is not network based but from the phone itself letting me know I should go to WLM.<br />
<br />
For clarity, on "3" network all users get free&nbsp;ebay, free WLM and free Skype. Many packages have 500mb or 1gb internet included but I do not have any inclusive internet allowance as I am on an older package, however, using ebay, skype and WLM does not use any
 inclusive minutes or add to bills - it is totally free,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I connected my N8 to the PC using ovistore I syncronised the messages and clearly saw japanese text in the WLM sms I received. All the sms does it to inform the phone owner that they have received a message on WLM, it is an alarm that is all. It was
 working before but not working now...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone offer some help please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK an update here... I have checked the 'My Nokia' notifications and the SMS acting as an alert for WLM was not from 'My Nokia' either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please offer any ideas as to how to activate/de-activate SMS alerts for WLM?</p>

            Unfortunately I have yet to find a working version for 3UK windows live messenger WLM so I am unable to use free messenger on my phone.<br />
<br />
I have noticed though, just as with skype that can't be hidden properly anymore. With inactivity even wlm hidden, after an amount of time, your just signed off so won't receive messages anyway.<br />
<br />
Its completely being phased out. I wonder how three can stop free for life skype on a skype phone. That would be an interesting article to read.<br />

 to appear. &nbsp;However, I can not find the "playback" tab on my ribbon. &nbsp;You can see from the pic below my tabs start with "home", "format movie"... and end with "developer." &nbsp;Where do I find the "playback" tab. &nbsp;Or is there some other way to do this? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Note that Microsoft no longer update 2011 so it could be a good time to upgrade. There are MANY new features in 2016 that have the potential to blow your mind!</p>

            Thanks Jim.&nbsp; So PP for mac does not have this basic capability to sync text onto a video&nbsp;(or at least not prior to 2016 per the other response to my question)?&nbsp; That seems hard to imagine.

<h2>            Changes to recurring events in SharePoint Calendar in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>We have a variety of recurring events on our staff calendar. &nbsp;Sometimes we need to edit a specific event and this works correctly on SharePoint. &nbsp;However when we connect that calendar to Outlook, the specific event changes to do show in the Outlook version
 of the calendar - just the original recurring pattern w/o the edits. &nbsp;We need to print the calendar so we have been using outlook for this purpose - and ease of use.</p>

<p>Hi Emily,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest you try <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
restarting Mac in safe mode to isolate issues</a>, then see if OneNote will open normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try following:</p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>Delete this folder: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.onenote.mac</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.</span><span style="font-weight: bold">(Warning: Outlook data will be removed when you move the folder listed in this step to Trash. You should back up this folder
 before you delete it.</span><span style="font-weight: bold">)</span></p>
<p>Delete<span>
</span>this folder: ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.Open Keychain Access
</span><span>and search for “MicrosoftOffice”.</span></p>
<p>If OneNote recognized that you signed in, you will have an entry with a long name. Delete it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Restart your Mac and open OneNote to check the outcome.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Send Messages</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure what is more frustrating, the fact that my messages wont send or the fact that it is impossible to talk to an actual person about what I'm experiencing so I'm forced to 'ask a question'. I can't find a person to call, a person to email, or even
 an actual real person on a chat. Here is my problem I'm experiencing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My messages are stuck on "Sending..." with a little snake looking thing forever trying to reach a final destination. I have some messages that have been stuck on "Sending" for over a week. I have logged in with my phone, my macbook, my pc, uninstalled, reinstalled,
 restarted, and said prayers. My messages will not send regardless of what network I'm on or what device I'm on. I even created another microsoft account with just my phone number and messages since with that just fine. What is suddenly wrong with my main account
 that will not allow me to send messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beyond frustrated that this is randomly happening, and that I can't seem to find any help with this issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Winhlp32.EXE in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joquantaman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Winhlp32.EXE in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 10 (v. 1511) 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone will let me access legacy HELP (.hlp) files in Windows 10.&nbsp; I realize Winhlp32.exe is persistent in memory and may take up vital space.&nbsp; But certainly there must be a way to load Winhlp32.exe only in a virtual machine and then retire it as
 the virtual machine is unloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last century I was a member of MSDN, and I developed several apps using Visual Basic (v.&nbsp;4 thru 6).&nbsp; I also developed robust help files that were crucial to maximizing those apps.&nbsp; One of the Help Files is more than 2 megabytes in size.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;RTF
 files that duplicate some of the data within but not all.&nbsp; I need to access this data.&nbsp; My hope is to convert it to PDF format.&nbsp; But first, I need access the data within.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the apps themselves are still 95% functional in Windows 10, though they were developed&nbsp;for a Windows 95 platform.&nbsp; I place a high value in backwards-combatable software, so should Microsoft.</p>

            This is an on and off company, I done business with them to get my 120g fixed twice. first time they were fast next time it took about a month to get it back and it died on me after a few weeks so I sent it back but they didn't charge me as they messed
 up as you could hear something was loose so they fixed it for free, it's the only place to get them fix as I know of so if it dies again I'll go back, they have a new Zune battery that they say is the best but it's pricey.

<h2>            Access 2010 - Ask for same query parameter several times</h2>
                    <p>I have placed a parameter into the queries parameter table of a query. Why when I launch the query do I get asked for the same parameter 2 or 3 times and again on closing the query? I noticed this behaviour in Access 2007. Is the MS quirk or am I not understanding
 the use of parameters.</p>
<p>Below is the SQL text of my query although I use the design view to build all my queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PARAMETERS [For which Qtr] Text ( 255 );<br />

            <p>That's odd: you're defining a parameter, but not using it. That does nothing at all to the query. Normally you would have a criterion in a WHERE clause, such as</p>
<p>WHERE [Qtr] = [For which Qtr]</p>
<p>in the query. </p>
<p>To avoid multiple prompts - in fact to avoid prompts completely! - you can create a little unbound form frmCrit with a textbox, txtQtr say; and use a criterion of</p>
<p>=[FOrms]![frmCrit]![txtQtr]</p>
<p>Open the Form first, enter the quarter, and then open the Form or Report based on your query (you wouldn't ordinarily open a query datasheet to user view, though that's certainly possible). It's convenient to put a command button on frmCrit to open the desired
 report (or whatever).</p>

            First, as the others have mentioned, adding a parameter to the parameters list&nbsp; doesn't make use of the parameter. You have to assigned the parameter in a WHERE clause.
<br />
<br />
But that doesn't really answer your question. Every time a query is referenced, any parameters will be prompted for. So if a query is a sub-query that is called by other queries, each time its called the parameter will be prompted for.<br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons I almost never use parameter prompt queries. Instead I prefer to enter my parameters using a form and then. referencing them as the criteria. For example you could have a form with an Option group to select which Quarter. In your
 query you would set the criteria for the Quarter column to:<br />
=Forms!formname!optQuarter<br />
<br />
where formname is the name of your form and optQuarter the name of the Option group. Then each time the query is called it will look to the form and not prompt you.<br />

            <p>Good Morning Scott,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to try your suggestion but do not know how to set up a form with an option group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parameters which I wish to set are for; What Fiscal Qtr? and What Fiscal Year? (yy).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fiscal quarter field and Fiscal year field are calculated query fields based on a table field [WStats].[WDate].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The summary query that I am creating is for a single quarter in a fiscal year. The underlying queries select a distinct group of records from the table based on a Max query on the [WDate] field. This selection of distinct records is then joined with the
 matching data based on a unique identifier with the table [WStats]. The final summary query is a totals query based on the above mentioned resutlts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently inserting my parameters into the intial Max query. This query has 4 fields, tow of which are the parameter fields for FQtr &amp; FYr.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid the multiple asking for the query paramters, I would like to set up your form solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you send me an example of a parameter form?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you....</p>

The key to inputting parameters through a form is the referencing syntax:<br />
<br />
=forms!formname!controlname<br />
<br />
You use the Option Group wizard to set up a group on a form. To be more specific I need to know how you store FQtr and FYr.

            Here is the SQL where I first use the formulae for the two parameters. Here it is used to select a distinct group of records from my many table where individual event records are stored.<br />
<br />
In other subsequent queries I use the same formulae to create calculated query fields for summaries. We only summarize in queries and forms, we do not produce paper reports. If we need a paper reference we simply print the form for the desired record.<br />
<br />
SQL<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS [For What Fiscal Quarter?] IEEEDouble, [For What Fiscal Year? (yy)] IEEEDouble;<br />
SELECT WStats.SNum, Max(WStats.WDate) AS MaxOfWDate, Format(DateAdd("m",-3,[WDate]),"q") AS FQtr, Format(DateAdd("m",-3,[WStats]![WDate]),"yy") AS FYr<br />
FROM WStats<br />
GROUP BY WStats.SNum, Format(DateAdd("m",-3,[WDate]),"q"), Format(DateAdd("m",-3,[WStats]![WDate]),"yy")<br />
HAVING (((Format(DateAdd("m",-3,[WDate]),"q"))=[For What Fiscal Quarter?]) AND ((Format(DateAdd("m",-3,[WStats]![WDate]),"yy"))=[For What Fiscal Year? (yy)]));<br />
<br />
<br />
I will try and setup a form using the wizard after lunch.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

    <title>Verification of E-Mail Sender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickcoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Verification of E-Mail Sender</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes I get emails from the same "Sender".</p>
<p>Sometimes they are in my Inbox, sometimes they are in my Junk box.</p>
<p>They usually have slightly different "from" email addresses.</p>
<p>When you click on the junk item it of course says that they think it's spam...………………………..</p>
<p>There is also a link for "Show Blocked Content."&nbsp; What can I check without allowing a virus etc. to enter my PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I know in advance if an email is infected; or is that not yet a reality?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that is how I got a bunch of crap earlier this week, when I "approved" the email, as it was from "LinkedIn".&nbsp; I do receive emails from them in my Inbox which I anticipate getting on occasion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would assume that perfectly valid emails end up in the junk box when coming into your email.&nbsp; So what's the solution?&nbsp; Return EVERYTHING in the junk box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Rick</p>

<p>It appears that the info I get depends on which version of Outlook I'm using.&nbsp; I have at least 2.&nbsp; One is through MS Edge.&nbsp; The other one is through 365 Home (which earlier this year I was "enticed" to buy the package if I wanted to keep Outlook and Word-(the
 only other thing I wanted.)</p>
<p>Who knows, I might have Outlook 2016 on here somewhere as well.&nbsp; I miss the good old Windows 7/Internet Explorer days!!!!</p>
<p>Included screenshot which is from 365 Home.&nbsp; I can see where a lot of various bits of info are available.&nbsp; I don't understand the photo's not being shown.&nbsp; Interestingly, Outlook also blocked the MS logo and some other bits from the response you sent to
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how good Comcast's email program is??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess for now I'll keep using 365's version until renewal comes up in Feb 2019.&nbsp; I'll see what's available then.&nbsp; Or by then, I could be in a padded room playing with an etch-a- sketch !!! and continuously sedated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input would be most appreciated.&nbsp; Rick&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5791a19a-0e7c-4e7c-8e5d-d9386c529afc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5791a19a-0e7c-4e7c-8e5d-d9386c529afc?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3843b38-cc96-4e5a-92ba-89ce46a3c2e3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3843b38-cc96-4e5a-92ba-89ce46a3c2e3?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>WHEN ISN'T MS going through an issue?????</p>
<p>I have had so many problems that started with the major update-@the beginning of the year????&nbsp; The latest update crashed my PC upon restart.&nbsp; That meant 2 trips to a MS Store.&nbsp; I had to go a second time because their first attempt crashed again when I got
 it home!</p>
<p>Then I got all caught up in the Edge 'Flashplayer, Windows driver scam, adware/trojan, whatever the hell it was called.&nbsp; Don't you think they would have done more testing before rolling that POS out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now besides the email issues, it appears they are also having problems with One Drive updating.&nbsp; Yup-that's on another burner!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Windows 7 and Internet Explorer back.&nbsp; My 1st PC had Vista-which was fine.&nbsp; Windows 10 has been nothing but a pain in the ass since they rolled it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting me vent.&nbsp; I'm sure you've heard it all before.&nbsp; Look forward to hearing from you on the dual email issue.&nbsp; Have a great weekend.&nbsp; -&nbsp; Rick</p>

<h3> c4995z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off live tile display of contact name on pinned pictue contacts.</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to a Nokia Icon from a HTC 8X.&nbsp; I have picture contacts pinned on the start screen for my wife and three children.&nbsp; On the HTC the live tile only updated if I received a call, text, or message from one of them.&nbsp; This was perfect.&nbsp; On
 the Icon their contact name flips over their picture.&nbsp; This is very annoying and totally useless.&nbsp; I recognize their pictures and know their names. This is a classic case where less would be more.&nbsp; Is there a way to turn this off?

<p>do you think this is a link that could be developed?</p>
<p>giving people the opportunity to least get your details?</p>
<p>or even a means by which you can locate code in your gmail settings that will then allow for an operable skype button?</p>

<h2>            Toggle spell checker</h2>
                    <p>At one time, I had a command on the quick access toolbar that would toggle the spell checker on/off. My computer had to be re-imaged, so I lost it. When turned on, it would place red lines under the misspelled words. WHen off, the red lines would go away.
 This prevented me from having to go into options and turn it off and on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can get it back on my toolbar</p>

            <blockquote>
<blockquote>The following macro will do the job<br />
<br />
Sub ToggleSpellingErrors()<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />
ActiveDocument.ShowSpellingErrors = Not ActiveDocument.ShowSpellingErrors<br />
Set oRng = Selection.Range<br />
oRng.Collapse wdCollapseEnd<br />
oRng.Text = Chr(32)<br />
oRng.Text = ""<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
I'm sure this would work but I was able to do it before without a macro. I just went to
<em>options / customize ribbon</em>&nbsp; and under <em>choose from commands </em>I added it to a custom tab I had created. Problem is I can't remember the name of the command.

<p><br />
I found it, <em>Hide Spelling Errors.</em> Click once, red wavy lines show, click again, they disappear.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I prefer this to automatic spell checking</p>

<h2>            Trying to get an alternative sms app such as handcent</h2>
                    I own an Htc HD2 and is always using the htc messages apps. but it looks rather plain and i envy those using android as they have other alternatives such as handcent. So can marketplace come up with an app like that and make it available to all.

            The Maketplace isn't a development shop per se, rather it is a place for developers to sell their applications. It is possible for third party developers to make such an application. At quick glance I see some other SMS clients that developers have published
 to the Marketplace, though I don't know if any of these have the features from the Handcent SMS application that you wanted.
