<h2>            Nokia C3-01 broken video file</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I recorded a fun video with my friends and as soon as I stopped recording, an error showed up but I didn't really care because I was talking to my friends. Later that day I wanted to see the video but then instead of having 1 3GP file, I had a
 3GP file that has 1 kB and a SWP file that has 69,8 MB (I guess that's the real video?). When I try to open the 3GP or SWP, it says "File format not supported".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's basically this:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/185320AF-C759-4D9C-9B84-B91BC174A9AA">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Pictures-and-Videos/6500-slide-video-Video008-swp-and-Video008-3gp/td-p/338390#</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But nobody answered that message.. Can anyone help me please? I'd be really really sad if I lost the video. (Excuse me for my English, I'm Czech)</p>

            Hi, DvD463. Thanks for sharing your concern with us. Does this happen to all of your recorded videos? Did you change any of your phone settings prior to this issue?

<p>I don't think I've changed any settings because I actually recorded 3 or 4 videos with my friends that day but only one of them is broken. I still can normally record videos.. that was the only time it happened to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for your response!</p>

            This needs more information for us to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue. Since this has only happened once, we suggest observing the phone for a couple of days. Let us know if the same issue recurs and provide us the details. As for the video, can
 you open it using a computer? You can connect the phone to a PC and use the following USB modes: mass storage &amp; ovi suite (when using the Nokia Suite). Keep us posted with the outcome.

<p>I actually tried opening both of the files in multiple media players in my PC but they just crash and an error window saying something like "Unsupported file type" pops up. I googled some sort of SWP to 3GP, AVI or MP4 but all I could see was just some fake
 malware stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was testing the Camera application almost everyday. I also tried to look for the cause of the corruption. I thought that maybe it was because I closed the Camera application before it could save the video but when I tried that again like 20 times, after
 pressing the "Red phone button" it just saved successfully and I could see the video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that was just some rare video corruption error? I'll keep on trying to find the cause but I really need to find a fix for the video. I'm no expert but if that SWP file has 69 MB, the video could still be in there? I really hope my English is somehow
 understandable.</p>

            Thanks for keeping us up-to-date with your concern. Have you tried downloading any 3rd party PC tool or application that could access .swp files?
<br />
<br />
BTW, your English is fine. No need to worry about that. :)

<p>You didn't say what the error message was, but I would guess that the video file has not saved properly. The videos taken by your phone would be in 3GP format. SWP files are normally "swap files", temorary files used by some operating systems to store data
 temparily, I didn't know that Nokia Series 40 phones did this with video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing the video was stored temporarily in the SWP file then when you ended the recording it created the 3GP file to finalise the data but was not able to complete it. Your phone is trying to read the 3GP file but there is no data in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Media players in your PC will not recognise the SWP file extension because it is not a recognised video file type. Try making a copy of the SWP file in your PC and rename the copy by changing the SWP extension to 3GP, then try to play it again to see if
 it works. Try <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.en_GB.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>VLC Media Player</strong></a>, generally speaking it is the best at playing damaged files. If it can't read your file, maybe nothing will.</p>

<p>I tried every media player I know but it just didn't play it. Although VLC didn't say any error, the video had 0 seconds.. When I pressed start, the video immediately ended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have another theory why it got corrupted.</p>
<p>I've noticed that when my phone has only 1 red battery bar, the camera app says "Battery low" and I can't start it.</p>
<p>So maybe when I started to record the video, I had only 1 black bar. (it was a pretty long video, maybe like 7 minutes?)</p>
<p>And when the camera app lowered the battery to the point where it can't record anymore, it tried to close the app and the video got corrupted, if that makes sense..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not really easy to try this situation again so I'll just have to guess that was it.</p>

    <title>Folder Sync and lost messages - Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david kobe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder Sync and lost messages - Outlook 2013</h2>
                    After much trauma, I had Microsoft Outlook 2013 working satisfactorily to archive messages for my IMAP based email account. Network solutions provides all my ISP services and has for several years. At present I have a series of "archival" folders that
 are placed in the inbox of a single domain name and that domain name is used exclusively for archival purposes. All other email to that account is pushed forward to an alternative domain and then I archive key email in the "archival" domain.<br />
<br />
As stated, everything was fine until the latest Office update was applied yesterday. Then quite mysteriously (following the update) one of my folders lost six months worth of messages. The sync still functions in that I can add new items to my "archival" Outlook
 folder and they are automatically and faithfully updated on the NS server. However, none of the missing messages - which are still present on the NS server - are updated/restored in the existing Outlook "archival" folder. I rely heavily on access to these
 archived messages and simply want them restored to their original folder. <br />
<br />
I will note that I have only focused thus far on a single folder - I'm afraid to see what other folders may have been affected. Importantly - I didn't do anything to cause this...no message archiving was underway and I didn't alter any of my settings. I will
 also make note that I had my email open at the time (and may have been accessing the suspect archive folder - I cannot remember for certain). I would have gladly closed the application save for the fact that as soon as the update option appeared, my computer
 froze in an unrecoverable state (this is not the first time this has happened - it seems to be a common occurance whenever an update is imminent).
<br />
<br />
I have already deleted the suspect account and set up a new account. That simply resulted in more messages in this particular folder being lost...
<br />
<br />
I did maintain the same folder name and I know one response will be to change the name of the folder (presumably due to registry remnants that are interfering?). However, I use two computers interchangeably and it is critical that the folder name(s) be consistent
 across both machines. Fixing the problem by deleting a folder name is not an option I want to take - please don't ask me to do that. Rather, would it be possible to offer a real solution that avoids these problems in the future? I imagine that the "seek and
 destroy" option is not a viable/preferred solution for many users like myself. I don't consider myself a "power user" and it seems to me that this should be a trivial task to request from the software (and its developer).<br />
<br />
My Outlook information lists my current version as follows:<br />
<br />
Microsoft Outlook 2013 (15.0.4551.1004) MSO (15.0.4551.1005) 32-bit<br />
<br />
I would be eternally grateful to have the problem fixed and sincerely hope that my request won't simply wither away on a dying tree. If this is a core problem that is unlikely to be fixed soon, then perhaps you can share with me how to roll back to an earlier
 version of the product that functions correctly?<br />

            Your description is very confusing. How did you set up an IMAP account to archive in outlook 2013?<br />
Is the data available online and not showing up in the IMAP set of folders in outlook?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Sorry for the confusion. Please let me try to be clearer. I have a domain name "A" where I maintain a series of folders with archived email messages (this is an IMAP account). All of my primary messages are received at domain name "B" (also an IMAP account)
 and transferred to the appropriate folders in "A" for archival purposes only.<br />
<br />
In Outlook I have accounts set up for each domain (A and B). The folders (and their messages) in the domain "A" account are always out of sync with the same folders that I maintain on my domain name (and email) server. There are folders/files missing and other
 folders present (in Outlook) that were once created and subsequently deleted.<br />
<br />
I set up this structure to "solve" problems I was encountering with folder synchronization in Windows 8.0. Everything was good until an Office 2013 Suite update some time ago. All I'm asking is for my Outlook account(s) to match the current account on my email
 (and domain name) server. The Windows Mail app seems to do this just fine and so does eM Client (version 5). For now I have stopped using Outlook 2013 (and all other versions too) as it's too frustrating. Perhaps if Microsoft can actually fix these issues
 with folder synchronization I will return. Until then I will continue to use eM Client - which is a much more satisfying experience.<br />
<br />
For what its worth, I have tried several times to remove the offending account(s) and reinstall with a different name. This has done nothing to restore the folders/files that are missing or yet to disappear.<br />

<br />
<br />Thank you for providing the links from that Email . . .
<br />
<br />This is definitely a well known Phishing SCAM that is not an official Email, you can safely ignore and delete that Email
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get you to provide your login details, so you did the correct thing in not clicking those links . . .

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>To better understand your requirement, I would like to confirm the information below:<br />
1. What items exist in your large list? Are there some keywords with related documents attached mentioned on the Wiki page? Could you please provide a full screenshot about your large list?<br />
To insert a screenshot, please click on <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and select the
<strong>Insert Image</strong> icon.<br />
2. What does ‚Äúresults relating to the Wiki page‚Äù refer to?</p>
<p>We can only filter the list view based on the column values. You are suggested to add specific values for these items, in which case, they can be filtered.</p>
<p>Please feel free to post back if anything is misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Yoga</p>

<p>A simple way would be to create views filtered by the value in the "aisle" column. Add a list view web part to each wiki page and select the appropriate view. Assuming one aisle value is "frozen":</p>
<p>Create a new view and filter it as column "aisle" contains (or is equal to) "frozen".</p>
<p>On the wiki page, add an app and select your list.</p>
<p>Open the web part properties and select the "frozen" view.</p>
<p>Only items where aisle = frozen will appear and you can title the web part "Other items in this aisle".</p>
<p>Repeat for other aisle values.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're creating a wiki page for "each item " anyway so creating the related views and inserting them wouldn't be that bad. Another option would be the url query filter web part. &nbsp;Then your page urls would be formatted like:</p>
<p>"/page.aspx?Aislename=bananas" which will filter the list view for you.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Graying out of a letterhead</h2>
                    I created a letterhead on my Mac and converted the file to pdf, doc, &amp;docx files. When on my Mac the colors appear in full color but on a PC the colors gray out, as they would in a header/footer. However, unlike a header/footer when printed the colors
 continue to the be that same washed out color as the letterhead is on the left side of the document not a header/footer. How do I prevent this from happening? The client I created this for does not have access to a Mac and they need this letterhead asap. This

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When creating a document from a specific device that has its own operating system, there‚Äôs a possibility that it will be viewed differently from a Windows computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern with the letterhead that you‚Äôve created which was also converted as
<strong>PDF</strong>, <strong>.doc</strong>, and <strong>.docx</strong> files and have opened it using a Windows computer, Word tried to look for the specific add-ins and features that were applied when it was created from a different version of Office. If
 the app won‚Äôt be able to locate these from the current application being used, it will be converted from the features available on the device. This could be the reason why changes to the header and footer were observed from the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the <strong>same version of Office</strong> and <strong>operating system</strong> will be used, it will provide you the same view either way as they are both compatible with its features and add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We‚Äôre just here if you need further help.</p>

<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

<p>Hello AlioMisellus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, please answer below questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the OS version on both devices? Make sure that both devices meets the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
specific system requirements </a>to run Skype.</p>
<p>2. Are you using the classic Skype version or the new Skype for Windows 10 application?*
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Skype for Windows 10 has dark theme enabled by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Where are you trying to send the contact request to your daughter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. I look forward to your reply.</p>

            <p>Hi Jansombum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried disabling your antivirus software temporarily? Or try connecting on a different network environment and check if you will be able to install Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another step is to disable proxy server information for your LAN. On your Internet Explorer, go to Settings &gt; Internet Options. Under the Connections tab, click on LAN settings then uncheck configuration for proxy server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-code-0-1011-30088-1015-30183-1011-or-0-1005-when-installing-Office-65aa955c-a35f-41d4-b098-8060f2d04264?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> bunny56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t make macro for Picture Position</h2>
                    I'm trying to make a macro so I don't have to click on a picture, then go to Picture Tools/More Layout Options/In Front of Text then to Picture position tab, then select Page (instead of default of Paragraph). When I start the macro and click on Picture
 Tools, the "More layout Options" is dimmed and I can't go any further. I use this a lot in my work and don't want to have to click on 8 things every time, but when making a macro, lots of icon you want to click on and use are dimmed. How do you get around
 this? I've made many macros, but this is a tough one.

            This was no help. I don't want to have to make all those moves you suggested! I want it in a Macro so I don't have to do all the steps you said to do. I used to be able to do that, but MS changed stuff, and now I can't seem to find a way to make a macro
 to save all those steps.

<h2>            Picture Compression in Word 365</h2>
                    I just downloaded Office 365 to my work PC specifically to be able to compress multiple pictures in fairly large documents. &nbsp;I'm running Win7 and the documents in question were created in Office '07. &nbsp;The docs open in compatibility mode but the "Compress
 Pictures" feature in <em><strong>Picture Tools - Format - Adjust</strong></em> seems to have no effect on the photos either individually or all at once (Apply only to this picture un-checked). &nbsp;Any fixes or workarounds greatly appreciated. &nbsp;A call to support
 was totally a waste of time!!&nbsp;

<p><span>Compressing the picture, reduces the dpi of the Picture and decreases the document size. It is not going to reduce the size of the picture.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may right click on the compressed document, and choose properties and check the size.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the above suggestion helps. If you need further assistance, get back to us and we will be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>I have actually been tracking the .docx file size to see if any compression has occurred.</p>
<p>After running the compression tool, the file size does not change which makes me think I am missing a step prior to using the tool.</p>

            <p>For anyone interested... after MUCH fiddling around I think I've discovered the culprit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using PainShop ProX8 to Dr. my photos prior to putting them in my documents. &nbsp;For some reason (attached editing data or???) when I move the photos directly from the PSP8 editor into my document (previously saved or not) the file is HUGE and Word's
 compression tool wont touch it. &nbsp;If I copy &amp; paste or insert the photo directly from its saved location, the file is a manageable size and can be compressed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with a better explanation, please chime in!!</p>
<p>

    <title>Office 365 Custom Ribbons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briscoesbuddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Custom Ribbons</h2>
                    <p>I'm running the current version of Office 365 (Excel 2016). When I imported Ribbon Customizations from Office 2010, things seemed to work fine. But now I've noticed that some of the commands &nbsp;have disappeared. For example, I just now noticed that my "More
 Borders" command was missing, so I added it back. The command appeared on the custom ribbon as it should, but when I restarted Excel, it was gone again. So I added it back and immediately went to the customization screen, and it was missing in the list of
 commands, even though I had added it just a few seconds earlier, but it still appeared in the actual ribbon. Has anyone else experienced this type of thing?</p>

</p><p>Hello there, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7d934a3e-4372-48f3-ade1-f513af1db6b8" title="wicky93">
wicky93</a>! Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
About your concern, if your phone stops working or responding like it used to, restart it to get back on track.<br />
<br />
To restart, press and hold the <strong>Power </strong>button until a <strong>Slide down to power off</strong> message appears on-screen, then swipe down. (It usually takes about three seconds for the message to appear.) To turn your phone back on, press the
<strong>Power </strong>button.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, press and hold the <strong>Volume down</strong> and <strong>
Power</strong> buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10 to 15 seconds), then release the buttons. Your phone will restart automatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please be reminded that:<br />
<br />
Your phone may vibrate as soon as you press the <strong>Volume down</strong> and <strong>
Power </strong>buttons because it's changing your ringtone to vibrate. Wait to release the buttons until you feel the second vibration 10 to 15 seconds later.<br />
<br />
If you don't let go of the buttons immediately after the vibration at 10 to 15 seconds, your phone may show a black startup screen instead of restarting normally. If that happens, try pressing the button combo again.<br />
<br />
Not all phones restart this way, so check with your phone's manufacturer to find out how to force a restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your phone has a replaceable battery (it's often under your phone's back panel), you can also restart your phone by removing and reinserting the battery, and then pressing the
<strong>Power </strong>button to turn on your phone. The date and time may be off after you restart this way, but you can fix that by swiping over to the All apps list from
<strong>Start</strong>, then selecting <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt;
<strong>Date &amp; time</strong>.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach us again for further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi. I hope you're talking about doing this on a form. When you click on the dropdown, all visible columns should show up. But once you make a selection, only the first visible column will be displayed in the box. To show the other columns, you'll need a
 separate textbox for each one or "concatenate" the values you want displayed into one column. To use additional boxes, they must be unbound and refer to the Column() property of the combobox. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=ComboboxName.Column(x)</p>
<p>
</p><p>x = column index starting with zero (0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps...</p>

            <p>As dbGuy said, lookups should be done using list controls on a form, NOT at the table level (see&nbsp;<a href="http://access.mvps.org/Access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Evils of Lookup fields</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The combobox wizard, by default, hides the key column from the Rowsource and displays the next column. So given the following Rowsource:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT CompanyCode, CompanyName FROM tblCompany ORDER BY CompanyName;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other relevant properties would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>BoundColumn: 1</p>
<p>ColumnCount: 2</p>
<p>ColumnWidths: 0";2"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Column widths property is the key here. Access will display the first non-zero width field. So the combo list will display just the company name not the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to display other attributes of a company on your form see my blog on Displaying Data from Related Tables for techniques to do so.</p>

    <title>MS word text jumbled up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prajwalrai  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS word text jumbled up</h2>
                    I have Microsoft Office 2010, i am translator and was reviewing a translation doc with track changes yesterday. Today, when i opened it, the texts are all jumbled up. I copy-pasted the test to a new MS word file, still the same problem. Then i copied to
 a notepad, then the text was fine. You can see in the image that the brackets are misplaced in the word file but they appear correct in the notepad.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c77883b-c40b-47ac-9633-33d8c656b0ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c77883b-c40b-47ac-9633-33d8c656b0ad" /></a>

            <p>Hi Prajwal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly ensure that the Office suite/program is updated and all of its components to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be guided that if the document displays &amp; prints correctly on a PC, there is most likely nothing about the document that needs to be fixed. The issue is local to the unit having the problem. It‚Äôs impossible to determine with any certainty why a document
 display incorrectly on a specific PC without knowing certain things about the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you check your system if it is set to just <strong>Show Final</strong> and if it is set to
<strong>Final Showing Markup. <em>Settings &gt; Review tab &gt; modify them with the document open.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of the factors why this happened:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Version and Update level of Office/Word</strong></li><li><strong>Missing or conflicting fonts</strong></li><li><strong>Significantly different printer driver</strong></li><li><strong>Damaged or corrupted preferences file</strong></li><li><strong>Corrupt Normal template</strong></li><li><strong>Insufficient memory (RAM)</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know about the outcome.</p>

            Is the script font language a Right to Left language.&nbsp; The is seems to be that Word is getting confused by the combination of Right to Left and Left to Right languages.&nbsp; You may be able to avoid the confusion by the use&nbsp;Style Separators in the body of
 the document with appropriate style formats being used for the RTL and LTR text.&nbsp; You may however then have to use TC fields to get both parts of the text in the body of the document included in the Table of Contents.

    <title>Excel 2007 Conditional Formatting - Function from an Add-In - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordang1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 Conditional Formatting - Function from an Add-In</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all...</p>
<p>I have created an add-in with a function in it called isformula().&nbsp; It's basically the same thing as hasformula() that is well documented on many sites.</p>
<p>I have a value or a formula in A1 and I am trying to apply conditional formatting.</p>
<p>I have tried to create a new formatting rue using a formula to determine which cells to format.&nbsp; The formula is set to =isformula(A1) and a fill color is set.</p>
<p>When I kick OK, I get a message:</p>
<p>You cannot use references to other worksheets or workbooks for Conditional Formatting criteria.</p>
<p>Doesn't an add-in make the function part of the workbook that I'm in?</p>
<p>I can, of course, remove the add-in, and put the function in a module, however, I am building a template where I want to highlight cells that are either using a function or not (depending on the situation) and I need to distribute isformula() to the team
 of people using or reading the workbook.&nbsp; I thought the add-in route would simplify this, but if anyone has a better idea, I'm open to that as well.</p>
<p>Thank!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's one way.</p>
<p>Right click any cell and then 'Name a range' and give it a name (say) Isformula. In the refers to box enter</p>
<p>=GET.CELL(6,Sheet1!$A1)</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>Now select A1 and apply a conditional format of</p>
<p>=LEFT(IsFormula)="="</p>
<p>with an approriate colour and your done</p>

<p>Thanks for your input!&nbsp; Your solution works well for a single cell, but it is not applying to a range.&nbsp; I named a range with =GET.CELL(6,Sheet1!$A$1:$C$3).</p>
<p>With all of the cells in the range populated with formulas, they all turn a color, but when a single cell is overwritten with a value, it doesn't turn off....only when the upper left cell is overridden.</p>
<p>This will be a potential large sheet with a lot of formulas, so the solution needs to work for more than one cell at a time.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

    <title>How many times must I verify my new OUTLOOK.COM mail account on a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> englishteacherinasia  say:</h3>
<h2>            How many times must I verify my new OUTLOOK.COM mail account on a daily basis&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to create a brand new OUTLOOK.COM email address because of problems following a move to the OFFICE365 servers. My original email no longer worked with WINDOWS LIVE MAIL and the suggested fixes from the community didn't help in the end.
</p>
<p>Since creating the new email account I have received - on a daily basis - a request to verify/validate my account.</p>
<p>Is there a special way to validate the account so that I no longer have to validate it on a daily basis - perhaps once every few months?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything that proves to be useful by way of advice will be gratefully received. But do not suggest that I move up to WINDOWS 10.</p>
<p>(Had to decline that update again today).</p>

            <p>Hi Mohammed,</p>
<p>Web browser access does not require any validation.</p>
<p>I keep getting automated messages from 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** with the following text :</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div><em>To continue sending messages, please <span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">sign in</span> and validate your Outlook.com account.
</em></div>
<div>
<div><em>This helps us stop automated programs from sending junk email. </em></div>
<div>
<div><em>Thanks for your help and patience! </em></div>
<div>
<div><em>The Outlook.com Team </em></div>
<p>This is received by WINDOWS LIVE MAIL.</p>
<p>This clearly is an automated program sending (what I consider to be) junk email.</p>
<p>The irony of that statement!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously mentioned I have had problems with my original account on OUTLOOK.COM - it doesn't work with WLM especially since Microsoft moved OUTLOOK.COM to the OFFICE365 Servers.</p>
<p>Hence I created a new OUTLOOK.COM email address - which now receives the daily reminder to validate the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, does anyone know how (apart from abandoning WLM) to get OUTLOOK.COM to work with WLM?</p>
<p>It used to work fine... then... </p>
<p>
</p><p>My latest sentiment regarding Microsoft's inability to create functional programs capable of working with each other? I can see now why they are giving Windows 10 away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget this. You won't miss one tiny customer.</p>
<p>Outlook.com? Hah! Windows Live Mail? Hah!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Validate yourselves first... then worry about a new O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            <p>Having been so kindly advised by Microsoft Support Technicians that WLM is a legacy system and is no longer supported and then left "high and dry" by that statement I look forward to the time when I can replace all Microsoft products and treat them as the
 legacy package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a fix, all on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually add the server details IMAP/STMP and WLM will work with OUTLOOK.COM - BUT SLOWLY!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the idiots in support couldn't provide that answer is beyond me, aren't they supposed to be 1) Technicians and 2) Customer support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also chosen to use an alternative email client. </p>
<p>And I will be abandoning any/all Microsoft products the moment I find a suitable alternative, or I no longer have the requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is interested... this question can now be discarded. No thanks to Microsoft.</p>
