<h2>            Slow latency for Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>For quite a while now i have been having problems with Outlook since it took over from Hotmail, just like so many other people on here.&nbsp; I've been able to get into my account but then the page just hangs with a white screen.&nbsp; I have to keep refreshing the
 page and sometimes 'eventually' my email page will appear.&nbsp; Sometimes i can reply to mails, sometimes it just hangs in 'saving' and the email i'm trying to send&nbsp;goes to draft.&nbsp; I then find my mail has been sent possibly two or three times.&nbsp; Yesterday, i was
 locked out of my account totally and it was telling me my password didn't exist even though i have used it for a very long time.&nbsp; I reset my password and was allowed back&nbsp; in to my account but now - same old problems.&nbsp; I simply can't access my email like so
 many of the&nbsp;other complaints on here and people who have just the same problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does come up to say that it is NOT my computer, it is a fault with Outlook which is not working - other times, there is no message at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is noting to do with the browser or anything people have to optimize - this is a problem with Outlook and it has now gone on so long i'm having to use another simple email service but i have the trouble of so much of my mail going to Outlook for business
 and social&nbsp;purposes this is causing considerable havoc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems one or two people i know are not having problems so why is it that a few people are ok, and yet droves of others are having such difficulty?&nbsp; There seems no sign of things improving at all.&nbsp; Clearly this change over from Hotmail to Outlook with
 all it's social network links has not worked and it doesn't look as if it is going to be put right anytime soon.&nbsp; Are you going to do anything about these issues with Outlook at all?&nbsp; If not, i don't think people will have any other choice but to move their
 accounts elsewhere.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry but i have no idea why you have sent me a private message about this.&nbsp; It is of no help to others on the forum.&nbsp; You asked for...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email address</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Affected Link where i encountered the error message - what does this mean?&nbsp; There is no affected link, it is that Outlook does not work properly as i outlined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fiddle trace logs - you gave complicated instructions how to do this.&nbsp; I don't need to.&nbsp; If you need to know this information it would apply to the hundreds of people on this forum who are all experiencing the same problems as in, Outlook does not work properly
 and if by asking this question it will help you to know where the issues are going wrong, all people on here complaining need to know the same thing, and be asked the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A screenshbot of issue encountered - you don't need a screen shot of Outlook not working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do understand you have been given questions to ask people by your superiors but basically - the problem is simple.&nbsp; The people who run Outlook know full well there are many errors that many people are encountering and they need to sort this problem out
 before people leave in droves as i said.&nbsp; When Outlook works ok on&nbsp;one day, it is worrying that the next day, it may well go back to square one and not work again. We need consistancy.&nbsp; I hope your bosses get the problem sorted to save you having to deal with
 the issues so many people are having problems with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question yesterday was already 4 pages back in the list as so many had complained after i did.&nbsp; Thank you for answering and i hope your bosses can sort this Outlook email issue and stabalize it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also make an .iso file from the BT-Windows folder (hidden folder in the root of C:) on the device that successfully upgraded as long as it is the same edition and architecture as the problematic device. &nbsp;Use that media to install the preview and

<p><font>- uninstall current/older version of Music (or Ovi) Player (also if latest version is already partially installed - uninstall that).</font></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have this 1722 install error message and Music Player 2.5.11021.00 fails to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having uninstalled the Ovi Player I have no Music Player at all :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have followed all of the troubleshooting steps outlined above and on the linked page referring to the earlier version. Have isolated the install files and run them independently, Connectivity Cable Driver, Connectivity Solution &amp; Multimedia Common Components
 all appear to install OK both indpendently and using the set up file which auto downloads/installs....music player always fails close to the start of the install process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, I followed the update instruction offered by the original Ovi Player this stumbled in an endless loop stating "Nokia_Multimedia_Common_Components_2_5 is Preparing to install" eventually resulting in a 1722 fail. All uninstall/reinstall steps fail
 at the same point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW OS is Windows 7 64 bit, Latest PC Suite, Software Updater&nbsp;&amp; Nokia Suite installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would value some assistance in resolving this....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi qubuqu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clarify I have (several times) attempted the following (using the linked post referred to earlier in this thread):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Uninstalled from Control Panel:</font></p>
<p><font>Ôªø</font></p>
<p><font>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia OVI Player/Nokia Music Player</font></p>
<p><font>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia Multimedia Common Components</font></p>
<p><font>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC Connectivity Solution</font></p>
<p><font>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Then deleted initially:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOKIA OVI PLAYER- C:\Program Files (x86)\Nokia\Nokia OVI Player</font>Ôªø</font></p>
<p><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPLATFORM- C:\Program Files (x86)\ Common Files\ Nokia\ MPlatform</font></p>
<p><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOKIA DATA STORE- C:\Users\&lt;&lt;Windows Username&gt;&gt;\App Data\Local\ Nokia\Nokia Data Store</font></p>
<p><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOKIA OVI PLAYER- C:\Users\&lt;&lt;Windows Username&gt;&gt;\App Data\Local\Nokia\Nokia OVI Player</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Repeated above uninstalls however subsequent deletion of directories as below (as&nbsp;neither Ovi Player&nbsp;nor Music Player&nbsp;directories are&nbsp;now present in C:\Users\&lt;&lt;Windows Username&gt;&gt;\App Data\Local\Nokia\ directory....most likely due to aborted
 install process):</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;<font>Ôªø</font></p>
<p><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOKIA MUSIC PLAYER- C:\Program Files (x86)\Nokia\Nokia Music Player</font></p>
<p><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPLATFORM- C:\Program Files\ Common Files\ Nokia\ MPlatform</font></p>
<p><font>¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOKIA DATA STORE- C:\Users\&lt;&lt;Windows Username&gt;&gt;\App Data\Local\ Nokia\Nokia Data Store</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Still get the 1722 error.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Above steps&nbsp;then repeated and also&nbsp;downloaded and ran the&nbsp;automated install/uninstall fix assistantÔªø from Microsoft (referred to both in your reply and linked post from earlier in this thread) at
</font><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_‚Äãand_Uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_‚Äãand_Uninstall</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The automated program found no issues!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try this again to uninstall Nokia_Multimedia_Common_Components_2_5......in fact I will use it to uninstall all 4 components then delete the directories once more and report the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for helping.</p>

<h2>            Outlook email red x &#40;delete&#41; missing</h2>
                    Running Outlook 2016 Preview&nbsp;on a Desktop and a Laptop (both with In 10 64x OS). The Laptop has a red x in the Inbox message boxes (which is very convenient to delete messages) - the Desktop Inbox messages don't have the red x; I have to rt click to get
 a menu that offers a DELETE command (inconvenient!). When I look at the versions of these two 2016 Previews, there is a slight difference in the Product ID numbers. How can I get the version with the red x to be installed on my Desktop?

            I suspect you have Outlook set in Touch mode.&nbsp; Look for an icon in the upper left that looks like a finger touching a button, click that, and select "Mouse" instead of "Touch"

    <title>Windows 950 rapid battery drain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterago  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 950 rapid battery drain</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,</p>
<p>I have the Windows 950 phone which I've had for about a year. The battery was never always the best, but acceptable. Recently however, I noticed the battery rapidly draining and checking usage, seems the phones messaging takes average 38-48% of battery usage.
 If you don't allow the app to run in the background, you don't hear/ get text msgs. But still it shouldn't take up so much battery. I've stopped just about every single background app OFF, but still drains fast. Even when on battery saving mode which is set
 at 80% , it still drains fast, so, I give up. Is the phone faulty?</p>
<p>Need help.</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>

            I'd like to stick with UWP because of the upcoming split view. I don't like installing apps that I will uninstall again. Skype 8 is just too much of a CPU hog. BTW, the issue persists despite a reset via Settings app so this is a probable issue were Skype
 ain't compatible with my realtek sound card driver.

That is exactly what I do not want. having another Skype client that might leave some junk on my drive after uninstalling it. I tried on web preview and it was totally fine. Since there is a similar thread on this I think the issue will persist on 8.33.0.50
 since the thread starter there had issues on the Non-Windows 10 App.

    <title>word and excel blank screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brigh7blade  say:</h3>
<h2>            word and excel blank screen</h2>
                    <p>hi guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with Microsoft word 2013 and excel.</p>
<p>when I either load a word document or open word directly it goes to a completely blank screen.</p>
<p>there is nothing visible on screen but as far as I can tell it all still works. drop down windows still appear and I can x the screen away because I know where it is but I cannot see anything.</p>
<p>if I click in the screen and start to type I still cannot see anything and when I x it away it asks if I want to save but I don't bother and I cant use it.</p>
<p>I completely uninstalled office and re installed twice but the same issues with these two.</p>
<p>any help would be great.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

            <p>Exact same issue, except it's just Word for me and Excel is still functional. Below is a snipped screen shot of what we are dealing with. I also reinstalled (with some trouble thanks to Visio) but the problem was not resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot think of anything in particular that would have caused this issue. I am a programming student, so I do have a bunch of development tools installed, but have not added anything of note within the time-frame of the issue occurring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hells yeah, after a bit of thinking I was able to figure out what changes I'd made recently and fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to an issue with my laptop insisting on using the integrated graphics when it really needed to be using the actual GPU, I'd recently gone through and forced the GPU use for most everything. As shown below, swapping my nvidia settings to use the integrated
 graphics for the program fixed the issue (do need to close-restart the program).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing some specific feature setting while using the GPU is the source of the problem, and if found wouldn't force the use of crummy integrated graphics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still not OK that this is a thing, and quite ridiculous that the highest profile document program is so sensitive and problem prone.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hayden, what version of Office and Window are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The general trouble shooting process I suggest you follow is this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Apply all Windows Updates</li><li>Repair Office</li><li>uninstall and re-install Office from control panel</li><li>uninstall and re-install Office using the appropriate "Fix it" tool</li><li>Start Word/Excel in Safe mode to disable addons</li><li>Start Windows in Safe mode to disable 3rd party programs</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I suspect the problem will turn out to be a bad interaction with an addon or 3rd party program, but that is just a guess.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following processes are specific for Word, but you can generalize them to apply to excel too</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<strong>Trouble Shoot Word</strong>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong>A General Starting point when Word does something unexpected</strong>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word ‚Äúmenu‚Äô go to Tools and then Options, in Word ‚Äúribbon‚Äù go to File then Options, and study all of the various options, both turned on and
 off.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>You may even get lucky and find some other settings that you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you‚Äôre wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked
 how I thought she should set something up. Each time the answer was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd use a Word table.‚Äù By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong>A good, simple quick fix is ‚ÄúBoot your computer‚Äù</strong>
<p><span>The simplest fix is shutting down your computer normally and restarting it. Often subtle ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù happens to create unusual effects. Shutting down and restarting the computer resets all of the loaded software, often clearing
 up strange problems.</span></p>

part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie ‚Äúsend to Bluetooth‚Äù, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different ‚Äúrandom‚Äù symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It‚Äôs not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>

<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you very much for the amazingly quick reply, I wont assume you are using a bot but you really should consider revising that massive copy paste. That is a huge info bomb that really isn't all that helpful and could cause some real headaches for users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main section I'd agree with and like to echo is that of recent software. Taking a full minute or two to think about what has changed on your computer recently and might be responsible is the absolute #1 way to fix a problem like this, though I still
 take issue with you immediately suggesting users liberally uninstall their software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to see my self-reply where I found the solution to the problem... within the time-frame it would have taken to read just 1 of those links.</p>

            <p>No I am not a bot &lt;grin&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a large collection of information (currently about 35GB in my "active" tips file) garnered from various sources that I commonly use, plus many more files and IE Favorites I can search by subject / keyword.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I think I recognize a problem description I find the associated data in my active file or my other files. Then I copy only what I think is relevant.&nbsp; I try to provide links to source articles and maybe short extracts rather than blatantly copying the
 whole text (I do try actively avoid plagerism).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have developed the habit of copying web content because I find that the "good stuff" often has a short shelf life, it has "evaporated" when I go back to look for it.&nbsp; If I copy it into my working document I use the "Hidden text" attribute so I don't copy
 / paste the whole document, just the title, a link and maybe a summary or extracts.&nbsp; Sometimes the hidden attribute "gets lost" ... &lt;sigh&gt;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an ... advocate ... of educating the poster by providing links rather than always providing simple stark answers (look at some of the terse, 1 sentence replies other people have submitted ... &lt;grin&gt; ). I find that while I do not always hit the nail
 on the head, the shotgun approach does trigger ideas that can lead to solutions. Like it did in this case &lt;grin&gt;
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Re: uninstalling software.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Office is, and has "traditionally" been, explicitly designed to be uninstalled and re-installed as a shotgun trouble shooting technique.&nbsp; MS's "traditional" trouble shooting process for Office has been since the 1980's: boot computer, repair office, uninstall
 from control panel and re-install.&nbsp; This has become even more entrenched since the introduction of CTR (Click To Run (most-of-the-time) ). If you look at many "MS" employee replies they often now go directly to re-install.

    <title>Security issue&#58; Sign out is not working on Edge and IE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karim murr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security issue&#58; Sign out is not working on Edge and IE</h2>
                    <p>I use a business account for which I am admin and also use the azure portal for web development. Since a week or so, I cannot sign out from office 365 or the azure portal when using Edge or IE. The scenario is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Use Edge or IE and goto <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://login.microsoftonline.com/</a></p>
<p>-In my case I get a redirect to office.com and get logged in (I never check the remember me option).</p>
<p>-Sign out from the upper-right corner of the browser</p>
<p>-Close the browser and delete cache (I also added ccleaner on top)</p>
<p>-Reopen Edge/IE and go to the above link. I am presented with my email and when I click it I get logged in without entering the pwd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is absent in chrome and FF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise if this is a known security issue and if there is a workaround.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Karim,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your video when you sign in Office 365 portal, I found and captured the the following screenshot.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/589abdfb-56ba-4d7c-838f-31e6974d4f38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/589abdfb-56ba-4d7c-838f-31e6974d4f38" /></a></p>
<p>Your office 365 account is "connected to Windows" which means in this situation, you can sign in to Office without using password. Because you have already signed in with your account in your computer. This is why this symptom appears again after you updated
 Windows.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to get rid of this, please go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings &gt; Access work or school<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Disconnect<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>your work account. Here is an<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/05/28/azure-ad-join-on-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a>for

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>I am not sure this is the issue because, indeed, I use office 365 to log in to my pc since some time now (2 years approx) and I always had to enter the pwd for each sign-in to O365 in the browser. This automatic sign-in to O365 is new since the insider preview.
 Furthermore it works only on Edge and IE if I opt for non-private browsing, so it does not really make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore,&nbsp; if I disconnect my work account I cannot sign-in to the pc using this account anymore. There is no way -as it used to be- to be able to have a work account for the pc but where browsing with IE/Edge would require me to enter the pwd?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi William,Thinking of it, there are other strange behaviours in this regard. In the past and while using Azure AD O365 to log in to my pc, whenever I wanted to check my bills on the azure portal for web dev, I was required to enter the pwd as an extra security,
 because this is where you have bank details, credit cards etc. That security made sense! Now, I can access this info without any pwd, which means that anyone who gets my pc can even delete the entire azure subscription and so on. Honestly, I am not sure that
 is wise but please confirm to me if this is the expected result. and we can close this issue.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

So, I have a Nokia 6555, that I am even now using as the modem, but through bluetooth.<br />
Every time I connect the phone with the datacable, it recognises it, tries to install the drivers, but it fails.<br />
<br />
Two popups appear, one that has a device named "Ports", and another for "Nokia 6555 USB Modem"<br />
<br />
'Cannot install this hardware.<br />
There was a problem installing this hardware.<br />
Ports<br />
An error occurred during the installing of the device.<br />
A service installation section in this INF is invalid.'<br />
<br />
For 'Ports', if it try the Add hardware wizard, select to search in windows update, it just pops up the same dialog.<br />
For the modem, it just says 'Windows was unable to install this modem.'<br />
<br />
I have tried PC suite 7.0.9.2, PC suite 7.0.8.2, trying to use the PC suite cleaner 7.0.1, trying the Connectivity Cable Driver 7.0.2.0, but nothing has worked.<br />
Im using win XP SP2.<br />
<br />
Kinda useless having a 2mb net on your phone if you just have a bluetooth for it :/

            I also have a 6555 and my windows PC recognizes it (as a Nokia 6555b) when I plug it in via CA-101 USB cable and tries to install the "USB phone Parent" which I assume is the driver and then windows says there was a problem installing the hardware, "fatal
 error during installation" and the hardware wizard quits. Have you solved your problem? If so, how?

            Hi guys! Got the same problem with john_edward too. I am using windows xp sp3. I initially thought the OS was the culprit as I was able to install everything successfully on a windows xp sp2 system (it installed phone parent driver and some other stuffs,
 but I didn't see this process w/my sp3) but apparently, it's not. I have found 2 'solutions' from other forums that included an xp update and the other one a file called wdf0100.sys, still it did not solve the problem. If u guys have worked around it, please
 let us know! I bought my cable separately as it did not come w/my phone package (nokia 7210 supernova). Such a waste of money if I couldn't use it. @stoche: yes i have tried using bluetooth and it installed everything perfectly but wireless connection is always
 slower than a wired one. In my area, i only get up to 6kbps using a bluetooth connection. I am hoping that speed is better w/a cable..

<p>I have a database that has a table for Employees and then a table for Projects. In the table for Projects, I have columns for Partner in Charge, Sr. Project Manager, and Project Manager which pull directly from the Employee Table. (Over time people get promotions&nbsp;or

<p>This would be better solved with properly normalizing your data. What you should have is a child table:</p>
<p>tblProjectRoles: ProjectRoleID (PK Autonumber), ProjectID (FK), RoleID (FK), EmployeeID (FK)</p>
<p>You would also need a Roles table:</p>
<p>tluRoles: RoleID (PK Autonumber), Role</p>
<p>With this structure, you simply query this table for EmployeeID and you get all projects the employee had a role in and what their role was.</p>
<p>I would recommend redesigning your database. It would be fairly easy to create these tables and populate them using Append queries. If you need more help with that feel free to ask.</p>
<p>P.S. PK = Primary Key, FK= Foreign key</p>
<p>P.P.S. You might want to Google/Bing <em>Normalization</em> . This is a key design technique for relational databases.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a UNION query to get the information.</p>
<p>UNION queries can only be built in the SQL view.&nbsp; One listing the person and all associated projects might look like the following.</p>
<p>SELECT [Partner in Charge] as Person, Project<br />
FROM Projects<br />
UNION <br />
SELECT [Sr. Project Manager] as Person, Project<br />
FROM Projects<br />
UNION<br />
SELECT [Project Manager] as Person, Project<br />
FROM Projects</p>

            Having separate columns for each role in the project is not a good design in a relational database.&nbsp; What you really have here is a many-to-many relationship type between Employees and Projects, with the role in the project as an attribute of the relationship
 type.&nbsp; This type of relationship is modelled by a third table, sometimes called a 'junction' table, which has two or more foreign keys, respectively referencing the primary keys of the related tables, so the table would be like so:<br />
<br />
ProjectEmployees<br />
....ProjectID<br />
....EmployeeID<br />
....RoleID<br />
<br />
The primary key of this table is a composite one made up of all three columns.&nbsp; If you wish to constrain the table to allowing only one employee of each role per project then a unique index should also be created on the ProjectID and RoleID columns in combination.<br />
<br />
In fact the relationship type is a ternary (3-way) one as Roles is also a party to the relationship, so you'd also have a table:<br />
<br />
Roles<br />
....RoleID<br />
....Role<br />
<br />
With this structure you are now correctly representing all data as values at column positions in tables, which is the only way in which data should be represented, not encoded as column headings as you are currently doing.&nbsp; This accords with one of the basic
 principles of the database relational model, the Information Rule, which was Codd's Rule #1 when he introduced the relational model for databases in 1970.&nbsp; Form a more practical point of view, you can of course make provision for other rolls in a project simply
 by adding new rows to the Roles table.<br />
<br />
To find out who participates in each project as what join the four tables in a query, with ProjectEmployees joined to each of the other three.&nbsp; To restrict this to a specific employee include a parameter on the EmployeeID column.<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>As I said, I am very new to Access and databases in general, so forgive the basic questions. I literally opened the program and am self teaching.</p>
<p>I work in the construction industry and the&nbsp;current&nbsp;database consists of the following tables as of now:</p>
<p><strong>Employees</strong> (with contact info and some other info...bdays,&nbsp;title, current employee, etc.&nbsp;as columns)<br />
<strong>Architects</strong> (with contact info and subtable for&nbsp;"type of specialty" that feeds the Architect Table as columns)<br />
<strong>Engineers</strong> (with contact info and subtable for "type of engineer" that feeds the Engineers Table as columns)<br />
<strong>Other Consultants</strong> (with contact infor and subtable for "type of consultant" that feeds the Other Consultants Table as columns)<br />
<strong>CM-GC</strong> (with contact info and subtable for "type of specialty) that feeds the CM-GC Table as columns)<br />
<strong>Client</strong> (with contact info as columns)</p>
<p>Each of the above tables has an "ID" column with an Autonumber as its primary key. These tables give me the basic ability to put together "Contact" reports and queries based on type specialty/engineer/etc. I feel like my major problem arises with the "Projects"
 table.</p>
<p>Currently my "Projects" table consists of:</p>
<p>-Project ID<br />
-Project Name<br />
-Project Type (fed from a subtable)<br />
-Partner in Charge (fed from Employee name on Employee Chart)<br />
-Sr Project Manager&nbsp;(fed from Employee name on Employee Chart)<br />
-Project Manager&nbsp;(fed from Employee name on Employee Chart)<br />
-Project Start Date<br />
-Project Completion Date<br />
-Current Project (yes/no)<br />
-Project Value<br />
-Project Square Footage<br />
-LEED Project (yes/no)<br />
-Type of LEED Project (fed from a subtable...LEED Project Types)<br />
-Brief Project Description<br />
-Owner (fed from Company Name from Client table)<br />
-CM/GC (fed from Company Name from CM-GC Table)<br />
-Architect Name (fed from Company Name from Architect Table)<br />
<br />
And then probably 25 other columns for each type of engineer and other consultant (each fed from either the Engineer or Other Consultant Table)<br />
<br />
After reading your response and some of the others, it seems that I have not designed this Project Table correctly. (and maybe the other tables too)</p>
<p>My basic questions now are:</p>
<p>1) How should I reformat my "Projects Table" so that&nbsp;I can input all of the above information in&nbsp;the table but maintain the proper relationships for queries/reports. basically so that there is normalization!<br />
2)&nbsp;I have created the two additional tables that you suggested above, "Roles" and "Project Roles". But without proper formatting on the "Projects" Table how&nbsp;do I utilize them to make sure the right employee is in the right "role" on the right&nbsp;"project". How
 do I let the database know that Jim worked as a Project Manager on "Project X" and Steve as a Partner on "Project Y"<br />
3) If my method for inputting the owner, architect, engineers, etc. is incorrect (which is extremely possible) What should I do so that I can do similar queries/reports. For example, search by an Architect's Name to find which projects they worked on.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long explanation, but thought it might be&nbsp;helpful in seeing where I am at.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, it wasn't too long!</p>

                    I was trying to activate windows after a hardware-motherboard change. I am currently running windows 10 pro&nbsp; insiders preview as a developer in fast mode.The page recommended that I buy windows 10 pro to activate windows, so far no luck. "We can't activate
 windows on this device as the product key entered doesn't match the hardware profile".Troubleshoot and then I got the error code-0x80049E00. Any suggestions. Thank-you.

            Have you reinstalled the same version of Win10? using the same Hard Drive? if the board is the same model (or close) you can contact MS and they should be able to activate your system using the MSA that you were using before the change.

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded Office 2013 Home and Business a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; I was especially looking forward to using Power View in Excel 2013 but when I opened Excel 2013 the Power View icon was not visible anywhere on the ribbon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I have been in contract with Microsoft Support several times....and they have spent 6 or 7 hours trying to figure out why the icon is not visible in Excel 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LWF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; They (Microsoft Support) are calling back in a couple of days to try something else to see if they can get it working.</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />You could try to repair the office installation by:
<br />
<br />From Start select Settings to launch Windows Settings
<br />From Windows Settings choose Apps. (It might take a few moments for the Apps list to load)
<br />Find Microsoft Office on the list and select it.
<br />Select Modify and in the menu that opens choose Online Repair
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps or not!

<h2>            Windows Phone Desktop app not copying playlist correctly</h2>
                    I have all my mp3s kept offline, I don't use streaming music of any kind. I used WMP in Windows 8 to create a playlist with 34 songs, then used the WP desktop app to copy the playlist to my phone. All 34 songs get copied to my phone, but the playlist on
 my phone only shows 23 songs are in the playlist. Why does this always happen? How can I make an offline playlist on my PC and get it on my WP8.1 phone? (Dev preview, Verizon Nokia 928).

<p>
</p><p>That's not quite what's happening. All my songs from the playlist make it to the phone, I can listen to them. But the playlist itself only shows that I have 23 songs in it. It's like it copied all the songs over but then failed somehow making the playlist
 on the phone correctly. I do agree it's most likely a problem with the music app on the phone itself. I wish they'd bring back the zune/wp7 music app/methodology. :(</p>

I get an error message when trying to activate office 2010 starter edition, what should I do?! The error message reads "There was a problem setting up Microsoft Office Starter 2010: There was a problem setting up Microsoft Office. Try running set up again.
 If the problem continues, contact Microsoft Product Support." So, I called, and the thing is, they don't know why it won't start up.

    <title>Using 6120 classic as modem on Mac to connect to the internet with USB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using 6120 classic as modem on Mac to connect to the internet with USB</h2>
                    Hi. I hope somebody could help me about this.<br />
<br />
I own a Macbook and recently purchased the new 6120 classic. I did manage to connect it to the internet with bluetooth connection, but it seems that the connection is weak and unstablle. The bluetooth collapses and crash very often, perhaps because even bluetooth
 2.0 cannot handle the highspeed HSDPA. And everytime it crashes, I must re-configure the bluetooth or wait for a very long time until it can go back online, which is very stressful...<br />
<br />
So, I am now trying to go online by using the USB cable, but there is no software available for Mac, from Nokia...I even purchased the cable cause it didn't come with the box. Are there any ways to connect the 6120 to Mac by using the USB connection and go
 to the internet? By the way I'm online now from windows and I prefer the Mac very much ;)

            Go to <a href="http://www.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com</a> and see if they have a PC Suite version for the operating system that you are using.

            hmmm.... My post has been seen more than 80 times but no answers that solve this problem... I guess it is impossible to connect to the internet by usb cable, until we have the non-existent "Mac Suite"???

            Hi. I already have iSync installed on my computer and I found Plug-in for 6120c on the web. But I cannot go on from there. Can somebody give me more information? And I suppose I can connect to the internet (by USB cable)from isync without the .mac account???
 Please help!

            Good news - I was having the same probs using the same things as you were, BUT on a Google search came across a DIFFERENT link to the Nokia Europe site which fixed all my probs.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4423134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4423134</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Once I loaded the Multimedia Transfer, installed it, followed all the instructions in this link
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4372155" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4372155</a><br />
<br />
by some miracle I connected.<br />
<br />
Don't ask how. I have been trying the various Ross Barkman scripts for HSDPA Nokias for 24 hours, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
I am pretty pleased. But you really must follow the instructions to the letter. I am using Leopard, btw. In the System Prefs &gt; Network Prefs, the Location I left at Automatic.<br />
Then I made a new Configuration which I called Nokia USB. (Something about having installed the Multimedia software made the Mac recognise that A Nokia 6120 Classic was "there".)<br />
<br />
Note, I am on the (Australian) Telstra NextG network, so I left all the fields - Phone number, Account name and Password - blank.<br />
<br />
TICK - show modem status in Menu Bar.<br />
<br />
Press ADVANCED.<br />
The Modem tab - select Nokia as the Vendor.<br />
The only option under Model says GPRS (GSM/3G).<br />
For a casual telstra datapack, the idea is to put telstra.datapack in the APN field.<br />
Underneath is CID and the only option is 1.<br />
<br />
All the other Tabs are ok as is.<br />
<br />
I pressed OK. Then the Connect button and I was in.<br />
<br />
I will test the same idea using the Barkman scripts later and check speeds. I should be getting upwards of 1.8 Mbps for downloads where I am right now.<br />
<br />
Cheers and good luck to all :)

            Thanks so much for your able assistance in setting up my Nokia 6120 for use as a usb connected modem.<br />
It had been working perfectly with my old G4 on OS 10, until I upgraded my compuper to a new iMac top of the line 24 inch job and then when I tried to configure it it would not recognize it. Your instructions were perfect except for one small thing. I am on
 a casual data contract with telstra also but in the APN field it would not work with telstra.datapack so I looked up my phone info in the hand set and found telstra.internet, entered this in the APN field and hey presto I'm in......yay.<br />
The Bluetooth connection got me out of trouble but it would often drop out and I had to restart my computer and mobile phone to re-establish contact.<br />
<br />
I should also say that I would not be having to go to all this bother if testra would give me a broadband connection via landline, but they refuse.......old par gained lines and they will not upgrade them!<br />
<br />
I am living only for a short period in this house while I build a new one and so I figured it's not worth the trouble to dig in and go to the telcommunications ombudsman.<br />
<br />
Blah blah........ I am waffling!<br />
<br />
Thank you once again ausielaurie.You have mad my life so much easier!
