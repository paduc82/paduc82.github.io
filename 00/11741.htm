<p>I just bought the phone about 2 weeks ago, I use it for texting, music and surfing (rarely)... I just noticed the fully charged battery only lasted for 20-22 hrs.? Sometimes I just using it for music purposes then suddenly when I got home from work... its
 turns out that its batter empty? Not surving a day! .. it advertised it will lasted for i think 47 hours of music? I uninstalled some apps (whatsapp) i just read in some post that it may cause the wifi to automatically to turn on but i didnt notice any changes,
 I check the connectivety setting make sure the wifi or bluetooth are on but still no changes its just drains the power.. Can somebody help me? thnx...</p>

<p>Hi kwamectc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the following guidelines to increase your battery life time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn&nbsp;<strong>Bluetooth</strong>&nbsp;<strong>off</strong>&nbsp;when you do not need it.
</li><li>Specify that your Nokia phone does not scan, or scans less often, for available&nbsp;<strong>Wireless LAN&nbsp;</strong>(WLAN) networks in the backround when you do not need WLAN connections (to turn off scanning, disable&nbsp;<strong>Show WLAN availability</strong>&nbsp;in
 Wireless LAN settings).&nbsp; </li><li>If you have set&nbsp;<strong>Packet data</strong>&nbsp;connection to&nbsp;<strong>When available</strong>&nbsp;in connection settings, and there is no packet data coverage (GPRS), your Nokia phone periodically tries to establish a packet data connection. To prolong the operating
 time of your Nokia phone, select&nbsp;<strong>Packet data connection</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>When needed</strong>.
</li><li>If the signal strength of the cellular network varies much in your area, your Nokia phone must scan for the available network repeatedly. This increases the demand on battery power.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;<strong>Network mode</strong>&nbsp;is set to&nbsp;<strong>dual mode&nbsp;</strong>in
 the network settings, the Nokia phone searches for the UMTS network. To use only the GSM network, select&nbsp;<strong>Network mode</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>GSM</strong>.&nbsp;
</li><li>Leaving&nbsp;<strong>applications running&nbsp;</strong>in the background increases the demand on battery power. Close&nbsp;the applications you are not using.
</li><li>Turn off&nbsp;<strong>vibrate</strong>&nbsp;function of your Nokia phone, using just the ring tone.
</li><li>Avoid&nbsp;using&nbsp;<strong>moving or animated pictures</strong>&nbsp;or videos for your Nokia phone's background.
</li><li><strong>Turn off&nbsp;</strong>your Nokia phone whenever you do not plan to answer any calls, for example while you are sleeping.
</li><li>
<p>Make sure your phone is running the&nbsp;<strong>latest software</strong>. For downloads and assistance, go to your local Nokia website's support page.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If the battery&nbsp;loses&nbsp;the power fast even though there is no features&nbsp;consuming the power, the battery may be faulty and we would advise you to visit your local
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care Point</a> and let them have a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I´ve got the same problem with Asha 303, the battery lasts about 20 hours of moderate activity,mostly whatsapp and sms on wifi, deffinitely not anywhere near 850hrs :o), yesterday I updated the device, but nothing changed (besides the email client, that
 stopped working at all...). Any tips before I return it?</p>

<p>I too was having similar problems, the battery not lasting even for a single day. On some days, I had to charge the battery more than twice. On a particular day, it got depleted to the extent of 'battery low' warning appearing. I put it on full charge through
 the night. As if by magic, from the next day onwards, I find the battery lasting for 3 or 4 days!&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I use the phone mostly for talk/text/organizer,&nbsp;occasional mail check on wifi and running a few apps&nbsp;now and then, but still this was not happening
 before.&nbsp; Then onwards, I am charging the battery only when the 'battery low' prompt appears, and I am getting a very satisfactory battery life now.&nbsp; May be there is truth in the popular belief that for good life, rechargeable batteries need to be fully discharged
 before recharging.</p>

<p>So I'm back where I was a year ago. I am confident I can pinpoint the source of battery issue now- it is the updated Facebook app what's draining the battery this time. The previous cause was the Viber app. So with my limited knowledge of how the o.s. works,
 I gather it will have something to do with update rate of this kind of apps. I will try to update what can be updated and/or remove some apps and we will see.<br />
TLDR-&gt; battery life sucks again, high update rate (wake on) held suspect<br />

<p>
</p><p>I've had build 14352 for a couple of days now and I can't find anything new&nbsp;to complain about.&nbsp; There are still a couple of things I'm not happy with, but I have been assured that these problems are being sorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I'll just have to wait for others to gripe about everything, then try to make intelligent observations about what they may be doing wrong.</p>

<p>people do not like about windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of mine to start you off</p>
<p>1. Unable to fully turn off all telemetry in windows 10 retail builds.</p>
<p>2. Unable to change windows update to "Notify but do not download or install"</p>
<p>3. Unable to "Change active hours" to more than 10 hours.</p>
<p>4. Unable to change "Use a custom restart time" - grey until a program is actually ready to download</p>
<p>Basically I want update to work like windows 8 or 7 &amp; control updates &amp; restarts.</p>
<p>5. Unable to turn off the "Lock Screen"</p>
<p>6. Unable to fully turn off "Cortana" as it is integrated into search.</p>
<p>7. The start menu does not work or start 98% of the time.</p>
<p>8. Edge even with adblocker plus installed still has too many adverts (compared to any other browser)</p>

    <title>New Outlook mobile site not working&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> batz777  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Outlook mobile site not working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use my Hotmail account almost exclusively on Chrome browser for Android. I do not like the app layout, but now I find that this new layout for the mobile site is just as bad!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's difficult to navigate, impossible to delete multiple messages at once, and more than half the time the page loads in an unresponsive manner. I find myself unable to open or interact with my messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm posting here in hopes that someone from Microsoft can see this and assist. In the few days since this new layout took effect I've been seriously considering closing my account. I loved the previous layout, it was the only inbox layout I like, but without
 reliable desktop access, I need something that will work on mobile Chrome. Even if that means switching to another email provider with a layout I hate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else unable to access their emails now? Were you able to find a fix?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Across the top, it says Outlook Mail from a desktop site (accessed from a laptop, not the desktop site option on the phone browser). On my phone, (Android-Samsung phone, Chrome browser) this is what I'm seeing. This is the site that almost always load unresponsive,
 and when I do select the View Desktop Site option from the Chrome options, the view does not change.

</p><blockquote>Has anybody else been getting threats through their email saying that someone has hacked your system and knows your password, knows what you have been doing on your computer and the person is asking for money or they will send everything that they
 have to all my contacts? </blockquote>
<p>Yes, many others have gotten this same ransomware scam email message, it's well known and almost always made from the same template you'll find in this other recent thread where I answered exactly the same sort of question.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/all/malware-ransom-threat/f8d7891d-1e7d-453d-8372-9cc01b82de25">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/all/malware-ransom-threat/f8d7891d-1e7d-453d-8372-9cc01b82de25</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The way they get this information is from an also well known huge database of email addresses and passwords.&nbsp; These addresses and passwords were&nbsp;stolen&nbsp;from dozens of old websites with vulnerabilities that were breached in the past, usually long ago, and
 these typically have nothing directly to do&nbsp;with either your PC or email account.&nbsp; However, some were known to be from&nbsp;a Yahoo breach that did include email accounts, but everyone was informed to change those passwords a few years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the password is actually one that you currently use, that's only because you were using the same password in multiple places, which is a dangerous practice for exactly this reason, so change the password to something different on all critical systems
 like banks or&nbsp;email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to know if any other usernames or passwords you use might have been leaked or breached in the past, the following article discusses this huge database and also provides the link to the
<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Have I Been Pwned site</a>, which allows you to perform lookups for your own email address or passwords you use in order to find those that may be at risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/30/spambot-leaks-700m-email-addresses-huge-data-breach-passwords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Spambot leaks more than 700m email addresses in huge data breach&nbsp; Technology&nbsp; The Guardian</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that the email sent to you isn't true, the scammers sending it just found your email address associated with a password in this huge leaked file and dropped this into a boiler plate email message they send to everyone, hoping the fact that
 you may recognize the (usually old)&nbsp;password will scare you into paying the ransom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a great scam for the attackers, since the data being used to create the messages is real, it's just typically very old, so in most cases people receiving the messages tell us it was an old, currently unused password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; Just to prove this same basic scam has been around for a while, here's an article on a respected security writer's site that discusses a similar scam from last July, that though some of the text has changed, is basically the same template with some
 relatively minor updates.</p>

    <title>Stop Autocorrect of HSA to HAS in Word and Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stop Autocorrect of HSA to HAS in Word and Excel</h2>
                    <p>How can I stop the correction of HSA to HAS when typing in a cell in Excel (or in Word)?&nbsp; HSA is an abbreviation I use frequently and it is always changed to HAS, with no "stop autocorrect option" as there is when other corrections happen.&nbsp; I looked under
 Proofing options, and while you can add certain categories of things under there, i didn't see where I could add this.</p>
<p>

            It would be best to return it to a Nokia care center and remind them its the 4th time for repair which im sure thy will have a record of this if thats where it has been before

    <title>Restore a mobile device from an ActiveSync 4.5 backup, when main - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve tuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore a mobile device from an ActiveSync 4.5 backup, when main computer running Mobile Device Center 6.1</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I've just had an *interesting* experience restoring my trusty old Dell Axim X50 pocket PC from a backup made around 6 months ago.<br />
<br />
Back then I was running Active Sync 4.5 under Windows XP.&nbsp; It generates an "STG" file which I had put away on a fileserver volume for safekeeping, so I could always get back to a working device image (the X50 has a nasty habit of losing its programs if the
 backup battery is left to go flat).<br />
<br />
Since the backup was made, I'd upgraded my machine to Windows 7.&nbsp; Mobile Device Center recognized the X50 and all was happy.&nbsp; Until I needed to restore.&nbsp; CLANG! note the following gotcha's:<br />
- Windows Mobile Device Center (6.1.6965 according to the About screen) cannot open STG files created from ActiveSync 4.5<br />
- Downloading and installing AS4.5 on Win7, gives a warning saying "this is not compatible"<br />
- WMDC 6.1 <strong>also creates / reads files with extension STG</strong> but they are not compatible.&nbsp; WMDC 6.1 just barfs if you try to open older STG files (it doesn't even suggest what you should do about this).<br />
<br />
Also note:&nbsp; Windows itself does not recognize the extension STG, nor does Microsoft's website - pretty darn hilarious!&nbsp; Look at this:&nbsp; http://shell.windows.com/fileassoc/0409/xml/redir.asp?EXT=stg<br />
<br />
So - beware - your backup images are probably only good with your <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
current</span> version of WMDC 6.1 and desktop OS used for the backup/restore.&nbsp; Don't assume these files have any longevity or usefulness beyond that!<br />
<br />
My workaround is:<br />
- Restore the mobile device on a computer running AS4.5 and Windows XP<br />
- Move the device onto the new computer running WMDC6.1<br />
- Backup immediately to the default folder (which will be something cryptic like C:\Users\Steve\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\ActiveSync\Profiles\c6afb643)<br />
- Copy this file from there, to somewhere with permanent storage e.g. a network volume that gets backed up<br />
<br />
Goes to say, if/when MS bring out any new versions of WMDC, keep the downloaded install files also on the backed up volume, otherwise your backup files may be useless in future.<br />
<br />
This total lack of forward / backwards compatibility is pretty lousy, and is a good reason for not relying on built in backup/restore software in any OS.<br />
<br />
Anyone know any good 3rd party backup software for these?

            Interesting dilemma to run into.&nbsp; In the past when I did backups, I would back up my device to a storage card so I could run it from the card to the device.&nbsp; I have changed what I do with a device and find the need for a total device backup unnecessary
 for my needs.&nbsp; As long as I have my files on a storage card, I am secure.&nbsp; That said, if I were going to backup, I would use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spritesoftware.com/products/sprite-backup/full-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Sprite Backup</span></a>&nbsp;or
<a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/products/backup/?en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Spb backup</span></a>.&nbsp; Both&nbsp;are outstanding solutions for FULL device backups.

<h2>            Cannot download movies</h2>
                    Thought I'd test out the video store for downloading videos onto my Surface Pro 2. New device, nothing in the libraries, purchased a movie, hit the download button, immediate error 0xc10100dd. Saw other threads where it suggests deleting and restoring
 libraries - nothing in mine. This isn't a good advertisement for Microsoft devices when competing with Itunes, google play and Amazon Kindle - they all work!! Love the Surface though.

<p>
</p><p>What they had me do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to file explorer, select libraries and delete the folders such as music, video documents and so on.&nbsp; This won't delete the files.&nbsp; The right click on library again and select restore default folders.&nbsp; Then I tried to download again.&nbsp; Worked perfect.</p>

            <p>Hello Roger_106:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having completing a movie download from the marketplace.&nbsp; We certainly agree that this is not the experience we expect you to have and this is not normal.&nbsp; Below you will find some suggestions
 of things to try and some questions regarding your experience.&nbsp; We hope to get to the bottom of this and allow you to successfully download movies to your Surface 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing I would like to suggest you do is create a local profile on your computer.&nbsp; This can be done by opening your charm bar, selecting settings &gt; change PC settings &gt; accounts &gt; other accounts &gt; add an account &gt; sign in without a Microsoft account
 &gt; local account.&nbsp; Once you create this other account, reboot your Surface and sign in with this account.&nbsp; Upon reboot go to the Xbox Video application and sign in, you will find this option in the upper right corner.&nbsp; Once you tap this look for the link related
 to signing into each account separately and sign in with your primary Microsoft account.&nbsp; Try to download the file again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I would be interested to know if you can both take videos on the Surface and transfer videos from another device to your Surface.&nbsp; These videos should be saved to your Windows video library.&nbsp; Once you find videos in this area, try and play them
 both directly through Xbox Video and via File Explorer.&nbsp; I would be interested to know if you have any issues saving, syncing or playing the videos.&nbsp; If you have a video currently stored on SkyDrive, please attempt to download this video to your Surface and
 again report if anything odd happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you continue to get the same download error it looks as if there is some issue with the file being written to your Surface.&nbsp; This could indicate some corruption in the library or on the storage drives.&nbsp; I have seen at least one other user resolve this
 by performing a factory reset of their device.&nbsp; I would suggest you consult your user manual or Surface support for more information on this process and steps to ensure you are backed up.&nbsp; You should be able to initiate contact with Surface support from here,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us/?productId=100110886&amp;issueId=100110940&amp;subIssueId=100110941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us/?productId=100110886&amp;issueId=100110940&amp;subIssueId=100110941</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few additional questions we have are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>What OS is running on your Surface 2: 8.0 or 8.1?</li><li>What is the word for word error message that&nbsp;comes along with the error code you are receiving?</li><li>Do you have the&nbsp;Zune software installed and have you attempted to download this&nbsp;video via the Zune software?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you soon and getting this resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We usually get the http 404 error whenever someone asks for a page that’s simply not available on your site. The reason for this is that there may be a link on your site that was wrong or the page might have been recently removed
 from the site. As there is no web page to display, the web server sends a page that says "http 404 error”. It may also occur due to malware/spyware or browser hijacking.</span></p>

<h2>            Granting a 365 User  access to OneDrive Admin Center</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a request from a user in regards to a user that wants access to OneDrive admin center. Which looks like the below:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be6fd009-ecd9-4842-9f6c-2b4c8e6c6e87?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be6fd009-ecd9-4842-9f6c-2b4c8e6c6e87?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>However when I go their 365 admin portal I didn't see that under any of the listed user roles that I can assign to them. How would I go about granting them access to only OneDrive admin center without granting them too many permissions?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d406b7db-9a25-4c4b-a8b2-93de923028de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d406b7db-9a25-4c4b-a8b2-93de923028de?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p><span>For users to access the OneDrive admin center, you need to grant them the SharePoint administrator role or the global administrator role.</span></p>

                    <p>After solving the problem of nonresponse/not opening at all, reinstalling the entire office 2016 package, and fixing the “you cannot save while the file is in use by another process…” error message, I am now receiving the error message “Undo edit button
 not found” every time I click anywhere on a document (no matter what I’m doing). Once I click okay, I get the error message “insert citation button not found”. This is occurring on a MacBook running High Sierra. I have had to delete the Normal.dotm file, the
 com.microsoft.Office365.plist, and the AutoRecovery folder to fix the “file in use by another process” problem but the “not found” error messages were appearing prior to that.&nbsp;</p>

            This is generally a result of some add-in / plug-in. Please review the add-ins / plug-ins installed in your Word and disable them. You can enable them one by one to identify if anything is causing a problem.

<p>Hello tyamar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. But regarding your above mentioned description, <strong>
it is not possible</strong> to create flag rule in <strong>after</strong> I send the message which you have want. Because
<strong>it is by design</strong> rules options in Manage Rules &amp; Alert. So, as per my practice we cannot create flag rule for myself sending in after I send message option. But as a workaround we can manually mark flag from “<strong>Follow up</strong>” option
 Under <strong>Home</strong> Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I understand your concern and dissatisfaction. It cannot meet your requirements. Therefore, I'd like to suggest you to share your idea via
<strong>UserVoice service</strong> <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Getting error message &#34;Sync Failed&#39; but no idea why....help please&#33;</h2>
                    Hoping you all can help me. I am new to Windows Mobile Device Center (have previously used ActiveSync as I had Windows XP on my old computer). I have a new laptop with Vista and was told I need to use this new program as ActiveSync is not compatible with
 Vista. I have no idea where to go with troubleshooiting issues so I am hoping someone can help me out.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I set up a partnership yesterday, synced, and all went well. Today, I can't get it to sync! I get the error message above but with no real details as to what went wrong. When I click on "1 error" it does say that "SplashID Sync: Attention needed" (which is
 a program I have on my PPC), but does that just mean that info in that one program did not sync or that the whole sync was aborted?<br />
<br />
How can you get to the bottom of syncing errors with this program?<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for any help you can provide!

<br />
OK, just syned again, same error message, then went to tried to follow the steps you mentioned to get to the Event Viewer and I got a window that popped up saying "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions
 to access them". I got this message right after I chose, Start-Computer-Manage (that is as far as I got).
<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

<p>Hi Chidiebube,<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably the <strong>Region</strong> settings is not set correctly on your phone. To check, just go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Language+region &gt; Country/Region</strong>. Just to verify, how did you reset your phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>

                    Hi All,<br />

I Have just tried to connect my wife's new nokia 6120 classic to her HP tablet 1100 via bluetooth, but get the following error:<br />
<br />
"Cannot use the connection type. Check that all the needed hardware, software and other drivers are available."<br />
<br />
On the phone I have turned bluetooth on, with visibility shown to all selected.<br />
<br />
PC Details are:<br />
XP Tablet edition 2005 SP2<br />
Nokkia 6120 classic<br />
PC Suite v6.85.12.0<br />

            Try this: Uninstall PCSuites, afterwhich use the PCSuites cleaner to clean up fragments in windows registry. Download the latest PcSuites for your phone model. Disable any firewall/anti-virus(somehow interfer in proper loading of drivers) temporarily during
 installation &amp; don't connect the cable untill told to do so. Check also in systems if there are two bluetooth drivers installed for sometimes the driver of microsoft is loaded also.

PC cleaner would not work with my version of pc suite.<br />
But a simple uninstall and reinstall did the trick.<br />

All Good.<br />
