<h2>            Internet explorer is not working. but firefox is.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a windows vista.</p>
<p>the internet explorer says I'm not connected to the internet when i am.<br />
then it tells me to change my proxy.. but&nbsp; don't know any vista proxies.</p>
<p>firefox is working perfectly. and so s my ipod if i want to use the internet off that</p>
<p>but because the internet explorer is my default one or something, the itunes store on my computer doesn't work, and i can't sync my new ipod with all the music, videos, photos and/or apps already on my computer :(</p>
<p>i dont know if this has anything to do with it or not.. but my windows update doesn't work either</p>
<p>i have AVG security. Spybot security, and whatever came with windows vista.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft SmartScreen classified this message as junk</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the problem that I am sending a mail to someone I know from my own domain/mailserver. This person owns an account under @live.nl and I wasn't getting an replies to my messages. So I sent a test mail to my own @live.nl account and I found out&nbsp; Microsoft
 Smartscreen classified it as junk and arrives in the spam folder. I haven't had any other big mail providers do this to my mail. I did some searching and found this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://mail.live.com/mail/troubleshooting.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>So seems like ms wants you to have an SPF record for the domain sending mail. I set the record up and 24 hours later still the same problem. I then made an alias on my domain: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** sent an email to a hotmail address, and it arrived in the
 inbox. So it seems like smartscreen filters/screens on the account name in the email address? Does anyone have any idea of how to fix this problem?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also came across this link:&nbsp; https://mail.live.com/mail/policies.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like ms also requires dkim, so I setup dkim, and my messages are still being marked as spam by smartscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>Seems like&nbsp; hotmail is not seeing my spf</p>
<p>
</p><p>Authentication-Results: hotmail.com; spf=temperror</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the website&nbsp; this is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.openspf.org/FAQ/Hotmail_and_TempError</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried mailing the email adress mentioned there but mail doesn't arrive: access denied. Will just have to try and wait for ms to update. I'll just wait till they refresh their dns cache, since I get a pass with gmail. The other problem is probably this:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p>dkim=none</p><p /><p>Will recheck my dkim setup.</p></pre>

            funny thing is when I create an alias *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and send it to a hotmail adress it arrives in the inbox with the same failed spf and dkim headers. So something else in the smart screen is causing&nbsp; my messages to be delivered to the spam folder.
 Any ideas?

            <p>I got reply from outlook support, and basically they're saying not our problem, and giving me the finger. Saying that smartscreen filtered my message to the spam folder based on: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/SmartScreen-Filter-frequently-asked-questions-IE9
 . However there's literally no information on why smartscreen filters messages to the spam folder. And they pointed out a few other things: Brand your mail, so that you can clearly see where the mail comes from(You can clearly see it's from my domain/mailserver),
 follow content and format best practices(I&nbsp; send plain text mails, and sometimes with attachments to people I correspond with), Highlight Opt in, ensure your email lists are up to date( Those don't apply to me) because I'm not a company just one person, running
 my own mailserver for correspondence with people I know and for companies that need to contact me. And lastly to join the programs to improve mail filter: JMRP and SNDS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They didn't even&nbsp; reply on my comment about when I setup a hotmail alias under my domain and send from there that it arrives in the inbox while having the same headers when getting sent from any other account under my domain. I think it's the worst customer
 support I've had to deal with in a while. With google,protonmail, and yahoo, I don't have this problem and with&nbsp; companies I correspond with for personal stuff I don't have this problem either. The only mail provider giving me **** is outlook(ms). I could
 understand it if I had the same problem with google and yahoo. But I only have this with outlook.com/hotmail.com, so it's not a problem on my side, and they are not willing to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually quite done with ms, the part where they didn't even comment on my findings but only what I should look at and didn't actually tell me what the problem was so I could work on my side on the problem. And their response was more robotic than human,
 cuz 0 response to any of my comments or questions in my email to them.</p>

            <p>I have very similar issue except Microsoft so called SmartScreen is blocking ALL email from my domain ..... I can send an email from my connection using a different domain and my email is delivered to my inbox, switch back to my other domain and the message
 is "accepted for delivery" but doesn't arrive in mailbox at all (not even in junk).</p>
<p>Now, this might not be a problem for me but, the domain is used by a hotel and so, because of this stupid "Smart"Screen, they cannot email ANY of their Hotmail, live or Outlook.com customers.</p>
<p>We have no problems with other mail providers (Yahoo, gmail etc), we have SPF, PTR, A records set up, we send marketing emails from a totally different domain name&nbsp;from a totally separate IP range from the hotel's day-to-day email. I've joined this JMRP
 and SNDS system but have received nothing from it and it actually show the IPs as OK!</p>
<p>All I get back is the standard Microsoft bull about this Smart Screen ..... well, I'm sorry Microsoft, it isn't that smart and wide open to abuse. I can quite accept INDIVIDUALS having a preference and marking emails as JUNK BUT, what is not acceptable is
 for you to block an entire domain based on someone's idea of JUNK or, more likely someone's 'practical joke' marking emails as JUNK when they're not.</p>
<p>I'd really like to get an answer from someone at Microsoft to resolve this but all the message I get from them I can't reply to !</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe I should start blocking Hotmail etc. addresses on the servers I control and bounce back a message saying 'If Microsoft won't accept email from our domains then we won't accept email from their customers !" .... ooh, if only .....</p>

            I guess that's a good idea to block all messages from hotmail/outlook and I'm planning to do so. And I suggest anyone who is treated unfairly by MS do it too. We need to show that we don't care/welcome MS at all!&nbsp;

I completely agree especially because many titles and special sales are not compatible with movies anywhere I bought Stephen King's Salem's Lot and had to watch it on my pc

            It's a real bummer that there's no app for this service on Roku. I have to watch any movie from this service on my Xbox where the audio is gimped. MS would get more of my business if this app was available on Roku.&nbsp;

<h2>            MSCOMCT2.OCX file affected by Windows updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have developed a number of excel spreadsheets for our school district over the years.&nbsp; Several of them include a Date Picker feature.&nbsp; Every so often it seems that a Windows update will kill that file and our IT department has to go into every affected
 computer and restore the file.&nbsp; We used to instruct users how to do this themselves.&nbsp; However, now our IT department has to execute the procedure under Administrator rights.&nbsp; This is causing that team to spend too much time fixing this issue.&nbsp; I know they
 would love for me to remove the Date Picker feature altogether to avoid them having to do this extra work all the time.&nbsp; But, that feature is an essential part of several key company forms, and surely Microsoft can resolve this continuing issue somehow.&nbsp; I
 know this affects many other users around the world.&nbsp; Date Picker needs to be a part of the Excel program.&nbsp; We should not be forced to abandon it and opt for a 3rd party add-on which would have its own risks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please get to the bottom of the issues surrounding Date Picker and stop killing this feature with future Windows updates?&nbsp; Excel is a powerful program and I have been using it for many years.&nbsp; Please realize that this feature is very important
 to many of us in the field who rely on Excel to produce company-wide forms which have to work on many end-users' computers.&nbsp; Having to repeatedly go into each computer to reload the MCCOMCT2.OCX file as an administrator is creating a hardship on our company.&nbsp;
 I look forward to hearing back from you with positive news about what Microsoft intends to do about this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p>This 32 bit system file is dead in the water and while it will still work if re-installed manually it won't work with the 64 bit version of Excel. It is time to consider a replacement date picker for your projects, and there are various date pickers that
 work well. </p>

<h2>            Conditional Highlighting</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm relatively new to using Excel and I'm making a spreadsheet tracking profit/loss etc. &nbsp;I'm trying to add conditional highlighting to my columns however when I try to add the rule of highlighting cells greater than a value greater than 0 Excel then
 highlights everything with some form of input, including blank cells with formula. &nbsp;I just simply want it to highlight red/green according to profit/loss but it even highlights cells with text?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any suggestions</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<br />Excel‚Äôs Conditional Formatting tool is diverse with loads of built in rules that you simply point and click to use, but I find more often than not that I need to use a formula based rule. I can sympathise if you‚Äôve ever tried to use formulas in your conditional formatting and ended up tearing your hair out in frustration. Thankfully there are only 3 simple rules you need to know. Once you understand these rules you‚Äôll never look back.
<br />
<br />5 Excel Conditional Formatting Basics <a href="http://chandoo.org/wp/2009/03/13/excel-conditional-formatting-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://chandoo.org/wp/2009/03/13/excel-conditio...</a>
<br />Conditional formatting is your way of telling excel to format all the cells that meet a criteria in a certain way. For eg. you can use conditional formatting to change the font color of all cells with negative values or change background color of cells with duplicate values..
<br />
<br />Add, change, find, or clear conditional formats in Excel <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-change-find-or-clear-conditional-formats-in-Excel-5f474dfd-17b6-4645-a10b-f3d3824c7c52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-ch...</a> 
<br />Use a conditional format to help you visually explore and analyze data, detect critical issues, and identify patterns and trends: 
<br />    Format cells using a two-color scale	    Format cells using a three-color scale
<br />    Format cells using data bars	    Format all cells using an icon set
<br />    Format only cells that contain text, number, or date or time values
<br />    Format only top or bottom ranked values	    Format only unique or duplicate values
<br />    Format only values that are above or below average
<br />    Use a formula to determine which cells to format	    Find cells that have conditional formats
<br />    Change conditional formats	    Clear conditional formats

<p>Yes, I selected the column i wanted to apply it to. &nbsp;For example -&nbsp;</p>
<p>I‚Äôve selected the whole column and applied the rule to highlight cells when the cell value is greater than 0 however this then equates to excel highlighting pretty much the whole colum including the heading row, and any blank cells that contain formula rather
 than just the numerical cells that contain a value greater than 0?</p>

            OK, cool. Up until now, when I did conditional formatting the data has been all one type. But I see the same thing you did. If I checked for a &gt; value it treated all letters a &gt; anything.
<br />
<br />I came up with this formula. With my data in column c I tested and developed this formula in D
<br />
<br />=IF(ISNUMBER(C1),(IF(C1&gt;1,TRUE,FALSE)),FALSE)
<br />
<br />Then following the instructions in this tip:
<br /><a href="https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/excel-conditional-formatting-with-formulas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/excel-condi...</a>
<br />
<br />I pasted that formula into my conditional formatting test.  It now only highlights cells containing numbers &gt; 0.  You can change the "0" to whatever
<br />
<br />Is this what you are looking for.
<br />
<br />************* Bonus Points ****************
<br />
<br />If you want to use a slightly fancier function try converting to =IF(and( ... ))
<br />(I wasn't able to get that syntax to work.

<p>There is seldom, if ever, need to use IF in a Conditional Formatting dialog.</p>
<p>All that is needed is a formula that returns either TRUE or FALSE</p>
<p>In the present case =AND(ISNUMBER(C1), C1&gt;0) will do the trick</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 &#40;15.37.0&#41; - &#34;Add Attachment&#34; Keyboard Shortcut Removed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can someone confirm that Microsoft removed the keyboard shortcut to insert an attachment to an open new message? It used to be Command-E. It worked until one of the recent updates. Now when I type that, it just centers the line of text I'm on. Their help
 docs still list it as of 2017-08-15 (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-for-Outlook-for-Mac-07ae68c8-b7af-4010-b225-324c04ac7335). The shortcut also isn't shown in the "Attachments" menu under "Drafts" (which wasn't that "Message"
 previously?), which makes me think it was removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did they actually remove it or has it changed? I completely rely on keyboard shortcuts to get through my email. I'm really hoping I'm just missing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Based on my test, this Shortcut works fine in Outlook 15.37 version. Could you please share the detailed version such as 15.37.170815. If your version is different from this, please try updating the Outlook client again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Help &gt; Check for updates &gt; tick manually check &gt; check for updates.</p>

<p>Alison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's stranger than I first thought. I upgraded to Outlook version 15.73.170815. When I relaunched Outlook, the shortcut was working. However, after a few hours, I started to experience the same behavior (no longer adding attachments but centering text
 in the message).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems every time I restart Outlook, the shortcut works as expected, but at some point stops working. I'm not quite sure what causes that behavior; I haven't noticed any consistency. Sometimes the shortcut stops working after 5 minutes, sometimes after
 a few hours. When I restart Outlook, the shortcut works again for some amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            <p>Hotmail does not allow you to directly download messages.</p>
<p>As a workaround, if you are really interested in doing this, get a desktop email program like Thunderbird or Windows Live Mail and connect it to your hotmail account (your old messages will be downloaded but you'll need to change a setting to make sure the
 program doesn't delete them from hotmail).</p>
<p>You don't really need to back up your email messages, because Microsoft takes care of that for you.</p>

            <p>Yes it is - Excel stores your personal macro workbook in a directory called XLSTART. On my laptop (running Win 7), the file can be found under:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my previous laptop (running Win NT), it was something like</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- the exact location of this will depend on your system set up so you may have to search around for it. Also, the AppData folder is hidden by default, so you may have to change the view settings to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've located the folder, you'll find a PERSONAL.xlsb file, which you can then copy and paste onto another PC in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any files added to this folder will auto-start when you open Excel.</p>

<p>Hello~</p>
<p>I've tried the proposed solution of outlook.exe /resetnavpane - as suggested - on my Windows XP machine, but this does not seem to fix the problem of Outlook not starting.&nbsp; I receive an error message of 'The command line argument is not valid.&nbsp; Verify the
 switch you are using'.</p>
<p>Are any other suggestions available for this issue?&nbsp;(the issue seemed to suddenly appear without a warranted reason)</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            There isn't a way you can download your text messages from My Phone directly to your computer.<br />
<br />
I think the knowlegebase article is pretty clear about your options.&nbsp; If you can't sync them all back to your phone and then sync them to your computer, you'll either have to wait
<br />
<ol>
<li>until Microsoft migrates your text messages to your SkyDrive account...then you can download the text messages (probably one-by-one) to your computer OR
<br />
</li><li>until October and request that Microsoft send you a DVD or CD of all the data that is stored on My Phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ol>

Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. Your Lumia 540 should be compatible to most selfie sticks available in your local and online shops.

            Have you checked if there is a firmware update available for your phone mate? You can upgrade via Nokia Suite on your PC if there is such an update available. The latest firmware version is 5.92 as stated here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/93D2277A-7FF4-4158-BA6B-6F7A2D29EAEC">
http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Software-Updates/New-software-update-available-for-Asha-311-version-5-92/td-p/1615156</a><br />
<br />
<br />
If there is no option still, you can always leave feedback with Nokia directly by clicking the Nokia Support link at the bottom of this page.

            When I got nokia Asha 311, I think it is one of the better......only for brightness problem, demo game, some build in music-video files, low quality camera, bad battery performance etc. I dislike this mobile. Other functions are so-so. Please at least
 make a app for adjust brightness.

<p>I'm sorry to say, but it seems quite unlikely that the brightness control would be added to Asha 311 at this point. One reason for this is that Asha 311 has ambient light sensor, which is supposed to adjust the display brightness automatically. I agree that
 it is not optimal for low-light usage situations especially, but this is the situation where we are at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you have trouble with this feature, you could consider looking at e.g. Asha 308/309/310 or the new Asha 501. Those phone models have the manual brightness control functionality included.&nbsp;</p>

            Armagon at least Nokia can fix the ambient light sensor? or do something !? Because this is really bad for the eyes of every Asha 311 user... :|

            <span>Hi, too. I have the same problem with the German Excel Mobile (Windows Mobile Prof 6.1, running on o2 Diamond Touch).<br />
Instead of the German command =SUMME(A1:A2) I'm getting =SUM(A1:A2), too. This leads to the formula error.<br />
I guess it could be fixed if the officeres.dll.XXXX.mui file could be changed. XXXX is a number referring to the language. In German the file is named officeres.dll0407.mui, in Norway the number might be 0414.<br />
In the mui-file there is a string table 943 with the =SUM( command. I guess if someone from MS would/could change this value (I'm not able to change, maybe it's even illegal to change due to copyright laws) and provide the new file the problem would be fixed.<br />
Thanks and best regards<br />
Marco<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;a)We don't have any idea or status of updating process so just wait till it is loaded in app list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;b) If you move your mp3 songs to a different folder&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fa.gfx.ms%2femoji_1F4C1.png" height="19" width="19" /><span>&nbsp;either via file app or PC, your music app won't list them in
 songs category. Even if it lists all, its shows "error in playing" message and at the same time third party app plays the same mp3 with no problems.</span><br />

<span>It takes lot of time to get all files detected in app. The situation is pathetic when you know your files are&nbsp; in SD card but your default music app couldn't detect it just because you have done a rename/move operation for better file management.in
 this scenario, If you go to mp3s via files app you can play it but your default mp3 app can't do it.even if lists all files,don't be happy</span><span>&nbsp;because it shows an error message while you try to play for long time. Music app will detect and
 be able to play all the files in your SD card only after so much time.The third party music app will definitely play without these issues. But your default app can't do it. Really irritating to see your files are not getting detected in app just because you
 have done a move/copy/paste operation.</span></p>

<span>2.<strong><span>Ringtone:-&nbsp;</span></strong>After denim update it is found that if you rename your ringtone file, then in settings when you search for that custom ringtone it will be missing. Means you have to perform the ringtone
 creation again via ringtone app. If you copy paste some tones to ringtone folder, it's is not getting updated quickly under setting. You have to keep on checking whether it is listed in setting or not to make your ringtone. As no status of updating status
 shown, the only option left is to wait and continue check your setting custom ringtone list for your newly added/renamed ringtone till it is listed.</span><br />

 give you an option to "save/don't save" option.Save is triggered when you exit the app.So when you type so many letters and wish don't want to save those in the existing notes,You are not allowed to do that.Once you type,it is saved.So you have to delete all
 those unwanted letters from note</span><span>.same is that when you delete some letters and think not to save,you are unable to do.you are forced by app to save the changes which you don't want.So is it a smartphone?If any solution to this please

 is going but the attachments is missing. How can i forward the mail with an attachment?</span></p>
<p><span>Pls tell me y should i download an attachment if not necessary for a simple forward process.</span><span>Its not at all logical and it simply consume your time and data usage.</span><span><span>If you received
 an attachment of 5MB which you need to forward to another person.Here i&nbsp;don't&nbsp;prefer download the content, i simply hit forward bcz this is a&nbsp;simple basic feature any mail system have and all people are used to it.so phone called "Smart Phone"should be be
 able to do this very basic feature.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>It works well in IE and UC Browser etc.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>The question is why OS is putting so much restrictions for users and also on developers?</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Please help me. I installed a new application and I was asked to restart the device but start up failed and ask me to contact the retailer. Your help is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Oh my God,</p>
<p>That's wierd. It's Ok now. So, here is the solution:</p>
<p>1. Reset your device by pressing 'green', &nbsp;'red', 'camera'&nbsp;and 'power' tell you see nokia logo.</p>
<p>2. Take off SIM card and start it up.</p>
<p>3. If it&nbsp;works probably reset it to Factory features.</p>
<p>4. Put SIM then start and if ask you to work offline press yes</p>
<p>5. When it starts normally then go online by choosing General from profiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Enjoy Nokia!&nbsp;</p>
