<h2>            Dragging windows by the titlebar no longer works as expected after April 2018 update</h2>
                    <p>I use both the Home and Professional version of Win10 64-bit&nbsp;on two different PCs. After the recent April update, I often try to drag windows by the titlebar and end up resizing them. Previously, the mouse cursor changed to the resize cursor when pointing
 at the exact border of a window, and only then. This is still the case for the left, right and lower borders. But at the top, the cursor now changes 9 pixels below the border, in the upper third of the titlebar. I've illustrated this below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17a85db0-15f3-4d22-88f9-15b5785c5914?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17a85db0-15f3-4d22-88f9-15b5785c5914?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This may seem like a small issue, but I work with multiple monitors and have to drag and drop windows all the time. This is quite a hassle when it happens 20 times a day, and it really impacts my workflow. It's especially bothersome since some system apps,
 such as the Settings window, no longer have a distinguishable, colored&nbsp;titlebar (see above). The entire window is white, so there is no telling where the lowest possible point for grabbing and dragging might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that, many applications still exhibit the previous behavior. E.g., Office 2010, Photoshop CS6, the Maxthon browser etc. So the titlebar behavior is no longer consistent throughout the OS. I realize that the change may have been implemented to make
 things easier for touchscreen users, but I don't use a mobile device and would very much like to change this back the way it used to be since the days of Win 95. Is this possible? I'm not afraid of editing the registry :)</p>

            Hey Tastentier,
<br />
<br />This happens to me too on some windows, I knew something was off when I tried to resize things. Unfortunately, I don't think there could be a registry entry or other form of settings you can change to deal with this. Maybe you could send your feedback over to the Feedback Hub and tell them all about it, just hit Windows key + F and file a suggestion, or bug if you believe it is so. If you could provide a link to your newly made suggestion, I'd be happy to upvote it in your favor!
<br />
<br />Hope that helps at least a little bit. Also, great illustration in the image you've sent!

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>The game has been hailed by me as "not very exciting" and "not gonna last very long".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's too bad they couldn't have focussed their efforts and come up with a full on retail title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The premise is an excellent one but all the in game footage I've seen so far smacks of "disposable".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope it bucks the trend though and ends up being really good but I'm not getting my hopes up.</p>

<p>The beta was ace fun.</p>
<p>Don't really mind the delay although it's gonna drop it in amongst a whole bunch of retail titles out in Feb... still, day one purchase for me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I'd say graphically it's similar to Team Fortress, but gameplay-wise it's got more in common with Shadowrun.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the

<h2>            Skype for iPad</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using skype on an ipad air 2 and the latest update (8.43.0.53) moved the chat window from the left side to the right side, thereby covering the 'me' image (pinned at the upper-right)and making it impossible to see that I'm in view. I need the chat window
 open as the other person is mute and can see and hear me clearly. In an attempt to compensate, I tried moving the 'me' picture to the left side, but the image snaps back to the upper-left (and hidden behind the open chat window). Split screen sort of works,
 but I don't need nor do I care for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

    <title>Owned Games size information - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alliance blue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Owned Games size information</h2>
                    <p>When i look at my owned games list i noticed that i can sort by size and it tells me the gb of each of the games i have installed but not the games i own that are not installed , as i can't afford an external drive i keep having to uninstall and re-install
 games due to hard drive space ( this is not the issue ) .... The issue i have is that when it comes to me re-installing games it is a pain as i have to keep going back to the tiny tiny print on the games case or into the store to find out what gb each game
 is , it would be a great feature if i could check my uninstalled games list and get the gb of each game there ...... In other words i think we should get the sort by size option for both installed AND un-installed games . It would be great to get the information
 needed at a glance .....&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there Alliance Blue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the issue you are facing, So it's basicly having the sort by size issue not appearing on the non installed ones making harder for you to manage without external, Sadly this might be a post for
<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uservoice</a>to be added on later on xbox, But in til then I suggest trying to copy all that info you have on current size of games to note pad to try and help manage it better til then
 :)&nbsp;</p>

            Only possible downside I can see is that with the constantly updating nature of games it'd be tricky to set up, but it is a great shout, even for those of us with external HD's it's a pain to know which games take up most space!

            still be quite hard as it means more info needs to be provided to xbox&nbsp;for adding in update&nbsp;file sizes as games always have new updates which are included in many games that have been out for a while

<p>I think this is a great idea, not because I don't have space.&nbsp; More if im lining up a game with friends and I think about getting them to DL something (maybe off gamepass) I don't want to be waiting for a 50+ GB game to come down to play - so id suggest

<h2>            can&#39;t use photo viewer as default viewer anymore &#40;win 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
hi, I always used the photo viewer as the default viewer for all types of images. windows photos is garbage, i mean, using the scroll wheel for switching to the next image instead of zooming? button to see the image's original size hidden in a menu?? what in
 heaven? not to mention that Photos is way slower than the previous photo viewer, and they do basically the same thing, how is that?</p>
<p>
anyways, the point is that every time I had a clean install of windows, I did the same thing, that registry entry trick to re enable photo viewer, and then opening an image as... and selecting photo viewer as default for that kind of file. but now it doesn't
 work anymore, only programs like paint 3d and what not will be allowed as the default viewer for images, photo viewer doesn't work anymore. I can open the images with it, just not open with it by default. what the heck?</p>

            Hi there rafael_adamy, Im sorry to say buy Microsoft disabled and hit Photo viewer. The only way to get it back is trough non-microsoft approved downloads and registry fixes which are very dangerous considering you have to allow a third party download change values.

            Hi Rafael, that registry fix you are using is totally save, please disregard the answer above . . .
<br />
<br />Setting File Associations in Windows 10 is now impossible, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, hopefully this is one of the bugs they are working on
<br />
<br />Please provide feedback to the Windows Developers on this bug, press Windows Key + F to open the Feedback Hub, the more users that report this, the quicker it will be resolved . . .

<h3> lawlorz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Windows Store app&#47;game installs between installations of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Looking to see if there is any way to move a Windows Store app or game from one Windows 10 installation to another without the need to redownload it again. Both Windows installations are using the same Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game in question is Forza Horizon 3. It is a 54gb download, and I have very slow internet, so it takes me 2 days to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to achieve is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have a current Windows 10 installation on 1 hard drive - purchased a new hard drive and installing a fresh copy of Windows 10 on it, intention to format the drive with the existing Windows installation on it.</p>
<p>2. Wanting to transfer Forza Horizon 3 to the new hard drive and Windows installation without needing to download the game again as it takes too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to access the installation of the game from the new Windows installation - locked out due to permissions - changed the permissions so the files are visible - can't run the exe.</p>
<p>Have tried to install the game through the Windows Store on the new Windows installation - pointing it to install to the same location as the current install of the game - it either errors on download or deletes the existing copy to download it fresh (imaged
 the disk to restore it to try multiple options).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of anyway to get the new windows installation to see that the game is already installed and get it working on the new copy of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could always just image my current Windows installation onto my new disk, but I'd rather start fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><em>"I could always just image my current Windows installation onto my new disk, but I'd rather start fresh."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only way to guarantee all games will run. Is your Win10 causing any more grief than Windows would in the</p>
<p>normal course of events ?</p>
<p>I've toyed with the idea of trying a clean install vs my upgrade from a Win7 I installed in 2010, which I've already cloned and</p>
<p>transferred (with new licence key) to two new machines. But can't be bothered. Games run as well as they should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I am missing any performance it would be minuscule, and hey! I have close to 200 games plus software to stuff around with after.
</p>
<p>Even if my Windows SSD melted, or the Windows install was totally borked by a malware, I would still have to be dragged
</p>
<p>kicking and screaming to reinstall everything 'clean'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you trawl the Registry on your original Windows you can find and Export the relevant Registry keys and Merge them</p>
<p>back to the clean Win10 install.&nbsp; Most game keys are easy enough to find, either by publisher, or game title.
</p>
<p>- However, when dealing with a client software there may be other keys that are not so easy to find.</p>
<p>There could also be files in Documents\AppData Local or Roaming. Also check the three Program folders in C:\.</p>
<p>- Then again... Being as the Store is MS, anything goes. MS tends to work in mysterious ways. If there is a</p>
<p>forum on the stores site you may find better suggestions there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>... Windows Store. Never used it so I don't know how their client works. Have you reinstalled stores client software,
</p>
<p>or run any options it may have, such as Steams '<em>verify integrity of game files</em>' tool ?</p>
<p>- You could try changing the name of the folder the game was first installed to and restart the download.
</p>
<p>Then change the name of the original folder back shortly after a couple hundred MB's, and move any new files from the
</p>
<p>new folder to the old (overwrite if prompted).</p>

    <title>Error 1068&#58; The dependency service or group failed to start&#34;. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenna544  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1068&#58; The dependency service or group failed to start&#34;. Windows firewall off and unable to turn on. Now McAffee firewall can&#39;t turn on either. Please HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have McAffee and saw a message saying my Firewall settings needed attention. I clicked to open McAffee security center and it said my firewall was turned off. Click on and would stay "on" for about a half a second. After several attempts, I contacted online
 support through McAffee and had someone use remote access to try and turn it on in McAffee. The person helping me said she was unable to turn the McAffee firewall on because Windows firewall would not turn on either. I watched her do this and then tried contacting
 Windows via my computers manufacturers website. I have an Acer Aspire netbook and found out my warranty was up in April so they wanted to charge me over $100 to "answer" my question. I came here to search for an answer and tried some of the things suggested
 to others who couldn't turn their Windows firewall on. </p>
<p>I get the message "Windows could not start the Windows firewall service on Local Computer. Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start". Please HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to resolve the issue and then find some insight about HOW this happened when we an active (purchased) subscription to McAffee internet secutiry and we STILL wind up with computer (virus?) issues. I just recently noticed the firewall in McAffee off
 and within 1-2 days learned that the Windows firewall was also off and I was unable to turn back on. I have noticed when I search in Google and click on a link I get redirected to random pages that display links completely irrelevant to my search terms. I
 just want this resolved before further issues arise because of the firewall issues. (Very worried over here...)</p>

    <title>Touch pad turn screen off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jxqwu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch pad turn screen off</h2>
                    I have a Surface 3 with window 8.1, where touch pad is set up as automatically turned off when other mouse is&nbsp;connected.&nbsp; Whenever I use touch pad though, the screen&nbsp;will be&nbsp;turned off half second when I leave the pad. But it is fine when I use a plug
 in mouse or a blue-tooth mouse (touch pad is supposedly turned off).&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Power option?&nbsp;Touch pad driver?&nbsp;Thanks!

                    I was drawing on paint last night and saved twice to make sure it saved. Then I moved it onto my flashdrive to keep it safe. I checked this morning, and my work isn't there. :/ I definitely saved it. Is there a way to get my work back?

<p>
</p><p>1. Have you try to connect the flash drive to a different computer? </p>
<p>2. When you say 'pictures', do you mean pictures from library folder? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is already saved and was deleted by accidently, then the file would be in Recycle bin, you can restore the document from the Recycle bin.

<p>Ok. So last night, I was playing my brother and then my nephew on Madden 13. Everytime I tried, the game would kick me out. This was very, very frustating. So I quit playing, inserted NBA2k13 and played online for a few hours...no problems.&nbsp;Then, I watched
 a few videos online with no lag on my blu-ray player...no problems. Wanted to play Madden again so I disconnected my internet, even though I knew this wasn't the problem, to make sure I was ok. Back online with Madden and it kicked me out again. My nephew
 told me that it was saying on his end that I was "removed due to excessive grievance." I have no network problems and I do not cheat. What else could be the problem beside EA sports and Madden sucking?</p>

<p>When you say you "disconnected your internet", do you mean the you did the network equipment restart steps that are in Solution 1 on our support page for

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, could you do a network bandwidth test on a computer connected to your network the same way as your Xbox 360 (wired or wireless) at
<a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">speedtest.net</a> and share the results with us here?<br />

<h3> heroicdefect174  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games missing from download&#47;purchase history&#33; Help&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was 14 when I bought my first Xbox 360, I had my mothers credit card linked to my profile to buy digital copies of games. I bought many games throughout my teen years, whether it was with a points card or the credit card. I sold my Xbox to a family with nothing after years of enjoying it myself. Cleared it completely. Didn't touch another Xbox for about 2 years. I AM 22 NOW. I BOUGHT 2 USED XBOX 360'S THIS YEAR. So I thought I would go back to my download/ Purchase history to get some games put on my new systems. Lone behold, I am missing more than half of my games. They are not in either my download or purchase history. But my purchasing dates back to 2011. The games I purchased with my mothers credit card are ALL MISSING. This was devastating to me of course, as a young teenager I always had to work and save my money to either pay my mom or buy point cards. So I go to check my achievements which would be an obvious piece of evidence showing I at least played these individual games.

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From the description of the issue, I understand that you are experiencing a black screen with a cursor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue (black screen) you’re facing could be most likely related to display drivers and could be resolved by updating the drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to open the Task Manager and run the System File Checker tool to rectify any issue with System File integrity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow below.</p>
<p>1. Open task manager&nbsp;by pressing&nbsp;<strong>ctrl</strong>, <strong>alt</strong>, and
<strong>delete</strong> at the same time&nbsp;and clicking on it from the given menu</p>
<p>2. In task manager, go to <strong>file</strong> and select <strong>run new task</strong>.</p>
<p>3. In the create new task window, check the box next to the text "<strong>create this task with administrative privileges</strong>".</p>
<p>4. Type in&nbsp; <strong>cmd</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;then press enter ,which will bring up the Command Prompt Window.</p>
<p>5. in windows command prompt, type in "sfc /scannow" ,which scans integrity of all protected system files and repairs files with problems when possible.</p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see the black screen <strong><span>only</span></strong> <strong><span>after sign-in
</span></strong>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></li><li><span>If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>If this resolves the black screen, use corruption resolution steps (dism, then sfc), and run the all apps PowerShell command in
<a href="https://vkbexternal.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/VKBWebService/ViewContent.aspx?scid=KB%3ben-US%3b3080495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">3080495</span></span></a>.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>If this does not work, use File, Run new task in Task Manager to start an Administrator CMD window. Use this to create a new administrator user with the following commands (changing “&lt;password&gt;” to something of the customer’s choosing):<br />
</span><span>net user test &lt;password&gt; /add<br />
net localgroup Administrators test /add</span><span> </span></li><li><span>This will give you a test user to try, which will confirm if the issue is user or system-specific.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen <strong><span>before sign-in</span></strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></li><li><span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters </span>
<ul>
<li><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></li><li><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>

</p><p>The orange light is usually energy-saving power mode. If it's blinking, it's not working correctly and you'll need to troubleshot it to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To protect your xbox from electrical damage, the power brick is the actual surge protector. Please try:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Unplugging the power brick from the Xbox One as well as from the wall socket.
</li><li>Leave it unplugged for approximately 10-60 seconds (<strong>more is better</strong>)
</li><li>Connect everything back together, if you are using a surge protector and/or extension cord, don't. Instead, plug the
<strong>brick directly into the wall </strong>as these can impair the performance of your xbox one power supply</li><li>Turn on the console and check and see if everything is working. </li></ul>

            <p>Sandra and Nancy, you both have Conexant audio. The built-in Windows driver should work, have a look at my colleague Matt's blog post:</p>

here</a>, though they are still working on rolling out some of the updates.&nbsp; I’ve just updated my own Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Extreme Audio card driver. &nbsp;I bought the card when Vista came out in 2007.&nbsp; It was working fine in 10, it’s always nice to have
 the proper drivers for Windows 10 though.&nbsp; A nice move from Creative to support legacy cards.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>After installing, you may have to check the computer Sound settings to ensure your card is set as the default sound device. (Go to Search in taskbar &gt; type "Sound" &gt; select the Sound Control Panel and check/ change the settings if required).&nbsp; Right click
 on the speakers with the Creative device you have installed and set it as the default device.&nbsp; Then also check the configuration for your speakers.&nbsp; The default install setting seems to be 7.1, which can make 2.0/ 2.1 speakers sound distorted.&nbsp; Just change
 the speaker config setting to 2.0/ 2.1 if that's the case.</p>
