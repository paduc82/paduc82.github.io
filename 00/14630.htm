<h2>            Default Mail Client&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Another question please.</p>
<p>Having installed Windows 7 64 bit version, I am using Explorer8 64 bit.&nbsp; When I click on the email icon at the top of the screen I get a message come up ""could not perform this operation as the default mail client is not properly installed""</p>
<p>Why is this and how do I overcome this??</p>
<p>If I use the 32 bit version of Explorer all is OK, I can click on the icon and go straight to Outlook as I always have done.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated guys</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Try to modify&nbsp;the Mail value in the registry and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Make sure you back up the registry. Follow the article given below to back the registry:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you can try the workaround mentioned below to check if it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Run &gt; Type regedit</p>
<p>2. Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; Software &gt; Client &gt; Click on Mail</p>
<p>3. Please check what is on the right pane. It should read as below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Default)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REG_SZ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you don’t find Mail, right click on Client and Click New &gt; Key and rename the key as Mail.</p>
<p>Once the Mail key is created, right click on Mail &gt; New &gt; String Value. Name the value as (Default).</p>
<p>Right click on (Default) and Click Modify. In the Value Data box type Microsoft Outlook.</p>

    <title>Lost Document, somewhere between Word and Sharepoint...in the Twilight - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guitar-picker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Document, somewhere between Word and Sharepoint...in the Twilight Zone&#33;</h2>
                    <p>An Office 2010 user checked out a word 2010.docx from a Sharepoint 2010 document library and proceeded to spend several hours editing it.</p>
<p>Then he saved the document and closed Word without checking the file back in. When he opened the document again from Sharepoint, it was the original version, with none of his work. We explained to him that since he still had the file checked out, it would
 not be on the server.&nbsp; So, here's what we tried:</p>
<p>1. We looked in his MyDocs\Sharepoint Drafts folder, but the file wasn't there.</p>
<p>2. We had him check the file in.&nbsp; THis should have flushed it up from his PC to the Sharepoint server from wherever it was hiding...but this didn't help.</p>
<p>3. We checked is Word/Options/Save settings and found that they were set to save checked out files to the Office Document Cache, not the Server Drafts location on this computer - which was properly defined as C:\Users\username\Documents\Sharepoint Drafts.</p>
<p>4. We figure that his draft should therefore be in the Office document cache.&nbsp; But ...where is that???</p>
<p>5. After considerable searching, we found the office document cache but the file was not there.</p>
<p>6. We assume that the files in the office document cache, are what appear in the list when we open Word and see the 'recent documents list....but his draft is not in that list, either.
</p>
<p>We thought that Word and Sharepoint were engineered in a way that makes it virtually impossible to 'lose' one's work....if we assume that this user is correct in saying emphatically that he saved the document numerous times during his editing session, as
 well as having saved it just before he closed it, then it appears that it may be possible to 'lose' your work....at least, so far, we have no clue how/where to find his draft!</p>
<p>What are we missing?</p>

<p>I downloaded the path from the trial version pre-loaded to my laptop. &nbsp;Installation was successful but, no product key was presented at the end of it in order to activate the trial version. &nbsp;However, I was able to do this on my sisters computer with no problem.</p>

<p>Hello NewUser73,</p>
<p>I have not downloaded nor tried to activate a Trial for Office since Office 2010 was released in June 2010, so I am not 100% sure if Microsoft still supports the issuance of Trial product keys for Office 2007.&nbsp; However, if you say you received one a couple
 of weeks ago, then I have to assume that they still do :-)</p>
<p>The easy work-around here is just use the same Trial product key that you received for the first computer on the second computer, assuming of course both computers came with the same edition of Office for the Trial.&nbsp; IIRC there were only a handful of these
 Trial keys and they were issued over and over again.</p>
<p>There is a larger issue here, though, and that is, what are you going to do after the Trial period is over?&nbsp; If you want to convert the Trials to perpetually licensed products, you won't be able to directly purchase a perpetual product key from Microsoft
 directly, as they no longer sell Office 2007 PKs directly thru their online store nor thru the software's built in conversion process.&nbsp; So that means, unless you have genuine copies of Offfice 2007 unused,&nbsp;you'll need to buy a PK somewhere else.&nbsp; Since Office
 2007 is not the current product, it will be difficult to locate at local stores.&nbsp; Many online retailers and smaller local "Mom-n-Pop" stores still have stocks of Office 2007, but yo8u have to be careful about from whom you by to avoid the many many counterfeit
 and mislicensed Office 2007 products.</p>
<p>That's why I mentioned Office 2010.&nbsp; As the current product it will be easier to buy locally and direcly from Microsoft.&nbsp; While Office 2007 was a radical departure from previous Office versions, there is only evolutionary change from Office 2007 to 2010.</p>
<p>In your situation, I would have uninstalled the Office 2007 Trials, restarted the computer twice, then installed the Office 2010 Trial.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi. I have a Little question and I hope you can answer it. My computer came with Windows 8 Single Language, so in Windows 10 and the Insiders Builds I have always kept that edition in order to use the digital licence that is now linked to my Microsoft Account,
 but with the installation of the build 17063 the edition changed to just Home (Windows 10 Home). Will the version be changed back to Single Language or will it not matter anymore and my Windows copy will be activated anyway?</p>

            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing your issue to our attention and our apologies for the delayed response. I'd be glad to assist you with your concern about the custom domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, we would like to inform you that&nbsp;<span>Microsoft decided to discontinue the free custom domain service as of April 10th 2014.&nbsp;</span>As part of the decommission process, eventually, listed domains in the admin panel will be removed and all users
 who will log in to domains.live.com will be redirected back to domains.live.com home page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, email accounts in the domain can still log in and access it at www.outlook.com with their emails intact. As long as there will be no changes in the MX Record set by the domain administrator, these users will continue to receive emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions. We'll be more than willing to assist you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>This is a really sorry way to end this.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the account should be grandfathered.&nbsp; Google did the same but they still make the accounts usable.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can reset passwords or any thing.&nbsp; You can see what email accounts that you created.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand them not wanting you to add any more account but to remove the control panel is just low class!&nbsp; It is a same that Google did it right but Microsoft could not follow their lead.&nbsp;

    <title>Word Online has lost my edits TWICE this week. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george v.reilly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Online has lost my edits TWICE this week.</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I edited a document in Word Online in "My Documents" on our corporate subdomain at sharepoint.com. Today, when I switched back to that tab in my browser a few minutes ago, it told me that my session had expired and that I had to refresh. When
 I refreshed, all of yesterday's edits were gone. According to the summary at My Documents, the document was last changed
<em>two</em>&nbsp;days ago. None of yesterday's changes were saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very similar thing happened earlier this week, when I was editing a document shared by my colleague. There was a popup saying that my session would expire several hours in the future and that I should refresh. When I refreshed, a couple of hours of edits
 were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word Online claims "there's no save button because your document is being saved automatically". Maybe
<em>your</em>&nbsp;documents are being saved automatically but <em>mine</em>&nbsp;clearly aren't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary reason why I would use Word Online as opposed to a desktop word processor is for ease of collaboration with others. Otherwise, I might as well be swapping .doc files back and forth in email, just like in 1995.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, between OneDrive and Sharepoint and various Live portals, I have created the same identity in three or four places. As far as I can tell, they aren't linked at all. I've had to jump through hoops to be able to share anything at all with my colleagues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Docs worked well for me for several years. So far, Word Online has just caused me grief.</p>

            <p>when you have completed an editing session just close the document browser tab</p>
<p>this closes the Word Online doc</p>
<p>there is no reason to leave a doc open for days on end</p>
<p>
</p><p>and Word Online <em>does </em>use auto-save</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Windows 10 did an auto update about 3 weeks ago which took hours. Below is the update history from that day 16/09/2016</p>
<ul>
<li>Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3176936)</li><li>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1607</li><li>Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool for Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 x64 Edition - September 2016 (KB890830)</li><li>Security Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB3182373)</li><li>Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3188128)</li></ul>
<p>The cursor was visible on all other apps, just Office apps were affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after this update on 02/10/2016, and after restarting pc, it seems to have been corrected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3194496)</li></ul>
<p>Thanks for you response.</p>

            What type of email account do you use? Were the contacts in a folder labeled 'this computer only'? 
<br />
<br />Go to the Contacts navigation pane (the people icon or Ctrl+3) - are there contacts in the contacts folder?  If so, right click on the Contacts folder and choose properties. On the outlook address book tab, is it checked to use as an address book? (It should be grayed out but checked if its the only contacts folder or the default contacts folder.)

            What type of email account is involved (POP3, IMAP, Exchange/Outlook.com)?
<br />
<br />If this involved an IMAP account and your contacts were located in a folder with the added description "This Computer Only", then it is possible that Outlook could not locate the original OST file and subsequently recreated it. Any data contained in any folder marked as "This Computer only" would have been lost unless it was explicitly manually backed up (exported) to a PST file.
<br />
<br />If the above does describe the situation, a way to prevent that problem going forward is to follow the steps in
<br />
<br />How to Protect Outlook '2013/'2016 Imap Contact/Calendar Data
<br /><a href="https://www.contactgenie.info/how-to-protect-outlook-this-computer-only-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.contactgenie.info/how-to-protect-ou...</a>
<br />
<br />An alternative to the above is to 
<br />1) create a free Outlook,com account,
<br />2) configure it in Outlook
<br />3) make the default data file for the profile the ost file associated with the Outlook.com account (go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab)
<br />4) Maintain your contacts in the Outlook.com contact folders
<br />
<br />The above will enable the contacts to be accessible to any device where the Outlook.com account is configured. Setting a default data file for the profile is separate and distinct from setting a default email account

<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />BTW, if you had the contacts in a pst file, the file is around there somewhere -if you imported it into an IMAP account's 'this computer only' folder, the pst version is probably not up-to-date though.  
<br />
<br />As an FYI, we do not recommend using those folders - yeah, its nice to not need a pst and an imap data file, but you risk losing appointments and contacts if anything happens to the IMAP account.

            &gt;&gt; since the update the help desk (or what ever it is called) about a week ago. 
<br />
<br />Do you have any idea what they did?  Wild guess, they deleted your account and added it back - without checking for 'this computer only' folders. Or they just made a new profile and didn't add the contacts pst back. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Assuming this so where would I find the pst version? 
<br />This would be an old pst you used with Outlook 2010 or older - its where you keep your old files (I'm basing this on your comment: "It has survived probably 8 -10 computer changes and a myriad of updates.")  Outlook 2013 and 2016 don't require a pst with imap accounts but you really should use it instead of the new way. 
<br />
<br />now... if you had 2 data files in your profile before and contacts were in a pst you'll just need to add the pst back and set it as default data file. Look in your Documents folder for Outlook Files folder and see if there is a pst there. If so, go to file, open &amp; export,  Outlook Data Files open it - see if the lost contacts are there. 
<br />
<br />The only problem with having them on the mac is getting them out - if there are in outlook for mac, there is no (useful) Export option, only .olm. :(   You can use Forward as vCard though - select them, right click, forward as vCard. Send to yourself. If you have a lot, send them in smaller groups. On the windows computer, you can select all and drag from the attachment field to the contacts folder.

    <title>Can Outlook 2013 open the PST files created in outlook 2003, 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harisubu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Outlook 2013 open the PST files created in outlook 2003, 2007 &#38; 2010&#63; What to do with NK2 files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have 15 users in my SBS 2003 domain. The XP work stations are mixed with outlook 2003 to 2010. All users have backed up their email as pst files every time it reached 2GB. We are going to buy two new servers 2012R2 one AD and One Exchange 2013 and 15 Windows
 7 clients with Office 2013.</p>
<p>Instead of undergoing painful migration from SBS 2003 to Server 2012R2/Exchange 2013, I want to make a new domain in the same name and create all users without connecting to the network, copy all the data and swap the servers. Will do the necessary change
 to receive the emails. My question here is, will Outlook 2013 open the previous versions Outlook PST files. If so, is there any precautionary steps I should take.
</p>
<p>Also I will backup all NK2 files and I m not clear how and where to paste the NK2 files in Outlook 2013</p>
<p>Please advice.</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Hari</p>

            <p>Yes, Outlook 2013 can open them. If they are the old ANSI pst, it's not recommended to use them as a delivery location, but you can open them to read mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NK2 files will go into the same folder there are in now. Outlook *should* import them on first run but if not, you can restart outlook with the inportnk2 switch.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, if you read through the EULA for the device, I think you'll find wording in there that says this will invalidate any warranty, etc. you may have -- implied or no.</p>
<p>No one can STOP you from doing this -- it's your phone and you can do what you want with it.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, a brief review of material from XDA-Developers is showing that 'breaking' the security/locks on the WP ROMS is proving very difficult.&nbsp; I haven't seen ANY 'custom' WP ROMS developed yet.&nbsp; If you get it to work, I'm sure they would be THRILLED to
 hear from you.</p>

            I don't think there are many here that are qualified to answer legal questions. Also keep in mind that laws vary by region. &nbsp;Installation of ROM's may be in violation of the licensing terms for an OS or some of the components included in the image. But
 to know for sure you would need to ask a qualified legal profession in your region.&nbsp;

<h2>            Anyone know the exact details as to how Podcasts work within WP 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First so there's no confusion, I'm looking for any information on the Windows Phone SYNC application which runs on the desktop.&nbsp; I already have it, I use it, and my podcasts that I had downloaded to my phone's SD card still aren't recognized even though
 they are located in the correct directory.&nbsp; Re-syncing doesn't help and redownloading them isn't a viable answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic questions I have are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How exactly are podcast files recognized by WP8.1; how are they distinguished from regular music files?</li><li>If they are recognized as regular music files, how can I make the MS podcast app recognize the files?</li><li>How are podcast "collections" managed?</li></ol>
<p>That's just a start but there will probably be more questions when answers start rolling in.</p>

            We don't use the term profile in Outlook Mac so I'm not sure I totally understand your question.<br />
<br />
You don't normally use multiple Identities in Outlook. We use them to test for issues. For separate accounts, the Mac way is to use a different User. However, Outlook can manage multiple email accounts in one Identity.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span>An identity contains preferences, email account settings, messages, contacts, events, notes and tasks.
<br />
Your identity is named "Main" by default. It is located in the Microsoft User Data folder. Creating a new Identity is a good way to test your database to see if corruption is the problem.<br />
<br />
Each identity can have (almost) any number of accounts. Each account is associated with a distinct email address than can be used to send and/or receive mail, but all mail is stored in the same database, all calendar events are common to all the accounts, all
 notes &amp; contacts are shared.<br />
<br />
You can have multiple accounts in Outlook. Examples: POP, IMAP, Hotmail, Gmail, AOL, Exchange.<br />
<br />

Go to System Preferences --&gt; Create a New User in Accounts. Switch to the New User by logging out/in or use Fast User Switching.

    <title>How do I stop Windows Live from saving every new contact into my email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eyrod  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows Live from saving every new contact into my email rather than as a regular contact on my HTC touch phone&#63;</h2>
                    I recently acquired a hotmail email and set up my email onto my HTC touch phone. When I set it up I guess I didn't fully read the question that asked if I want to add all me email contacts onto my phone contacts, because now every time I enter someones
 phone number into my phone it asks if I want to save it into Outlook, which is the email default on my phone, or Windows live. I do not have an option of just selecting a regular phone contact. So when I select Windows Live it connects to the internet to save
 onto my email account. How do I stop it from sending it my email? I went to HTC.com but there was no help. I can't even remove the email account from my phone. I can remove a yahoo email, but I think it might be since Live Search was already installed on the
 phone when purchased.<br />

                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I submitted a service request last week and received my confirmation # within an hour.&nbsp; However, I have yet to receive my shipping label which I requested to get via email.&nbsp; I sent an email with the same question which went unanswered.&nbsp; Not impressed with
 the Customer Support so far but I sure miss my Zune!</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have Office 365 through my employer. We are starting to use Teams but our version doesn't seem to have a 'meetings' tab at the side.</p>
<p>How do I get it? or is there perhaps a reason this is unavailable to us?</p>

<p>Hi Kristen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings, I'm glad to follow up this thread, firstly, please&nbsp;go to&nbsp;<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://teams.microsoft.com</span></a>&nbsp;to access the Teams web client to see if the Meeting tab is available
 in Microsoft Teams. If yes, it's recommended to uninstall and re-install the Team Client from official website to see the result:
<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get Microsoft Teams on all your devices</a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, since there is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/known-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
known issues for Microsoft Teams</a> that Meeting functionality is not available when Exchange Mailbox is hosted<span>&nbsp;

<p>
