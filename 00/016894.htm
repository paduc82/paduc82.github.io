<h2>            After less than 24 hours of ownership my 808 is a brick</h2>
                    
<p>Not a good way to end my day...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got my Nokia 808 earlier today and was really liking it at first. &nbsp;But then I had to go and attempt to install a Japanese input system (I'm a student of the language) called +J using some poorly-translated instructions (<a href="http://plusj.kthree.co.jp/install_e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://plusj.kthree.co.jp/install_e.html</a>
 if you're interested). &nbsp;Obviously I did something wrong because after the first reboot my phone is now stuck in some sort of boot loop. &nbsp;It boots, makes it to the home screen for a few seconds but is totally frozen and unresponsive, then it seems to try booting
 again and so on and so forth. &nbsp;Of course it never actually succeeds in booting. &nbsp;Or doing anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do? &nbsp;I know there is supposed to be some sort of factory reset if you hold down a certain combination of buttons for long enough, but I can't seem to get that to do anything. &nbsp;Or I'm just doing it wrong, which is entirely possible but I can't
 really find clear instructions. &nbsp;Does the phone have to be started before you can do that? &nbsp;That would make things tough. &nbsp;Is there any way to flash it over USB like you can with some Android devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. &nbsp;It's painful to see this happen to a brand new toy...</p>

<p>I think you read the same instructions I found. &nbsp;They don't really seem to work, though. &nbsp;I can hold down those buttons and eventually get a Nokia logo that then disappears, but then the phone just turns off. &nbsp;I can sit there all day holding camera and volume
 down and it doesn't reboot after that. &nbsp;Not unless I press the power button, anyway, but then it's just back to normal (well, normal broken...) booting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone actually done this reset thing?</p>

<p>Best is to visit <strong><a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care</a></strong> and get the firmware flashed. Have read on this Forum that performing the Hard Reset ( which you have tried thru' the button combination..)
 results in losing some functionalities especially regarding the Navigation application as it also deletes some important files .. Nokia Care should fresh install the OS and you need not worry about the working ..</p>
<p>..and other advise..Don't repeat the thing you were trying, that caused this situation.</p>

<p>I've done this reset multiple times. And have succesfully done.<br />
<br />
You said that you installed some app and after that this thing happened right? Did you install in mass memory or memory card? If on memory card then try removing your memory card and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have installed in mass memory then sometimes it can be problem. Assuming your phone is switched off right now! Just connect your mobile to PC/lappy. Wait for couple of minutes, your PC would recognise it as a storage device. If it recognises then
 copy all the important data you want to keep and format the memory card and mass memory. (I'd this problem when installed something like theme/app from untrusted developer.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This method worked for me. If not then try again the hard reset</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold down the following three buttons Volume Down + Camera + Menu button at the same time. (It will Hard reset your Phone, and may takes several minutes to restart your Phone)</li><li>While holding these buttons, hold the power button to switch on the phone. And remember press all these buttons carefully as you might not fully press all the buttons!</li><li>Release the buttons when the phone shows the nokia hands logo or shows other signs of life like the language selection screen.</li></ul>
<p>As you might be aware of the data loss while attemping this method be sure you will lose everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If nothing else works then you might unfortunately visit a local nokia care.</p>

<p>For Symbian Belle devices whilst keeping&nbsp;<strong>Volume Down + Camera + Menu button</strong> depressed prees power button until
<strong>first</strong> vibration felt and release it , whilst keeping other three
<strong>continually</strong> depressed until country selection screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should restore telephony functions, although certain certificates can be erased causing issues with Nokia Store &amp; Maps necessitating software to be completely re-installed at a Nokia Care facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As regards <strong>+J for S60</strong> I don't think that any method of changing font whereby stored upon memory card will be successful with Belle unfortunately!</p>

<p>Unfortunately the Nokia Suite suggestion seems to be a no-go.&nbsp; Before I broke my phone I had it set to USB mass storage mode.&nbsp; When I try it with Nokia Suite it says it has to be in Nokia Suite mode to do anything...but since the phone is totally unresponsive
 I have no way to change it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That really seems to leave a hard reset as the only real option.&nbsp; You say that will make certain features unusable, but can I use that to at least get the phone into a working state and
<em>then</em> reinstall stuff from Nokia Suite?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I'm seriously considering just returning the phone.&nbsp; (I know I'm the one who caused the problem, but what else can I do!&nbsp; It's either that or mail it back to Nokia and hope they can fix it...)</p>

<p>When I installed +J, I didnt install the font pack. Seems to work without it.</p>
<p>+J is extremely buggy, for some reason I cant use it normally in horizontal mode. Only workaround to get it working in horizontal mode, is to leave the keyboard open in some other application in the background. And also if you manage to brick the phone again
 with +J, might be worth a try to throw a file named "DeactivatePlusJFontRasterizer" in root of mass memory and sd card.</p>

                    <p>Been getting this message for several days now. I don't know what I am supposed to do. Please help... I don't want my laptop to crash again (a preview update wasn't working 10/31/18). Anyway, since then I have reinstalled and things were fine until about

<p>What build are you using now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSFT always has an expiration date for preview builds.&nbsp; The latest build (18298) expires in July of next year.&nbsp; The idea is to keep up to date so that your build never nears expiration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download an ISO file for build 18290 from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="click me">
Download site</a> and save it to your desktop.&nbsp; Right click the ISO icon, click "mount," and double click "setup.exe" in the file explorer window that opens.&nbsp; That will start your upgrade.&nbsp; Once the upgrade is finished, check WU and you should get build 18298.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, lacrumb. You're right,&nbsp; my post should have some basic info. Sorry about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, as I was looking for the info just now, I noticed an update is installing (Windows 10 Insider Preview 18305.1000 (rs_prerelease). Maybe this is the update I've been waiting for to get rid of that notification. It's a pretty extensive download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But just in case, here is some info:</p>
<p>Current Version: 1809</p>
<p>OS Build: 18272.1000</p>
<p>This is my MacBook but I'm running Windows (Bootcamp)</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview</p>
<p>Ram: 16.0 GB</p>
<p>System Type: 64-Bit operating system, x64-based processor&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did have McAfee installed, but that was before I had to reinstall everything back on 10/31/18. Since then, I have not installed any 3rd party antivirus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hopefully the current update will do the trick since as you (and the other person who replied) pointed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll follow-up with an update... on the update lol soon. Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t remember my password - What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    I messed up and can not remember my hotmail password. I was laid off from my job a few months back, and my old work email address was one of my verification methods. I have requested multiple times to have my password reset, and I keep doing that stupid
 30 day waiting thing, and I never hear from Microsoft. I desperately need to have my email on my phone, as all potential employers are using my hotmail address. Is there any way around this ridiculous set-up?<br />

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p><span><strong>1. All </strong>account related issues are now dealt with</span><strong><span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><br />
</strong>Select the error you need help with and fill out the requested details on the next page.&nbsp;
<br />
<span>You can read further information about <strong>codes</strong> &amp; blocked accounts<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/account-temporarily-blocked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong><strong>FYI Re the 30 days...</strong></p>
The 30 day waiting period can<strong> not </strong>be waived.
<p>
</p><p><strong>What should I know about the 30-day waiting period?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you choose to delete your out-of-date security info, MS don't fully remove it for 30 days. This waiting period helps to deter hackers from updating your security info and gaining access to your account without your knowledge.
</p>
<p>After 30 days, the user of the account <strong>will</strong> be able to access the security settings and update his/her preferred information.</p>
<p>But the waiting period doesn't mean you're locked out of your Microsoft account.

    <title>Word 2007 on W10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockinpreacher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 on W10</h2>
                    <p>I am using MS Office 2007. I have converted my laptop&nbsp;to Windows 10. The issue I would like information about is (I believe) found with the Auto Formatting function. Particularly the double&nbsp;hyphen (--) converting to a single dash. I used to run W 8.1 and
 had no issue, but now it's not cooperating. I've checked the setting under Word Options &gt; Proofing &gt; Auto Correct Options &gt; Auto Format (tab) &gt; and checked the box under Replace: Hyphens (--) with dash (--) [even while typing this post the Format drop-down
 (above this content box) did not respond for me to change the example to a dash].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, another issue I'd like clarity on is the "Disable internal pointing device when external USB pointing device is attached" check box for my wireless mouse. I have to keep checking it and hitting Apply every time I restart my computer. Why won't W10
 retain this setting??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            The option to replace hyphens with a dash should be selected on the <strong>
AutoFormat As You Type</strong> tab, not on the <strong>AutoFormat</strong> tab. It is the options on the former tab that determine what happens during typing.

<h2>            Excel 2013 Stuck at Starting Splash Screen</h2>
                    <p>Excel 2013 is getting stuck at the Starting Splash screen on a number of my users computers. This occurs when opening up Excel files(xls/xlsx) and when opening the program by itself. After ending task it will open correctly by itself after selecting "No"
 &nbsp;when it asks you to open in Safe Mode then it will not open again after that. I've reinstalled it and that fixes it for a little while, but then it just starts happening again after a few days. I'm out of ideas as I've perused the answers here and elsewhere
 and I haven't been able to solve this issues with any of the fixes. I've disabled Addin's and deleted printers with no luck. Has anyone else experienced this?</p>

            <p>It seems to me that all these users use a particular Excel file which creates this problem after using this Excel file. We need to identify this common Excel file. Meanwhile, to correct this&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try following -</p>
<p>
Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name) and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files
 / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself.<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.</p>

<p>Hi Kayla,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the external users are no longer to access to the folder that you shared with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the situation, we suggest you go to Office 365 Admin center to check whether the problematic external user account is in the Active users. If yes, try deleting the problematic external
 users and re-share the document to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can let the problematic users use private mode of the browser when they open the shared link and make sure they have logged in with the right account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>Hi Tisky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our clients try to open the link in a private browser and are still getting the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>" That didn't work. We're sorry, but 'insert client email' can't be found in your company directory. Please try again later, while we try to automatically fix this for you."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried in the past to stop sharing the folder with the individual and re-add them to the folder. Is that the same as below?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"W<span>e suggest you go to Office 365 Admin center to check whether the problematic external user account is in the Active users. If yes, try deleting the problematic external users and re-share the document to them."</span></p>

<p>Hi Kayla,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quotation in your reply means to delete the external users in the Active users in Admin center, stop sharing is not the same as deleting external user. To narrow down the situation, we suggest
 you try deleting the external user then re-invite them to the site and check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have a similar problem.&nbsp; I wish to set up Skype on a different laptop, but have forgotten my password as I was always signed in on my other one. I cannot reset the password, as the recovery email address they have is a defunct one.&nbsp; I have reset my Skype
 contact email address, but this has not changed the security email address they have.&nbsp; Any attempts to chat to a human being have failed - the online chatrooms require the password in order to access them.&nbsp; I have emailed and had a reply saying it was an unmanned
 email address.&nbsp; I basically need someone to change the recovery email address associated to my account so that I can reset my password.</p>

<h2>            Cannot scroll page by keyboard in Word 365  Mac version.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I meet a problem.</p>
<p>After updating to Mac version 16.12, I find the scroll function works abnormally.
</p>
<p>Sometimes when I put the cursor in the last line of the current page, then push "Down Arrow", the cursor goes down to next lines but the page doesn't scroll up. While sometimes (usually the first several minutes I start use Microsoft Word) it works normally.
 So I think it cannot be the preference setting problem but more likely a bug.</p>
<p>Can someone help me?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Sylvia,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First I suggest you restart your Mac to see and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I’d like you to confirm the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check if the issue happens in a specific file.</span></p>
<p><span>2. If you do a test in the same version of the Word 2016 for Mac application on another Mac, what’s the result?</span></p>

<p><span>From the video, it seems that the issue is showed in the 1:35 part. If yes, it seems that you are using the return key to do the test. So could you also list the steps about how you do the test in the

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I used in the test video. I'm pretty sure that no "return key" is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>0:51　</p>
<p>Click Line 22 by mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0:57　</p>
<p>Press ↓ on the keyboard 3 times. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor moves to Line 25 where you can see the lower half of the cursor is out of the editing area (between 0:58-0:59).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1:10-1:18　</p>
<p>Continually press ↓ button. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor moves down to Line 26, 27, 28... I guess. Just a guess because these lines still stay in the next page which I cannot see and they don't scroll up.</p>
<p>No return key is touched.</p>
<p>No mouse is touched.</p>
<p>The only action is pressing the ↓ button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1:22</p>
<p>Move the mouse to the scroll bar at the right side. Click. Jump to Page 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1:24</p>
<p>Click again. Return to Page 1.&nbsp;</p>

Thanks for your updates.</p>

I try to reproduce the issue in our environment and I can’t see the behavior. Could you also share the affected file in the video in the private message for us to do a test?</p>

    <title>Outlook account locked out. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony2k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook account locked out.</h2>
                    So I have an XBox1, and a couple of weeks ago I forgot the password to my main account, and I entered the wrong password too many times., which lead to my account being locked out. I've reset my password twice, but sign-in is still blocked. This account
 was made specifically for XBox, and&nbsp;there are no other accounts linked to it, with the exception of this one (The parent account). Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<p>

</p><p>This happens when too many incorrect passwords were entered consecutively while attempting to sign-in.

<p>
</p><p>To fix this, we need to go through password reset. Please follow this <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 that Save source data with file is checked. For good measure, I made sure Enable show details was checked and Number of items to retain per field was set to Automatic.</span></span><br />

 I'm using Excel 2010. I have another spreadsheet with a connection to a view in SQL 2008 R2 and had the same loss of functionality when I disconnected the data source. I think the data's still there, but I can't figure out how to access the Pivot Cache.</span><br />

<h3> xenawarrior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pictiures turn into grey tiles on LUMIA 640 XL</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently bought a generic brand 16 GB Micro SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed it on my Lumia 640 XL with Windows 8, I set the phone to store newly taken pictures to the SD card.</p>
<p>It worked OK for some time, but one day I noticed that some pictures and videos I took about an hour before that suddenly turned into grey tiles in the phone! Even after connecting the phone to my laptop I was unable to view the photos, and still
 can't (is there a way to retrieve them at all by the way? I still keep those files on my laptop, they have proper size and names but just won't open!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reset my phone to the factory settings, formatted the MicroSD card, inserted it and set my phone to keep freshly taken photos to the MicroSD, took some pics, restarted the phone, and they turned into grey tiles again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have to store newly taken photos in the internal memory of the phone, in this case they seem to be fine. But if I ever attempt to move them to the card and restart the phone, they appear as grey tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the card for errors on my computer, it says the card is totally fine. Yet besides the picture problem some of my apps I installed to the card became unavailable after I used them for a couple of weeks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

    <title>OneNote printing&#47;pdf does not look like the Print Preview - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjf83  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote printing&#47;pdf does not look like the Print Preview</h2>
                    <p>OneNote has been working great.&nbsp; I want to print all my notes because I find studying from a hard copy sinks into my brain easier than studying from the screen.&nbsp; I don't know why but it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in knowing that I want to print everything, my first step after creating a page is to go "View" --&gt; "Paper Size" and select "Letter" which is the same as an 8.5" x 11".&nbsp; I then drag my text box to conservatively fit within the&nbsp;printed margins&nbsp;of the
 paper.&nbsp; Most of my notes for each topic will be more than one page long, so I go back to sizing the paper and re-select "Auto", which gives me more white area.&nbsp; My notes are mostly text with some pictures.&nbsp; I like that I can drag/drop and insert documents
 right on the page.&nbsp; I also like to used the draw function and put red boxes around very important notes or items that I need to memorize for a test.&nbsp; These boxes are all over the place (but all well within the 8.5" of the paper).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my problem.... In OneNote, my notes look exactly as I want them to look.&nbsp; I click "Print Preview" and my notes again look exactly as I want the to look.&nbsp; When I go to print, my red boxes shift downward.&nbsp; The delta between the expected location and
 the printed location is small on page 1 but becomes increasingly skewed as the pages go on.&nbsp; In addition to this, the top of page 2 repeats the bottom 2-3 lines of text from page 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt this is a printer issue, as I tried this on two different printers at work and my home printer and all yielded the same errors.&nbsp; Then, after getting tired of wasting paper, I did a pdf print.&nbsp; Again, the notes looked right in OneNote, the Print Preview
 looked right too.&nbsp; But when it created a pdf, it came out exactly like the printed sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help....</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>What can I do differently to ensure my Print Previews are exactly like my printed pages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>Ryan</p>

            <p>Has to be an issue with the printer you are working with.</p>
<p>Anyways it is better to convert these into word documents and then try printing from there.</p>
<p>Coping and pasting content into word after re sizing and then printing from word, will give you more control.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mozilla Firefox</a></span>?&nbsp; That's what I use, and it works well, even in build 10049.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I too am very disappointed with Spartan, noticing several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequent graphical redraw issues and screen corruption (OK, it's betaware, this is understandable).<br />
</li><li>Slower than IE (which is significantly slower than Firefox <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="http://peacekeeper.futuremark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">in benchmarks</a></span>).&nbsp; In addition to scoring lower in the benchmark, I could readily tell the difference in page loading time.&nbsp; Firefox loads most pages almost twice as fast as IE or Spartan.<br />
</li><li>Still doesn't support certain important media formats including Ogg Vorbis, Opus, and Theora.&nbsp; Chrome and Firefox score perfectly here.</li><li>Sends a fraudulent <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.useragentstring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserAgent string</a></span> identifying itself as Chrome or Safari.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this was just another company, I wouldn't even care.&nbsp; But this is Microsoft, the world's largest software company.&nbsp; I expect better than this!</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It appears like you are having issues with playing a game after updating to build 16176. The easiest way to resolve this is to run the troubleshooter for Windows Store apps
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/E/7/FE74974A-9029-41A0-9EB2-9CCE3FC20B99/Appsdiagnostic10.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. This tool will help us find and correct issues on your computer which may have affected the performance of some of your apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling the application.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your firewall settings as well if it is blocking the game's internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since not all apps are guaranteed to work with Windows 10 Insider Preview, we suggest that you submit a
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-10-feedback-diagnostics-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
feedback</a> in case the issue is persistent even after reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

<p>Sorry for the delay in replying, I tried all your suggestions but none worked. However the issue resolved itself in build 16193.</p>

    <title>Excel File Opening Issue - PROTECTED VIEW Be careful&#8212;files from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip mark hunt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel File Opening Issue - PROTECTED VIEW Be careful&#8212;files from the Internet can contain viruses.  Unless you need to edit, it&#39;s safer to stay in Protected View.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bat file that successfully opens a series of Excel files on my home computer, where I have created all the content and all the XLAMs that the spreadsheets use, and the spreadsheets and macros are all stored on local drives, not the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately while all the files open, they all come up in the protected mode, as per the message that I have used as the subject for this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I force the system to open these files in editing enabled mode: I just find it be a real peeve to have to go through a dozen spreadsheets clicking enable editing before I can get on with my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read something somewhere about a way to declare some safe directories, or something like that, but I am not sure where or how I would do that.&nbsp; I have no hesitation in using regedit or other 'advanced' aspects of the computer set-up, as I am a retired
 mainframe programmer, but I was always on the applications side, not the systems side, so if I do have to get into some 'unusual' areas, please give me very clear, idiot-proof instructions.&nbsp; On the other hand maybe there is something I can include in the bat
 file to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With private words changed, the bat file reads as follows -</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd "E:\Old PC\Family_History (G)\Family_Trees\"<br />
start "" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\EXCEL.EXE" "Cousins_Trees.xlsm"<br />

            Hi Philip
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There can be two ways -
<br />
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt;Trust center settings 
<br />
<br />1. Protected View &gt; Uncheck Enable Protected view for files located in unsafe locations 
<br />(This is not a preferred solution because of some risks)
<br />2. Trusted location &gt; Here you can add a trusted location
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

 anyone tell me what to do next?</p>
<p>I have spent 2 full days trying to get this working. &nbsp;Now it says all my apps will cease working on April 13, even though I have paid through 2018. &nbsp;HELP.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Connie, </span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I shall assist you related to Outlook email issue, however I need some more information about the same.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What are the types of email account configured in Outlook (POP, IMAP, MAPI or Exchange)?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you have different inbox's created for each individual account?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you have any rules created in Outlook?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Were you been able to receive emails earlier to their specific inbox?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method: 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the email accounts are configured as POP, you may create rules in Outlook to send emails to their individual inboxes.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information related to create rules in Outlook, you may refer to the link below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/manage-messages-by-using-rules-HA010096803.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/manage-messages-by-using-rules-HA010096803.aspx?CTT=1</a></span></p>
