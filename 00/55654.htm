<h2>            &#91;FIXED&#93; WL Photo Gallery error when starting Error&#58; Windows Live Photo Gallery encountered an error and can&#39;t start. Error code&#58; 0x80070035</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Original title: WL Photo Gallery error when starting </strong></p>
<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I've been using WL Photo Gallery (latest version) for quite some time but one day it stopped working without me recalling any important change that could had break it.</p>
<p>When I try to run it, it gives this error:</p>
<p>---------------------------<br />
Windows Live Photo Gallery<br />
---------------------------<br />
Windows Live Photo Gallery encountered an error and can't start.<br />
<br />
Error code: 0x80070035<br />
---------------------------<br />
OK&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
---------------------------</p>
<p>I've tried reinstalling it but without luck. I've also renamed the Pictures.pdX files from C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Photo Gallery but with the same result.</p>
<p>Not to mention that the Event Log doesn't contain any logged messages about this and also monitoring the process with Process Monitor didn't show anything that would point me to the root cause of this problem...</p>
<p>If someone from the Live team or an MVP is monitoring this I can send you the Process Monitor output or any other info that might be useful to you.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions on what I can try next?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>I'm waiting for the confirmation from the Live Team guys on this but I've fixed this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error was from the fact that Windows Registry contained stalled records from some network paths that I had on my computer from a former WHS (Windows Home Server) box so basically Windows Explorer - WL Photo Gallery was still attempting to reach those
 network paths although in Explorer / settings there was no references to the WHS paths, so stalled and wrong registry entries...</p>
<p>Replacing the data of those keys in Windows Registry under the HKEY CURRENT USER fixed this issue and I was able to start again WL Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>:)</p>

<h2>            Inaccessible Boot Up Device Windows 10 I beg you for help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10 the free update Microsoft was giving out to everyone. I've had it run normal and fine for weeks until I got a virus from something I downloaded I tried using avast and cleaning the viruses but my computer was still
 laggy and infected so I decided to reset my computer. I went to recovery and it gave me&nbsp;3 options to either restore the computer and keep all my files or to remove all my files (recommended if keeping the computer) and the 3rd option it said to remove everything
 sorry I can't remember exactly and it said (recommended if planning to recycle the computer) so I picked option 2 to just remove all my&nbsp; files and restart my computer fresh with windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started to restart my computer fresh normally and when it was at the finishing point it said
</p>
<p>
</p><p>;( Your computer as ran into a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many many solutions I thought would work. I downloaded the ISO tool from the MS Windows 10 page, the 64 bit operating system one (since my system is 64 bits) in a 16 GB flash drive. It's a HP pavilion made for Windows 7 if that helps any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the USB with the windows 10 on it, when it started up my computer it said what language I want Windows 10 to be so this was the setup to get it. I pressed next it asked me what product key to activate windows was I don't have a windows 10 product
 key cause I got it for free so I pressed skip and accepted the licensing terms. I pressed the Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings and applications then it said to take off the drive with windows 10 I guessed this to be the USB and it told me
 to restart the computer. I restarted it and same thing happens the same error and it endlessly keeps restarting my&nbsp; computer. I tried custom it doesn't work and factory resetting doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it deleted my operating system and now my computer Is useless please help! I regret upgrading to Windows 10 I would just like to revert it back to Windows 7 if it's possible or just make it able so I can use my computer again please please
 help me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A step-by-step guide on how to solve this would be helpful! Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with an HP Compaq laptop from 7.0 64 bit to Win 10.</p>
<p>Pls check whether like on my machine on BIOS opening there is a menu point</p>
<p>restore to default system. In my case it worked back to Windows 7 and</p>
<p>the next step updating to Windows 10 was o.k. As to go back to Windows 7 formatted the HDD</p>
<p>that might help your point as well because that should eliminate any virus topic as well&nbsp;.</p>
<p>After installation please make after updating the system immediately a usb recovery set</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Guenther</p>

            I'm really bad with machines where is this BIOS opening? I tried doing system recover (F11) when it tells me to go to startup menu in my computer but it says that my operating system wasn't found and disconnect any drives that don't contain an operating
 system. This isn't about a virus it's just my computer for some reason my operating system is deleted and it keeps giving me a error screen all my computer now does is just restart..

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue. The BIOS update should be done with the help of computer manufacturer’s support help.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong><span>: </span>
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may use the latest ISO available and perform a custom install of Windows 10 to check if this helps. If you don't have many programs installed, a clean install might be a good choice. Backup the data before you start the
 clean install.</span></p>

<h2>            Back up Failure&#35; &#40;0x80070578&#41; Invalid Window Handle</h2>
                    I have Window 7 PRO 64 OS and I have not been able to run my daily backup for some time. So I cannot remember what software or update that might have broke it. But needless to say I need to get this fix and I hate to do a clean install to fix this backup
 error message (&nbsp;

<div>It is SSD drive just so you'll know.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have&nbsp;verified&nbsp;that Volume Shadow Copy and Windows backup are in started mode.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I have ran System File Checker with no errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have ran SSD drive check with no errors.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Image copy ran fine but I question if I am able to do a restore using that image copy.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community to post your question!</span></p>

<p><span>Based on the above description, it appears that</span> back up fails, you get an error: (0x80070578) Invalid Window Handle. I will be happy
 to assist you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you perform system restore using the image copy, all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced with the contents of the system image.
</p>

            I did have a 3rd party cloning software and I uninstall&nbsp;it and reran backup. Still have the same error message.
<div><br />
<div>I tried the clean boot too. Still the same error message again. ( I was really hoping this would fix the problem ). After I tried that, my&nbsp;PC&nbsp;failed to boot up and I had to walk away from my pc yesterday. Today I disconnect a disk and change the BIO to
 hard drive boot order and then boot to DVD to use the Repair Disc Window 7 PRO 64 bits before. It&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;work yesterday because the BIO order for&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;was different even though I hit PF12 to use the DVD and it&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;find nor repair the&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;before
 I did the changes today.&nbsp;</div>

            I need to add that I also disconnect one of the SSD today before I finally got my system back up today. Not that it has anything to do with the backup. Or does it ? &nbsp;

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you to change the back up device and check with the issue. If you are&nbsp; using SSD to backup, change it to hard drive partition other than C.</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Microsoft does not recommend to take the back up on the same physical device on which Operating system is installed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade fails with error C1900101-4000D at SECOND_BOOT during MIGRATE_DATA</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm upgrading an Acer Aspire from Windows 7, 64 bit (Danish) to windows 10 and get the error "The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error in the MIGRATE_DATA operation".</p>
<p>I have tried following the advice in several posts on this site:</p>
<p>* Anti-virus uninstalled</p>
<p>* Un-essential devices disabled</p>
<p>* Doing a clean boot</p>
<p>* Resetting Windows Update</p>
<p>* Checking the disk/file system for errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing both from the upgrade app and from a dvd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I try next - or even better: how do I determine what went wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Those of us who've been using Windows 10 for over a year now watched all the bugs get worked out in preview.&nbsp; The problems we're seeing now are mainly old OS corruption and factory bloatware choking Upgrade
 and passing issues into it.&nbsp; You can minimize or eliminate this possibility following these steps compiled after helping in several thousand Upgrade cases:&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If confident your hardware is modern enough to meet&nbsp;the
</span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Windows 10 Specifications</span></span></a><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>including any unsupported OS features, then you can bypass Get Windows 10 app in the System Tray to

 the Upgrade which overcomes almost all issues with Get Windows 10 in the System Tray.<span>&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However in the same amount of time it takes to download that option, you can choose the second option "Create Media for another PC" to make bootable flash or DVD media to keep for any needed repairs or reinstall, and can
 be run from Desktop to Upgrade.&nbsp; <strong><span>This media also gives you an extra option to Save Nothing during the Upgrade which overcomes&nbsp;Upgrade choking on corruption or bloated factory installs
 and gets as close to a superior Clean Install as an Upgrade can get.</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To run the Upgrade the media must be opened in Windows 7/8.1,&nbsp;then right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If asked do not insert a Product Key at any time, just click Skip or Next.</span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>If you want to <span>&nbsp;</span>maximize chances for a successful Upgrade, then choose to Save Nothing so the Upgrade has much less to choke on and has less problems after install.&nbsp; Make sure your files are backed
 up separately and you have your program installers and any Product Keys for programs like Office.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To improve the Upgrade's chances turn off everything at Startup:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Windows 7, type msconfig in Start Search Box, uncheck everything on Startup and Services tabs,
<strong>but only after ticking the box in Services to “Hide all MS Services</strong>”.&nbsp; Then click&nbsp;Apply, restart PC when prompted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Windows 8.1, right click Task Bar to open Task Manager, disable everything in Startup Tab, Apply, Reboot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall any anti-virus except Defender.&nbsp; Bloated AV's like Norton, MacAfee, AVG and Avast need to have special

    <title>Lexmark Printer problems with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christiandlt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lexmark Printer problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting the same issues as many others, with not being able to print after a recent Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; I'm using a Lexmark X4650.</p>
<p>I am still able to print on the same printer with a Window XP laptop no problem, but nothing now with Windows 10 Wired or Wireless (when I could print a couple of weeks ago).</p>
<p>I've tried removing the printer and re-installing using Windows 8 drivers, then following all the troubleshooting, and still noting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with others if the ink levels in printer properties are showing question marks this is a good indicator it is&nbsp;not going to work.&nbsp; However when going via Control Panel "View network computers and devices", right&nbsp;clicking on the printer and "View Device
 on Webpage" it does show the ink levels, so the printer is clearly linked to the network, as it does also show up via Word etc when trying to print documents.</p>
<p>Interestingly I could scan from the printer, but only when wired and&nbsp;via the "Device and Printers" Control Panel, and using right mouse clicking on the printer.&nbsp; But even wired I can not print using this printer!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this printer on the Lexmark support page:</p>
<p>http://support.lexmark.com/index?locale=EN&amp;page=content&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;id=OS28</p>
<p>It quotes: "<em>These products were developed before Lexmark had knowledge of the re-designed Windows 10 printing system, but will support basic printing features. Microsoft may choose, at its own discretion, to completely discontinue printing support for
 these products in future Windows 10 operating system updates.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the compatibility of these printers is now at Microsoft discretion?&nbsp; Have Microsoft decided on the latest Windows 10 release to stop supporting this device now does anyone know?&nbsp; This is poor if they have, and needs to be communicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also does anyone know why when removing and reinstalling the device, we now get not only the Lexmark 3600-4600 printer but something called "ET0020003F4D20" too?&nbsp; Is this linked to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there is a setting somewhere that can be changed (via a Microsoft update, or manually) that will allow printing from a printer that is clearly linked, networked, wired or wireless (and used to work on windows 10)??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help with this one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had similar issues with a X5340...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It required some tricks to get it to work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect the printer from the computer... in your case, also turn off\disable wireless..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Devices and Printers "REMOVE" the printer... if you have Lexmark Fax, Remove it first..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In SERVICES turn off the Print Spooler..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the Lexmark Software\Drivers and Reboot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again turn off the Print Spooler...</p>

                    <p><span>Hi</span><br />
</p>
<p>I just upgraded my toshiba laptop to windows 10 but after the installation of the windows 10 to 16% it restarted the laptop then for sometime the small dots kept spinning. After sometime it showed diagnosing your pc for about an hour. Then, it said
 that the laptop didn't restart properly and asked to restart again. I restarted it again, however, it again showed the same thing. Can anyone help to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for the info. But it didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop model is Toshiba Satellite C50- A0f3 with 4GB RAM and its has intel core i3 processor.&nbsp;I think it came with windows 8 version and I updated to windows 8.1&nbsp;afterwards.&nbsp;I had reserved the Windows 10 and everything was downloaded. After the
 download, I started the installation. then, a blue screen with configuring update showed up and it completed successfully. After that a screen showed up with the installation progress of the windows 10. I just waited to complete. However, it was copying files
 up to 53% and the installation bar showed 16%, then it restarted the laptop. After the restart, it showed the loading sign and kept spinning until it showed a blue screen saying '<strong>your pc ran into a problem and needs to&nbsp;</strong><strong>restart'</strong>&nbsp;and
 some more info which I couldn't read as it quickly restarted it. Then, the laptop shows<strong>preparing automatic repair</strong>&nbsp;and goes into&nbsp;<strong>diagnosing your PC</strong>. After waiting for more than an hour it shows unable to diagnose
 and shows another section where I had the option to restart or go to advanced option.</p>
<p>I tried restarting and it didn't work. So, I&nbsp;went into the advanced option where there were many options like restart with Windows 8.1 which didn't work. There was troubleshoot option and I clicked it but my laptop just hanged up on me the first
 time, later I opened the troubleshoot option after a few try and&nbsp;tried to refresh the PC but it said some problem occurred and could not refresh. And last option was just the shut down option.</p>
<p>I have tried to&nbsp;boot&nbsp;with both windows 10 iso and the previous version of my windows 8.1 but it doesn't boot up. It just shows the same thing from the beginning i.e. preparing automatic repair and then diagnosing your pc.</p>

    <title>Issues with amount of memory in Win10 home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with amount of memory in Win10 home</h2>
                    Can anyone advise me if there is a maximum amount of memory that can be used in Win10 home edition with an intel Core Duo2 E7400 @2.8G processor? I purchased a Microsoft refurbished HP Compaq DC5800 as a backup computer which came with 4G DDR2 ram and
 I found it very slow to boot up to usable operation -- takes almost 5 minutes to fully be operational. I also have an HP Compaq 6200 which is my primary computer and it runs Win10 Pro also latest version (1803) --8G DDR3 ram and Intel I3-2100 CPU @3.1G - and
 it takes less than 1 minute to boot and be operational. I bought 8G of DDR2 ram for the refurbished computer thinking that that might be the difference and found that after I installed the 4 2G modules that the BIOS recognized the change and seemed to be OK
 - however after using the computer for a short while (about 10 minutes) the computer made a buzzing noise and shut down and re-started. After this happened 3 different times - I removed the 2G modules and re-installed the 4 -1G memo

            Hi,
<br />it is 4GB for 32-bit and 128GB for 64-bit edition.
<br />see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/desktop/Memory/memory-limits-for-windows-releases#physical-memory-limits-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/deskto...</a>
<br />Hardware may have its own limitations reducing these numbers. 32-bit Windows may use 2-3.5GB depending of hardware.

            Your problem may be related with memory module's incompatibility - please, check compatibility list of your motherboard.
<br />Some memory modules needed non-standard BIOS setting - please, check their documentation.

            No I don't believe there is any compatibility issue - same memory mfgr and model of memory as the 1 G stick. I have re-installed the 4 2G modules and the BIOS and computer recognizes the new amount. Computer boots up much quicker with the 8G rather than
 the 4G, however I am still getting a freeze-up in some cases and I have to power off by pulling the plug. After checking in Reliability Monitor, it appears that I have a software issue that I have to look in to. Still working on that and will see what happens.
 Thank you for your response.&nbsp;

            Thank you for your response. I re-installed the 8G of memory and the speed issue was resolved, But I still am getting a freeze-up problem with the 8G of memory. According to Reliability Monitor - I have a software issue that I have to look into and am
 still working at it.

            I had them in pictures. I was able to do a search using a few keywords I knew were in my photos and found them on my C:// drive under "User" folder vs going under Windows Old and then looking in the User folder. Thank you for responding!

<h2>            Skype Number - Incoming calls do not complete</h2>
                    <p>as of today all incoming calls to my Skype Number (BRA) do not complete. Skype rings on both WIN7Pro as on Android 5.1.1, but when I answer, the connection is totally mute. Skype counts timing as ongoing call, though. The caller hears no sound at all, not
 even the ringing sound... Outgoing calls work fine on both devices. No changes were made on settings or software of any of the devices since yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues what is going on? Any information on technical problems with the Brazilian Skype Number provider?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>We have not received a number of reports concerning an issue with Brazilian Skype Numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try signing out from one of the devices? Change the Internet connection you are using and be sure to sign in to one device at a time only before making a test call to your Skype Number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the same behavior occurs so we can check further. </p>

<h3> sac2rwm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank Screen after inserting PNY Nvidia GeForce GT 240 512MB</h2>
                    
<p><span>Thank you in advance to anyone kind enough to answer my post.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’ve seen this problem posted in a couple of places, yet never seem to get a clear answer to my issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MY RIG</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Model:<span>&nbsp;
</span>HP p6347c</span></p>
<p><span>CPU: AMD Athlon II Quad 630</span></p>
<p><span>RAM: 6GB PC3-10600</span></p>
<p><span>PSU:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>300W…PNY, Nvidia and 3-4 forum replies say this is enough so please do not say that this is the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>On Board Video: yes</span></p>
<p><span>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>THE PROBLEM</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here’s what happened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I first went to my BIOS and ensured that the PCIe was the main video display port.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Inserted the GT 240, started up, logged in and inserted the drivers CD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While trying to install the drivers, I got a message saying that windows way trying to install drivers for the new hardware and was conflicting with the driver install process from the CD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, I stopped the windows driver download, but then couldn’t install drivers from the CD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Frustrated, I rebooted my system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Prior to the log in screen it goes blank.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Black screen.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am “assuming” that this is because Windows 7 has an incomplete driver assigned to the card.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not sure.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can take out the card and use the On-Board and everything is fine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>BUT I DON’T WANT ON BOARD GRAPHICS!<span>&nbsp; </span>When I get home, I’m going to try to install the drivers first…if I can.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>THE QUESTIONS</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How can I uninstall drivers that Windows has assigned to my Nvidia Card?<span>&nbsp;
</span>What other possibilities for this problem are out there?<span>&nbsp; </span>
Can I have the Nvidia card in and still use the OnBoard until I get the drivers installed…then switch over?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please help!!!!!!!!!!!<span>&nbsp; </span>Hopefully I’ve provided enough info.</span></p>

<p>In addition, go into the Device Manager and under Display, remove any reference to the nVidia card.&nbsp; Now reboot the PC, and hopefully it will now let you install the latest drivers from nVidia for your card.</p>

                    My usb doesn't show on my computer but it shows up under devices. When I try to open it from there it will not let me. I tried going into disk management and right click the box where my usb showed, but initialize wasn't an option.

                    A friend tells me that his Windows 10 has no People app.&nbsp; He tries searching for "people" in the search box and nothing comes up.&nbsp; This came to light when I asked him to change his records to show my new email address and he could not find any way to do
 it. My own Windows 10 definitely has a People app.&nbsp; Why is his missing?

<h2>            Reinstalling windows 10 from recovery disk after upgrade from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I like to format my hard disk once in a while to start with a clean system.</p>
<p>Is it possible to create an installation/upgrade folder on external media. My system has a recovery partition with windows 7. So first I would reinstall windows 7 from this partition. But after a year the free upgrade to windows 10 has expired. How can I
 again upgrade to windows 10 after more than one year?</p>

            <p>After you upgrade, make a recovery disk (usb stick) </p>
<p>Boot from that to set it back to the time you upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An ISO will also be available to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Gabriel Aul</em> confirmed on twitter that once you have upgraded you will be able to do a clean install of windows 10 whenever you like. ie. you will not have to reinstall 7 first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intend to -</p>
<p>1) upgrade</p>
<p>2) clean install</p>
<p>3) get it how I want install apps etc</p>
<p>4) use a 8GB memory stick as recovery disk.</p>

            <p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also initiate a clean install by doing the following:</p>
<p>You can do a clean install a couple ways.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + i</p>
<p>Click Update and Security</p>
<p>Click Recovery</p>
<p>Under Remove everything and reinstall Windows, click Get started</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>At the Sign in screen</p>
<p>Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power icon on the screen</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Click Troubleshoot</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Click Reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. Once you upgrade, its yours forever at no additional cost.&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</em></span><span><em>–</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge. </em></span></p>

<h2>            Incompatibility between Windows 10, IE 11 and Java Ver. 8 Update 60</h2>
                    I have a 2-yr old Dell 660 Inspiron desktop PC with Windows 10. I have played&nbsp;Bridge on Pogo.com for years.&nbsp; The game of Bridge requires Java. Currently Pogo.com only supports IE &amp; Firefox browsers.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;Internet Explorer 11 Ver. 11.0.10240.16431 Update
 11.0.22 (KB3078071) and the latest version of&nbsp;Firefox. Recently, I updated&nbsp;Java&nbsp;to Ver. 8 Update 60 and now I can no longer access Pogo.com&nbsp;with IE or Firefox.&nbsp; Dell support technicians were unsuccessful in resolving&nbsp;the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;They advised I would have to
 wait for an update that would resolve the incompatibility issues.&nbsp; Is anyone else having this&nbsp;problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a workaround? Who&nbsp;is working to resolve this issue - Microsoft, Java or Pogo?&nbsp; I miss playing Bridge very much.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

<h2>            Need to export from Outlook 2002 but can&#39;t obtain disk to install the &#34;required translator&#34;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am helping a bookkeeping client migrate to a new computer.&nbsp; He has a massive Outlook 2002 contacts database.&nbsp; When I try to export to CSV, I get the notice: "Microsoft Outlook cannot start the required translator.&nbsp; This feature is not currently installed.&nbsp;
 Would you like to install it now?"&nbsp; I select "yes," but then get the notice that "the feature you are trying to use is on a CD-ROM or other removable disk that is not available.&nbsp; Insert the 'Microsoft Office XP Professional disk and click OK."&nbsp; My client can't
 find his Office disks.&nbsp; I tried my copy of Office Professional 2000 and my copy of Office Basic 2003.&nbsp; Neither contains the required "proret.msi" file.&nbsp; The one site online that claims to have this file available for download is jibberish.&nbsp; Please advise.&nbsp;
 Many thanks.<br />
<br />
Perrin<br />

<br />
P.S.&nbsp; Customer is running XP on an 8-year old ThinkPad - sorry if this is in the wrong forum category ("Windows Vista"), but the site gave me no other options.

    <title>Drawing Tablet Calibration Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lizd89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drawing Tablet Calibration Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello! have a Lapazz/Monoprice drawing tablet (unknown model, unfortunately; my sticker fell off) that I would like to calibrate with my new Windows 10 laptop. I am using an external monitor with this computer to do artwork with; for reasons of display quality
 I am using them in "Extended" style (the display is not duplicated). Here's a screenshot of my "Tablet PC Settings":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/217b220a-6cea-4037-b1ae-dcd998e6118a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/217b220a-6cea-4037-b1ae-dcd998e6118a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell is the external monitor I would like to calibrate my pen with. Right now when I use the tablet, my cursor sticks to the left side of the screen (sometimes one monitor, sometimes the other, depending on how I've fiddled with my settings; when the
 display is duplicated it does not show up at all!) - it will move vertically, but not horizontally. Seems like something a simple calibration could help with, but when I click "Calibrate" I am given three error boxes all in a row:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Failed to enumerate the installed digitizer devices."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"No suitable hardware was found to calibrate. Windows supports calibrating only integrated digitizers."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Invalid display was specified."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have much more luck with clicking "Setup". The screen goes all white, and on my original monitor, the one connected to the laptop, says "Tap this screen with your tablet pen to set it as the Tablet PC screen. If this is not the Tablet PC screen,
 press Enter to move to the next screen. To close this tool, press Esc." I press Enter, and see the same message on my external monitor. When I tap it when my pen, I get the message, "Press Enter to proceed to the next step to complete your configuration."
 I press enter, and my screen returns to normal. The cursor shows up on the external monitor now, but it is still stuck to the left side!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I read on the internet that may help was uninstalling my tablet and letting Windows reinstall it. But I can't find it on my Device Manager. Here's a screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/587563e6-7742-472d-b9c3-26a541fd16ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/587563e6-7742-472d-b9c3-26a541fd16ed" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened and closed a few of these, but I am unsure where to look or what the tablet would be called.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just really stumped with this, the tablet worked perfectly on my last computer and perfectly on THIS one until I added the new monitor. I'm sure the device is in working order and I would hate to buy a new tablet just to find out that there is still
 some sort of issue because I can only a use a certain brand or something (I haven't a clue what "supports only integrated digitizers" means); funds are really tight right now! I'm an admin with all the permissions I need...I can't think of anything else to
 do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be beyond grateful for any help anyone could provide. I know it would be better if I had the model of the tablet or more information about it, but I can't even find the Lapazz website, let alone ask them for support.</p>

<p>Hi Liz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us. Most of the devices that connects to your PC have a functionality called
<strong>Plug and Play</strong>, where the device itself automatically runs its necessary driver on the computer for installation. The fact that you do not see anything in the device manager that may associate with your Drawing Tablet, that means the device
 have not installed its drivers to your computer. As we know, devices drivers are necessary for the computer to recognize your peripherals, especially to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the few reasons why the Plug and Play was not triggered on your computer is compatibility issues. We cannot speak on behalf of the manufacturer of your device, so it is strongly recommended that you contact the right channel of support. Perhaps you
 can search for Monoprice Support Site online as we have seen they have their own website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to run our Microsoft Easy Fix for resolving hardware issues. Kindly visit the link provided here, look for

<p>Hi! I was hesitant to reach out to the manufacturer because of a ... branding? purchasing? issue - I ordered a Monoprice from Amazon and got a Lapazz, and to this day I'm still not sure which wires were crossed or why that happened or if I got duped into
 buying a knock-off or something. But at your advice I did reluctantly do some digging and did find a tablet that looked just like mine (except with a Monoprice logo instead of a Lapazz one, maybe they just renamed the company or something, I have no idea)
 and went ahead and downloaded the installation disc for it, which the website provided. (Link, just in case anyone's curious:
<a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=6814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=6814</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can now see the tablet in the device manager, and the cursor moves! Unfortunately, if I have both monitors active, it tries to map itself to both (which means it is oversensitive to horizontal motion but no so vertically), and the calibration screen still
 does not work - at the "<span>Tap this screen with your tablet pen to set it as the Tablet PC screen</span>" stage, when I tap, nothing happens - but if I set my display to only work on the external monitor, it will ... well,
 more or less go where it is supposed to. Still feels off by a few pixels, so I think possibly there are a better set of drivers out there somewhere, but it's functioning enough that I think I can get by with it!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the troubleshooter if I run into anymore problems - right now I suspect this setup is being held together with metaphorical duct tape and crossed fingers. Thanks so much for your help!</p>

<p>Hey, thanks for keeping us updated as well. It's a breath of fresh air to me that you were able to find an installation disc/software for your device. At least, we already have your device installed, recognized by the computer, and running somehow. Still,
 if any further issues are encountered, you might want to try to update the driver for this device, now that you can see it on the device manager. Note that you might have been able to install the working drivers for your drawing tablet, but who knows it might
 have some updates on it that would have fixed any bugs in the performance of your device. For guidance, please use the link provided here:

<p>Hello, I have a HP G60-100EM which had Vista pre-installed. About a month ago we started having problems when it was booting up. It kept trying to repair itself and would then work normally for&nbsp;a while before playing up at the startup again. Today I managed
 to get the screen to display something at all and got this: StartUpRepair saying Windows cannot repair this computer immediately. Here's the problem signature<br />
<br />
Problem Event Name : StartupRepairV2<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are&nbsp; you able to access Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot?<br />
<br />
This coud be a serious error and need tech support from a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks<br />
at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Vista disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Vista or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though the titles<br />
are named differently.)</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or use a Vista Disk<br />

If you do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy protected. Your<br />

can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

                    Apparently some wizards (notably Linksys) check to see if "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" is installed.&nbsp; However, in Windows 8.1, it is NOT.&nbsp; Apparently, in WIn8.1, it's now called "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)", which is the same thing, but the

            <p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hi Justin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are currently two version of Internet Protocol (IP):
<strong><em>IPv4</em></strong> and a new version called <strong><em>IPv6. </em></strong>IPv4 (<strong><em>I</em></strong><em>nternet
<strong>P</strong>rotocol <strong>V</strong>ersion <strong>4</strong></em>) is the fourth revision of the Internet Protocol (IP) used to identify devices on a network through an addressing system. It works the same as the earlier version with enhanced features.
 To specify the versions of TCP/IP it is has the number 4 and 6 after TCP/IP. Your computer should work the same as it worked with a previous version of Windows.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know in case you need any help on this issue or any issues related to Windows.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I am well aware that "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" is in fact "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)", that is, the old style assumed version 4.&nbsp; The problem is that in Windows 8, it's not
<strong><em>called </em></strong>"Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)", it's called "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" which is not the same string.&nbsp; Some software written in XP days explicitly searches for the string to determine if you have
 tcp/ip installed.&nbsp; Not finding the <strong><em>correct</em></strong> string, the software refuses to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for compatibility, there needs to be a way to install, well, a virtual protocol
<strong><em>called</em></strong> "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" which is just an alias for, or a link to, "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" so that the software is satisfied that you have installed the protocol it wants.&nbsp; Thereafter, I'm sure the software
 doesn't care, and just makes API calls which default to the version 4 routines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By changing the name of the protocol in Windows 8, it is not backwards compatible with software whose authors had no reason to suspect they had to differentiate v4 from v6.&nbsp; What if all the software looking for USB support suddenly had to specify 1.0 or
 1.1 or 2.0 or 3.0 and if not specified, wouldn't work?&nbsp; There has to be a default, a fallback, or else an alias or link, a "fall forward" if you will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, any idea how to do this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for describing the concern in detail. Unfortunately, we do not have a way of renaming that in Windows 8.1, however, if&nbsp;you want to dig deeper into this and see if other power users have any workarounds to this,&nbsp;you may post this once in the
<strong>Technet IT Pro forums </strong>and see if they have any further information available.</p>

            A year and a half later...&nbsp; I was hoping that someone would have written/compiled some files so that under the Network Sharing listing of protocols where you can ADD a protocol you could point to files to install "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" as an installed
 protocol though assumably it actually is or points to the Windows 8.1 now called "Internet Protocol Version 4 TCP/IPv4"
<br />
So far my searching has not turned up anything to allow the older Print Servers to work with Windows 8.1.
