<h2>            Your DNS server might be unavailable</h2>
                    For two weeks I have been running into this problem with my wifi on my computer. I'm running windows 8.1 on an hp pavilion g7. My wifi has been going between normal and limited access constantly around every 10-15 minutes, sometimes every 2 minutes. Every
 time this happens I do reset the router and the modem, it'll work for about 2 minutes then go back to being limited or not connecting at all. It's working on every device I have except my laptop and my brothers laptop. I'm actually using my phone connected
 to our wifi right now typing this message. I tried flushing the DNS server like I've read in other troubleshooting threads but nothing is working. I am very frustrated that this is happening and I have much school work to do using my laptop and having it go
 on and off all the time is very displeasing. If there is some other thing I can do to fix this that would be great. Thank you for your help.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which antivirus program is installed on the computer? </p>
<p>2. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. I would suggest you to perform the steps provided here.
<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

<p>d. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press Enter:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<pre><strong>netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt</strong></pre>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong> If you don't want to specify a directory path for the log file, run the following command instead:</p>
<p>
</p><div>

</p><p>e. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Event ID 41&#40;63&#41; &#38; 6008 - Kernel-Power Crashes in Game without BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having a problem with my computer over the past couple of weeks - essentially when I'm playing a game (usually Overwatch or The Witcher 3), it'll just shut down without warning and power up again. I've checked all the RAM sticks with memtest86
 and ruled out a RAM problem. My system was a Dell Dimension XPS 8300, but I've changed the PSU, casing and GPU. The specs are below (from Speccy):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Operating System<br />
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit<br />
CPU<br />
Intel Core i7 2600 @ 3.40GHz<span>

</span>30 °C<br />

</span>38 °C<br />
Optical Drives<br />
PLDS DVDRWBD DH-12E3S<br />
Audio<br />
Creative X-Fi Audio Processor (WDM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the event logs leaves no clues - I suppose this means it's a hardware problem? Event Viewer only states 2 critical entries each time - one with the Event ID 41 and the other with Event ID 6008</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to your computer? Like installing some software or Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to check this issue by keeping your computer in Clean Boot state. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the below mentioned steps to perform
 Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong><span>Windows Key,</span></strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the

<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>
<span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer. Now try to reproduce the issue to see if it makes any difference in this situation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If a service is causing issue, I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time, reboot and then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one
 by one, till you find the one which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for
<strong><span>Startup's </span></strong>too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer the&nbsp;below article on&nbsp;"<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Perform Clean Boot</a></strong>".

<p>
</p><p>If you really thing that the problem is appearing with the RAM stick, then better I suggest you to get in touch with device manufacturer. Hope they will guide you and assist you with the require information. Before contacting manufacturer, check once by
 uninstalling and reinstalling the games to see if it makes any difference. </p>

<p>Hi, Andre, here is what happens. I am on a HP All-in-One, with Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; When I am not going to be on my PC for a long time; say overnight, I hit the start button and click the power-off button, but choose sleep-mode, so that I can still get updates.
 When I go to log-in, I get my normal screen asking for my password. I enter my PW, and than I typically get a blue screen with a frownie face; i.e. :(.&nbsp; Below the frown is a message: "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're collecting some error,
 info and then we'll restart it for you. 0% complete. on the bottom left of this screen is a QR code and to the right of the QR Code is this text: For more information about this issue and possible fixes, visit https://windows.com/stopcode. If you call a support
 person, give them this info. Stop Code: UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next the PC restarts on its own, goes through a black screen with HP in the center, and then goes to a blue screen with text that looks like old DOS font. The text says: Boot Device Not Found&nbsp; Please Install an operating system on your hard disk. Hard Disk
 - (3FO)&nbsp; F2 - System Diagnostics</p>
<p>For more information, please visit: http://www.hp.com/go/techcenter/startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken it to Best Buy Geek Squad. They were able to restore the system, with no problem. And, I purchased a Passport HD to back my system up to. Then, it happened again, and I called Geek Squad, and the guy wanted me to take it to Best Buy again.&nbsp;
 When I protested, he found a new "cue card" and said, "let's try this," and asked me to go to Microsoft.com. My screen didn't match his in trying to locate where to sign in, so he made a store appt for me. After we hung up, I figured out how to login to microsoft
 from my phone. And, then miraculously, my PC started working again, just fine, no problems. This has happened at least 5 times or so.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks, Andre. I'll give that a whirl. Right now, I'm working on a tight-deadline, and while my PC IS working, I'm going to keep working on my deadlines. I will try the repair upgrade soon, when I can devote full attention to the issue. For now, simply
 not shutting the PC down seems to be helping.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows freezes and crashes &#40;BSOD&#58; &#34;Unexpected Storage Exception&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday I built a brand new PC. I updated Windows, installed drivers, updated BIOS and started playing Metro Exodus. After a few hours, I saw the SSD where Windows is installed to go from 1% to 100% and my computer would freeze. A couple seconds later
 I get a BSOD with the error "Unexpected Storage Exception". So I googled and uninstalled my AntiVirus program (Kaspersky), reinstalled windows, checked my SSD with CrystalDiskInfo and checked my RAM with the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool. Result: No errors
 detected. Everything should work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crashes occur very inconsistently, sometimes it crashed after 30min sometimes after 10 hours. I have nothing running except for my monitoring tools (NZXT CAM, CrystalDiskInfo, Task Manager) and a game (mostly Metro Exodus atm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I just don't know what else to test. I really want to avoid sending in my NVMe SSD for a replacement and I hope someone could help me find an easy fix. I understand that it might not be possible but I really hope you have any ideas.</p>
<p>

            Hi Kai, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />
Open Windows File Explorer <br />
<br />
Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump <br />
<br />
Zip up the contents of that folder <br />
<br />
If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />
Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.) <br />
<br />
Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Kai
<br />
<br />My name is Alex and I am an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />It might be worth running a system file checker. To do this open the command prompt and run the following command sac /scannow 
<br />
<br />If there are corrupt files run the following command to view the log of the files. 
<br />
<br />findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log &gt;"%userprofile%\Desktop\sfclogs.txt"
<br />
<br />The log will appear on your desktop and you will be able to view the corrupt files. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask me any further questions or queries that you have.

<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />It seems like the issue is the NVMe SSD. The next thing that I would try is to check the health of the drive with this HDtune, if you see a problem there then you need to replace the drive.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdtune.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Please give it a try and let me know how it goes.

</p><p>unfortunately that folder doesn't exist or I just can't find it. I also looked for "memory.dmp" but also couldn't find that. Any Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            Hi Kai.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes here for 100% disk usage:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>Thanks for the help guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: All my drivers (motherboard, graphics card, bios, etc..) are up to date and windows has been freshly installed today (v 1809)</p>
<p>2: I ran "sfc /scannow" and it shows no errors</p>
<p>3: Testing the SSD now with HDTune (I've checked it before with CrystalDiskInfo and nothing came up but we'll see)</p>
<p>4: Will do a clean install of the nvidia drivers with DDU after (Yes I use NVIDIA's Geforce experience)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so far, I'll keep you posted on the results</p>

<br />
By far the most common causes of BSOD with new home builds are hardware issues or BIOS, chipset, major driver issues. A lot of different Bug_Check also points to hardware. A real problem with any hardware issue in home builds is the lack of known good components
 to swap in and out. <br />
<br />
Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.
<br />
New builds often have cards that loosen with time or during the build process. &lt;-- please do not fail to do this as I see it over and over.
<br />
<br />
Check with the MotherBoard Maker for updated BIOS and chipset drivers. Also for any onboard device driver updates. Do the same at the individual device makers for updated firmware and device drivers (such as Samsung for the SSD and Nvidia).
<br />
<br />
----- <br />
<br />
After all the above : <br />
<br />
You may need to reduce the system down to as simple as possible including minimum memory.
<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all
 memory tests fail to show a problem. <br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so. &lt;-- best method <br />

<br />
I would like this batch file to run every 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me with a script ? &nbsp;Please ??

            <p>It seems slightly odd to lock the machine if it runs on battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, use copy &amp; paste to paste then code below into C:\Scripts\LockWorkstation.vbs, then use the Task Scheduler to run the script once every ten minutes. Make sure to run the task under the System account.</p>

<h2>            Ridiculous costs for repair. Xbox WiFi hardware problem</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago i contacted xbox support,&nbsp;My xbox could no longer connect to WiFi or ethernet. The xbox gave a: "wifi hardware not working. this xbox needs to be sent in." message.</p><p><br /></p><p>I contacted xbox support and since my xbox was out of warranty, they told me I had to pay 130-150 euro upfront to get it repaired. I didn't agree to this. Then I went online and bought a replacement WiFi module this costs me 12.98 euro's. Today i received the part and put it in. My xbox is working fine right now.</p><p>Its kinda bizarre that xbox support want to charge &gt; 130 euros for a simple WiFi card replacement.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope that people who have the same problem as I had read this and replace the part themselves instead of spending &gt; 130 euros for a replacement which costs less than 1 hour.</p><p><br /></p><p>And xbox you should be ashamed for charging that much.</p><p><br /></p><p>Regards,</p><p>Nick</p>

            <p>While I agree that the cost Microsoft charge for a out of warranty repair is way to much, self repair or getting anyone other than Microsoft to repair your console is a strict violation of the ToU/CoC &amp; will result in a console ban.</p><p>&nbsp;Even discussing self repair on the forums is not allowed.</p>

<h2>            Inaccessible_Boot_Device  BSOD &#91;SOLVED&#93; Windows 10 Pro Build 14393.187</h2>
                    <p>This is not a request for support but more of a request to Microsoft make a recovery option that was available in previous versions of windows available once more. The issue has already&nbsp;been solved, by me. However if one of the Support people wants to chime
 in with their cut &amp; paste "help" solutions on how it would have been solved by them, Please, go ahead do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently went to upgrade my secondary HDD from 1Tb to 2Tb. I put the new drive in my trusty Orico 2598US3 enclosure, and hooked it up to my E-SATA port (and the power cable to a USB port) and copied the partition&nbsp; from one drive to the other. this took
 about 45 Minutes to transfer nearly 1Tb of data to the new drive. afterwards I used Disk Management to expand the partition to fill the entire drive. The new drive was ready for installation. So far so good. I turned off the PC and took the old drive out and
 installed the new drive. Once I finished with the installation, and everything was hooked back up to the PC, I booted up windows. once windows was booted I noticed Icons for programs which resided on the new drive were broken. I went into device manager to
 find the new drive and my O2 SD card slot were listing a Code 19 "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged". deleting the devices and reinstalling the drivers did nothing.&nbsp;neither
 did reinstalling the SATA drivers for my PC. In my haste I accidently uninstalled the entry for my boot drive in the "Disk" category&nbsp;with the problem devices. I finally ended up running the device troubleshooter which said it fixed the issue for the new drive
 as well as the O2 SD card slot. I rebooted when asked. windows started to boot, but then displayed a BSOD displaying the error "Inaccessible_Boot_Device". windows rebooted and attempted to do a startup repair and failed. I first attempted to do a system restore
 which failed and deleted the restore point during the restore operation (probably due to low disk space). attempting to boot to safemode resulted in the same BSOD. I dropped to the command line and ran all the usuals; SFC, CHKDSK. all came back clean. I next
 moved to the command line tools that can be found by using 'dir boot*.exe, DISM' the tool to rebuild the BCD could not fing my windows installation. but a check of the boot drive&nbsp; (currently listed as F:\ under recovery environment) showed all files were present
 and accounted for. DISM and SFC results seemed to back this up. I tried an old win7 recovery CD, and it was able to identify my windows 10 install, but was unable to do anything with it (OS version Mismatch error).My last resort, attempting to do a reset,
 failed as well (but then it never has worked for me). two days of frustration&nbsp;and a little research later, I came across this M$ support article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2795397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2795397">here</a>,
 as a final last ditch attempt to recover my OS, I loaded up the recovery command line once more and brought up regedit. I loaded the hives 'f:\windows\system32\config\system' and 'f:\windows\system32\config\regbackup\system' both loaded bothe appeared to be
 nearly the same, but one had a date before windows started to refuse to boot. so I copied&nbsp; 'system' 'system.log1' and 'system.log2' from 'f:\windows\system32\config\regbackup' to 'f:\windows\system32\config'. by this point, windows Windows refused to boot
 at all displaying some annoying screen saying essentially 'windows had not booted correctly to many times' it would not even allow me access to the recovery environment. I tried one last time to load safe mode. this time it loaded up. Progress? maybe. I told
 windows to shutdown and started up windows normally. after a longer than normal boot, the login screen appeared. I logged in and checked Device Manager, All devices were functioning normally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had similarly&nbsp;issues to this problem before on previous versions of windows, which were able to be solved by selecting "Use Last Known Good Configuration" on the advanced startup menu where safemode&nbsp;is listed as an option. but M$ in all their wisdom
 removed the "Last Known Good Configuration" boot option starting&nbsp;with windows 8. There is a way to get it back for windows 8, but I don't know if it will work for windows 10. Had this useful troubleshooting feature been available as an option, I could have
 saved two days of which I will never get back. I urge Microsoft to re-add the option as an available option to the advance startup menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as part of my research, I looked for solutions to the BSOD 'Inaccessible_Boot_Device'.&nbsp; many of the solutions called for either a reset or a clean install. both of these options are drastically overkill. especially for a problem that MS has provided a solution
 to fixing in past OS versions. I don't know why it was removed as an option, but IMHO it was a BIG mistake. I have followed instructions from
<a href="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-last-known-good-configuration-feature-in-windows-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-restore-the-last-known-good-configuration-feature-in-windows-8-1/">
here</a> to try to re add the option, but as a trade off, the graphic recovery environment is now disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have had an experience where this option would have been useful please post you experience. If you have renabled the feature and you have used it, please post you experience.&nbsp; the more constructive posts, the better. if we get enough, perhaps M$ might
 readd the option to windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Accuweather uninstall&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I installed Pivot animator some time ago, and this Accuweather thing keeps popping up at the taskbar:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad046eeb-95bf-462f-a0a9-b268c10f5246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad046eeb-95bf-462f-a0a9-b268c10f5246" /></a></p>
<p>I looked at some forums and it seems like it's malware. The problem is that there's no way to uninstall it(I don't think). It won't show up in Task Manager and it's not an app you can remove in the control panel. There's also no options to uninstall in the
 app itself, it only has 'Change location' and 'Exit'. Pressing Exit will remove the widget, but at startup it will launch automatically. And also, all the forums that I've looked at said that it was a desktop widget but for me it was in the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Well turns out it was another widget that wasn't even called Accuweather...... It was in the task manager so I just uninstalled it.</p>

<div>I also got this to work with Realtek HD Audio Manager.</div>
<div>There is an option in the settings: 'Make front and rear output devices play two different audio streams simutaneously.'</div>
<div>Check that and you're good.</div>
</blockquote>
<br />
This worked!!!&nbsp; Thanks!!&nbsp; I was thinking I would have to purchase a 2nd audio card to accomplish this task.&nbsp; Can't thank you enough.<br />
<br />
And for the person looking for the option, double-click the Realtek speaker icon in the tray.&nbsp; When the window pops up look along the left side, click on the sprocket (device advanced settings) and you will see the option right there in the middle of the screen.&nbsp;
 Check the box, it will reload the audio driver and you will be good to go!!<br />

<strong>If Neosmart does not work, you may need to reinstall Vista:<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.<br />
</span><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash when you are up and running.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
</span></p>

    <title>I would like to move the control button on the handwriting panel to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garethbaron  say:</h3>
<h2>            I would like to move the control button  on the handwriting panel to the left.-How&#63;</h2>
                    I have a couple of issues with the handwriting panel that I feel would make the Surface incredibly good (handwriting recognition itself is awesome).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;1) The ability to move the control panel in the handwriting panel to the left. Us right-handed people keep hitting it as we write!<br />
&nbsp;2) The ability to have a simple button to recall the handwriting pad. Maybe a pen button?<br />
&nbsp;3) A simple way of closing the handwriting/Keyboard interface. Having to pick a Menu/submenu is bad design!<br />
&nbsp;4) I would like to be able to have a choice of semi-transparent keyboard. This will allow me to see any page info underneath that may be relevant.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;All Said and done, I do think that the writing recognition is really good but a few polishing touches will really make the product Compete with Apple and Google devices.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
please download this reg file from my SkyDrive:<br />
<br />
http://cid-128fc518635be2dc.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/MS%20Foren/Registry/WER%5E_dllhost.exe.reg<br />
<br />
and make a double click on the file to import it.<br />
<br />
When the DLLHost.exe (COM surrogate) crashes, Windows Error Reporting Service [1] creates a dmp file under C:\Localdumps. Please upload the file to your public Skydrive [2] folder and post the link here. I take a look at the dump with the Debugger, maybe I
 can see which Shell extension is the cause.<br />

Your CPU is a bottleneck here. You may try to reduce your video/graphics settings for the game from the game's menu.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with&nbsp;FreakRoach, your CPU is a little under-powered for this game.&nbsp; Either reduce the graphics settings or lock the frame rate to 30FPS for a more stable experience in the game graphics settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minimum processor for this game is the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">i3-4170, your CPU is a little bit under that, performance wise.</span></p>

<p>From what you've told me, you're running a Intel G4600 which is a dual core Intel Processor from the 'Kaby Lake' range.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think your motherboard will support an 8th generation processor, but it will support the 7th gen.&nbsp; The lowest i3 you could have would be a i3 7100.&nbsp; Even then, this is still low end for gaming really.&nbsp; These i3 processors are dual core, most modern
 games now are designed with at least quad core processors in mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An i5 7600k&nbsp; or an i7 7700k would be a much better option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you go ahead and buy something though, can you provide us with your Motherboard make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With either the i5 or the i7 the GTX 1050 would become the bottleneck, although you would still get better performance than with the G4600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Device Manager - if showing it needs a driver, may search and install the proper driver ... if not.</p>
<p>Might look at your attached usb Hub?&nbsp; Visit its support site for its driver.</p>
<p>Asmedia makes usb components. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So either a remote attached hub needs its own driver or your Asus Motherboard has the asmedia built in .. so ask Asus support for usb driver for your motherboard.</p>

<p>Hi Ole,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to do further investigation so that we can identify the cause of the issue. Is this only happening on that specific program? It's possible that this is caused by your video card, overheating, or under powered power supply unit. If you are overclocking
 your device, I suggest that you disable it and see if it has the same issue. I also suggest that you update your video card driver to the latest version and see if there's any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Radney.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already been in an extensive dialogue on the forum pertaining to the game, where I have been guided through all the basic investigative steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my PC for racing games only. I have experienced some crashes on both games that I play at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running Stress tests and Memory test software to no avail. No overheating takes place. My PS unit is capable of delivering 750 Watts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Overclocking is taking place, and Intel Turbo Boost has been turned off, since I started to troubleshoot. Even my RAM is running on 2133 MHz even though it is capable of 4 GHz with X.M.P. (also turned off for the time being).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any PSU and GPU related utilities have been uninstalled. The latest Nvidia driver has been installed but not before having removed all old files with the DDU Uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have a feeling that my issue are TDR related though, because in my log, I get lots of "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered" messages together with a bunch of unspecified hardware fails, like the one shown above.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Here's the link to my post in the Project CARS forum from where I have received guidance so far. Snapshots of my screen showing the results of the Ram test are to be found there as well:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?62367-HELP!!-My-game-keeps-crashing-on-my-PC</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks for your advice so far. I hope that you may help me understand the original error message, though.</p>

            For further isolation. What is the exact error message (not on the reliability monitor) when your game crashes? Also, did this just recently happened? Did you made an update, or install any program before this issue happened? You can also try running the

<p>Thanks for all the good advice. But I have now located the hardware failure in question, and it turned out to be my GPU card as I suspected all along.</p>

<p>An update to my situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the last few days I have continued testing my setup. I even completely uninstalled my Oculus gear to make sure that the VR equipment wasn't the culprit. Sadly, when gaming the game continued to freeze/close down after a short while.<br />
<br />
So I installed the test software PCMark, 3DMark (both published by Futuremark) together with the **** GPU stress-tester Furmark.<br />
<br />
My PC fared well in the PCMark test but crashed during both of the GPU Stress tests. So I went over to a friend were we performed the exact same tests on his PC. It passed without any problems at all.<br />
<br />
Then we switched GPUs so my PC was using my friend's GTX 1070 card and his PC was using mine. And guess what? The problem transferred to his PC whereas my PC was suddenly able to perform all GPU Stress tests with no issues encountered at all.<br />
<br />
So now I will RMA my GPU and hopefully soon be receiving a new and better graphics card.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all the help so far.</p>

<h2>            How to disable Scroll Lock and enable F-Lock permanently&#63;</h2>
                    This has got to be one of the stupidest buttons on modern keyboards. &nbsp;If its in the wrong setting it can REALLY mess you up. How do I eradicate this? &nbsp;And, since the answer probably involves the registry, perhaps someone bright here can enlighten us on
 how how to control the F-Lock key too? &nbsp;Both are never used by 99.99% of computer users once set in their most useful positions. &nbsp;I think all of us want F-Lock on and Scroll Lock off. &nbsp;Once set they should be locked so they can never be activated by accident.
