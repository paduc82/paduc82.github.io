<p><strong>You can change your motherboard, move the license to a different computer if you wish. Windows 8 OEM includes flexible licensing allowing you make as many changes as you wish.

<p><b>"Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? </b>You may transfer the software to another computer that belongs

<p>that i can't use the same key if i replace the motherboard. i see in your quote of the agreement that it says the key can be used by another computer belonging to you but the motherboard issue is still grey. if this is the case then if the motherboard is
 changed i assume the OS needs to be reinstalled. is this correct?</p>

            In general, a motherboard contains the RAM and the CPU.&nbsp; Together they make a "computer."&nbsp; Therefore, "we" can say changing a motherboard makes a new computer.<br />
<br />
And yes, normally you would have to re-install Windows once the motherboard is changed.&nbsp; Questions still not complete answer:<br />
<br />
1) How many time can "we" activate the Windows 8 OEM via the Internet?<br />
<br />
2) Can the Windows 8 OEM be "re-fresh" with an "in=place" reinstall on top&nbsp; of the installed version?<br />

            <p>Thanks for the response. From what you said it sounds like it'sa toss up whether installing a motherboard will allowed the key which we purchsed to use will be valid. there in lies my issue with the key usage. if we pay to use this licensed key we should
 be able to reuse it on a new computer whether that be a completely new box or a new motherboard/cpu in the same box reinstalling or repairing windows 8 pro. It says in the agreement that we can use the key on a new computer if we remove windows from the old
 computer. How would microsoft know right away that the OS was removed. I know that eventually that microsoft will see the key on multiple machines thru the updates but there shouldn't be any way of knowing in the same day so by the time an upgrade is done
 there should only be 1 key on 1 machine. I'm about to remove win 7 from my machine and install the oem version of windows 8 pro but i do want to upgrade my motherboard and cpu in the near future just not tomorrow so this is a concern to me. Can we get a definate
 answer on this or is this a best guess scenerio? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw thanks for the reply. i do appreciate it </p>

            Hi, I have the same question, but with Windows 8 Pro instead (non-OEM). Will I be able to transfer my license like this? I have Windows 7 Home pre-installed on the other computer.

            Windows 8 "non-OEM" versions are "upgrade" licenses, which can always be trasnferred to antother system.&nbsp; You will still need a qualifying older version of Windows on the "other" computer and remove the upgrade on the previous one.

            Hi Guys,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Browsing the forum and I came across to this thread. I'm also planning to buy a new motherboard. Bought the Windows 8 upgrade version ($39.99). Can I re-install this again to the new motherboard? My key was only activated once. I also saved the windows
 installer on a USB drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To my understanding, you can install windows 8 5 times without having to reactivate it via the phone. Is this correct?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know if this has been answered, I just want to clarify things before proceeding to buy the motherboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers!</div>

            You can always re-use the upgrade version.&nbsp; It will still need an installed /&nbsp; activated older version before you re-apply the upgrade.&nbsp; You still may have to activate the upgrade by phone, after the first activation.<br />
<br />
No, the 5 times information is misleading!!&nbsp; Microsoft only permits a purchase of 5 different upgrade licenses per Microsoft Store customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Bought Win8 Upgrade and installed over Win7. About a week after this I changed motherboard, CPU, Memory and HD to SSD. I had to completely reinstall using my iso image. During the installation I had to phone MS. The activation was carried
 out by an automated service asking me for the ten blocks of five letters each which were on my computer screen prior after try to reactivate. You have to enter the numbers a block at a time so pay attention and make sure that you get it right. The whole process
 is user friendly and mistakes can be corrected. However you might get a bit stressed out. If everything checks out, you will be given another ten blocks of five numbers to enter on you computer. You can ask for repeats and again correct errors. Finally press
 finish and your software will be reactivated. If you then add or re-add features such as Media Server to you PC your old key will not be accepted and you will have to go through the above process again. Before you start any of this process make sure that your
 phone is on speaker and you know where your * and # buttons are. If you write the final numbers down it might help but I don't think that they are reuseable and are generated each time by your imput. Any way "Have Fun" I did.<br />

            Hi Lorenzo,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Driver updates are better to be installed by the manufacturer so I would suggest you to hide this.
<br />
<br />When the update is offered, hide this update using the following troubleshooter tool:
<br />
<br />Download Windows 10 Updates Troubleshooter Tool from Microsoft
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F2...</a>
<br />
<br />Click on "Hide updates" option and you'll be able to hide desired update given in the list.

                    I really would like Microsoft Sam/Microsoft Mike on Windows 7 but apparently you need XP to get it. If you could give me a download link to either, maybe both, that would be awesome!

Step 1b: If your computer is 32 bit, just run the x86 .bat file under Administrator.</p>
<p>Step 2: Only do this step and Step 3 if you've done Step 1a. Go to&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\SpeechEngines\Microsoft\TTS\1033 and copy four files: Mary.sdf Mary.spd Mike.sdf Mary.spd<br />

    <title>Network printer offline&#59; private network problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williambarron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network printer offline&#59; private network problems</h2>
                    <p>Seven wireless desktops and one wireless HP printer. No issues Windows 7. Upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCs had a lot of problems staying connected to wireless network.</p>
<p>Lost ability to connect to "Home" network; no longer an option; can't reset; now each PC is connected via "private" network status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had to turn off advanced firewall rules in order to connect PC's as "private"; since Windows firewall default idiotically blocks all inbound connections for private/public networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the 7 desktops connect fine to wireless; but there's no homegroup and network printer shows offline.</p>
<p>Unable to restore homegroup-or reset to "home" network status- or get the printer to work.</p>
<p>(Note: Printer does &nbsp;work fine when connected by cable ... or printing wirelessly from Samsung phone or iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How do I restore internet to "home" (vs private) network status; so I can restore homegroup and share?</p>
<p>2) If #1 not possible; how to get HP4500 network printer to be seen by the 7 desktops while they are in "private" network mode?</p>
<p>

Still using "private" network connection; "home" network not appearing; not able to connect to other network PC's or network printer</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
1) Setup "homegroup" on each PC. This accomplished nothing as the PC's don't "see" each other under a "private" network setting</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
2) Based on seeing err code 0x80070035, I turned off the firewall on "domain" ... the firewall on "private" having already been opened / shutdown (if you don't open it, you can't connect to the internet at all!).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
This enabled one of the PC's to "see" some of the others .. but not to connect to them or to "join" their homegroup. The other PC's still do not see any of the others.....</p>

Problem finally resolved:</p>
<p>
Somehow in the elimination of the "home" network, the ARISS router "AP" setting was turned on; setting up each device as its own private network. Although the Windows 7 and XP and Apple devices could see each other (and the printer work) the Windows 10 devices
 could not see each other.</p>
<p>
The ARISS router has been reset; the firewalls restored; and the system works. Let's hope we don't need to go through this process with the next "update".</p>
<p>
Thanks all for you help.</p>

<h2>            Change boot partition from startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change the active startup-partition in order to try an ubutu-instalatio located on another partition. But when i restarted my computer it turned out that the partition i had selected as active had no operating system on it, so now I only get the
 message "Missing operating system" on startup. Is there a way to change the active partition from where I am? As you can understand, I can't use the tools that an operating system provides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h2>            SyncToy as a Scheduled Task - How to see results of run</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone: I am using SyncToy (2.1 x64) on Windows 10 to backup files. When I execute the program manually (by opening SyncToy, selecting folder pairs and running) the program displays the results of the run, which is useful for confirming that everything
 went OK (or not). When I execute the program from a scheduled task, while it runs OK, the process flashes by in a
<em>Run </em>window which closes as soon as the program ends, and it is not possible to see what happened during the run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to view or capture SyncToy run statistics from a Scheduled Task execution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers. . .</p>

<ul>
<li>Why am I running SyncToy as a Scheduled Task? I am using SyncToy to perform regular backup of files in an office situation, and I need this to run at specific times (every day) without any manual intervention.</li><li>Am I facing any issues when I run the program normally? No, but I would like to see the same statistics produced by the "normal" run when it is run as a Scheduled Task.</li></ul>

            <p>Who answers these replies when someone has major trouble upgrading to Windows 10?&nbsp; I don't need&nbsp;link to something that has already been failing to begin with.&nbsp; Where is the contact button right to Mircosoft Customer Care or 800 number?&nbsp;I would be glad to
 talk to an overseas technical&nbsp;person.&nbsp; Funny, now that what I have been through I am receiving scam calls from people saying that they are from Microsoft and would like to help me set up Windows 10 for a fee of course.&nbsp; Does Microsoft have a legit&nbsp;department
 that&nbsp;handles customers?&nbsp;&nbsp;With times as they are and people trying to save money where they can, here comes a freebie that costs more to fix then actually buying a new computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;My computer a HP TouchSmart IQ504 Windows 8.1 up to date.&nbsp; Windows/Microsoft did
 there little download exe program to see if my computer qualified for the upgrade.... sure enough my computer passed.&nbsp; Working on the computer, then all of a sudden the screen goes blank.&nbsp; Waiting, waiting, waiting, oh and waiting...&nbsp; 3 1/2 hours later the
 my computer reboots and it starts loading Windows 10.&nbsp; Exited I was sure, new Windows 10, heard a lot about it.&nbsp; My roommate also heard a lot about Windows 10 for the next 3 days when the computer would not restart, reboot, restore to previous version...&nbsp;
 nothing...&nbsp; Started scrambling, but wait I had a Microsoft back, the one backup you do before the install is initiated.&nbsp; I showed a sigh of relief.&nbsp; So for the next two day, I started with restoring my computer to its original manufacture condition.&nbsp; Well
 when I say Circuit City, does Vista come to mind?&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, my machine grew from Vista to Windows 7, to 7 Premium, to 8, to 8.1, to 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; SO I thought ok I am finish all the Window installs and brought it back up to Windows 8.1 pro, and went to restore from
 8.1 Pro back image that I performed with the backup instructions within 8.1 pro, and guess what?&nbsp;&nbsp; I think you all guessed it, the f'n image back was corrupt.&nbsp; I lost everything.&nbsp; I am going to think twice now about Microsoft products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in the hell is
 Bill Gates?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wanted to let everyone know that I am not the only upset with&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;and&nbsp;believe this is&nbsp;going to cause&nbsp;a lot of class action lawsuits down.&nbsp;Heard&nbsp;from a sources that Microsoft was tight lipped on its problems with the release, so they just let
 it happened.&nbsp; Customers (me over 20-25years) have be let down, kicked to the curb, when it comes to support, advise...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thumbs Down for Windows 10&nbsp; from me.</p>

            <p>Hi Billy -</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;HP's have the worst load of bloatware in the industry and typically choke on a Windows 7 Repair Install which is the same as an in-place Upgrade you attempted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are gettting by with disabling all Startup freeloaders which allows Upgrade to run.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Easiest now will be to <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/ss/windows-8-clean-install-part-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&nbsp; Clean Install Windows 8 or 8.1 [Walkthrough]</a> </p>
<p>using the media provided at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create installation media for Windows 8.1 - Windows Help.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete all partitions during the booted install to get it cleanest.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After install, do all Updates, confirm Activation, save a backup image of the completed install in Backup Center to go back to at any time in the future since Windows 10 allows you to go back to the old OS as long as you delete the Windows 10 partition first.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp; try <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - Windows Help.</a>&nbsp; You can used the automated first option by ticking the box shown, or choose For another PC to make bootable installation media for future repairs and reinstall.&nbsp; However to use this media
 for the Upgrade, it should be opened from within 8.1 to right click Setup file to Run as Admin, and not booted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Upgrade will be the same as a Clean Install, and hopefully smooth sailing without the bloatware interfering.&nbsp; Let us know how it goes, and if you have any other questions.&nbsp;

            <p>Did you rview the XP No Boot Troubleshooting Steps in the sticky post at the top of the forums?</p>
<p>They were virtually useless, I am glad they took them down.<br />
</p>
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<p><br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown? &nbsp;(this includes plug pulling,&nbsp;power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)</p>
<p>Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?</p>
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
Fill in the blank:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My system was working fine until: _________________________________________.<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
<p>I decided to save up points for a new puppy instead of a pony!</p>

<p>We are working through the holidays to deliver a fix for the small number of customers that have experience decreased battery life and booting/sleeping problems&nbsp;as a result of the December update.&nbsp; We took the update down to prevent additional customers
 from ending up in this state.&nbsp;All hardware failures, none of which are known to be caused by the December update, are being handled promptly&nbsp;through our warranty exchange policy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The UEFI firmware that we released in the December update prevents some devices from entering sleep mode (and other low power states)&nbsp;properly during periods of inactivity. In order to release an updated version of the UEFI firmware&nbsp;we need to test the new
 version with the other drivers in the set to make sure we are not releasing yet another unknown state to customer machines. We certainly feel your pain and assure you that we are doing everything possible to make this right, as quickly as we can.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <div>Greetings all,</div>
<div><br />
<div>We understand that the February Firmware Update has fixed the Battery gauge issue and the Firmware showing as failed. However we can see that there are some customers who are still experiencing issues with their Surface Pro 2 going into Sleep mode and
 Hibernate.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So we can better track those particular issues, we have decided to close this thread off. We encourage you to create a thread related to your Surface Pro 2 not going to sleep or not going into Hibernate. Please give as much detail as possible to your scenario.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We understand that the February Firmware update did not resolve the issue with waking from Sleep or Hibernate, as it was not intended to fix that particular issue. We are continuing to work to deliver a high quality solution. More updates will become available
 as this effort progresses.</div>

<h2>            Hibernation takes a long time.</h2>
                    I recently got a new laptop, and for the first week or so, the time it took to hibernate was quick.&nbsp; Various programs and updates were installed, and now it takes 2-3x more time to complete the same process.&nbsp; Wake up from hibernation in both cases has
 stayed fast.&nbsp; I've tried disabling and enabling hibernation and I've deleted the hibernation file to make Vista create a new one, and the first time after that process hibernation is fast again, but after that it goes back to its process of just sitting there
 with no hdd access for 10-15 seconds before turning off.<br />
<br />
Any idea what could be causing this?

            Callum - I've had this problem recently, and write caching needs to be enabled.&nbsp; (The difference in speed is pretty drastic - it's not the usual story of the registry gradually kludging up.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, Randomg, Right-click C drive (assuming Windows is installed on C), Properties, Hardware tab, choose the hard drive that represents C, Poperties again, Policies tab, Enable write caching.<br />
<br />
Sorted?<br />

 it's faster than older one and i want windows 7 to run on it and Hitachi one to be just for backup or recovery hard drive, so do i just need to format both hard drives and then to install windows 7 on second hdd or what ? THANKS!

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Instead of formatting both just swap the drives (move the cables) so the WD is the C:&nbsp; (primary) and the
<br />
Hitachi is the D: (secondary). Then format and install Windows on the new C:.<br />
<br />
Then you still have the installation on D: which you could swap back to if needed. Once you have the system<br />
running on the new drive and have all the data from the old drive on it then you can format D: to remove
<br />
everything on it.<br />
<br />
Remember you need backups of any data from any drive OFF of that drive before you format it which wipes<br />
the drive clean.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Audio fails on start-up &#40;half the time&#41;</h2>
                    When I start my XP-Pro system, the audio fails. Clicking on the icon in Start/Settings/Control Panel labeled "IDT Audio Control Panel" results in a beep coming from the mother board, not the speakers. Then when I re-start the system with Start/Turn Off
 Computer/Restart, the system re-starts, and the audio runs normally from the speakers. I hear the usual music on start up. I would like to resolve this without having to completely re-install Windows XP.

            <p>The troubleshooter did not work.&nbsp; Then "send troubleshooter results" did not work, either.&nbsp; It would not connect after several attempts to send the 'capcha' message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drivers came with the board, an Intel DG45ID.&nbsp; I tried updating with drivers as instructed on the Intel web page.&nbsp; That did not resolve it.&nbsp; Then I went back to the driver that came on the disk with the mother board.&nbsp; That's where it stands, now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is temporarily resolved when Windows XP is re-started.&nbsp; Then I hear the audio from the speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before&nbsp;XP stops there is another error message apparently indicating the Intel audio driver did not stop normally.&nbsp;&nbsp; The error message says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>End Program - Sigmatel-IDT-SysTray</p>
<p>Ending Program...Please wait</p>
<p>If you choose to end the program immediately, you will lose</p>
<p>any unsaved data.&nbsp; To end the program now, click End </p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to this issue?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The installation worked OK on a previous install of Windows XP on another hard drive.&nbsp; I needed increased capacity and bought a new hard drive.&nbsp; I installed Windows XP-Pro (SP3)
 on it, as instructed.&nbsp; I was directed to the Intel web page&nbsp;for updated drivers.&nbsp; I used them.&nbsp; I believe that's the source of the problem, and I may have to reinstall Windows using only the drivers on the disk that came with the Intel DG45ID mother board.</p>

            <p>Additional tests:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Run and Dxdiag, I find one "Sound" tab.&nbsp; Proceeding to it, I find everything empty, as if it had not been installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when exiting and re-starting Windows XP, it does not shut down immediately.&nbsp; Instead there is an error message window mentioned above.&nbsp; It says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>End Program - Sigmatel-IDT-SysTray</p>
<p>Ending Program...Please wait</p>
<p>If you choose to end the program immediately, you will lose</p>
<p>any unsaved data.&nbsp; To end the program now, click End </p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it appears the sound driver is not recognized.&nbsp; When Windows XP Pro re-starts, the sound appears to run normally.&nbsp; All the sound tests listed in Dxdiag then appear to run normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Run and Dxdiag, I then find two "Sound" tabs.&nbsp; Both show the same information, except one is labeled with the tab "Sound1" and the other "Sound2"&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver name on both is shown as sthda.sys.&nbsp; It is shown as Version 5.10.6107.0001 (English), Provider:
 IDT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that shutting down Windows does not end the program normally, and on the next start up (except for a "re-start") it is not recognized at all - - until there is a "re-start" when the audio operates again.</p>

            <p>You may need to install your system specific sigmatel drivers. Sigmatel was bought out by IDT, or is it the other way around. it would be very helpful to know the name of you pc manufacturer.</p>

            <p>The sound is now working - but I suspect if I shut down the computer I will have to re-start it twice to get the sound going again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report from Dxdiag shows two tabs for the same Sound installation.&nbsp; The tabs are labeled Sound&nbsp;1 and Sound 2.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The content of each appears the same.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take it this is not normal, and I believe if I can find a way to delete&nbsp;"Sound 2" I may have an answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there a way to proceed with that, maybe without using Regedit?</p>

            <p>Sorry i took so long to reply. Do you also see two of these installations in device manager?&nbsp; It seems a lot of people have problems with sigmatel drivers but i am glad you have the sound working again. All i can offer you is the link below that may offer
 you clues as to how to proceed. </p>

<h2>            HDMI won&#39;t use dedicated card on Windows 10</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>I've now waited 2 months with no fix and no further replies from a Microsoft rep. I have reverted to Windows 8.1 and will not be using, buying, or recommending Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original post follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 from 8.1, the HDMI will only use the integrated video card on my laptop, and will not use the dedicated video card.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I checked Dxdiag. the Windows 10 display settings, the integrated Intel 4000 Graphics properties, and the Nvidia properties, and I've disabled the integrated card. I've even tried disabling the integrated card through the BIOS, but the BIOS included
 with this laptop is anemic and has no display settings options there. (even after updating the BIOS through HP) I've updated drivers, OS, and HP manager multiple times since upgrading to no avail. &nbsp;I made sure to exhaust all options on my side before posting
 here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dxdiag says it's using the Intel integrated card</p>
<p>Disabling the integrated card on Windows 10 stops all video and audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*side note: disabling the integrated video card when I was using Windows 8.1 months ago stopped all sound, while the dedicated video card worked fine, leading me to understand the audio is dependent on the integrated video card being operational.
 Disabling the card in Windows 10 makes the screen black with no audio and a no device connected warning on TV through HDMI and looks worse than usual on the laptop monitor*</p>
<p>
</p><p>The model is HP 15-j058ca<br />
</p>
<p>I was told by&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a37aef47-f80f-4cf2-a41a-4124edff4f3b" title="Jessen P">Jessen P</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;to
 make sure the sound was using the HDMI as default. This was unhelpful at best, as the sound works perfectly fine, and a cursory look at my post should have ruled that out.</span></p>

            You mentioned a lot - but not the versions of the drivers you installed for both cards (I would recommend NOT disabling either internal video device - but making sure the device drivers installed are the latest direct from the manufacturer for the OS in
 question. &nbsp;If you have to run them in compatibility mode: give up and go with the OS that is officially supported by the hardware vendor.)

<h2>            product key for win 8.1 single language built 9600</h2>
                    <p>I bought a dell laptop last years , with windows 8 pre-installed. Windows then automatically updated to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to access the "Add features to windows 8.1" which asks me for my product key. I have used belrac and cmd to find my "original product key", but when I put this key in it is saying "This key wont work. Check it and try again, or try a
 different key"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an official windows 8.1 and it is showing as being activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the key i am using is my windows 8 key and it changed in the update to 8.1? If so how do I find out the new one?</p>

            <p>Hi Aida,</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to download or where you're trying to download from, but if you want to keep it simple a good place to start would be to open your
<strong>Windows Store </strong>app, then type <strong>MP3 downloader </strong>into the search box and hit enter; that will give you about a dozen or so free options to get you going.&nbsp;
