            <p>The phone will set up the new SD card [not just format it] &amp; will set up the phone to use that new SD card so you will need to let it do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Unless there is any specific advice on your phone maker's website or your ISP's support pages for that type of phone:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp; Make a note of the downloaded apps in your phone &amp; also any apps that have been set to use the SD card as you&nbsp;may need to re-download or at least check the setup of these apps when you have finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp; Put your old SD card in your PC SD card reader [using a MicroSD card adapter, if applicable].&nbsp; Or connect the phone to the PC &amp; set the phone's connection options to
<em>Disk drive</em> / whatever term your phone uses for its connection types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Copy your user files, such as music tracks, from the folders you find on the SD card* to somewhere handy on your PC and make a note of the folders they came from.&nbsp;
<em>The folders used&nbsp;vary between phone OSs &amp; also, possibly, between different makes or even models so you will probably need to look at each folder in turn to find out what's in them.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4&nbsp; Once the copies are on the PC check them again as you could cause&nbsp;a problem if you later copy back system-related or application-related files onto the new card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5&nbsp; Connect the phone to the PC &amp; set the phone's connection options to <em>Disk drive</em> / whatever&nbsp;term your phone uses for its connection types.&nbsp; [You could try switching the phone off then putting the new SD card&nbsp;in your PC but you would have to ensure
 that Windows did not try to "repair"&nbsp;its file system by reformatting it.&nbsp; You'd then have to put it back in your phone when you have finished copying to make sure that the new SD card remains fully usable.&nbsp; Only switch the phone back on when the SD card is
 in it or the phone's OS will try to repair itself for the detected absence of the SD card that it has previously set itself up for]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6&nbsp; Copy across your user files from the PC to the phone's SD card&nbsp;- again, be careful not to copy any system-related or application-related files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&nbsp; Check the downloaded apps in your phone &amp; also any apps that have been set to use the SD card as you&nbsp;may need to re-download or at least check the setup of these apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- - - - - - - -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Just as a set of examples, my HTC Desire X with Android 4.1 uses these SD card folders:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DCIM [photos &amp; pre-4.1 upgrade screenshots]</p>
<p>Download [downloaded documents, with pdf files often being in the subfolder <em>
Adobe Reader</em>]</p>
<p>Music</p>
<p>My documents [for files made using the installed Polaris Office, with sound recordings being in&nbsp; a subfolder
<em>My recordings</em>]</p>
<p>Pictures\Screenshots [a new folder that contains screenshots since the 4.1 upgrade]</p>
<p>Podcasts [ones I have downloaded directly from their source]</p>
<p>Ringtones</p>
<p>sms_backup [for deliberately saved backups of my sms app]</p>
<p>[my Meercel RSS reader keeps its cache in subfolders of com.meercel.feedreader.rssdemonad]</p>
<p>[my Meercel RSS reader keeps its exported list of feeds (opml file) in the root folder of the SD card]</p>
<p>[my BookmarkSB importer/exporter keeps its backed up browser bookmarks in the BookmarkSB folder]</p>

            <p>You will have to find some discs to install, there is no recovery section if the disk has been completely formatted, you can look in disk manager and see if there is a hidden partition of approx 5gb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if there is one, then you would have to look at your user's manual for how to access the recovery partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please note that if xp was upgraded to vista, then the xp license is invalid as the vista license is now valid for that particular pc.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you using any Roxio or Nero programs? These have been known to cause this problem even<br />
if they were working well for a long period of time. If so check with their support.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Check these :</p>
<p>Error message when you try to resume a Windows 7-based or a Windows Server 2008 R2-based<br />
computer from hibernation: "Stop 0x0000009F"<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977186</span></a></p>
<p>Stop error when you put a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 to<br />

<p>You can use BlueScreenView to paste the BSOD info into a message here.<br />
<br />
VIEW - HTML Report ALL ITEMS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; Right Click on a BSOD line and select same. Then copy and<br />
paste the lines in to a message here. Be sure and check the filename section. Also check the time<br />
in MyEventViewer for other possible information.<br />
<br />
<br />
===========================================================</p>
<p>Check with these utilities to see if any information can be gathered : (Be sure to run this since there<br />
may well be other Bug_Check codes.)<br />
<br />
This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information<br />
<br />
<strong>BlueScreenView</strong> - Free -&nbsp;scans all your minidump files created during 'blue screen of death' crashes,<br />
and displays the information about all crashes in one table.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen (BSOD) to within a second or so of the<br />
time of the BSOD to provide more information as to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
<strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file -<br />
set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the BSOD.<br />

<p><strong>AppCrashView </strong>- Free -&nbsp;a small utility for Windows Vista and Windows 7 that displays the details of all<br />
application crashes occurred in your system. The crashes information is extracted from the .wer<br />
files created by the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component of the operating system every<br />
time that a crash is occurred. AppCrashView also allows you to easily save the crashes list to<br />
text/csv/html/xml file. <br />

<br />
================================<br />
================================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See next message for my<br />
generic driver update methods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 9F&nbsp; 0x0000009F&nbsp; &lt;-- read this<br />

            <p>Thx, but read this board. I don't know if it's virus, but ever since it came aboard the PC is dorked up. There's plenty of talk on this site about how to remove bogus versions of taskeng.exe. The first step is to search for it in safe mode. But my laptop
 won't run search in safe mode. So yeah, something is very wrong. Thx. </p>

    <title>Few icons in Taskbar not functioning well after Disk Cleanup in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Few icons in Taskbar not functioning well after Disk Cleanup in Windows 10</h2>
                    Recently I did a Disk Cleanup in Windows 10. But only after that few icons like the Start button, Search and even the Calendar in the Taskbar not functioning at all. The computer didn't open those applications when these icons are clicked. I believe there
 are few files in the Setting that had been deleted during the Disk Cleanup, but I don't know what are they. Can somebody help me to solve the problem? Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with the concern, we recommend running the troubleshooter on this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, it can help fix problems in opening the Start menu or Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after running the troubleshooter, we suggest restoring from a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore point</a></strong> to bring back the settings of the computer before you've encountered the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <span><strong><em>Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</em></strong></span></p>

<h2>            install win 10  says please wait and then just sits there all day&#63; what now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I installed win 10 on my win 7 laptop than removed it and went back to win 7 which works ok. Now I'm ready to try win 10 again but when I click on the win 10 icon it just says wait. I've waited all day with nothing happening. What now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stumbled around and got win 10 to install. Now it says Getting Updates and then says "checking for updates 0%". It also says" this may take a few minutes" but this has been going on for 30 minutes so far, The NEXT and BACK buttons don't work. How long
 is a few minutes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cancelled the above update. Now it says "setup is cleaning up before it closes this may take a few minutes" seems to be going on and on and on.. Now I remember why I abandoned win 10 and went back the win 7. MS has done it again. No wonder it's free, as
 all would ask for a refund. Very frustrating!</p>

<h2>            No Apps are installed to open this type of link</h2>
                    My new Dell came with Win 8 installed. Now I can not click through HTML links in Eudora. When I try I get a Pop-Up box with "No Apps are installed to open this type of link" and a link to the Apps Store. These are just regular links to a website. FireFox
 should load right up with the page.<br />
<br />
I do not want to change over to IMAP or use MS Mail. Nor do I want to have IE as the default. This all worked fine with Windows 7 for several years.<br />
<br />
Can this be fixed or do I need to get Win 7 again?<br />

            <p>It seems as if Windows 10 changes the driver system used with iPod. Follow these steps to correct the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Connect your iPod</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ensure that the latest version of iTunes is installed. To check, first show the menu bar by using the keyboard combination
<strong>Ctrl + B</strong>, then clicking <strong>Check for Updates.</strong></p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Open Control Panel (not Settings). Head over to <strong>Hardware and Sound &gt; Devices and Printers</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You should see the Apple iPod listed in the unspecified section. Right-click it, and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>

<h2>            catwoman dlc xbox 360 pal</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>i have downloaded the batman: arkham city game from the xbox live two days ago. when i am starting to play it's telling me that i can download a free catwoman content. so&nbsp; when i press "start download" it's giving me a 800700e8 eror massage all the time.
 when i search this content on xbox live, it can't be found. can it be because of my region?? because when i entered the xbox live site on my pc i can see the catwoman content is downloadable for money but when i sign in it writes me that the conent is not
 avalibale for your region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have a pal xbox and i am from israel, please help me somehow!! i want to play it so badly.</p>

<p>Does your physical location match the region associated with your Xbox Live account (i.e. are they both "Israel"), and is it the Israeli Xbox Live site on which you saw the content available for purchase? If they don't all match up, that could be the problem
 -- I've certainly had issues like that when trying to download content here in Ireland with my UK Xbox Live account, even if the content is available in both regions.</p>
<p>If that's not the problem, you'll probably have better luck posting on the "Purchasing or Downloading" support forum:

 the game company for answers. meanwhile i wanted to ask you, if i make my region UK on my xbox live acount, could i download contents without a any problem and they would work or it's cause some problems? they both pal no?</p>

[/quote] If doing that allowed you download the DLC, then yes, the DLC should work fine even though you're in Israel. Unfortunately, there's still no guarantee that you'd be able to download the DLC in the first place. Some downloads just require you to be
 physically located in the UK if you're using a UK account. You can usually get around this by routing your Xbox through a UK-based DNS or VPN server, which makes it look like your Xbox is in the UK. (DNS is easier as you just have to temporarily change the
 network settings on your Xbox). Some companies like https://www.overplay.net offer DNS and VPN servers for doing exactly this sort of thing, but of course they charge a small amount (usually about $5/month) which you may or may not consider worth the money.

If I copy the archive to a removeable drive the little lock symbol goes away. What's with that? The files I am archiving are not read only or encrypted.

            First at all look at this location: C:\Users<br />
<br />
You will notice that your user folder has that lock too. The content of it is protected from other (standard) users. If you login as someone else you can't see what's there.<br />
<br />
I guess you zipped something outside your user profile, but this is zipped by you, and again only you have rights to this file (the lock icon appeared). You can right click on that zipped file &gt; choose Properties &gt; Security tab &gt; and you will see that under
 of Group of users are listed System, You, and Administrators. You can check this: press Edit... button &gt; press Add... button &gt; type Users and press OK &gt; press Apply and OK. You will notice that lock icon disappeared. Now everyone can access to this file (all
 users)<br />
<br />
When you copy something to the removable drive these rights who can open a file are expanded, so everyone have access to it.

<h2>            Windows Store Error Code 0x8000FFFF, Doesn&#39;t Open At All</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am having a problem opening the Windows Store. Every time I load it up, I get this error screen (although the CV changes every time):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47279ba8-9a6a-4cbf-b560-14d4a5dda4f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47279ba8-9a6a-4cbf-b560-14d4a5dda4f3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I hit "Refresh the Page", I get this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/317211c1-0c62-4e8d-a390-891156e3e346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/317211c1-0c62-4e8d-a390-891156e3e346" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have a working internet connection (as I have been searching online for solutions for several hours). Are there any solutions anyone has found works? I've run the wsreset.exe application and command (as administrator and not as admin) and tried
 the troubleshooter multiple times. The troubleshooter says, "Windows Store cache may be damaged" and "Not fixed" every time I run it, and I haven't found a working solution for that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago I accidentally downloaded a virus, but I managed to get rid of it through antivirus software. In trying to correct my problems with the Windows Store, I uninstalled my antivirus software, though it hasn't helped. I've checked my internet
 proxy as well, and it is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 on a relatively new (less than six-month old) ASUS K501U, with two drives (an SSD and a regular hard drive). If someone could offer any solutions I may not have tried, that would be immensely helpful.</p>

            I've checked on another account, yes. The internet for my laptop is wireless, and I've tried multiple times to clear the store cache. I've also already disabled my proxy and double checked it multiple times.&nbsp;

            I have tried it on another user account on my laptop as well. It looks like all of my apps downloaded from the Windows Store are also not working; they are all saying that the internet connection is not working, but the connection on my computer is fine
 in my other apps, like Google Chrome and Skype.

<h2>            Issue Installing Windows on New custom built pc</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues installing windows 10 on a brand new custom built pc. I have used the media creation tool to create a USB drive with Windows 10 install, but when I boot into the usb, I get a blue screen that says recovery at the top, then says your pc/device
 needs to be repaired, the digital signature for this file couldn't be verified. </p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \windows\system32\boot\winload.efi</p>
<p>Error Code: 0xc0000428</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools....etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new computer; I shouldn't have to repair recover anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used two separate computers with the media creation tool on two separate 8gb flash drives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs: </p>
<p>cpu- i5-8400</p>
<p>mobo- Asrock Z370m Pro4 (UEFI)</p>

            <p>ok, thanks for responding. &nbsp;You posed three questions, and these are the best answers I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;trying to download from another site, not Blizzard. &nbsp;(I learned of it thru another site known as the Osiris Method. &nbsp;They say it's ok...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Replays are games already played and uploaded to a specific website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;not logged in as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Yes, I have another account on yahoo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp;yes I am using Internet Explorer to download games.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Selecting default bluetooth connection type</h2>
                    I'm having a bit of trouble configuring my bluetooth headphones on Windows 7. I can pair them and connect them just fine, when I disconnect and reconnect them, for some reason, the default profile selected is "headset" over "Stereo audio device". When
 headset is selected the audio quality is dreadful, it can't be listened to and there is a green tick next to "Forward VoIP Calls to Handsfree". If I click "Disconnect" then "Listen to Music" the tick transfers next to "listen to music" with the "Connected
 to" showing as "Stereo Audio Device".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to set the default connection to "Listen to Music" and "Stereo Audio Device"?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/56ffcfa3-b1da-4202-a3f6-6077bf6f4fbc">Anshul</a>, thanks for the quick reply.
<div><br />
<div>I didn't make any changes to the computer. I simply installed the device then tried switching it off then on to see if it would automatically connect.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The make and model is the Philips Fidelio M1BT (M1 Bluetooth).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have checked all the connection FAQs and guides. Unfortunately they are only any use when the connection isn't working, in my case it's working... it's just defaulting to the wrong setting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is what happens when I turn on my headphones. It automatically connects and defaults to "Forward VoIP Calls to Handsfree". The audio is awful but the mic etc works.</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/697cbb50-9abf-4aaf-9c4e-1184726199e2" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>I then click "Disconnect" and see the following.....<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6fe5f85d-5988-4b5a-9343-b6474e5ca938" /></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I then click "Listen to Music" to get the device working properly as far as audio is concerned. In this mode the Mic does not function though.....</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47d47d27-5c91-4284-a5f0-6e9d74fa6483" /><br />
<br />
<div><br />
What I am looking to achieve is for the "Listen to Music" option to be the default choice when the device is enabled.</div>

<p>We understand your concern and would suggest you to d<span>ownload the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website and then try re-installing the drivers for Bluetooth and check if that helps. Try the below mentioned steps:</span><span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Go to your <strong>manufacturer’s website </strong>
and download the <strong>Bluetooth Driver’s setup file </strong>for your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>B: </strong>Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>on your desktop screen to go to run box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>C: </strong>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>D: </strong>Look for printer driver, expand, then right click and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>E: </strong>If you are prompted to Confirm, then <strong>Confirm</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>F: </strong>Go to the location where you had saved your downloaded setup files of the drivers and install them and
<strong>Restart</strong> your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, do notify us and we'll be happy to help you.</p>

            I believe all you can do is wait as Zero has said you can check server status at this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link Here</a>, but you may need to change the region to match yours

<p>There is no need to get angry. All services do have issues. Like yesterday I am sure they will sort it out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for keyboard and mouse it does not hurt anyone and is a fairly highly requested feature.&nbsp;</p>
