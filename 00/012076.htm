 stopped working and the display became non- functional. When I submitted it to the Service Centre I was informed that there were some problem related to the software so the software of the phone was updated by them, but this did not solve the issue. [Herewith

<p>Too bad you did not take a moment to read the Nokia&nbsp;Support discussion guidelines as it would have told you this is a user to user platform. Your 'letter' is therefor addressed at the wrong people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to double check your facts too. Nowhere in your story did you deal with Nokia. You dealt with a company which is not part of Nokia nor does Nokia have any control over said company. I wish you good luck getting 'your lawyers' to make this stick
 with Nokia as a company as you did not ever deal with them in any shape or form. What some apparently misinformed phone shop employee may or may not have said or done is completely outside of the control and responsibility of Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get you feel angry, frustrated and/or upset and need to vent but reallly, this course of action will not get your issue resolved nor will it work. You would be much better off trying to get in touch with Nokia support directly, you'll find your options
<a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> and as a tip you may want to try a friendly and inquiring tweet to @NokiaHelps&nbsp;..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Support may actually be able to help you but obviously if you come to them kicking and screaming the chances of that may not be as great as when you do so in a more relaxed and understanding tone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, please try and use some formatting, your post is near unreadable being in the format it is.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel opens a template as a template file instead of as workbook</h2>
                    I'm trying to open my custom template files as workbooks (xlsx), as I used to do before I changed to a new computer.&nbsp; Now Excel opens them as template files (xltx) so every change I make, changes (a damages) the original template file.&nbsp; Does any one knows
 how to fix this problem?&nbsp; This used to happen me on the Ipad as well but never on my computer.

<p>Hi Charles</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and quick response.&nbsp; Before I read your answer, I reinstalled all office and this solved the issue.&nbsp; The problem I think it's that the pre-installed office in the computer is very basic so it's better to reinstall everything.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now
 I only have the same issue but with the Ipads (it opens the template as template so any changes affect the original file...).</p>

<p>I just had the same issue appear on my Nokia N8. I looked back in my pictures and it started about two hours ago based on pictures I'd taken (I take a lot!).<br />
<br />
Anyway I searched for the solutions you had referred to and found ones saying a shake of the phone resolves the problem. I tried but to no avail, I still had a dark spot. I read further about explanation of dust or micro-organism (and how this should not be
 possible as they units are sealed airtight in the factory) and decided that I would knock the phone against my hand (more forgiving than a wall or table) to see if this helped. Lo and behold the dark spot disappeared!<br />
<br />
It is worrying that there may be something falling around in front of the lens of my camera and just hope it does not reappear soon....</p>

<p>wow, Can't believe it, that really helps! I saw a couple of forums out there and some people just opened the camera! a madness... you can't back from that. So glad to found this post. Only 3 messages?I did hit the phone against my hand and voila! The Camera
 back to normal, of course that I had to close the camera app and open it again because Lens goes out of focus. Thanks alot! I was afraid.﻿</p>

<p>I had the same problem and let me uncover the secret for you: the black spot is a tiny drop of lubricating oil having been jerked from its original location in the Zeiss camera mechanics onto the lens﻿. Cause: jolting or falling. Funny to read your simple
 solution AFTER passing in the device TWICE to NOKIA service Bonn, Germany. The first time I got it back after 10 days without them having taking any action which was annoying while when they returned it to me next time the black spot had disappeared, finally.
 I have no idea of whether they replaced the cam or simply hit it with the edge of hand ... maybe I could have mended it in 5 seconds while they wasted 3 weeks!</p>

            Hello sakark, don't shake your phone too much that may cause additional problems. Better you take your phone to Nokia Care.

<p>Hi Alpha K. H. NG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. What’s the on-premise Exchange version, Exchange 2010 or Exchange 2013?</p>
<p>2. Which method do you use to migration to Exchange Online? </p>
<p>There’s an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Ways-to-migrate-multiple-email-accounts-to-Office-365-0a4913fe-60fb-498f-9155-a86516418842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Have you ever tried to migrate some of the mailboxes to Exchange Online for test? If so, what’s the result?</p>
<p>4. If you use another admin account to create a new migration batch, could you succeed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dear Brook,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What’s the on-premise Exchange version, Exchange 2010 or Exchange 2013?</p>
<p>We're using Exchange 2010 on-premise servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Which method do you use to migration to Exchange Online?
</p>
<p>Migrate using an integrated Exchange Server and Office 365 environment (hybrid). We use online migrate tools (Web admin portal) to move the mailboxes one by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Have you ever tried to migrate some of the mailboxes to Exchange Online for test? If so, what’s the result?</p>
<p>It worked very well before the error connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If you use another admin account to create a new migration batch, could you succeed?</p>
<p>We faced same issue when we was using another admin account.</p>

<p>Hi Alpha K. H. NG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the #3, do you mean that the test also encountered the issue? Or the test succeeded without any error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about you create a new endpoint and create a new batch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing I’d like to know is was there any issue occurred when you ran the HCW wizard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>About the #3, we haven't done test. We migrated the mailboxes successful before we faced the below error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did the migration one by one, never use batch. </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, please perform the following steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Check the EWS configuration on each CAS server</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ensure that the MRS proxy endpoint is enabled on every CAS server that will be used in the migration process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Collect below output from local Exchange Management Shell:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory|fl ExternalAuthenticationMethods,Externalurl,MRSproxyEnabled,Server</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The output can be similar to below example:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ExternalAuthenticationMethods : {Basic, Ntlm, WindowsIntegrated, WSSecurity, OAuth}</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ExternalUrl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :
<a href="https://mail.domain.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://mail.domain.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx</span></a></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MRSProxyEnabled&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : True</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : EX2010</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here is important to check that
Basic </span>authentication are enabled and that you have the correct <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ExternalUrl </span>populated on each CAS server.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also, you can try to set
<em><span>MRSProxyEnabled&nbsp;</span></em><em><span>to false, and set to true to check it.
</span></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Confirm that the local MRSproxy service works fine</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Check first that the
<strong>MSExchangeMailboxReplication.exe</strong> service is running on the migration servers.</span></li><li><span>Perform some local move requests to confirm that MRS service works fine.</span></li><li><span>You can check if Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Replication service is consistent on your Mailbox/ CAS servers by using the command<strong> “Test-MRSHealth”</strong>.
 Please refer to below article for more details:</span></li></ul>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee332325(v=exchg.141).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee332325(v=exchg.141).aspx</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Browse to the MRSproxy external URL</p>
<ul>
<li><span>This can help you to confirm that your MRS proxy URL is reachable from outside the network, by accessing it from an internet browser.</span></li><li><span>Since MRSproxy endpoint is running under Exhange Web Services, it is expected that all the MRS request will be encapsulated in EWS calls, so the URL
 should have this format: <a href="https://mail.contoso.com/ews/mrsproxy.svc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.contoso.com/ews/mrsproxy.svc</a></span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The middle portion
<strong>“mail.contoso.com” </strong>is the <strong>external URL</strong> for your EWS service.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>If MRSproxy service is accessible from outside the network, you should
<strong>receive a credential prompt. </strong></span></li><li><span>If no credential prompt occurs, this indicates that your EWS service<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> is not accessible</span> externally and
 the firewall could <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">block</span> the MRS incoming requests, so you need to double check the firewall configuration and see if you can find any relevant logs in the firewall.</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Johnny</p>

    <title>shared links to Office 365 University OneNote notebooks are broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lauriecoleman  say:</h3>
<h2>            shared links to Office 365 University OneNote notebooks are broken</h2>
                    
<p>My students and I are using our college Office 365 University accounts to work with OneNote. Some students use the app on their phone, PC, Mac, iPad, tablet or campus PC. I have an assignment that asks students to create a OneNote notebook that they share
 the link with me. (I couldn't get the Class Notebook to work with OneNote so gave up on it.)&nbsp; Some students' links don't take me to their notebook. For example, one link takes me to the student's Office 365 login page:
https://xxx/Documents/Prologue%20-%20Chapter%206/</p>
<p>Another link takes me to the student's OneDrive login page: <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?resid=876D4311BFD2898A%21113&amp;cid=876d4311bfd2898a&amp;app=OneNote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://onedrive.live.com/x</a>xx</p>
<p>Another link takes me to an error page: <a href="https://studentalamo-my.sharepoint.com/personal/egonzalez572_student_alamo_edu/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8184DA82-5326-4992-B984-993A9D3A5E68%7D&amp;file=Evangelina%2520@%2520Work&amp;action=default&amp;RootFolder=%252fpersonal%252fegonzalez572%255fstudent%255falamo%255fedu%252fDocuments%252fNotebooks%252fEvangelina%2520%2540%2520Work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://xxx_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8184DA82-5326-4992-B984-993A9D3A5E68%7D&amp;file=Evangelina%2520@%2520Work&amp;action=default&amp;RootFolder=%252fpersonal%252fegonzalez572%255fstudent%255falamo%255fedu%252fDocuments%252fNotebooks%252fEvangelina%2520%2540%2520Work</a></p>
<p>Why is there so much inconsistency? There is no Microsoft tech support for students or faculty using OneNote--or any of the MS Office products for Office 365 University. My campus is just learning Office 365 and have not been helpful at all.</p>

<p>hi laurie,</p>
<p>the first link and the third link you provided are created by students in onedrive for business while the second link is created in students’s personal onedrive.</p>
<p>given this situation, i suggest you let all your students create their onenote notebooks in onedrive for business. here are the steps:<br />
1. open the onenote app -&gt; click file on the upper left corner -&gt; new -&gt; onedrive-contoso- &gt; browse. on the pop-up window, type a notebook name and click create.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ddb17aa3-bcda-456a-963a-1c8aad8bc7d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dddb17aa3-bcda-456a-963a-1c8aad8bc7d5" /></a><br />
2. after another window pops up, click invite people.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=382316d0-e8e3-438f-bc39-1b28faf5245c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d382316d0-e8e3-438f-bc39-1b28faf5245c" /></a><br />
3. let your students type your school account, uncheck require user to sign in before accessing document and then click share.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=73a3611f-71d0-4de2-a64a-373c0f9de242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d73a3611f-71d0-4de2-a64a-373c0f9de242" /></a><br />
4. let them click get a sharing link on the screenshot above, click create link on the next pop-up window and then send this link to you.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=615a3e9c-ff22-439e-b93f-3956a568b5bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d615a3e9c-ff22-439e-b93f-3956a568b5bb" /></a></p>
<p>in addition, for students who use mobile devices, please let them log into onenote with microsoft accounts and add their school accounts to onenote. then they will see onedrive-contoso.</p>
<p>let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<h3> kallan mende  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio - Setting Default Language</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently experiencing an issue with setting the default language in Visio 2016 on our RDS servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently set up group policy to enforce all of our machines to set the default language in Windows and Office to English (Australia).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only outlier is that Visio is still defaulting to English (United States).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/620146ba-12b1-4569-8f26-f61836aef55c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/620146ba-12b1-4569-8f26-f61836aef55c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've double checked that the server Visio is installed on has the correct language pack installed and selected as default. All other Office products default to English (Australia).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc9d7875-c91d-4ce7-941d-a56c9fa7a1a7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc9d7875-c91d-4ce7-941d-a56c9fa7a1a7?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>When attempting to set the default language in Visio, I have noted that there is no "Set to Default" option through Review &gt; Language &gt; Set Proofing Language:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38186f6f-d741-4f2a-bbb7-c59df8b00240?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38186f6f-d741-4f2a-bbb7-c59df8b00240?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>However it appears in all other Office products:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cee7b87-774e-4b3f-9648-602e47610157?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cee7b87-774e-4b3f-9648-602e47610157?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have attempted changing the Office default languages and while the changes are reflected everywhere, it does not seem to affect Visio.</p>
<p>The same goes for changing the Windows language as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I am aware of being able to Ctrl + A and change the language to Australia (it does work too), employees are requesting that documents default to English (Australia).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if this is possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still experiencing this issue and have tried the following to resolve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing all other proofing languages from Visio/Office</p>
<p>Removing all other language packs from Windows/RDS server</p>
<p>Unchecking "Detect language automatically" in Office on our RDS server</p>
<p>Changing proofing/Windows language on RDS server in attempt to replicate issue/fix</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got any recommendations?</p>

            Additional troubleshooting items -
<br />
<br />"Below are general troubleshooting steps for Outlook. Try one by one and and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Create new Outlook profile to rule out corruption in Outlook profile. - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Type command in your Windows Search Box &gt; Right click on Command Prompt &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Type ""sfc /scannow"" without quotes &gt; Run it and when it completes, configure Outlook again. 
<br />
<br />3. Please check if you have Lync or Skype installed on this computer which starts when the computer starts. If yes, then get out of Skype and start Outlook. Basically, Outlook need to start first than Skype. 
<br />
<br />4. Repair your Outlook data files - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />5. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />6. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />7. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />8. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator. 
<br />
<br />9. Permanently delete all your deleted / spam mails, if not needed. And empty your Junk / Clutter / Spam folders also (Other is new name for Clutter in 2016), if not needed.

    <title>font size of flagged &#38; overdue message list in single line mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anutonski  say:</h3>
<h2>            font size of flagged &#38; overdue message list in single line mode</h2>
                    <p>In the Outlook application (via Office 365 Home subscription) I have recently needed to increase the font size of the list of messages via View -&gt; View Settings -&gt; Other Settings -&gt; Row Font.&nbsp; After increasing the font size, any message highlighted in red
 (due to followup flag being set and the message is overdue that followup), the message subject etc is still displayed in font size 8 rather than the new font size 9. This only occurs in single line mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is whether this is a peculiar design feature or a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the picture below I have set the row font size to be 9 (as can be seen by the font size of the emails that are not overdue), however, the third email and other in red in the list is displayed in font size 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81c6c0a2-83f4-4afa-827f-8d50ef80d51a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/81c6c0a2-83f4-4afa-827f-8d50ef80d51a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Changing the followup date to tomorrow the third email in the picture below changes the message subject to black (not overdue) and the font size is correctly picked up as 9.</p>

            That looks like a bug in the current version. Restarting outlook should restore the font sizes to normal. You may need to restart it twice, or reset the view.

                    <span>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to create a vertical right-to-left Chinese document in MS Word 2010. Everything fine except that those punctuations are not centered within line. It goes to right-most of the vertical line and they're very close to the character before it. While
 typing in horizontal format, yes, it is OK for the punctuations to stay at the bottom of the line. But when comes to vertical format, it is weird for the full-stops or commas to go to side way, either right-most or left-most of the line.</p>
<p>I want them to be centered within line. Please help. Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not the matter of vertical or horizontal alignment. Those are for paragraph's alignment. What I meant was punctuation like full-stop or comma to be centered by line while in the vertical text right-to-left text mode. As you know, Chinese characters are like
 square boxes, so I want the punctuation to be centered in the box, like what have been appeared in many other Chinese books.</p>

<div>I don't know Chinese, but I think the full stop is a full width character, </div>
<div>and the position of the glyph within the character box is a function of the </div>
<div>font. I don't think Word does anything automatic in response to your text </div>

<p>I am trying to figure out how my Chinese wife can enter Chinese characters in a vertical format and it sounds like you have been able to do that. How did you do it? She is using MS Word 2011 on a Mac and has a touchpad to enter the Chinese characters as
 strokes.</p>

            Fixed my problem:<br />
<br />
Finally able to install Microsoft Security Essentials.<br />
<br />
As a result of the NIS driver failing in the logs I turned to the system device manager. I enabled "Show all hidden Devices"&nbsp; Under Non-Plug and Player Drivers I uninstalled the Microsoft Network Inspection System Driver.<br />
<br />
Then I went into the system registry and I located two other locations where this driver was referenced but not removed by the Microsoft Un-installed Clean up utility for Microsoft Security Essentials.<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet003\Services\NisDrv]<br />

            Ciao Sharon,

I don't understand if you're talking about MS Word (which version?) or the discontinued MS Words.

Can you please clarify?

Ciao and thanks

            First check that your date and time are correct then go to email and accounts in your settings and long tap your email address until a screen pops up saying sync now tap that and see if that helps if it doesn't you can try a reset press and hold the volume
 down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them and it will restart that is a soft reset for a hard or factory reset backup your phone first then go to the about setting and tap reset let us know how you go rgds Roy

<h2>            MS Word - Pick up where you left off has stopped working on my Android tablet.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I found this to be immensely useful as I narrate audiobooks and I use Word for the scripts.&nbsp; It has stopped being an option, however, so I must hunt for where I left off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search and the only solutions offered were for PC based (where I also have Word, of course).&nbsp; Any suggestions for tablets, please?</p>
