<h2>            Office365 on desktop - Can&#39;t see emails in imported files</h2>
                    Hi, I moved from an IMAP(?) email address with webmail to an Exchange email through Office365 (both through GoDaddy). I used Outlook installed on the PC (from 365) to export from the old email and import to new, via .pst. So... I know it worked, because
 accessing email through a browser I can see everything. But on the desktop version (on three computers for me and on two computers for another user who did the same change), anything in the imported folders is invisible. Even if a new email comes in and I
 move it there, it vanishes. I can see it through the browser, but because of the different functionality I really would prefer to use the desktop version. I was on with tech support with two different people, an hour each, and so far nothing. Help!

<h2>            Complicated relationships</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I am trying to build a construction project database that can produce project info, contractor and subcontractor info as well as supplier and cost information that can also be summarized by project name or number. Here is where it gets complicated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each project will have one contractor, but may have multiple sub-contractors and suppliers.</p>
<p>Each contractor may have multiple projects.</p>
<p>Each subcontractor and supplier will have worked within multiple projects.</p>
<p>Each project, contractor, sub and supplier will be listed in their own table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have just overlooked the solution, and I know that access has to have a way to relate these tables without having to resort to pages of code, so if anyone has an idea of a solution that will simplify this, please let me know.</p>

<p>I missed this part in my first read. As Tom said you can create a database design and setup relationships without using a single line of code. But lets explain further about relationships. Creating relationships between tables is a DESIGN issue. Take, for
 example, your relationship of projects to contractors. A project has one contractor, therefore you include a field in the Projects table that indicates what contractor is associated with the project. This is referred to as a Foreign Key. iIt stores a value
 that uniquely identifies the contractor record. Boom you have now created a relationship between projects and contractors. You need do nothing more. However, Access has a way of (what I call) formalizing a relationship. This is done in the Relationships Window.
 Its done by dragging the key field in one table over the corresponding key field in the related table. Formalizing gives the advantage of being able to impose Referential Integrity on the relationship. RI allows you insure that there are no orphan records.
 That every Project that has a value in the Contractor FK has a corresponding value in the Contractor table. You can also turn on Cascading Deletes. This means if you delete a contractor, every project associated with that contractor is removed. It also allows
 for Cascading Updates. If you change the key value for a contractor, all FKs will be automatically updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>RI is a good thing, but it can also be managed by proper design of your user interface. So its not absolutely necessary to formalize relationships. You can create the same joins in your queries without formalizing the relationships.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your responses... I think my main issue is not the factor of PK or FK relationship, because that Ive done, yet the issue is trying to associate multiple records in one table to one record in another where it works and doesn't cause issues
 down the road as the database grows. For instance,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Each project, contractor, subcontractor and supplier are setup as separate records within the specified table(s).</li><li>For each project, there usually is ONE contractor assigned, so that is easy, YET</li><li>For each project, there may be multiple subcontractors and suppliers assigned.</li></ol>
<p>That's my dilemma, if I wasn't clear before. I need to be able to assign more than one subcontractor and/or supplier to a project at a time. I believe it requires a many to many relationship, but then do I have to setup a specific table to get that going?
 Will a query work? Do I need to code VBA?</p>

<p>in this case we could also use our phone to display Office files on big screen.</p>

 it tomorrow. I don't believe it is a purely software issue. I have confidence that if my 1020 could support Miracast they would have enabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leaves cabled connection via Project my Screen to a PC for these older models, nothing directly to a TV. TV support with just a USB connector would require something like MHL to have been built in and never activated. Doubtful. &nbsp;Based on the rumors,
 it appears the new devices, that support all of Continuum, will be sporting USB-C. That could explain the video out, and touch screen/keyboard-mouse back possibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, screen mirroring of Office apps to a large TV isn't very satisfying, beyond PowerPoint, or just for meeting viewing. Not something I'd want to work on. &nbsp;I do think you are likely to retain the mirroring to a PC, and gain the ability to use BT
 keyboard and mouse with Win 10 on older devices. &nbsp;That works quite well on a 1520 using the wedge keyboard and mouse, or the new foldable keyboard, BTW</p>

<h2>            Only underline tracked changes, but don&#39;t change color</h2>
                    I would like tracked changes to be underlined but keep their original color. We are using character styles to color parts of the document, but those colors are lost when we use change tracking.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried changing the color to "automatic", but it just makes them black rather than their character style color.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I change the first drop-down to "(None)" then they do keep their character style color, but they are of course not underlined either. I do still get the change bar though.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I am looking for is the equivalent of a "(None)" for the 2nd color drop-down. So I can choose Underline but no color change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this possible?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Keep in mind there is now two editions of the venerable and longstanding Access example called the North Winds trader database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new version is designed as you note what is called a "services database".&nbsp; In fact more specifically the correct term is "Access web services database".&nbsp; So it called NorthWind
<strong>Services.</strong> </p>
<p>So the term "services" is the term that suggests this is the web edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This so called Web services database example&nbsp;has more functionality than any version of the&nbsp;traders example, but it's been designed as a publishable web database. Being a "Services" database&nbsp;explains why you cannot put forms into design mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access 2007 introduced an ability to design forms in "live"&nbsp;preview, or what we call layout mode.&nbsp; No doubt this new layout mode was in preparation for access 2010 and that of web forms design that was comming down the pipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not really that big of a deal here, but&nbsp;just keep in mind that for web based database design in access, you don't have form design mode anymore and you MUST&nbsp;use the new layout mode.&nbsp; There are good number of reasons for this, and one of them is simply
 that in web based systems many restrictions such as controls can not overlap or be on top of each other. The older design mode does not reflect these new issues in regards to web browsers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you're forced to use these new design services because is a lot more restrictions in web based development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other interesting thing is I believe this is the first version of the traders database that has the code present to update and maintain inventory&nbsp;levels automatically. This ability is&nbsp;accomplished using the new database triggers feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't have to use the access web services example, and you can still download the previous 2007 version of the north wind traders database which of course is built as a classic non web publishable database (and the forms will have desing mode, but the
 over all applicaiton does not have the features we see in the 2010 version).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you now have two edditions of this&nbsp;database. In fact&nbsp;in theory I believe there's a third edition which was designed for ADP, but that's not really relevant to this discussion. So there are several editions of this database over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you want the&nbsp;classic designs surfaces, you'll have to use an older edition of the north wind traders database.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind the advantages of the new version is that you can publish this example to a web site, and your users can run the application with nothing more than a web browser, that includes launching it even on something like their smart phone or an iPad.</p>

<p>I tried this many times by restarting the services from task manager, killing the service and other options and I still get the&nbsp;same behavior.</p>
<p>The pending updates are:</p>
<p>-Intel corporation driver update for intel HD graphics 5000</p>
<p>-System hardware update 1/27/2015</p>
<p>-FBL_AWESOME1501 9933 professional </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to clean boot by using msconfig to Hide the Microsoft service and disabled others also on Task manager disabled startup apps.</p>
<p>same result.. updates stops at 6% and doesn't seem to pass the 6%.&nbsp; when restarting the updates from task manager, sometimes it stops at 5% too, but never passed 6%.</p>

code change was included which unintentionally had the side effect of changing targeting for builds, allowing builds that are exclusive to Microsoft employees to appear available. No new builds are available which are newer than 9926 at this point. We will

<h2>            N73 Barcode Scanner Problem</h2>
                    Hi there<br />
<br />
I just got a new Nokia N73 and was attempting to install the Barcode Scanner thats located in the Downloads! folder. When the installation is nearly complete I get the message: 'Unable to install - component is built in' anyone had a similar problem? How did
 you get it sorted? If it is in fact installed where is it hiding?<br />
<br />
Cheers

This reads the barcodes found on things we buy. The barcode contain information about its mfg. * expiry dates. phone nos., web link etc.<br />
<br />
Now looking to the problem Bar code rader must be pre-installed. Therefore there was no need to re-intsall. Just navigate to menu<br />
(Try under my own ) and see if you find bar code reader

            Install the last firmware with NSU tool from Support pages. If the phone is a network locked version, could not have new firmware or even dont have the bar code reader application. The application it self, works well with 2D codes and very bad with linear
 codes.

Feel lucky if NSU works for N-73. Else you have to live with Nokia Care. Try getting friendly as flashing takes 20 minutes flat. Another 10 minutes for QC check. You should be out of Nokia care in 30 minutes

    <title>Acrobat Reader closes when any direction key is pressed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nwsea73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acrobat Reader  closes when any direction key is pressed</h2>
                    <p>Acrobat Reader (the full desktop version) closes the second an arrow key or page up/down is pressed while viewing a document. &nbsp; &nbsp;It worked perfectly prior to 9926. &nbsp;I assume it isn't expected behavior, as you can imagine how frustrating it is that EVERY
 pdf I go to view, the first thing I do is start hitting page down, which cleanly and immediately closes Acrobat Reader. &nbsp;It's Acrobat Reader 11.0.10.</p>

            If you look carefully, I think you'll see that Starter is not so much "still" default as "again".&nbsp; I found that Starter was annoyingly persistent about retaking Windows default, no matter how many times I re-assigned it.&nbsp; I suspect, that there is a built
 in function to reset defaults to Starter, whether you ask it to or not.<br />
<br />
As I see it you have a couple of options:<br />
<ol>
<li>In control panel, programs and Features, use "Office Repair" to reset defaults as needed</li><li>use a batch file to re-register defaults as required</li><li>Uninstall Starter</li><li>Create copy of Portable Starter on a USB drive<br />
</li></ol>
<p>#1 Takes a few minutes longer than I like to wait</p>
<p>#2 is actually quite fast, a good option if you don't want to uninstall Starter</p>
<p>#3 Starter should be part of the recovery partition, so you can get it back by re-installing Windows.</p>

<p>Office 2010 Starter is only officially installed by computer builders. If you google skillfully, there are a few links to the installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Home users do not have access to the installation file so there are only 3 options for re-installing it.</p>
<p>There is an option that allows users to re-install Office Starter without using the recovery partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It requires that you have the Microsoft Office 2010 Program Manager installed. If you go into Programs and Features dialog, look for the Microsoft Office 2010 entry.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010. A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Win7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption of files.
</p>
<p>This type of recovery will wipe out all of your installed programs and personal data files. Therefore, before starting this type of repair you should make a backup of your disk and make sure that you have the installation files and product keys for all
 of your applications.</p>

<p>Dear Azam</p>
<p>Thank you. As I said in my post it occurs if I call "www.migrosmagazin.ch". I also tried it with no add-ons. No chance. On my other system (W7 64-bit english) the error with IE8 does not occur.</p>

IE9 has new diagnostic tools you could try for comparison purposes.&nbsp; E.g. the Developer Tools Network tab is like a built-in Fiddler Lite.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you would at least know which request was generating the&nbsp; 500 error.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</span></div>

<p>I had the same trouble using ie11 and chrome. After installing Drupal (CMS), I tried to launch the software and got the 500 Internal Error using both Chrome and&nbsp; ie11. Then I changed the URL from
http://www... to https://www..., and by God's grace through the mercies of Christ Jesus, it worked to free me from the trouble of this error in both chrome and ie11. Nevertheless, I encountered the same
 error again, but this time while within the Drupal software after clicking "Extend" to reach the extensions. So, I assume that the problem is within Drupal, but I'm sure that God's grace through the mercies of Christ Jesus will again see me through.</p>

    <title>Sub report page footer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.a.marshall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sub report page footer</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a main report which contains two sub reports in seperate group headers. The first subreport shows client details, one client per page) and the second subreport shows other related information, also one page per. All the client details are shown in
 the main report first and then the other info from the second sub report follows that. so basically I have (and need to have):</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>for client one on the first page</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>for client two on the second page</p>
<p>
</p><p>This comes from subreport 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>the third page then contains details relating to client 1, the fourth page shows details relating to client 2 etc. etc which all comes from subreport2</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first subreport I need to have a date and signature field at the bottom of the page however page footer doesn't show on the subreport when viewed in the main report.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can get the fields to show in the footer of the subreport 1 when viewed in the main report?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have thought that I might be able to put it into the page footer of the main report, which is fine and makes sense when the data is shown for the first subreport but it is also shown on the pages for the second sub report data, which is not required. I
 can't think of a way to make it not visible depending on which page/subreport is shown.</p>

<p>Hi Duane,</p>
<p>I think that will work well but the problem I have now is that the first subreport may be one page or multiple pages at the start of the report as the first page is client 1 name, address etc., second page client 2 name address etc then other infor coming
 from subreport 2 afterward. I need to have "Name:_________________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Date:____________ to appear on all pages of the first subreport so me.page=1 won't work for me unless there is only one page (one client).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can have the subreport display "Name__________ Date_________" only for subreport 1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing me.page=1 to&nbsp;If [RsubKeyList].Report![lblKeyList].Caption = "Key List"&nbsp; as lblkeylist is a field only on subreport 1 but "name etc. then shows on every page&nbsp;</p>

            I don't believe a subreport has any concept of "Page". I would probably create a global variable like gintReportPageNumber and set if from the main report. You could then use this variable in an If Then section of code.

<p>Thanks Duane, I'll see what I can come up with. I think maybe I can use a collection but will need to study it a bit more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across this code (link below) which adds a footer to the main report starting from a particular subreport. If code is placed in the on format of say the second subreport then the footer will start when the second subreport is displayed and continued
 until the end of the report. I will be using it in the first subreport so I need to stop the footer display once all pages of that subreport have been displayed, so I've modified the footer code below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://bytes.com/topic/access/answers/950378-including-footers-subreports-access</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the footer of the report I will have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IIf(([Page]&gt;[z_ctrl_txt_offset] And [Page]&lt;[Text6]+1),"Name__________ Date__________","")</p>
<p>
</p><p>the text6 is what I need to replace with the number of pages from the subreport. I've tested just using a number and it works well.</p>

                    <p>I've tried all the logical steps, still....emails are being sent to junk folder after I have put them on the safe sender list.&nbsp; Our business relies heavily on email communication so this is a problem.&nbsp; I use Outlook 2010.</p>

            <p>There may be two completely separate safe lists at work here: the one in Outlook 2010, and one that may be on the server. If the server itself thinks the messages are junk, it may move them to the Junk E-mail folder before Outlook ever sees the message.
 You add the sender to Outlook 2010's Safe Sender list, but the server has no knowledge of this list (it doesn't sync to the IMAP server), so the next time a message arrives from the same sender, the server once again puts in in Junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into the mailbox using a web interface and see if there is a way to disable the server-side junk mail filter or see if you can add the sender to the server-side safe sender list. Then Outlook 2010's junk filter will be the sole arbiter of what is junk
 or not.</p>

<p>It's Kinda still there, but I meant multiple desktop feature to create new desktops. I figured it out after clicking on that icon I can find it above the Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview wording on the far right of my desktop. I was still looking for it
 to pop up as an option above the icon when I click on it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the effort.</p>

                    Me I have purchase 2 Microsoft fitness bands in the past year and a half and have lost both due to the design of the wristband. The both fell off my wrist and because i was walking on carpeting I did not hear them hit the floor. The design is poor and
 the band is prone to coming loose. Prior to losing them, the continuously fell from my wrist and now i'm out of $179 i've paid on two occasions for a band.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this issue?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating the phone software, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Call &#38; SMS filter issue - was it ever fixed for 8.1&#63; Driving me mad...</h2>
                    <p>So my daugfhter has a Lumia 630 which she loves and started getting some silent calls so we decided to install the call &amp; sms filter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot get past the error which says somethiing like 'Oops something went wrong, you may have to restart you phone' - very soon I will throw the phone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the hard reset, much to my daughter's disgust since not everything returned from the backup from her apps, and am now at the point where I'm going to give up with her Windows phone altogether and get an Android since there are many apps available
 for Android that filter calls and texts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely either Microsoft or Nokia know about this and have a reliable fix?</p>
<p>Even more so now Microsoft own Nokia!</p>

<h2>            Office Outlook Compatibility 2010 - 2019 or 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a recent hard drive crash I need to install a new copy of Office. I have been using Office 2010 for a number of years and rather than trying reinstall 2010 I thought I would update it to either Office 2016 or 2019</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have access to the Outlook 2010 pst file and wanted to, 1) check the compatibility of using the 2010 pst file in either 2016 or 2019, 2) check the best way transfer the file as I cannot use the usual export / import process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>If the 2010 pst file was created under OL2010 there is no problem or compatibility issues with that been opened in any later version of Outlook</p>
<p>You copy any pst file, with OL closed to media, thence to \My Documents\Outlook Files\ on the new/other PC or drive and once you have configured/setup OL you open that pst within OL, it will then appear in the OL tree view pane and you can access its data
 as required.</p>
<p>Of course whether you want to set up your mail account(s) in OL as pop, and use that copied pst file is something else.

            Hi Andy,
<br />The old pst will definitely work with the new versions. Just copy it to the new computer and open it in the profile. You can set it as the default delivery pst if you are using POP3.  Import/Export is not recommended in most cases as you lose a lot of things-  rules, custom views, categories etc. 
<br />
<br />Note: if you want to use pop3, you may need to use the manual setup option (click advanced on the first add account screen then tick the option for manual setup) as Outlook will default to imap if the server supports it.       
        </p>

            Dear EdLastname1,
<br />I am a independent advisor and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />Try to use another browser, and In Private mode. Sometimes extensions or cookies can block authorization. It is also recommended to clear cache and cookies from time to time. In this article you will find the way how to delete the cache and cookies for most of the browsers <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Tracking-Cookies</a>

<p>Hi and thank you for your response. I have deleted cookies and cache but still no luck. I also tried different browsers and 3 different computers .</p>
<p>I think it is a browser - outlook site issue because the outlook app does work.</p>

            Dear EdLastname1,
<br />As I mentioned in first message, I am more a user like you, not a part of Microsoft.
<br />As health status shows <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a> all servers are working normally, so your problem with login is either browser or some network restrictions. When you were trying another device, was it connected to another Wi-Fi from a different internet provider ? Please try to connect device to your mobile data on phone via hot-spot and try to access your account. Also, please try to follow suggestions from this article ( Can't sign in to Hotmail or Outlook.com ) <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-sign-in-to-or-out-of-outlook-com-e08eb8ac-ac27-49f4-a400-a47311e1ee7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a>
<br />Also please share the screenshot of the error message that you receive. Please remember to delete all personal information from it before position in Community.
<br />Looking forward to your reply.

            Dear EdLastname1,
<br />This might be an issue, as when you are trying to login to your Microsoft Account and server checks your position for suspicious activity it can block authorization process and you will get such error. After disabling, you should be able to login to your account normally,

            Dear EdLastname1,
<br />After disconnecting VPN first of all perform Flush DNS <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Flush-DNS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Flush-DNS</a>
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />Then try to open browser in Private and try to authorize using this link <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/inbox/</a> if you will not be able, but you are able to login to your Microsoft Account ( as you mentioned in previous message ) then click on More actions under the Profile and choose View inbox.
<br />This problem that you are experiencing is caused by the VPN more, than router itself.
