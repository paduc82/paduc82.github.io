<p>You sure that's the right model?&nbsp; Dell did not support the XPS T series in Windows XP.</p>
<p>Chances are there may be a default driver built into XP that makes it just work - but...</p>

            Hi, <br />
You have to be careful downloading things like this from places other than the manufacturer. So to answer your question, there is absolutely no way to have a clue if that is the exact same driver.
<br />
<br />
My advise is to stick with Dell. That is the best and safest way to make sure you get exactly what you need for the computer and nothing else. Have you spoken with them about this specific model computer working with Windows XP?<br />

    <title>Keyboard and mouse support concerns. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandonbartel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard and mouse support concerns.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I'm WELL-AWARE that there's a bunch of threads about this highly debated topic. I don't really care, I just haven't been able to find a way to communicate directly with Microsoft to voice my concerns. I need more information to determine my future
 purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know what steps are being taken to keep K/M users separate from Controller users? People can already mod a keyboard so they can use it on their Xbox, so it feels like this is only going to make the issue on consoles worse. Running into a
 P.C. user on the game "Sea Of Thieves" leads to a fight that's so one sided that it lead me to quit playing the game altogether. Is there going to be a way to disable playing with any other keyboard users or is it 100% on the developer? With some of these
 releases lately, I can say with some degree of certainty, that's not going to work. Almost none of these games work correctly upon release or at all for that matter. It feels like it's only a matter of time before K/M users start to end up in my favorite &nbsp;skilled
 shooting games like "Red Dead Redemption 2" or "Call Of Duty: Black ops 4" or "Battlefield 5". It's safe for me to say that I want NOTHING to do with any of that. There's already tons of "high skilled" players that make the games less enjoyable. If everyone
 starts to play like them it's definitely not going to be fun anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand wanting to merge the gaming communities, that's great more people should make things more fun. But a K/M user has a tremendous advantage over anyone using a controller. I'm not going to keep using an Xbox if I can't even enjoy a video game because
 a K/M user is winning the game every time I play. I like to win sometimes too.<br />
</p>
<p>If I wanted to use a K/M, I would log onto my computer and play games there, it's plain and simple. The controller is one thing I love about playing Xbox and essentially what makes a console exactly that. The playing field is the same, and no one can hack.
 Where as to on a P.C. There's TONS of different hardware/software to maximize your advantages. The only thing people can do with Xbox is raise their sensitivity and buy a pro controller.<br />
</p>
<p>I bought the first Xbox the day it came out and haven't looked at any other console since. I've went through 2 of every single one or their consoles. But this has my gaming future deeply concerned and I'm not totally sure if Xbox is the route I'm going to
 take in the future.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.&nbsp;<br />

<p>It's not up to Microsoft in a number of cases to decide this, it's up to the developers of individual titles - so yes in some cases (such as SoT) it will be a Microsoft issue, but for the vast majority it will be up to those who make the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is of course highly dependent on several factors though as to the advantage one would receive on M/K over a controller, for example if you run into a 10 year old on Fortnite chances are they're not going to be as effective with the M/K as say someone
 who's played PC games for years.&nbsp; I don't think there's much to worry about as so far it seems to be the case that most developers are going forward with the mindset of keeping M/K players apart from those of us who're using a controller - namely to avoid
 situations where people get overly frustrated.&nbsp; For what it's worth, the "other side" face this very same issue nowadays, it's something that will happen going forward on both the "traditional" consoles (the third option being a very different idea all together!).</p>

            You would have to contact the game devs about that. A lot of people like the keyboard and mouse and it doesn't always give the advantage. I've seen a lot of terrible keyboard and mouse users. Especially in shooters. There is wayyyy more hacking on a PC
 then there is a console. Have you ever tried CSGO for example? I think because of the demand, And how gaming has evolved that they will continue to make gaming more accessible to everyone.&nbsp;

<h2>            Iphone not being recognized as a portable device when plugged in to a USB port</h2>
                    My iphone 4 is not recognized as a portable device when plugged in to a&nbsp;USB port, however it is recognized by iTunes. My wife's phone is recognized by both. I am using windows 8. My phone was recognized as a device until I changed the phones name. I also
 might have also&nbsp;accidently uninstalled the I phone driver for that phone only if that makes any sense. I have tried different attempts and can't get back to square one.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>

1 .Right-click the Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, or Apple iPod entry in Device Manager and choose Update Driver from the shortcut menu.<br />
2. Click "Browse my computer for driver software."<br />
3. Click "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer."<br />
4. Click the Have Disk button. (If the Have Disk option is not present, choose a device category such as Mobile Phone or Storage Device if listed, and click next. The Have Disk button should then appear.)<br />
5. In the "Install from Disk" dialog, click the Browse button.<br />
6. Use this window to navigate to the following folder: <br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers.<br />
Note: If using a 64-bit version of Windows, this folder may be stored in C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\Drivers.<br />
7. Double-click the "usbaapl.inf" file which is listed in this folder. (This file will be called "usbaapl64.inf" if you have a 64-bit version of Windows).<br />
8. Click OK in the "Install from Disk" dialog.<br />
9. Click Next and finish the driver-installation steps. Open iTunes to verify that the device is recognized properly.</span></p>

<p>That link I sent gives you all the usual options to fix your problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have tried each one and none of them fixes your issue, you may need to Restore your computer to an earlier time (i.e. before this problem came up).&nbsp; &nbsp;However, you may not have
 a restore point old enough to go back to and also you will lose any updates or settings (not data or photos) that you have done since then.&nbsp; &nbsp;To find System Restore, go here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel\System and Security\System\Advanced System Settings\System Protection\System Restore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click on Next.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your Restore points will be seen;&nbsp; you may need to tick&nbsp; Show more restore points&nbsp; &nbsp;to see if you have any others.&nbsp; If your earliest restore point is too recent, then this method won't help you if you have had the battery percentage
 problem for a long while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I can't help further.</p>

<h2>            Headphones&#47;speaker playback issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi after updating to Windows 10 I now have the following issue.</p>
<p>Everytime I play video on my pc the sound comes from the speakers, if I plug in headphones I get nothing. &nbsp;I have checked the drivers are up to date. &nbsp;The only way I can get some form of fix is if I use the audio Trouble shooting window. &nbsp;Sometimes this
 states that Enhancements need to be switched off and I need to change the defult device to headphone but most of the time it states there are no issues. &nbsp;Why cant it reodnise that i have headphones plugged in?</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting really frustrated with Windows 10 now</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having this issue for the past 4 months and no I have not updated any software or added any other hardware etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used apple earphones, Bose earphones and gummy earphones (all of which worked previously)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the fix and it did not work. &nbsp;I can either play with headphones or without but I cannot stop the film/music/podcast and change to the other. &nbsp;Even when running the troubleshooter I have to choose one to fix so if I am listenening on the internal
 speakers, I have to plug in the headphones or remove them and then run the troubleshooter so that it recognises there is a problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Cannot read  the &#60; ProductKey &#62; in the answer file for unattended installation.</h2>
                    <p>I have 6 computers. On 5 computers I could install Windows 10, but the 6th one gave the error message "Kan de instelling &lt;ProductKey&gt; in het antwoordbestand voor installatie zonder toezicht niet lezen. (<span>Cannot read&nbsp; the &lt; ProductKey &gt; in
 the answer file for unattended installation.)</span> Strange is that this last computer is exactly the same as one of the others.&nbsp; And that one installed perfectly.</p>
<p>For all computers I used the same installation file, created with 'MediaCreationToolx64.exe'.</p>
<p>Can some one please tell me what is going on? </p>
<p>Thank you, Pieter</p>

            <p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>1. The two identical computers were both bought at the same time in a shop and both were activated by the shopkeeper.&nbsp; I could easily install Windows 10 on the first computer, but there is no way I can install Windows 10 on the second one. I don't understand
 this, because they are 100% identical.&nbsp;The initial OS was Windows 8, but upgraded tot&nbsp;8.1.</p>
<p>2. All other computers&nbsp;are correctly activated.</p>
<p>I never received a message from Microsoft saying I could install Windows 10. On all computers there was the white Windows 10 download icon. And I got e-mails from Microsoft&nbsp;to congratulate me with my reservation.</p>
<p>I have created an Windows&nbsp;10 USB-stick with MediaCreationToolx64. At first I installed Windows 10 over 8.1.&nbsp; With Produkey I could read the serial number.</p>
<p>After that I did a clean install, using the just found serial number.</p>
<p>This method worked fine on all other computers.</p>
<p>I don't understand the error message "Cannot read&nbsp; the &lt; ProductKey &gt; in the answer file for unattended installation".
</p>
<p>I hope you or someone else can help me to get Windows 10 on my computer.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Pieter</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reaction, but I did everything you and Deepika said.</p>
<p>There is no option to select 'Upgrade this PC now' in the tool. All I get is the message that everything is fine and that I just&nbsp;sit down and wait for the message that I can upgrade.</p>
<p>The USB-stick does not work. I get the message "Cannot read&nbsp; the &lt; ProductKey &gt; in the answer file for unattended installation." And removing the USB stick after the installation has started gives the message that Windows is missing&nbsp;a driver, e.g. for USB.</p>
<p>A clean install with the USB stick is possible, but I am asked for the Product key.
</p>
<p>I really don't understand why one computer easily can be upgraded, while the second one, 100% identical, give all those troubles.</p>
<p>Maybe someone can explain to me what "Cannot read&nbsp; the &lt; ProductKey &gt; in the answer file for unattended installation." means.</p>
<p>

<p>I can install Windows 10, but have to skip the activation key.</p>
<p>When I am done I get the message that Windows is not activated and I can't do anything with my PC.</p>
<p>For example: when I try to do something , e.g. change&nbsp;the color on my desktop, I get the message "not actvated" and then norhing happens.</p>
<p>I also find it&nbsp;strange that I have not received any message that I could install Windows 10 on any op my six PC's.</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem when trying to update from Windows Vista Business (32 bits) to Windows 8 Professional (64 bits).</p>
<p>I tried to install from the installation DVD since upgrading from within Vista is not supported (therefore I would need a 64 bits Vista).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it seems there was an USB stick in the computer when I tried to do it.</p>
<p>The USB stick was there because I had to install Raid drivers in order to install Vista (I have a Raid 1 configuration in this machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I removed the USB stick the problem was resolved and I was able to continue and upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hallo PWM van Dijk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zat er misschien een USB stick in de machine toen u dit probleem had?</p>
<p>Bij mij was dat het geval en de oplossing was om die eruit te halen.</p>

<p>That problem comes (almost certainly) from the fact that in your hard drive, there is a messed up Windows 10 (or 8) that was previously installed (in UEFI mode, I bet). The activation, or something in the system failed (you may notice unexpected behaviour
 in Windows Settings and Account management if you boot into it). That may come from the fact that the hard drive was on another motherboard before you installed it on that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Suggested solution:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With C: the supposed letter of your Windows partition (you can use "e:" command to go to parition e, and "dir" command on each one to see its content, just to make sure you're on the good partition. Windows parition often has Program Files, Program Files
 (x86), Windows folders, and maybe Intel or AMD folders).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(Of course, make sure you have no personal / important data on that partition.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After this wipe, run your USB flashdrive filled with an ISO of Windows (use Rufus instead of Microsoft Media Creation Tool ; Rufus allows you to choose GPT for UEFI or MBR for BIOS/Legacy) and install your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps other people as well.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - settings - storage usage - other&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just got a new laptop and so far have only installed a browser (Firefox), however, the HDD (128gb) is showing an alarming 60gb of free space. I know that the older version of windows (the laptop on power up did the Win 10 upgrade) is taking up some serious
 space at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;But, in settings and storage usage, the "other" section is showing 13.5gb used, but only showing around 1.5gb when you actually open the other section. How do I fine that other 12gb and more importantly, how do I know what parts of it are safe to remove?
 Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link but it didn't help sadly. Still got a discrepancy between what 'other' lists as used space, and the used space once you click on it and look inside. At the moment it says 11.5 gb used, but inside there is less than 1 gb listed? Puzzled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: I don't get the "other options" mentioned in that post you linked to. But I notice that post is from 2010 originally and so wouldn't have been connected to windows 10 at all, which is what I am using.

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that some folders are not showing under the <strong>Storage usage</strong> &gt;
<strong>Others </strong>since they are hidden. Though they are hidden, the space that they are taking will still be counted under
<strong>Storage usage</strong> &gt; <strong>Others</strong>. You'll have to identify what files and folder are hidden with the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>hidden </strong>in <strong>Cortana</strong>, the Windows search bar or your task bar.</li><li>Select <strong>Show hidden files and folders</strong> from the result.</li><li>Go to <strong>View </strong>tab.</li><li>Enable the <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>Apply</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with these steps, try checking the Storage usage again and see if it will match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it addressed your concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi there. I had already enabled "show hidden files and folders" so no luck there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It is very strange as the other folder in storage keeps showing what seem like random amounts of HDD space being taken up. At the moment it is saying 6.5gb - and again, once inside it says just over a gig is being used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Not sure what else is hidden that could be fluctuating in HDD space so wildly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks</p>

    <title>outlook address book not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carl43m  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook address book not working</h2>
                    A week ago I updated my vista&nbsp; home premium with sp2.&nbsp; However, my outlook address book which has worked perfectly for over a year now has a glitch.&nbsp; When I click my address book I get a message that it is empty or can't be found .&nbsp; I then have to go manually
 to contacts on left side of window and click it to see a list of contacts and then send my message.&nbsp; Additionally, when I type a message in font size 8 , the typing looks as big as a size 12 but when it goes to an adresee they get the message in a size that
 looks like a 4.&nbsp; Also, if I then go into sent messages the typing is very tiny.&nbsp; Neither of these issue were evident until after the sp2 update.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.<br />

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose.

<h2>            Unable to activate Windows 10 Pro error 0xC004F074.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 Pro activation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a laptop just few days back. It had windows 10 pre-installed. Yesterday, it automatically updated to Windows 10 pro. Now I'm getting a notification in bottom right corner of my screen as Activate WIndows. Go to Settings to activate Windows. So I
 went to settings and in the Activation seciton. I'm getting an error 0xC004F074. I mean something related to product key.</p>
<p>Could you please help?</p>

            <p>The best way to solve is to contact with the manufacturer of the device-as you said it is a new device. PC's which come with windows pre-installed are generally shipped with OEM licenses. They might give you a replacement key that would activate your windows.</p>

            Windows 10 Home was preinstalled. And it upgraded to Pro. That's what I could figure out. Because of auto update option Pro installed.

<h2>            Widerstand bei XBOX Afterglow Controller A-Knopf verschwunden&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hallo zusammen!</p><p>Ich habe mir Ende vergangenen Septembers den Xbox One Afterglow Controller genutzt und ihn seitdem unter Windows 10 für PC benutzt.</p><p>Jedoch wurde ich bereits bald enttäuscht was die Lebenszeit angeht: Der linke Analog-Stick nutzte sich etwas ab, was jedoch nicht ein riesiges Problem ist. Am schlimmsten wurde es, als nach wenigen Monaten der A-Knopf anfing, immer zu "kleben" und auch nach mehrmaliger Reinigung nicht mehr 100% den Widerstand wie die anderen Knöpfe aufbringen konnte und stattdessen bei stärkerem Druck schnell mal festhing.</p><p>Nun ist es jedoch passiert, und nach ca. 8 Monaten Nutzung ist der Widerstand für den Knopf komplett weg, er liegt nur noch lose im Knopbett und es wird zwar ein Drücken registriert, aber halt auch ständig.</p><p>Kennt jemand dieses Problem und weiß eine Möglichkeit, das Ganze zu reparieren?</p><p>Ich kenne mich mit der Garantie nicht aus und habe auch den Kaufbeleg leider nicht mehr, bin aber doch sehr enttäusc

<p>Hi&nbsp;DJSlice659,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be usually done if the other user account is only a Standard user. What I advise for you to do is to make the app
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. This way, before running the app, the Admin credentials are needed. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, find the app, right-click and select
<strong>Open file location</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the program and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Shortcut</strong> tab, click <strong>Advanced...</strong> button.</li><li>Tick the <strong>Run as administrator</strong> check box and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> again on your keyboard, and type <strong>UAC</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>User Account Control Settings</strong> window, set the bar to <strong>
Always notify</strong>. This way, every time the app is opened, Admin credentials are needed. NOTE: This will also prompt you whenever an app or software will attempt to make changes to your computer. In a way, it's also a good security feature so that you'd
 always be notified of changes on your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Let me know if there's anything else you need.</p>

<p>I see. I don't think there are other workarounds for this. The really best way for control a user account's access is by giving it permissions, however, with Admin account's that's a different story. Do let me know if you have further questions.</p>

<h2>            multiple errors suddenly</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo ideapad 320 (with Windows 10 preinstalled) started not working properly, for no reason. I have not made any changes to it and the antivirus is working fine. The laptop was working fine when I shut it down the night before. I honestly don t know
 what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet icon (on the taskbar) is gone, the audio service is not running, I cannot go online,&nbsp;windows firewall is not working and I cannot restart it. System restore is also not working.&nbsp;The software programs I have installed are
 working, including Libre Office, PDF, GIMP, I can see photos and video but without the sound.<br />
</p>
<p><span>I have had the laptop for a year and in the beginning it was working fine but then with all the windows updates it started showing 100% disk or memory, although the disk is far from full, only 200 GB out of 1TB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>THESE ARE SOME OF THE ERRORS IT SHOWS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows did not detect any networking hardware.</p>
<p><span>Network and sharing center – The dependancy service or group failed to start.</span></p>
<p><span>Connect to the internet - The wizzard cannot create the connection</span></p>
<p><span>Troubleshoot did not detect any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Network connections - The folder is empty.</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore -&nbsp;System Restore&nbsp;does not appear to be functioning correctly on this system. A volume shadow Copy service component encountered an unexpected error (0x80042302)</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore - The volume shadow Copy service used by&nbsp;</span>System Restore is not working. (0x81000202)</p>
<p>Windows backup - The backup oraplication coult=d not start due to an internal error. The service cannot be started either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it (0x80070422)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>realtek hd audio manager - You are seeing a blank page because there is no audio devices plugged into the system.</span></p>
<p><span>Dolby audio - Your installation is missing components.</span></p>
<p><span>Sound - No audio devices are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>We can t find an audio device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Without an internet connection my laptop is useless.</p>
<p>Plus, how can I get a copy of Windows 10 since I cannot perform a backup or make a copy in any way on an external drive? If I reinstall indows will it work or will it show the same faults?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine. (I believe this won't work in your case)
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to a clean Install - I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply. I will see what I can do.</p>
<p>System restore does not work and I cannot connect to the internet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I choose Reset this PC (or even a clean install) and if it works, how will it reinstall Windows since windows 10 came already installed and I cannot do a backup of it and do not have windows 10 on another type of media? I would like to avoid buying a
 new licence, since it is not my fault for these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I entered System - View basic information about your system, under Windows activation there is a product ID (a series of numbers and letters). If I download Windows 10 ISO image from the Microsoft website and I save it on an external drive, would it
 be enough to enter the product ID upon installation in order for it to work properly?</p>
<p>

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

            Hi Sourav
<br />
<br />Windows 10 now contains a full and competent Security Suite . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has, over the last few years become a fully featured Security solution 
<br />
<br />It is on a par with paid for Anti-virus software, the virus definitions are updated regularly, it will not slow our PC down, works well with Edge and it is Free 
<br />
<br />Defender now has a new feature - Controlled Folder Access, which protects against a ransomware attack
<br />
<br />Honestly, you do not need more protection than Defender can supply . ..       
        </p>

            Hi Sourav,<br />Windows 10 comes with a built in Anti virus called Windows Defender. You do not need to have any other Anti-virus. <br />However, you should keep Malwarebytes free as an on demand scanner for a greater secrurity is our suggestion. <br /><br />Hope that helps.

            Hello, Microsoft provides an anti virus feature by default called Windows Defender. This feature will protect your computer from big malware, and virus. Although you can rely on this feature, some virus tends to  slip through the Defender. You may want to install a third party app like Malwarebytes just to be sure that your computer remains safe. If you don't want to however, make sure to stay away from malicious websites and emails.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

            Hello SouravPaul3,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Windows Security/Defender itself is sufficient to protect your Windows 10 system against security threats. I am using it for years and it never disappointed me. Just make sure you keep its virus and spyware definitions up-to-date and it will do its best to safeguard your device.
<br />
<br />Regards.

    <title>System Failure On First Boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessicarubel  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Failure On First Boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, since the last windows update, I've been experiencing an issue- I'm not sure if it was actually caused by the update, but I felt it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I start up the computer, my first attempt to boot it never gets past the OS boot-up; it'll usually get to the screen where it shows Windows loading, and suddenly my computer just shuts down. But then when I try a second time, it always boots up
 fine, though I get a notification from my graphics software that my settings had been reset "due to an unexpected system failure". I can't really detect any other issues with the PC. My disk and driver scans, on third-party software and the Windows' methods,
 said that everything is fine. I haven't downloaded or updated any programs recently, including before the issues started. I've scanned with the multiple programs on my computer and I can't find any viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just wondering if anyone knew why this might be happening. It doesn't cause any real performance issues, maybe a little slow down but that may be a coincidence and isn't bad enough to really concern me. Is this from the new update? Is it just a bug
 that'll patch itself naturally or in the next update, or a different issue I should actually be concerned about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!</p>

            I searched high and low. So far only found VueScan at hamrick.com, a&nbsp;proprietary software that at least allows the continued used of outdated hardware when the original suppliers do not provide drivers for windows 7 &amp; 8. I am debating though whether to
 fork out $40 for it, or just save the money towards a new scanner or multifunction printer.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>So one can say that the scanner is compatible with win 7, but only if you are willing to spend money on VueScan, as Mirascan will not work with this scanner any more.</div>

    <title>When playing Age of Empires II - Enemies will not build up many - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> der fliegen dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            When playing Age of Empires II - Enemies will not build up many resources or troops</h2>
                    Hello. I have been playing Age of Empires II for years now. I have seen many strange things happen in the game, but this is just weird. The enemies on my game are no longer building up. They do gather resources, age up, and train a few units, but they
 seem to stop when their population is somewhere around 40. This problem has been going for the past year or so. I have played Age of Empires II on this same computer for so long, and I don't recall changing anything. I even played a quick regicide game this
 morning. The combined army of all four of my enemies was probably about 60 units. When I landed in their territory, they sent all of their troops individually, not in any sort of formation, kind of like when the British attack in the first scenario in the
 William Wallace campaign. These enemies had advanced through the ages, yet they had almost nothing stronger than a man-at-arms. The Koreans built two turtle ships, the Chinese built about six Chu-Ko-Nu's, but that's about it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It gets stranger, too. My brother has played on this computer several times. When he plays, he has epic battles where over a hundred units get involved at times. I played right after him. I mimicked his playing style on the exact same scenario and didn't
 even change a single setting. Once again, it was dismal. I tried all sorts of difficulties and still got nothing. I completely uninstalled the game (both the expansion and Age of Kings) and all of its associated software, and reinstalled it. Still nothing.
 I tried that patch, and still got the same results. Does anybody know how to fix this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            I do remember this issue, granted it was about 6 years ago when i was actively playing the game on a day to day basis. There is one thing i can suggest, and that's get an AI mod. Places like Age of Kings Heaven have very good AI mods. Link to AI mods

            You are going to need a 3rd party uninstaller program like Revo.

<br />
<br />Do you not have a system restore point you can revert back to?
<br />Sometimes that is easiest and fastest method.

            Hi atboybakeryfb, it will not uninstall using the normal method, use Revo Uninstaller, it is known that it removes Spy Sweeper successfully . . .
