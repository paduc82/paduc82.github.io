<h2>            When I open Internet Explorer 9 it asks me to allow this program to make changes to my computer</h2>
                    <p>Original title:<strong> IE9 Frustrations.</strong></p>
<p>I just got IE9 (for Windows 7 32bit) and besides not being able to watch videos which is annoying enough (could you help me fix that too?), but also when i go to the start button and open up IE9, every time it asks me if i want to allow this program to make
 changes to my computer. If i click no, IE9 doesnt open so i have to click yes. How to I make this notification disappear/ just let me into IE9 without the extra permission?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your help.</p>

            That's not normal behaviour. The box that pops up, could you provide a screenshot? Or tell us what the details of the box are? (What program it's saying it's from, etc.)? This sounds like either malware or a problem with an addon.<br />

            I'm not sure where the Compatibility View Settings are. I know what the button is on the website address bar that puts it in compatibility mode but is that what you're talking about? If so, it doesn't improve my videos.<br />
<br />
And when I tried the Active X filtering...i turned it on (it was off initially) and tried it and the video said to get Adobe Flash Player which i did-and it didn't work. It didn't register that i had it even after trying to do the download a few times and kept
 telling me to get the Flash Player. Then turned it off and again the video will play but there will only be sound and every once in a while i can move my mouse over the video and a piece of the video will show up.

            <p>Without wishing to be rude, in this case you don't need a screen shot. IE9 is behaving the same way on my PC: Each time I open IE9, the message appears about allowing IE9 - itself - to make changes to [my] computer - exactly as LB12-09's reply on July 9,
 2011&nbsp;to Entegy's question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clue - This started to happen after I (after no small effort) uninstalled IE10 and returned to IE9 on my Windows 7 64-bit system. HP's updater had installed IE10 as an update, but it must not have been ready for prime time as it would not load beyond a brief
 blank screen. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It occurs to me that some of these issues cannot be understood given the difficulty of replicating them and that programs like IE9 have become so incredibly complex. (If only Google Chrome had a better interface....)</p>

<p>Your reply does not address my issue at all, which further adds to the frustration.&nbsp; The link does nothing to rectify my posted issue.&nbsp; What it DOES do is show the insanity of deleting a backup to fix a backup issue, which is a problem in itself.&nbsp; I followed
 that instruction based on the hundreds of previous posts of people complaining of the same issue.&nbsp; In the past, this had worked, but the constant fear posted by hundreds of users was that what happens if you delete your good backup and it still does not work?&nbsp;
 This is EXACTLY my situation now.&nbsp; I deleted the backup in hopes of being able to back up my phone before moving to my new phone, and now I lost my backup AND I CAN'T BACKUP MY PHONE!&nbsp; I am upset beyond words, and support seems to not really have a true fix,
 just suggestions.&nbsp; I paid for a Microsoft based product and I paid for online storage, and yet I am not being helped as I should be.&nbsp; BTW, there is an instruction found in the link that you sent that is wrong.&nbsp; It says:</p>
<div>
Tip</div>
<div style="margin-left: -24px">
<div>
<p>
Deleting backups on your phone only removes the local copy, but you can delete backups permanently from OneDrive. Log in to&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=199230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">your
 OneDrive account</a>&nbsp;and go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Device backups</strong>. You'll see a list of your backups and can delete any you want.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This appears to be not true, as I deleted from my phone AND IT REMOVED THE BACKUP FROM OneDrive!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I uninstall Single Image 32 bit&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have a new laptop that came with Office 2010 trial version on it. I purchased the 2010 Home and Business version (64 bit) and uninstalled the trial. &nbsp;I'm trying to install the Microsoft Project Professional 2010 trial version, and I'm getting an error
 message telling me to uninstall Microsoft Single Image 32 bit. &nbsp;I can't find it. &nbsp;I've uninstalled the pre-installed office, and rebooted. &nbsp;I chatted with MS support (USELESS and FRUSTRATING. "Grace" hung up on my in the middle of my questions), and that didn't
 get me any closer to figuring out how to uninstall whatever I need to uninstall. &nbsp;I can't purchase the full version of this product until I evaluate the trial.&nbsp;

            Your best bet is to stick with 32 bit Office unless you have an explicit need to handle files larger than 2GB.&nbsp; The thing is, MS hasn't done a lot of work to take full advantage of 64 bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
YES, when you buy an Office license, you can download both 32 and 64 bit installation files and you can run one or the other on your computer. The Office installer is designed to allow one or the other to be installed at a time.<br />

Office</a> | By: emma</p>
<p>Office 2010 is the first release of Office that contains 64 bit edition. It’s recommended to install the 32 bit version Office 2010 due to compatibility issues however if you still want to try 64 bit version keep these in mind.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>32 bit version works on both 32 bit and 64 bit windows operation systems. But 64 bit version Office 2010 must be installed on 64 bit windows operation systems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can’t upgrade from 32 bit Office 2007 to 64 bit Office 2010 directly, you have to uninstall existing 32 bit Office products prior to install 64 bit Office 2010. (It’s okay to upgrade Office 2007 to 32 bit Office 2010 on
 either 32 bit or 64 bit operation systems) </li><li>You can’t run 64bit and 32bit office products side by side. For example, you can’t have side by side installation of 32 bit OneNote 2010 and 64 bit Outlook 2010
</li><li>Some of 32bit Office Add-Ins might not work on 64 bit Office 2010.
</li></ul>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p>64-bit Office 2010 product backup is available at <a href="http://www.office.com/backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.office.com/backup</a><span>&nbsp; </span>. However, we recommend most users install the 32-bit version of Office 2010. The 64-bit installation of Microsoft Office 2010 products are for users who commonly use very large documents or data sets
 and need Office 2010 programs to access greater than 2GB of memory. There are some technical limitations with the 64-bit version.</p>

<h2>            How do i copy specific contents from Excel attachments received in Outlook automatically to an Excel file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: How do i copy info from outlook to Excel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I receive an Email everyday via Outlook with numbers and percentages of our previous days results as well as the plan for today. I would like to automatically have certain information pulled from this email and copied into certain cells in an excel workbook.
 How would i go about making this happen? The Excel workbook has multiple sheets but the information is the same for all the cells. The email usually comes as an attachment and is an Excel file as well. I own and operate a MAC but the work will be done on a
 PC. I just want to familiarize myself before i go and attempt to make the changes at work. Thank you in advance for any and all help!&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Can someone out there please enlighten me what law I am breaking such that Outlook now insists upon reminding me that I'm forwarding messages from my Office 365 email account to a non Office 365 account? Every... Single... Time... I log into Outlook 365
 for the past several days I get this AAF notification, as if I am somehow unaware that I'm forwarding to another account. All I can conclude is that Microsoft, in its infinite wisdom, has decided I'm breaking the law and must stop forwarding. Never mind that
 it offers me no explanation or rationale for its insistence upon shoving this information down my throat.</p>

<p><span>Hello Andersonfmly,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my tests and experience, it is not feasible to turn off the notification. It is used to notify the customers that the Email Forwarding is turned on, in case some users forgot to turn off the feature when necessary.
 As a workaround, you can click “x” to turn off the notification. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, I think it is a good feature to let the users have ability to turn the notification off. I found a similar feature request. You can submit the feedback in Outlook Web App UserVoice for feedback:
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--outlook-on-the-web-office-365/suggestions/35207194-please-stop-the-forwarding-notification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your understanding is highly appreciated. </span>

<h2>            Updates for Office are ready to be installed, but first we need to close some apps</h2>
                    <p>I've been testing a registry fix to disable the notification in Office 2013 to upgrade to Office 2016:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\ClickToRun\Updates</strong></span></p>
<p>And under “<strong>UpgradeAdvertised</strong>” I set the value to 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a reboot the notification to upgrade to Office2016 has disappeared. However, there is now a notification in it's place:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beae2c8e-9681-4b88-9954-06dd5572d3d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beae2c8e-9681-4b88-9954-06dd5572d3d3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click update now it says Office is up to date:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8375fa7f-fb15-41ef-8364-b5a0ff2d9a5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8375fa7f-fb15-41ef-8364-b5a0ff2d9a5c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I close and open the office application the message returns. Is there a registry fix that we can use to also disable this notification?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note I've tried running through the repair options as stated in other discussions to no avail. Have also tried removing Office and downloading a fresh version. The notification still appears.</p>

            I am baffled as to how you have&nbsp; the&nbsp; "notification in Office 2013 to upgrade to Office 2016" in the first place. Are you running Office 365 as opposed to Office 2013 (Which version). PS: you should not be need to&nbsp;edit the registry. The message 'you're
 up to date' normally appears when you click on 'update now' That is by going to&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;Office Updates&gt;Update Now.

            Hello Mike
<br />
<br />This is normal, it could take few minutes up to several hour (24hrs), i see this daily. 
<br />Just give it a few minutes and if it do no load give a Microsoft support a touch and see if they need to run an internal tool for it, but it take time and differ.
<br />

<h2>            Can you delete older Office for Mac 2011 Identity backup files&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Office for Mac 2011 and have found multiples backup copies of my "Office for Mac 2011 Identity".&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These files are rather large and I need the additional hard drive space back. &nbsp;Can I delete the older "backups" copies of my Office identity?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The files are located in the following location:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft User Data\Office 2011 Identities\</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The folder contains the Main Identity and several backup copies of the same main identity. &nbsp;I only maintain one identity.</div>

<div>Main Identity</div>
<div>
<div>Main Identity [Backed up 2011-08-23 &nbsp;14.31.00]</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Main Identity [Backed up 2011-08-23 &nbsp;09.01.00]</div>
</div>

<div>Main Identity [Backed up 2011-06-08 &nbsp;07.04.00]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't want to delete if they are important to save in sequence.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Can I delete all of the backups or should I delete all but the latest backup copy? &nbsp;</div>

            As long as you are satisified with your current Main Identity you can safely delete the ones with [Backed up...]<br />
<br />
After a rebuild, some users have had to revert to the copy made with the [Backed up...] after the name. It's just a safety backup.<br />
<br />
However, if you've had to rebuild numerous times, you might find that you need to start over in a new Identity. Rebuild is not 100%.<br />
<br />
Under File &gt; Export select to export all your data as .olm file. This is the default action.<br />
<br />
Note if you do not get "Done" at the end but something like "one or more items didn't export" this indicates corruption.
<br />
<br />
Let me know if this does not export with "Done" and we can go over options to recover.<br />

    <title>Emails lost when downloading to Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob3007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails lost when downloading to Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; I have just opened an an Outlook account and have downloaded my emails (2006-2019) from my ISP's webmail server.&nbsp; Last night this seemed fine. When I opened tonight all the emails from 2006-2014 were missing from the Inbox and most had also been deleted
 from my ISP's server.&nbsp; Then, after about an hour they reappeared in Outlook.&nbsp; Then they disappeared again.&nbsp; The download/send bar at the bottom of the screen indicates there is activity, although it's stopped now and the 06-14 emails are missing again.</p>
<br />
<p>This is disastrous for me, so I'd really appreciate an explanation and some help in setting up Outlook to be stable - and not delete from the server.&nbsp; This was my first serious attempt to back up my emails, and I've lost hundreds (thousands?) in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange thing, although without the serious consequences of above, is that the inbox, sent and trash folders had another 6 folders nested one inside another folder full of duplicate emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp; Rob</p>
<p />

<p>There is no such thing as an Outlook account, there is MS Outlook the mail client (program) to which you add your mail account.</p>
<p>Who is your mail provider?</p>
<p>And if this is the first time you have used any version of MS Outlook and added your mail account it would have added the mail account as an IMAP type using the auto setup process where only the mail address &amp; password is required.</p>
<p>Within MS Outlook, File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Email Tab......... select your mail account...... what
<strong>Type</strong> is shown?</p>

<h2>            Network Connection &#40;VPN&#41; IPv4 properties not working in Build 10049</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in build 10049 I am not able to get to the IPv4 properties of my Network Connections any more.</p>
<p>I set up my usual VPNs. For them I have to change the Gateway stuff in the IPv4 properties, otherwise I will loose my internet connection when the VPN is connected. I went to Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections, went to the properties
 of the adapter, went to Networking. I tried double-clicking IPv4 and tried clicking the "Properties" button (which is enabled) but nothing happens. I tried it in all 3 VPN connections I created, some for all of them.</p>
<p>In build 10041 it was still working fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for a hint.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>got some good news. We found a workaround. A colleague pointed me to the right direction (thanks Philippe! :-)).</p>
<p>The properties of VPN&nbsp;connections are stored in PBK-files.</p>
<p>There seems to be one file per user which contains all connections. The file is located here:
</p>
<p>"C:\Users\<em>[YOURUSER]</em>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\rasphone.pbk"</p>
<p>You can open and edit&nbsp;it with an editor of your choice&nbsp;as it is a "good old" ini-like file.</p>
<p>The property to be edited in this case is "IpPrioritizeRemote". Just set it from "1" (true)&nbsp;to "0" and save. Afterwards it worked immediately for me as desired.</p>
<p>There are plenty more properties if one has to change something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would strongly recommend to copy the file to a save place before starting to fiddle around with it. This is surely not the preferred way to change those properties but a nice workaround for now. Be careful with it :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>marcipsen</p>

HOW DO I FIX THIS?&nbsp; I need another login for this like I need a hole in the head.<br />

    <title>Sum or Count in Query Produces Double the Correct Amount - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gpburdell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sum or Count in Query Produces Double the Correct Amount</h2>
                    <p>When I use sum or count in my query, I get double the correct result. &nbsp;When I use group by, the query produces the expected result. &nbsp;From my research, it seems that the result is from the Cartersian effect of joining tables, but I cannot find how to eliminate
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tables are Product, Customer and Transactions. &nbsp;Product uses the ProductNumber as the primary key. &nbsp;Customer has CustomerNumber as its primary key. &nbsp;Transaction has AutoNumber as its primary key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transactions is joined to Product by the ProductNumber and to Customer by the CustomerNumber, in each case using an inner join with enforce referential integrity. &nbsp;The objective of the query is to produce a total or a count of products purchased by customer.</p>

            <p>You'll need a combination of Grouping and counting... grouping by customer, counting products, and leaving out any fields that are not directly related to "count of product by customer", which may throw off the results.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Share point - Owner rights</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using the Share Point in the company.</p>
<p>For some of the Share Points I am the site creator (so the&nbsp;Share Point&nbsp;owner as well)&nbsp;and for some -&nbsp;I have been just granted the access of the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone please help me explaining why the Share Point site creator has the following rights, but when you add any&nbsp;other user to the owners of the site, they are not available for them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- only site creator can review the Revision history of the files stored.</p>
<p>- only site creator can grant owner rights to other user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose there should be also other rights not available for other owners I am not aware of, which is very inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to manage this and ensure all owners can have these rights?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Khrystyna,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed information and glad to know that you have resolved the problem with "<strong>only site creator can grant owner rights to other user</strong>".<br />
<br />
For the other problem, I suggest you perform the following information to check the outcome:<br />
<br />
Navigate to the SharePoint site &gt; click <strong>Library</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Library Settings</strong> &gt; under
<strong>General Settings</strong>, click <strong>Versioning settings</strong> &gt; after
<strong>Document Version History</strong>, make sure you have enabled versioning, not
<strong>No versioning</strong>.<br />
For your reference:<br />
 or library</a></span><br />

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please share the following information with us:<br />
1. A screenshot of the <strong>Versioning Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Let the other Owner click <strong>ellipsis…</strong> behind one file &gt; <strong>
ellipsis… </strong>&gt;<strong> Version History</strong>, can he accesses to Version History? And share a screenshot with us.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda</p>

            Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.

    <title>Focus view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kerryhood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Focus view</h2>
                    I've switched from Office 2004 to Office 2011. When I write Word documents I usually have it on Page Width for the largest format. With Focus View the Page Width is not as large as the 2004 version. Without enlarging the font every time to write a doc
 then changing it back to 12 point for printing, is there a way to enlarge the text? Thank you.

            <p>Kerry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always recommend "Draft View" for writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's a simplified view that gets much of the formatting out of the way so you can concentrate on what you are writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fonts and formatting are simplified, important things such as spaces and paragraph marks are enhanced. &nbsp;It takes a little time to get used to it, but it is a view that is specifically developed for efficient writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also saves a lot of battery power on a portable, and because it requires less CPU power, it speeds up Word and makes it much more responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who handle a lot of documents find that you cannot format the document until you have completed the content. &nbsp;Because the best layout to emphasise the important content cannot be achieved until the content is there. &nbsp;So best to use Draft View while
 you are creating, so you produce the best language possible: then go into Print Layout View and apply your styles to format it to present it in the most readable way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

the bolt indicates it is charging.
<div>FYI, the 80's have been out of production for a while, so yours has been sitting unused long enough for the battery to have lost quite a bit of its initial charge. &nbsp;So, don't worry if it takes a bit to charge up, and is non-responsive. &nbsp;It can't turn on
 and start indicating things, including that it's charging until it has reached a minimal charge state. &nbsp;It's also possible that your PC USB socket is part of a hub (common on laptops) so has lower than full power to charge if other USB items are also connected.
 &nbsp;Plugging into the wall of course eliminates this 'shared' power state and will charge at the fastest rate. &nbsp;You will probably be fine by the time you see this reply!</div>

<h2>            Error starting Ofice 365 everytime I shutdown computer</h2>
                    Every morning when I restart my computer, Office 365 reports that there is an error and to reinstall.&nbsp; I then have to go through the process of downloading Office 365 again.&nbsp; This is extremely inconvenient, especially when I have to urgently access documents
 of spreadsheets.&nbsp; I find myself using alterative programs that work properly more often than Office 365.&nbsp; Why is this happening and how can it be prevented.&nbsp; I have a monthly subscription to Office 365 installed on one Win 7 computer
