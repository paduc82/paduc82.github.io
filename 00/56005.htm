<h2>            Is my HDD going bad&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Need some help - I think I broke hubby's Xbox while he's deployed... eek!</p>
<p>We have a 360 Slim with a memory stick.&nbsp; It's been totally fine up until last night.&nbsp; Had Fallout New Vegas in the drive, but was actually connected to the wifi watching Netflix, signed into Live with my account/avatar.&nbsp; Netflix was running too slow, so
 I signed out, went back to the homescreen to play Fallout, and it froze (never had that happen before).&nbsp; I turned off the console and turned it back on, but when I did, it didn't log into a Live account, didn't recognize there was anything in the tray, and
 all of our avatar/Live accounts were gone.&nbsp; I tried to download my account, and it told me that I needed an Xbox memory unit to do that.&nbsp; I tried to connect to wifi, and it told me I needed a wifi adapter to do that, which is odd since we've never had an issue
 connecting it to the wifi in the 5+ years we've owned it.</p>
<p>So after a slight pit in my stomach, I turned it off and on again.&nbsp; Same thing.&nbsp; It's like it factory reset itself (or wiped itself clean) but then forgot that it's even got a storage unit or wifi adapter inside!&nbsp; Did this twice more, and the last time I
 did it, it went back to normal - signed me into Live right away, all our accounts were there, wifi was connected, showed Fallout in the tray.&nbsp; No issues.&nbsp; I went to try and get to the social screen, just to have a look around, and it froze again.&nbsp; When I turned
 off and on, it was back to the "wiped clean" setup.&nbsp; That's how it's stayed.</p>
<p>I did download an update on Sunday night, and this was the second time I've used it since then.&nbsp; There is no red ring of death, but at times the controllers seem to just keep searching and searching to connect to the console and they aren't really communicating
 well.&nbsp; Also, when I try to play any game in the tray on the "wiped clean" setup, it either freezes or tells me there's nothing there.</p>
<p>Is it dead? Please don't give my husband more ammunition to buy a One, and tell me this is fixable!&nbsp; I have no idea how to open the console, or even what I would do once it's open, but someone suggested maybe the HDD is either loose or bad.&nbsp; Is there anything
 I can do to fix this?&nbsp; Thanks for ANY help you can give me!!</p>

            <p>Hello Littleissa,</p>
<p>At this link here you can read about different troubleshooting steps pertaining to various hard drive-related issues: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../hard-drive</a></p>
<p>To take the hard drive out and put it back in you do not need to open up the console per sé, it's more opening a cover. There's a guide here, covering all the Xbox 360 models: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a></p>
<p>You may also want to run through the steps for troubleshooting a bad update, which you can find here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/system-update-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../system-update-help</a></p>
<p>Let us know how you get on and if you have any questions.</p>

<p>I don't think the OP's console actually has a 'hard drive'. &nbsp;As the fast sentence states
<em>"We have a 360 Slim with a memory stick."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</em>I'm pretty certain this this is an Xbox 360 4GB Slim, in which case it won't have 'hard drive' to remove. &nbsp;The 'Memory unit' is non user replaceable. &nbsp;Basically, looking at all the evidence, the console has some kind of of general hardware failure. &nbsp;The
 4GB Memory Unit in the 4GB slim can fail just like any Flash storage and it can not be removed because it's attached to the console motherboard.<br />
<br />
If it was just the on-board storage that had failed, you could still use the console if you attached a hard drive. &nbsp;However, with the WiFi failing, the DVD drive not recognising discs and the inability to connect controllers properly suggests it has indeed
 failed.<br />
<br />
Other than set up a repair, no there is nothing else you can do. &nbsp;Sorry.<br />
<br />

<p>Maybe I stated it wrong. &nbsp;It's got a flashdrive that my husband has some movies and a couple game saves on, but we only just got that last year. &nbsp;Before that, we weren't using any external memory for it. &nbsp;I don't know if that affects what can be done, but
 I thought I'd clarify just in case.</p>

            <p>It depends on the model. Some consoles are sold as a 4GB model, which is basically only some internal flash memory and does not count as a hard drive, whereas if the model you have is a 250GB (or anything other than 4GB; 120GB, 320GB or 500GB could also be the case) then it's one with an additional, removable hard drive. If you're not sure, by following the steps I linked above you'll find out (there either is or won't be a hard drive where the guide says there is one).</p>

<p>OP --I'll save you some time. USB Thumb drives, use something known as flash memory. To save you time, they basically have a finite amount of read/writes before they stop working. For this reason, it's very, very cheap. For something like storing documents
 on, it's not a problem. However, since the Xbox reads and writes to the thumb drive a heck of a lot more than a document would, these drives fail quickly. I wouldn't recommend using a thumb drive on an Xbox for any amount of time. The performance on them is
 terrible, and they fail fairly quickly. For these reasons I suggest buying an external Hard Drive. You can buy 500 GB drives for fairly cheap, and they're going to last you a lot longer than a USB stick (provided you don't knock them around, mechanical drives
 are fragile creatures). As for brands, I would stay away from Seagate and PNY under all costs. You get what you pay for, and these drives are borderline trash. That, and they have compatibility issues with Xbox 360s. Western Digital drives are very resilient
 and are available for decent prices. I recommend buying a Western Digital Passport drive. They're small, portable, and are pretty darn great!</p>
<p>If your USB stick is working half the time, or at all, I would recommend that you stop use immediately to save your data from any potential loss that could happen if you continue using the drive.</p>
<p>If that's too long and you don't feel like reading that fat blob of text, don't use USB sticks. Buy yourself a Western Digital External. If you're tight on space you can buy a Western Digital Passport drive. Also, Seagate and PNY suck so avoid those.</p>
<p>Good luck! :)</p>

            Hi Anandhu
<br />
<br />If you download the Update normally through the Settings App or if you use the Update Assistant, the download size is between 3.3GB and 3.7GB, depending on your system . . .
<br />
<br />If you download the Windows 10 ISO and upgrade using that the download size is approx. 4.9GB

                    <p>Hi everyone. I am a part time game developer and I am in talks with a large IP holder that is considering letting me have their hard drives from previous games to make them a new one. Before they want to give me these hard drive of uncooked assets they want to know the cost of each marketplace cut before they proceed since the game is planned on being free to play but with hundreds of map packs. &nbsp;How much does MS take per $10 dlc pack sold?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Can anyone tell me? and if not publicly can someone DM me the answer?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Resets Apps Pinned to Start ARROGANTLY DELETING  MY CHOICES</h2>
                    <p>The latest Windows 10 Update on both of my PC's reset the apps pinned to Start with Microsoft defaults.&nbsp; My pinned list was selected and organized to maximize my productivity by not wasting my time hunting for my most used applications.&nbsp; Further, my choices
 reflecting apps for certain tasks from non Microsoft authors which I preferred.&nbsp; Finally, it one more time pushed on my services and apps which I either have no interest in.&nbsp; Most annoying being games, entertainment, and Microsoft selected news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The arrogance of this is astounding.&nbsp; This leads of course to another issue,and that is Microsoft's, Google's, et. al. battle to each be the mega supplier of all things.&nbsp; Microsoft should stop trying to be a content provider.&nbsp; I do not need them to provide
 a map service, videoconferencing,&nbsp; photo album organizer, news aggregator, music store, etc.&nbsp; Just stop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead give me easy to install software that is less prone to errors or conflicts with earlier versions.&nbsp; Tell me when an update really is critical not just for one your apps.&nbsp; And I no longer want to be a home hobbyist to maintain our pc's and office network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, hell with it, I spend a few thousand dollars each year on software, hardware, and support.&nbsp; I feel totally used and abandoned by Microsoft.&nbsp; MS is going to lose my market segment.</p>

<h2>            Echo using Kinect</h2>
                    <p>For the love of God, WHY&nbsp;do I keep getting an echo, (varying from slight to intense) during party or game chat? &nbsp;I've tried everything. &nbsp;As of now, I've got the Kinect set up basically right in front of me, with nothing obstructing it. &nbsp;I have no exterior noise in the room. &nbsp;Both my connection and my Multi Player connection tests run as "It's all good". &nbsp;&nbsp;My network connections are: Wired, Download speed:&nbsp;139.64, Upload speed: 10.43, Packet loss: 0%, MTU&nbsp;1480, Latency: 79&nbsp;ms.&nbsp; I'm concerned that the echo is also on the end of others in the party, as well as being irritating to me. &nbsp;Sometimes I don't hear the echo, but worry that others do. &nbsp;Should I just forgo the Kinect?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there an alternative to Kinect that DOESN'T involve the boo-**** of having to wear a headset?</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>No matter how you set your kinect up there will always be ambient noise from your television. &nbsp;The best option for communicating with clarity and no background noise is to use a headset. &nbsp;You do not have to spend tons of money on them but you get what you pay for. &nbsp;The basic $20 variety from microsoft are exactly that - a $20 headphone. &nbsp;Turtle Beach has reasonable headsets ranging from $50 to a car payment. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have used virtually every option from Kinect to higher end headphones. &nbsp;I&nbsp;am currently using Turtle Beach headset that I&nbsp;paid $70 for when I&nbsp;first purchased my XB1 when they released. No issues and I&nbsp;feel that they have more than reached their value. &nbsp;Good luck and sorry to hear that you are having issues with your setup. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Connecting Surface Pro 2 Mini Displayport to HDMI</h2>
                    I recently purchased a Mini Displayport to HDMI adapter and used it to connect to my Sony tv with no issues, plug and play worked great.
<div>The following day i connected my surface to one of my monitors to test it out and this also worked great!</div>
<div>I later went to watch a movie on my tv using the adapter but received no signal message and no sign of a connection on my surface. I tried different resolutions, HDMI cords, and even tried out two of my monitors, all with no luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm planning to test out the adapter on a friends surface soon to check if its the adapter that's the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div>Alex</div>

    <title>Surface pro 3 auto rotate not working after Windows 10 Creator Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hawkeye99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 3 auto rotate not working after Windows 10 Creator Update</h2>
                    I noticed that after the Windows 10 Creator Update, the auto-rotate feature on my Surface Pro 3 stopped working when I switched into tablet mode. When I have the type cover attached, the rotation lock button is greyed out (which is no big deal), but when
 I remove the type cover and switch to tablet mode, the rotation lock button becomes active. I've double checked to make sure rotation lock is off, and the screen still won't auto-rotate when the surface is in tablet mode. I've restarted the surface and ran
 the troubleshooter suggested by the microsoft website, with no luck. Any help resolving this issue would be appreciated, thanks.

            Why would you want Auto rotate to work with the Type Cover attached? Thats intended behavior. 
<br />
<br />I just tried this, I detached my Type Cover from Surface Pro 3, then a notification appeared 'Auto rotate is on' and the rotation lock in Action Center is no longer grayed out. 
<br />
<br />Reattached it and its grayed out again.

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great news that windows 10 has different package come with or we can add our country language. However, we need support for the letter, keys equivalency in English. We don't have the keyboard printed on our language on keyboard. And like my language,
 Nepali, has more much letters than English and hence all letter can't found on the keyboard, Thus, it need combination keys like with alt + digits. Or I don't is there new ways of combination. As there is language packs and I can use it, there should whole
 pack documentation of how to type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can I get this ????&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            cannot add the forza horizon .exe to logitech gaming app because the exe is locked.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to add the forza horizon game executable to the list of games in my logitech gaming app so that i can edit the wheel settings via the app. However when i press open on the exe, it just says you do not have permission to open this file, contact
 the owner. It also has a little padlock on the side of the icon. It also does this when i try to add it to my steam library therefore stopping me from opening it via the steam big picture mode.</p>
<p>I have also tried reinstalling the game to check that it wasnt just me that had done something but the outcome was the same. Also I am an admin on this pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have tried reinstalling the app however that did not work as it is the permission of the file that seems to be the problem &nbsp;it does launch from the windows app store. When I try to open the .exe in any kind of program such as steam or the logitech app
 it says I need permission from system to do this.</p>

<h2>            Blizzard Mountain DLC Content Missing &#38; Apparently Irretrievable</h2>
                    <p>I've just been on Microsoft Support chat with a chap named Franklin for the best part of an hour, to no avail.</p><p><br /></p><p>I recently reinstalled all of my games onto a new external HDD after calamity struck the last one and it took a tumble from my desk. Today I tried to access the Blizzard Mountain expansion area in Forza Horizon 3 only to be told that it wasn't installed. The Expansion Pass is installed on my Xbox and I have access to the Hot Wheels area. It then took me to an in game screen and&nbsp;it shows as&nbsp;purchased, so I click install and it sends me to the Xbox store and demands that I pay for it to download the content.</p><p><br /></p><p>I followed Franklin's instructions to check my purchase history for the expansion pass and the blizzard mountain content, and neither show up on the pages I was directed to. It's a bit ridiculous considering I installed the expansion pass last week when I was painstakingly replacing over 3Tb of data on my external HDD.</p><p><br

<p>My sndvol32.exe file is missing, is there any other way to install it other that downloading it off of my windows xp cd, as I have lost that. I don't really have anybody I can borrow one from. Can I get a download free online somewhere?</p>

            I would not mess with or put anything in the Prefetch folder - it takes care of itself.<br />
<br />
You should copy the sndvol32.exe file in the two folders indicated:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite existing files.<br />
<br />
If your sndvol32.exe keeps disappearing, it is probably due to malicious software or your antivirus/antimalware application deleting the file thinking it is a threat.&nbsp; If that is happening, whatever you are currently using for AV protection is afflicted or
 defective.<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for AV protection, I would do this ASAP:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>

<p>i was hoping someone could help me. i'm trying to delete a folder that i restored from my backup file.</p>
<p>at first it said i needed permission from trusted installer. i searched and did all the changing ownership and allowing all permissions but i am still unable to delete said folder.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span><span>nyanyamd</span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you are getting when you try to delete the folder?</span></p>
<p><span>It would be helpful if you mention the steps you have tried to delete the folder.<br />
<br />
Let’s try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1<br />
</span></strong><span>Let’s try to take ownership of the folder and then try to delete.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Locate the folder which you want to delete in windows explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right click on file or folder and select “Properties” from Context Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on Edit button in Properties windows, click ‘Ok’ to confirm UAC elevation request.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select user/group from permission windows or click ‘Add’ to add other user or group.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Now under Permission section check the rights which you want to grant i.e. check “Full Control” under the “Allow” column to assign
 full access rights control permissions to Administrators group.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click Ok for changes to take effect and click ok final ok to exit from Properties window.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span><br />
You may also try to delete the folder from command prompt by using this command.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Type ‘cmd’ in start search box.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right click on cmd.exe in the program list and then select the option Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>c. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>d.Type this command and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>DEL [drive:][path]filename [/P]</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>which file is he trying to delete?</span></p>

<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is it any file that is related to the Nokia Smartphone?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to delete the file after taking ownership of the files or folder:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Locate the file or folder you want to take ownership of.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right-click the file or folder, click
<b>Properties</b>, and then click the <b>Security</b> tab.</span> </li><li>
<span>Click <b>Advanced</b>, and then click the
<b>Owner</b> tab.</span> </li><li>
<span>Click <b>Edit</b>, and then do one of the following:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click
<b>Other users and groups </b>and, in <b>Enter the object name to select (examples)</b>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<b>OK</b>. </span></li><li>
<span>To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the
<b>Change owner to</b> box, click the new owner. </span></li></ul>
</li><li>
<span>(Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the
<b>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</b> check box.</span></li></ol>
<p>
<span>If the above steps did not work, then it would be better to contact the smartphone manufacturer.</span></p>

<p>This is very abnormal. I would assume that it's a hardware-related issue.</p>
<p>If you get absolutely nowhere, try contacting the manufacturer for a repair.</p>
<p>It's pretty hard to help you on the lock screen, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to force yourself into the Recovery options by shutting down your PC by the power button 3 or so times, but that is a last minute resort and all on you.</p>

            Hi mattsanborn
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Media gets stuck downloading at 0&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    So I recently bought a ssd and I want to put a fresh install of windows 10 on it. I went to download the installation media for windows 10 which ran fine. I went to download windows 10 installation media on a flash drive of mine (32GB) so I could later
 boot off the usb and download windows 10 to my ssd. However when trying to download the files it gets stuck at 0% and won't load any further. Any help would be appreciated and why it won't download.&nbsp;

<p>I have exactly the same problem, some programs were eliminated from Windows 8 doing a refresh, among them Overdrive Media, reloaded it, it needs the security update. Have tried with Tools on Overdrive also the Microsoft site, the gray area does not accept
 anything. I called Microsoft, very polite but they could not help. Has your problem been solved? If so how, please? Thank you.</p>

<p>I was having the same problem - could not get the WMP security upgrade needed to work with OverDrive. I found the solution h ere:

<font color="#0072c6">http://blog.jongallant.com/2012/11/windows-media-player-overdrive-error.html</font></a><br />
<br />
Essentially, you have to disable IE10 Protected Mode (Tools-&gt;Internet Options-&gt;Security-&gt; uncheck Enable Protected Mode). You'll get a warning, but ignore it. Go back to the security upgrade and page and try again (<a href="http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://drmlicense.one.microsoft.com/Indivsite/en/indivit.asp</font></a>).

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you have metioned seems to be very confusing. </p>
<p>You had installed the media player security upgrade when you were using the Windows legacy operating system and now when you upgraded to Windows 8, the same media player security upgrade is not present on the computer and due to which you get the error "windows
 media player encountered a problem while playing The file" Is this what you are trying to explain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the issue, then try installing the media player security upgrade again. I think you can do it from this:</p>

</p><p>By default the power settings are set to sleep but there is a way to change this.

<p>

<li>Press Windows Key = R </li><li>Type control panel and click OK or enter</li><li>Hardware and sounds</li><li>Power Options</li><li>Choose what the power button does</li><li>From the power button and lit settings you might be able to select from a drop down menu the power states drop down menu, one of them is hibernate.
