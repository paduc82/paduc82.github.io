    <title>Internet Backgammon Disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob oc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Backgammon Disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I have had a lot of trouble with Windows Internet Backgammon disconnecting me from a game I am in the middle of playing, and now it's almost every time I play.&nbsp; In the middle of a game I get a pop up error message that says "A network error occurred
 while communicating with the game server".&nbsp; See this link for the message ... http://s944.photobucket.com/user/eaglerjo/media/Screen%20Shot%2008-2016.jpg.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had some&nbsp;trouble connecting to Windows Internet Backgammon in the past, and ended up going down multiple rabbit holes (clean boot, safe mode, uninstall/reinstall the game, registry errors, internet connection issues, bla bla bla) ...&nbsp;only for it to
 turn out that there was nothing wrong with my computer/connection, and it was just a busy or down Microsoft game server that would be working again the next&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This recent problem is more annoying and frustrating because its like I cant even play one game before the MS server disconnects ... not to mention being disconnected gives you a loss for the game.&nbsp; And it's not my internet connection, as I have watched
 this while playing and the server still disconnects with a solid connection.&nbsp; Can Microsoft please fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know they are really pushing people to upgrade to Windows 10, but that's not an option for me, and it's not right to just&nbsp;let Windows 7 users suffer, so please fix this.&nbsp; P.S. I am running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 bit with all windows updates installed.</p>

            I have been having the same problem - it has progressively been getting worse. Is this because I am not using Windows 10?

            <p>I understand Windows 10 has different games, which are applications that you download.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually if you upgrade to Windows 10, you loose the built-in Microsoft Internet Backgammon, and can no longer play it.&nbsp; See this thread ...
</p>

<p>
</p><p>My real point was it seems like&nbsp;Microsoft if focusing too much on their new baby to push that, and Windows 7 users, the primary predecessor&nbsp;to 10 (considering 8 is a flop and being swept under the carpet and there is no 9) are starting to see the signs of
 neglect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft cant keep something simple like a built-in&nbsp;internet game for a preceding system running smoothly, how can you have any confidence in their systems as an existing user.&nbsp; And what happens to Windows 10 users once the next best thing comes out
 ... like Windows 360 (cause there already is a Windows One).</p>

            I'm experiencing the same thing too, every single time I play it disconnects partway through. Haven't got to play a complete game in months. They're likely doing this deliberately, drive people into paying for windows 10. Because if they just left it as
 is, it'd continue like it always was previously. They have to actively alter it to make it disconnect every time like this.

            It seems the games are gone for good. What amazes me is that there must be thousands of people playing spades, backgammon, checkers, where are all the protests?, just a handful here &amp; there.

<p>I have some insight on how MS is doing this. They deliberately make it so people who don't use it much, like just using it few times a month, get these connection problems. But people who use it daily must care about it more, so MS doesn't give them the
 connection issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think they're doing it that way because I used it for years with it rarely having this issue. Then I stopped using it for several months, and when I started again it started having the connection issues nearly every time. Last weekend though I tried several
 times every day, after enough tries it stopped having the connection issue. Got to play around 10 games in a row last weekend without connections breaking, when before that it disconnected nearly every time. So when you connect to play the game, MS probably
 tracks your IP to see how much you use it. Then just give the connection issues to people who won't miss the game too much, try to phase out those people from using the game.</p>

<h2>            Why do I keep getting an error message when trying to burn a DVD&#63;</h2>
                    DVD burner has always worked great, but all of a sudden every time I try to burn a DVD it gets to 98% burned, then stops and pops out the DVD and&nbsp; I get this message: "Cannot create the DVD. An error occurred when burning the DVD"&nbsp; I have tried every single
 troubleshooting suggestion on the help page but nothing works.&nbsp; After that the DVD is unusable, so something is getting burned to it but it won't finish.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues. Have you added
<br />
devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to
<br />
this occurring. Could be BIOS as well.<br />
<br />
For 9f&nbsp;it means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device Manager<br />
to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound<br />
and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
See next message for driver update methods.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). Update BIOS when doing drivers.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Generic troubleshooting methods - and you already gave the info. Keep eye on it while testing to see<br />
if the BCCode changes.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your
<br />
system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

<br />
Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />
mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<span><strong>Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.3.2 Highlights</strong></span>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span><strong>Support For<br />
</strong>01.Tom Clancy’s The Division® 2<br />
02.Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI: Gathering Storm <br />
03.Up to 4% average performance gains on AMD Radeon VII with Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.3.2 vs 19.2.3. RS-288<br />
04.DirectX® 12 on Windows®7 for supported game titles <br />
05.AMD is thrilled to help expand DirectX® 12 adoption across a broader range of Windows operating systems with Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 18.12.2 and onward, which enables consumers to experience exceptional levels of detail and performance in
 their games.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span><strong>Fixed Issues<br />
</strong>01.Radeon ReLive for VR may sometimes fail to install during Radeon Software installation.<br />
02.Fan curve may fail to switch to manual mode after the manual toggle is switched when fan curve is still set to default behavior.<br />
03.Changes made in Radeon WattMan settings via Radeon Overlay may sometimes not save or take effect once Radeon Overlay is closed.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span><strong>Known Issues<br />
</strong>01.Rainbow Six Siege™ may experience intermittent corruption or flickering on some game textures during gameplay.<br />
02.DOTA™2 VR may experience stutter on some HMD devices when using the Vulkan® API.<br />
03.Mouse cursors may disappear or move out of the boundary of the top of a display on AMD Ryzen Mobile Processors with Radeon Vega Graphics.<br />
04.Performance metrics overlay and Radeon WattMan gauges may experience inaccurate fluctuating readings on AMD Radeon VII..</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span><strong>Added Vulkan® Support<br />
</strong>01.VK_EXT_depth_clip_enable <br />
01a.This extension allows the depth clipping operation, that is normally implicitly controlled by the driver to be controlled explicitly by the application instead. This is useful for translating Direct3D content, which assumes depth clamping is always enabled,
 but depth clip can be controlled by the DepthClipEnable rasterization state.<br />
02.VK_EXT_memory_priority <br />
02a.This extension allows applications to set a priority value at memory allocation time, which could be used to determine which allocations are more likely to remain in device local memory if heap limits are reached.<br />
03.VK_EXT_memory_budget <br />
03a.This extension adds support for querying the amount of memory used and the total memory budget for a memory heap.<br />
04.VK_KHR_vulkan_memory_model <br />
04a.This extension formally defines how to synchronize memory accesses to the same memory locations performed by multiple shader invocations.<br />
05.VK_EXT_debug_utils <br />
05a.This extension allows developers to obtain more debug information. When combined with validation layers, more detailed feedback on the application's use of Vulkan can be further obtained.<br />
06.VK_KHR_depth_stencil_resolve <br />
06a.This extension adds support for automatically resolving multisampled depth/stencil attachments in a subpass in a similar manner as for color attachments.<br />
07.VK_KHR_shader_float16_int8 <br />
07a.This extension allows use of 16-bit floating-point types and 8-bit integer types in shaders for arithmetic operations and improves usability of those types by adding implicit conversions.<br />
08.VK_EXT_transform_feedback <br />
08a.This extension adds transform feedback to the Vulkan API by exposing the SPIR-V TransformFeedback and GeometryStreams capabilities to capture vertex, tessellation or geometry shader outputs to one or more buffers.</span></div>

<h2>            Constant BSOD and freezes Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10. When i upgraded my motherboard CPU and RAM to i7 6700K my computer started freezing randomly during gaming and surfing. I have tried using another CPU and the same error remains. I have ran memtest and reformatted the computer but
 the problem persists. Sometimes i get a BSOD but other times the computer just hangs with the sound going like bzzzzzzzz and I am forced to do a hard reboot. I ran driver verifier and it gave me an error:</p>
<p>
</p><pre>DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (c4)
A device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been caught.  This is
because the driver was specified in the registry as being suspect (by the
administrator) and the kernel has enabled substantial checking of this driver.
If the driver attempts to corrupt the system, bugchecks 0xC4, 0xC1 and 0xA will
be among the most commonly seen crashes.
Arguments:
Arg1: 0000000000002004, subclass of driver violation.
Arg2: ffffe00085eb0f08
Arg3: fffff80188a201f0

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Has to be hardware - work with the motherboard maker's support and forums. Also<br />
check with the memory provider and Intel.<br />

<br />
You could try running Prime95 and other hardware stressing programs however you<br />
already know that such stress causes the BSOD and other issues.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>The work-around would be to sign on to the second account via Skype for Web.</p>

<h2>            cd command when there is a period in the directory name</h2>
                    how to use a cd command when there is a period in the directory name<br />
I am trying to use the cd command to navigate to a directory called mysql5.1.53 but the cd command does not seem to work when there are periods in the directory name.&nbsp; I also tried "mysql5" since I read somewhere the cd command would look for anything beginning
 with the directory name I typed in the command but that does not work either. I am on Windows 7<br />

<p><span>It’s possibly the old ‘long name’ restriction, use CD MYSQL5~1</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Another way of opening a cmd prompt at a specific location without using CD is to navigate to your folder mysql5.1.53 in Explorer. Now hold down the Shift key, right-click on the folder name/icon and choose Open command window here.</span></p>

<h2>            HP laptop hangs at Login, showing no password prompt</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has been happily (most of the time) running Windows 10. &nbsp;However just yesterday (and i believe after an automatic update) i cant get past the lovely scenery login page. &nbsp;If i press the keyboard it greys a little as if it is going to display the
 password prompt but then just sits there. &nbsp;Ive tried everything I can find on the internet to remedy the problem. &nbsp;I’ve tried safe mode and many other things. &nbsp;Im not really sure what to do to sort this out. &nbsp;My gut feeling is its a conflict somewhere along
 the line. &nbsp;My laptop is a HP Pavillion. HELP!</p>

            Hi Jamie,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

</p><p>I have checked the site for ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4500 Series graphics drivers and AMD only provide the driver support through Windows Update. The driver is dated Jan 2015 and version is 8.970.100.9001 and my driver version is upto date.</p>

    <title>Not all command lines of CMD are working in Powershell - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not all command lines of CMD are working in Powershell</h2>
                    Since Powershell is the main command tool in Windows 10 Insider build 14971.1000 and the CMD has gone in the background I am missing some command lines from "HELP", like "SET" in the Powershell. The HELP command in Powershell is also not working. So as
 said, not all the command lines are not working in PowerShell. Also specific information about the command using for "COPY /?" for more information about the command line etc is also not working in Powershell. I will miss these when Powershell will be the
 only command tool.

            <p>In build 14971.1000 Microsoft has changed Command prompt with Powershell&nbsp;in the right-click context Startmenu, see screenshot below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Batch files (.bat or .cmd) will also not run properly in Powershell because not all command lines of HELP are working in the Powershell. How do we run batch (.bat) files with command lines that aren't supported&nbsp;in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider you have a file "test.bat" on the root of the D: dirve. You can't run in it Powershell by entering "test.bat" on the D: drive. The term will not be recognized. You have to write "D:\test.bat" to run it in Powershell. That is strange behaviour. In
 the old CMD you didn't had to add "D:\" path in the line to run it in the opened directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know CMD&nbsp;can still be executed in the Startmenu of build 14971.1000, but it looks they are changing this behaviour. It is now hidden from the contextmenu by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who prefer to use Command Prompt, you can opt out of the WIN + X change by opening Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar, and turning “Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the Start button or press Windows
 key+X” to “Off”.</p>

            They may have changed what a particular menu item calls, but Command Prompt is still there if you want to use it. Don't assume that because something is no longer front and centre that it's gone or will be killed off.

<p>1. Switch back to cmd if you don't like the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Cross the bridge only when you come to it instead of worrying right now about removal of cmd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. IMO the 'bridge' will never come (or at least not any time soon) because there are probably a gazillion batch files in use out there, including important ones in major companies. Support for all those simply cannot be abandoned by MS. So even

<p>Being a game specific issue, MS cannot do anything to fix it. You would have to try contacting the developers, who unfortunately don't seem to be helping anybody in this situation. In order to play the game online again you would have to create a new account.

<h3> splatt3rs  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x80070008 Error on just Dance DLC</h2>
                    
<p>Purchased two songs for Just Dance, but they will not install. Keeps coming back saying that I should check error 0x80070008 on this site. Enter that in the Error Code Search and there are no results for that error code.
<br />
I generally purchase two songs fortnightly for Just Dance every time my five year old son comes to visit as we love playing the game together and it has become our favourite thing to do on a Friday night. Not only have I now spent over an hour trying to work
 it out, he is a bit upset that he couldn't get any new songs either. Getting pretty tired of the xboxones s&amp;*^.</p>

<p>I've been having this same problem for a while. contacted Ubisoft and they advised me that it was a problem with one of the DLC files and to install them one by one. Unfortunately that didn't work for me either. Deleted the full game(its the downloaded version)
 as well as all the add-ons. Either of you recieved a response that works? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I managed to get all 15 songs installed. Uninstall all the songs that are not showing on the console and install them through the xbox store instead of through the game. Worked for me and its running just fine. Finally a solution that worked for me</p>
