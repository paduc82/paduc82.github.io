<h2>            Outlook.live.com stopped saving sent messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using outlook.live.com for pertaining my yahoo mail (IMAP/SMTP).&nbsp; Suddenly it has stopped saving my sent e-mails.&nbsp; Although many help forums say to go to settings &gt; options &gt; writing e-mail &gt; saving sent e-mails, there are no such settings available
 in outlook.live.&nbsp; I have search all the settings thoroughly and there are absolutely no settings regarding saving sent e-mails.&nbsp; I am having this problem on multiple PCs, OSs and browsers, so this is not an issue on my end, it is an issue with the outlook
 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help in solving this.</p>

    <title>Screen lock on Samsung GT-I8000 &#40;Omnia II&#41; not accepting input - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ham2112  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen lock on Samsung GT-I8000 &#40;Omnia II&#41; not accepting input</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using my Samsung Omnia&nbsp;II mobile using WM6.5 Pro for 8 months now without problems. The phone is set to request a simple passcode (numeric) on boot and after the screen saver has started to preserve battery life.</p>
<p>I decided I wanted to change the style of the display from standated black to one of the coloured themes. This was in the control pannel display settings. It said I should reboot for the display settings to take effect, and I opted for the Yes to do so.
 The phone restarted and displayed the standard samsung screensaver in locked mode as usual.</p>
<p>I slide the button to unlock and it presents the numeric keypad to enter passcode. It will not accept my passcode. I KNOW it is correct as I have been using it at least 20 time a day for the last 8 months!</p>
<p>However, it accepts the key presses and for the 4 digit pin, but does not accept the unlock button press afterwards. The key entry times-out and it returnes to locked screensaver.</p>
<p>I have tried taking out battery and restarting several time with no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a message saying the passcode was wrong once, so I tried again, and again ....etc.</p>
<p>I cannot sync with PC as it is locked and cannot be unlocked.</p>
<p>My data is stored online in MyPhone and I use Exchange so there is minimal data loss for a hard reset. However, I am concerned about the many applications that I have purchased from Windows Marketplase and Samsung Marketplace and whether or not I can get
 them back again without having to re-purchase.</p>
<p>Is there a way of getting the phone to get past the screen saver.</p>
<p>I am annoyed by this as I only changed a display setting and now my phone can only receive incomming calls!</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problem, and how did they get around it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I managed to overcome this problem by performing a hard reset of the Samsung Omnia II device.</p>
<p>The link within this forum to a site that gives the instructions for a reset of almost every phone was extremely helpful, as the reset button inside the phone did nothing.</p>
<p>The reset did not lose any major data because the memeory in the phone is in three parts: the system ; my storage; and an optional memory card. The hard reset only clears and reinstalls the system part, so all my content and programs installed on the My
 Storage and SD Card were left intact.</p>
<p>Because I always install programs to the My Storage area on the phone, which was left intact, I am still able to see programs that I purchased from Samsung Application Store and Windows marketplace so should I need to download them again in future I still
 can.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful to others in recovering from similar problems and in deciding whether or not to do a hard reset on similar phones.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Ham</p>
<p>P.S</p>
<p>I suspect the problem&nbsp;may have been&nbsp;related to having an antivirus and firewall application running on the phone when I made the setting change. So much of the standard Windows tools are overriden on Samsung phones with there own stuff, including the screen
 saver, that yet another third party application messed up what should have been a simple&nbsp;restart.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 700 and Nokia Purity WH 920 Earphones</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've recently purchased a Pair of Nokia Purity earphones and low and behold... when I plug them into the Nokia 700... "Accessory Not Supported" comes up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this is potentially a growing trend with Nokia Belle devices. I'm absolutely shocked that I can't even use them as a standard pair of earphones with the phone without mic/volume control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried it with my Nokia E52 to see if it were the headphones, and unless I hold down on the answer button on the remote control, I don't get the full sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This reminds me of when I bought a pair of Logitech Ultimate Ears for my Nokia E7 and it worked great (even though I couldn't use the volume control on the pair) until I upgraded to Belle and then it said "Accessory Not Supported".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there's a software patch available for Belle that will allow me to use the ear phones? This is all starting to get ridiculous!</p>

<p>Take a closer look at the cable, it's probably not for size and same as the one supplied with the purity earbuds. &nbsp;I have to use it to get sound from my N9, without it I get nothing.</p>

</p><p>Perhaps this will help you.&nbsp; As Raju S Daj said, Excel cannot open and print files that are not also Excel files.&nbsp; Your sample indicates that the files involved are .pdf files even though you said they could be Excel or Acrobat files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have made is an Excel workbook that will allow you to choose a 'source' folder and a 'destination folder' and then look at a list of file names (with or without file extensions like .pdf, .xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, .doc, .docx, etc) and match those names
 up to files in the source folder and copy those that match into the destination folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a download link for my working example file (it also shows you what to expect while running it).&nbsp; Put it into any folder EXCEPT not in either the source or destination folders.&nbsp; I have provided a button on Sheet1 to begin the macro, but you can run
 it directly also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link to the working file:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/3gc10cspkefswkh/FileCopier.xlsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/download/3gc10cspkefswkh/FileCopier.xlsm</a></p>
<p>Note that it is a macro enabled workbook so you must enable macros/content when you open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is all of the code if you would like to place it into a Regular Code module in your own workbook.&nbsp; You can find the instructions for copying the code into a regular code module here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Regular" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html#Regular</a>&nbsp; Be sure to save your workbook as a "Macro enabled workbook" if you place the code into your own workbook - these are file types .xlsm and/or .xlsb in Excel 2007 and later.</p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia 635 Not Charging Because Of Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lozzer_461  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 635 Not Charging Because Of Update</h2>
                    <p>About 3 days ago my lumia 635's battery ran out. I plugged it in and it turned on as normal. Then it came up with the two gears to symbolise an update. Updates need enough &nbsp;power to complete and because I had just started charging it didn't. It powered off
 and then on again before retrying the update. Once again it failed and shut off and has been repeating this since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to solve this please reply.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are times when after updating a phone, the latest updates don't jive well with the existing settings of your device. This may lead to issues with certain aspects of the phone's software, or in your case, affecting the charging of your battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We recommend our customers to perform a reset in order to fix this. To start off, try a soft reset by pressing the Power and Volume down button for 15 seconds. After removing the hold, the phone would refresh and just wait for it to finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try to charge your phone and check if it works this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it still cannot charge well.</p>

<p>Hi, although I haven't tried this yet it is not because of an update that has happened &nbsp;- it is the update that can't be done because of my 0% charge. When I charge it, it just can't update because it doesn't have enough battery so I can't get past the two
 gears to symbolise an update.</p>

 is the image it show after attempting an update. The update is attempted automatically every time it turns on (when I plug it in to charge) so it gets stuck in a loop of 'turn on - try to update - fail - turn off - repeat'. If this is any help to solve it
 then I can video the loop if necessary.</p>

<p>It would be helpful to know which version of Project you are using. Also, is it updated with the latest Public Updates. Note, if it is a subscription version (e.g. Project Online), it is automatically updated.</p>

<p>

<p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. It's Project 2013.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you meant by "latest Public"?&nbsp; Our company orders license via SHI.&nbsp; No it's project pro on premise, not online.&nbsp; Each individual in our team has project pro client and we all connect to PWA
 in the same server.&nbsp; I have discovered that the reason why I didn't see multiple option because it was set as project attribute and not task attribute.&nbsp; For that reason I can't see the multiple options in project pro but rather PWA.&nbsp; In PWA, I was able to
 select multiple options.&nbsp; Thanks for your response.</p>

            You can use the Nokia BH108 headset, which is a mono, audio headset, for phone calls, but it won't work for music since the music app can only play through stereo bluetooth headsets that support the A2DP bluetooth profile (which mono Bluetooth headsets
 do not support). If you want to listen to music through a bluetooth headset you'll need to use a different headset that supports the A2DP profile.

<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] ok now its getting ridiculous, I tried to buy another song and this time it didn't even give me the chance to download it,&nbsp;I got a message saying "try again later, were doing maintenance" and yet it still spent my money on the song yet I cant download
 it :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] Talked to around 6 people trying to help from Microsoft, nothing helpful, don't think ill be buying from them again</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] Finally found a way to download it after some more searching, still disappointed that Microsoft themselves couldn't help me with their own website, luckily enough I was able to find it myself</p>

<p>This is why we are paying more!&nbsp; Double more!&nbsp; I have the same issue.&nbsp; I don't even know if someone called unless I actually hear the ring.&nbsp; If I miss the ring, I have to remember periodically to open skype to see if anyone called.&nbsp; Sweet.&nbsp; It's like going
 back 100 years in time.&nbsp; Ooops.. nope.. it was better then!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am disgusted.. with a service I have loved and used for years and years and years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what makes it worse is now they want me to pay 84 bucks for a service I paid $30.05 for ...and the quality of service is worse at the higher price than it was at the lower price.&nbsp; &nbsp;My phone number is good until January 2019..&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus we get music folks... who cares?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No missed call notification.&nbsp; No way to change a contact's number.&nbsp; &nbsp;UI that has decreased in intuitive use.&nbsp; No recorded message for answers.&nbsp; Customer support via chat that wastes your time because they can't write in English....&nbsp; &nbsp;AND... for this folks
 we are charging you more! Lots more... hey double more.. no more than double!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happened.. Mr. Gates take a loss on something and needs to recoup?&nbsp; &nbsp;It's not like MS is sitting on slim margins.&nbsp; &nbsp;They roll in money... which is probably the reason for the bad expensive service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's amazing to me that a service that was so excellent has become so bad -- all the way around... from price...to support... to product itself.&nbsp; They should be ashamed.</p>

<h2>            10049 Will not install Error code 0xc1900101-0x20003</h2>
                    <p>Trying to install 10049 from 10041. It gets to the black "Installing Windows 10 Technical Preview" window. Shows the installing circle of the window at 23%. Below that it shows configuring setup as being done. The next&nbsp;section is showing "79% Setting Up".
 It will stay at that point forever! I have tried this 3 times. When I kill the program it will revert back to 10041 level. Then when I go back to update it shows error&nbsp;0xc1900101-0x20003 which means nothing to me. Any ideas of what is causing this and what

<p>I had similar problems trying to update to 10049, then I tried many different methods (other people wrote about) to rectify this with no success.&nbsp; Finally I did a System Restore back to the completion of 10041 and tried the update to 10049 again and success
 at last!</p>
<p>It's been worth the nuisance of having to re-install software, but definitely solved the problem for me.</p>

            <p>Resolved! 10049 loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I disabled the items that were in task manager startup folder and then it loaded properly. The items in the folder were:</p>
<p>1. Realtek HD Audio Manager</p>
<p>2. Microsoft onedrive</p>
<p>3. Snyaptics Tourchpad 64 bit</p>
<p>4 Windows defender</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Don't know which one was actually causing the problem, but I would suspect the Realtek HD Audio Manager. After loading I re-enabled the items and the system is working properly.</p>

<h2>            Activesynch 4.5 Missing Information</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have htc hd2 connected via usb to xp sp3 outlook 2007 and activesynch 4.5 &nbsp;I synch up directly with the PC rather than the exchange server. Activesynch says for instance 335 contacts it synch up acording to activesynch without any error but when I try and
 find specific contacts on the htc they are missing. I cant see outlook mail (although the mailbox folder structure is ok) I can send email from the device ok. The Calendar has some entries but not others.<br />
I exported the contacts to a pst file then imported them on anothe pc all of the contacts are their. I used activesynch on that pc and all of the contacts appeared on the HTC ok. I have deleted the connections on both sides unchecked the fast sysnch option
 reset the device numerous times unintaleed &amp; reinstalled activesynch a few times.<br />
Any ideas how to proceeed?<br />

            I could synch the same user on a different PC no problem, tried the repair without success, I created a new outlook profile, same problem, I created a new windows profile same problem, Finally resolved the problem by clearing down some emails from the
 PC very strange.<br />

<h2>            Get AutoMapping Status&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Many of you guys will know the AutoMapping feature while setting Mailbox permissions, but i just can't a way to get the current status of AutoMapping on mailboxes. Is there any way or place where you can find what the AutoMapping status is for a mailbox
 permission entry?</p>

<p>Hi Eric,<br />
<br />
Based on my research, there are no direct options or PowerShell commands to get the automapping status of mailboxes in Office 365. I understand that it will be more convenient if the status of automapping can be checked, given the situation, you can submit
 feedback via the link below regarding this feature.<br />

Our engineers will design or upgrade features referring to customers’ feedback. Your understanding will be appreciated.<br />

    <title>Multiple Domains-Single Forest in o365 sync&#39;d with Azure AD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhmstech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Domains-Single Forest in o365 sync&#39;d with Azure AD Connect in a single o365 Account</h2>
                    Is this something that is possible? Currently have one forest, two domains. Domain 1 is sync'd with AAD into regular o365. Domain 2 we'll be migrating those users from GoDaddy o365 to regular o365. Can we migrate the GoDaddy office 365/Domain 2 users into
 the same o365 that Domain 1 users are in and sync them both with AAD? Now, they both have two different FQDNs for their emails so they would have to be separate in o365. What would be the best course of action here? Not asking about how to migrate from GoDaddy.
 This is more about "How do we make it so both domains can sync to AAD and have regular MS o365 working?" We'd prefer to have one o365 account with multiple email domains, if we can.

            <p><span>Hi Jhmstech,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I understand that you have only one forest but with two domains, <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772007%28v=ws.11%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
one of which is added as a User Principal Name Suffix</a>. You have two tenants connected with the local forest. Based on
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-topologies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Azure AD Connect Topologies</a>, two Azure AD Connect server must be deployed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your scenario, yes, it’s possible. </p>
<p>1. Configure the Azure AD Connect settings with the GoDaddy tenant so that all users are moved out of the tenant.
</p>
<p>2. Remove the domain from the GoDaddy tenant. </p>
<p>3. Verify the domain mentioned in #2 in the normal Office 365 tenant.</p>
<p>4. Configure the Azure AD Connect with the normal Office 365 tenant to sync the users to the online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: in this way, only the user object information are synced from the GoDadddy tenant to the normal Office 365 tenant. So before the #1, you need to manually back up all the users’ data (emails, calendar items) and then import these data to the new tenant.
</p>
<p>Cross tenant migration is not supported. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>
