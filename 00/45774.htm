<h2>            Can&#39;t Adjust Brightness Setting on Windows 10 Fall Creator Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Home Single Language on ASUS UX410UQ. I recently updated to Windows 10 Fall Creator Update. The update was great bringing some new features. But I have an issue after I updated my OS. I can't adjust bright setting from keyboard function
 key shortcut. And I don't find any bright setting on Settings and/or Power Options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked up for solutions on webs and tried some of their answer like updated my display drivers but none of them seems working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone here have working solutions for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Hardiansyah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incompatibility or Outdated drivers are possible reasons why you were unable to use the keyboard function key shortcut on your laptop to adjust the brightness setting after installing Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An initial step in resolving your concern is making sure that the drivers for your laptop are up to date. We highly recommend visiting your laptop's portal or contacting their support team for assistance in getting the latest drivers for your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime. </p>
<p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many 'fixes' that don't work around the web...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through this situation twice now - each after major win 1- forced updates... :/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time it's been the same fix - not out-dated hardware drivers... but windows forcing the wrong monitor driver...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to device manager (Win+X, select Device MAnager), then go to your monitors, and right click on the monitor. Update the driver, select 'browse my computer for driver software', then select 'let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer',
 and select 'Generic PNP Monitor' - NOT PnP Monitor (standard)'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to update your graphics drivers, but I have found that the common thread is actually the monitor drivers. I had to change it a couple of times after a reboot, but now I have full control of my brightness settings and function keys again...
 Hooray! No more sore eyes after 4 hours with it glaring into my face while trying to fix it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft - please explain why this happens every time a major 'service pack' or upgrade is installed?? It never happened with Windows 7, so why now? It sucks!</p>

            Thank you so much! This is the only solution that worked for me. And this isn't the first time this has happened either. Thank you!

                    <p>I am a hardcore misanthrope and would love a way to get rid of the community page altogether. I also don't like it when you make me automatically follow a game just because I download it. It should ask me to follow or give me a preference to disable it being automatic. I would also like the friend suggestions to stop because no suggestion you ever give me will ever be close to right. I don't care about what's trending or being in a club. So the whole page is just a nuisance for me. Please give me a way to remove it in a future update.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For the benefit of our younger readers, a "misanthrope" is a person who dislikes and avoids other people.&nbsp;Everybody's different, and I too value my own company, but if there's something to be said re your topic, it might&nbsp;simply be - DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;LOOK&nbsp;AT&nbsp;THE&nbsp;COMMUNITY&nbsp;PAGE. It's not like anybody's twisting your arm to go there, and&nbsp;outside of searching for content (community or otherwise), I pretty much never stray from the homepage&nbsp;myself.&nbsp;So why deny others the freedom to choose what's important to them? No need to be a "miserablist" about it. 🙂 </p>

    <title>Surface Book Pen won&#39;t open Onenote 2016 and clip to Onenote 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jh_886  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Pen won&#39;t open Onenote 2016 and clip to Onenote 2016 in particular</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book pen somehow neither want to open Onenote 2016 nor send a screenshot to it. I did set it to open Onenote 2016 on "click once" in the&nbsp;"pen settings" &nbsp;and screenshot on double-click. Neither works. This is an issue related to starting Onenote
 2016 in particular since the buttons work for any other setting, be it Onenote, universal apps or whatever. I guess there is some broken link here but I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your help!</p>

            <p>I was having the same issue and found a solution that worked for me. I'm not sure from your description whether you have adjusted these settings or not...</p>
<p>Open the surface app and on the page where you adjust the pen sensitivity there's a link for more setting at the top. Open this and change the settings for what the button does when you press it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

    <title>ICMP Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mayhemgard  say:</h3>
<h2>            ICMP Error</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I just had a few questions/concerns with my xbox live connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I play UFC 3 pretty frequently and for the past two days I have been having some connection issues, during games I would lag and a message saying "waiting for synchronization" would appear and then some seconds later I would disconnect.&nbsp; I would then go
 to dashboard to try and resolve the problem but as I would load the game up again I would get disconnected from xbox live.</p>
<p>So I decided to go and test my connect when I got an ICMP error message, I restarted my modem and then things worked for a couple minutes again (except the game was still laggy and I still had disconnection problems).&nbsp; I then went and tested my network configuration
 again and it said that I have internet connection but problems connecting to xbox live.&nbsp; I then restarted my console and tested my connection again where I got the second ICMP error message.&nbsp; I then switched my connection over from wireless to wired where
 the connection problems persisted.&nbsp; Upon testing my configuration with the wired network I received yet another ICMP error message.&nbsp; Also I tested my configuration multiple times in a row, sometimes it would say it was working and other times I would get the
 ICMP error message.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayhemgard</p>

<p>Ok, I'm not too savvy with which is which, so I think the router is NetgearWNR200 and the modem is Ubee (model # U10C035.25). &nbsp;There is an orange light on the Ubee where it says DS. &nbsp;I've reset it a couple times and the orange light is still there.</p>

            <p>Its a modem, it doesn't need more Ethernet ports. Only one.<br /><br />Ok, try connect as follows! Power off your modem for 2 minutes. Power it back on and wait one minute for it to connect properly. Connect the Xbox and turn it on. Go to Xbox network settings and restore you factory defaults. Press "B" on your controller and run a connection test to Xbox LIVE (Test Xbox LIVE Connection).</p>

<p>Ok, so I did everything you said to the best of my ability. &nbsp;There seemed to have been a few problems, I couldn't find where it said "restore to factory defaults". &nbsp;Although after I rebooted everything the connection seemed fine (I didn't test it by playing
 any video games). &nbsp;I came back on the computer to notify you, and to do so I had to unplug the Ethernet cable connected to my xbox from the modem and plug the other Ethernet cable which connects to my router so I could get internet access on my computer. &nbsp;I
 had to troubleshoot a couple times because a DNS error kept popping up. &nbsp;There is still an orange light over the DS section of the modem, while all the other lights are green. &nbsp;I don't know If this solved anything, but when I ran the test for network configuration
 there was no problems. &nbsp;Although like I said before, it seemed the test would prove inconclusive every other time, while still finding an ICMP or DNS error every other time I tested it. &nbsp;This is getting frustrating!

                    Hi, One day when i shut down my computer and turn it on the other day. My AVG license not found. and theres some error with skype.exe Thereafter i was not able to uninstall any prog or do a system restore or turn on my internet explorer or windows media
 player. Im currently using Windows 7. Note: i did not install or download any other program prior to this issue. I believe this is a virus infection or infestation. However i tried running spybot. could not detect anything. AVG uninstallation or installation
 obviously could not work. Tried running other anti virus or malware such as MLAM and superantispyware or a similar prog with this name i can't really remember much. All could not run, or install to begin with. Tried to run computer in safe mode. Tap F8 when
 booting. Nothing happened. Tried system restore, could not be done. Tried sfc /scannow could not also it says smth like unable repair service. I really really need to get my computer back up again. This is a pain in the ****. Shou

            <p>I am having the same issue, however, it seems to be the entire hard drive (both c: and d:). I have tried permissions, the attrib command, etc. Nothing seems to work. I have even tried reverting back to a previous state to see if that might do something.
 Nothing works. I do not have One Drive running, which seems to be one theory. </p>
<p>It is not just Office files. Which was another theory. </p>
<p>It is all the files and folders. </p>

<p>I first saw store errors&nbsp; Fri night. Since then&nbsp; the Windows 8.1 forum has been flooded with users having the same problem, error 0x c03f300d and others.

</p><p>&nbsp; No one here, moderators, acknowledges the problem even exists. Look at all the other users with similar problems.</p>

<h2>            How can I keep private,, video, photo, and other files protected .</h2>
                    <p>I checked out all the apps . pertaining to protect photo&nbsp; video, and other sensitive files in a safe enviorment. The hysteria starting mavbe a purge of protected content on my computer<em>.&lt;non relevant content removed&gt;
</em>but right now I need a&nbsp; logical ,economical plan to move them to a secure safe enviorment.&nbsp; I checked out the apps on my market concerning an app that locks them down. but they look cheap and I don't want to get in a extorsion position after the fact.
 they will have access to the files. and 100% they will want storage charges on an existing plan. I am not liking that plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; where do they actual files stay. in a Cloud ?&nbsp; I like that idea less.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Encryption is a way to prevent unauthorized access or probably the best way to keep your files safe. The fastest way to encrypt your files and folders in
<strong>Windows 10 Home</strong> is to use the built in encryption tool, called <strong>
Encrypted File Service</strong> (<strong>EFS</strong>). If you are using <strong>
Windows 10 Pro</strong>, what you can use to protect your files is the <strong>BitLocker</strong>. It is&nbsp;<span>a full disk encryption feature included with Windows Vista and later. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire
 volumes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To encrypt your files and folders on your <strong>Windows 10 Home</strong>, you may follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the file/folder you want to encrypt and go to <em><strong>Properties</strong></em>.</li><li>On the General tab, click the <em><strong>Advanced</strong></em> button.</li><li>Under <em><strong>Compress and encrypt attributes</strong></em> section, click on
<em><strong>Encrypt content to secure data</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and close <strong>Properties</strong> window.</li><li>Apply changes to the folder, sub-folders and files when prompted.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

<h2>            Skype notification pop ups appearing on top right of my screen</h2>
                    As the title says, Skype message notifications are popping up at the top right of my screen. I cannot figure out how to get it to pop up on the bottom right of my screen like it used to, is it possible? I am on Skype 8.13.0.3 for what that's worth.&nbsp;

<h2>            Thrustmaster 458 TX wheel not working anymore after update</h2>
                    
<p>Today i got a update, i believe about 45MB, when the prompt came to update i noticed my Trustmaster wheel wasnt responding (Xbox home button didnt lit up). Used a controller to update, but after getting back on the homescreen, it still doesnt respond.</p>
<p>Unplugged USB and back in, powersupply, just a little 'twitch' on the wheel was all it gave. However, popping it in my PC and it works 100% so i know it aint a faulty wheel or whatsoever.</p>
<p>There is no new firmware on the TM website, rebooting my Xbox One a few times (both 10sec hold and normal) wont bring back any respond from my wheel. Did the update had something changed with the USB ports or something?</p>

<h2>            Windows Experience Index - Caused a blue screen of death</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>just go a new graphics card, RADEON hd 7850, vtx3d, so I decided to run the windows experience index.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that this utility gave you some sort of graphics pictures when it ran the test. All I saw was a flickering screen as it ran several tests, and then at the end I got a blue screen of death with the following information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code messages from the BSOD were - </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The bugcheck was: 0x00000116 (0xfffffa800c3d4010, 0xfffff88004d4e410, 0x0000000000000000, 0x000000000000000d)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know what this might be?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I would say it's definitely a hardware problem with the graphic adapter.&nbsp; Make sure that you have the latest proper drivers for the card.<br />
<br />
Does your computer meet the minimum system requirement to support the card?&nbsp; Is your PSU adequate for the power consumption of the card?<br />

<h2>            Refund for my skype account</h2>
                    I have never in my life experienced such difficulty finding information that I needed on a web site to answer my questions and resolve my issues. There is essentially NO customer service and dead end links. I erroneously signed up for things I didn't want
 and didn't need and don't seem to work! However, when I attempt to use the worthless "Virtual Agent" I am merely pointed to another dead end! If anyone out there knows how I might know how I can receive a refund for the subscription I didn't want and credits
 that I will never use I would surly appreciate the help! I am truly disgusted that a&nbsp;company like Microsoft would&nbsp;be responsible for&nbsp;ridiculous "smoke and mirror" tactics! &nbsp;

            System Mechanic Pro, and all such programs, <span><span>are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and
 what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.</span></span><br />
<span>

<br />
<span>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from the market almost immediately.
 Many people have used a registry cleaner and never had a problem with it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it the substantial *risk* of having a problem. And since there is no benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad bargain.</span></p>

<p>That woudn't help, even if it were possible.&nbsp; Download the Media Creation Tool and use it to create Windows 10 installation on a flash drive or DVD, then use that to attempt to repair your installation.&nbsp; What was broken that made you decide to try to "repair
 everything"?<br />

I had to reload the latest version of Windows 10. &nbsp;That fixed the problem.

<h2>            How do I turn off passwords when switching users on windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I sign out of my user account on windows 8.1 it asks me for a password if I want to get back in again. How do I get rid of this password prompt, so that I can just click which user I wish to use and sign in automatically without having to enter
 a password. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

            I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; When I start my computer it logs me right in but if I try to switch between my wife and my account it ask for the password on my PC and Surface RT.&nbsp; The netplwiz only works for when you boot up your computer.&nbsp; My wife doesn't
 like switching to her account because she has to enter that every time, and I find it annoying when I switch back as well.&nbsp; I can put up with it, but she is annoyed with tech and likes to keep it simple.&nbsp; So while I use the mail app and People hub she goes
 to the actual sites.&nbsp; Problem is that if I need an email fast I have to go to yahoo and since she uses it all the time, there she is logged in under my windows account, adding to the annoyance.

<p><span>Hi lbdeedee,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you receive any error messages when you try to install updates for QuickBooks?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: How to perform a disk cleanup?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Choose the option to cleanup system files also.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista
 or on Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Once you perform disk cleanup, you can try running system file checker. It should work.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Disable your anti-virus software</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can also try disabling your anti-virus software and then try to run system file checker to see if the operation gets completed.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You need to re-enable your anti-virus software once the system file checker is completed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After performing system file checker, you can try to install updates for QuickBooks. If you still have issues, then follow further steps from the
 link below.</span></p>

<h3> awlsomealex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Domains Conflicting &#40;Controller and Remote&#41;</h2>
                    Hello, whenever I try to run two domains (separate forests) in one household/router one of them (The Remote) will always fail to connect. What happens is I created a Domain Controller running Windows Server 2012 R2 with the domain of (blank).local and
 had it wired to the router (Apple Airport Extreme) but when someone else tries to connect to their work domain (blank).com&nbsp;via Remote Connect or other services, they can never be able to connect or get an error about timing out. The only solution is to shutdown
 the domain controller and to reset the router (Otherwise no one has network connection) Anyone know why this is happening?

<h3> annacurtis  say:</h3>
<h2>            My apps in the windows 8 store will not update, they are stuck on pending</h2>
                    I have 13 apps ready for updates in the windows 8 app store, but they are constantly stuck on pending. I have tried the following three methods to rectify the problem but they have not worked:
<div><br />
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong>&nbsp;Run the App troubleshooter for the Windows Store issue.<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></p>
<p>Click on the link above to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;Reset the Store Cache.<br />
a) Press "Windows key + R".<br />

<p>I should also note that this is a brand new Surface Pro, and the 15 apps that are stuck on "pending" are the preinstalled ones included in the box (e.g., Travel, Camera, Reader, etc.).</p>

            Same here. I even posted in another thread but no one has posted there in last 3 days and I cannot sign in to apps as it tells me to update the app before I can sign in. here is the link to my post:

 7 updates but after restarting the computer for completing the update for Windows (via Windows Update) all the apps are struck to pending again. Also I've noted that instead of telling "Installing Apps" "Installs" is written in the top of the Windows Store.

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick update. The third party firewalls from the anti-virus are sometimes unblocked and may be a prominent cause of the error.</p>
<p>So, if you have can reinstall your favorite anti-virus again, I would recommend you completely uninstalling the anti-virus from by downloading and installing its removal tool&nbsp;from the corresponding anti-virus' website and then, check if you are able to restore
 your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall&nbsp;your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists even after uninstalling the anti-virus, please reinstall it to reinstate the security of the system.</span></p>

<p><br />
Windows 8 is not production (finished; released as a final product, etc.) yet.</p>
<p>As far as Windows 7 is concerned, you should manually (do not rely on any software, including any put out by Microsoft) check that your current hardware and software installed are compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; you would do this by making a list (model of computer,
 each software package you have installed, hardware you attach to the computer like printers, scanners, cameras, etc.) and checking the manufacturer's web page to see if they support that product at that version level in Windows 7.&nbsp; Chances are on your side,
 given it is a Vista machine.</p>
<p>youd</p>
<p>'d then purchase a version of Windows 7 you could use to upgrade whatever specific edition of Vista you have and upgrade.&nbsp; That is fairly straight forward at first, just insert the DVD and follow directions.&nbsp; Then you have to download and install any newer
 hardware drivers for each hardware component (much you can go to HP for via your model computer's support web page, but your peripherals will be elsewhere...)</p>

<h2>            family safety windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of years back, I set up family safety on my daughter's Win 7 laptop.&nbsp; She's now 17 and a senior in high school.&nbsp; Time to lift restrictions.&nbsp; They are interfering with her school work.&nbsp; I've had a couple of Microsoft accounts over the years.&nbsp; I think
 I probably set up the family safety on her machine using an older account.&nbsp; When I try to log into family safety on her laptop, it already has my most current login name and won't allow me to enter the older one (and password).&nbsp; When I enter my newest credentials,
 it says the following:&nbsp; "The action can't be completed because the parent is no longer a part of the Family Safety family."&nbsp; How can I get into the family safety software on her machine, turn it off, and uninstall.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Skype Keeps Logging out &#38; Doing weird Things&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Keeps Logging out &#38; Doing weird Things&#33; &#40;Windows&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My Skype has been doing weird things for a few months now. I have windows 8, and this problem happens to me all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I could be using skype and it would randomly just log out. When I log back in, All of my contacts are deleted, my skype name is changed to my original username, and my skype photo is removed. The Weird thing is, My Skype contacts are only removed
 from MY End. My friends can still see my profile picture, and still have me added, but on my end that's not the case. Everyone is deleted and I have to add everyone back again. Note that When I re-add these deleted contacts, it doesn't actually send them a
 friend request, it just waits 10 seconds and adds them as if they never got deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know what's wrong with it. It does this every 1-2 days. When I log on through my ipad, everything is fine. My contacts are there, and everything is normal. First I thought it was a firewall problem, but it's not. Then I thought - Maybe it's because
 I'm logged in via 2 devices (PC and Ipad). Could this be the problem? I have an Ipad 2, and I have the newest version of skype on my PC.</p>
<p>

<p>You will see two "Default programs" ; use either, though the second (bearing the settings icon) is idiot proof.</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<p>Click on Windows icon bottom left in tool bar&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select All apps</p>
<p>Scroll down and Click on "Windows System" drop down menu</p>
<p>Click on "Default Programs" with the settings icon</p>
<p>Change default program for photo viewer from TWINUI to Windows Photo Viewer or alternative</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this fails try my other reply which I found to work since windows would not let me change the default photo viewer via this method.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The most likely reason why this error has occurred is because Windows changed the default photo viewer to TWINUI, because it supposedly works better with PNG images. If you cannot change the default photo viewer back to Windows Photo Viewer from the All
 Apps menu, then try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open File Explorer</p>
<p>Go into the Pictures Folder&nbsp;</p>
<p>RIght Click a .png image file</p>
<p>Select Open With&gt;</p>
<p>Click on "Choose another app"</p>
<p>Select Windows Photo Viewer</p>
<p>Check the box "Always use this app to open .png files"</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try clicking on other files. If the same error is occurring for other file types repeat the same method by clicking on a file of that type, such as JPEG or for video files. This error may occur with video files as well because TWINUI has replaced other
 default programs. You will see which default programs it has replaced by accessing Windows System Default Programs (settings icon) from the All Apps menu under the windows icon on the tool bar.</p>

            <p>Right click on the file or picture file, or video file and then click on Properties, then under the General tab about the second line down you should see “Opens with:” and to the right of that is the change button, click on that and change from “Twinui”
 to “Window Photo Viewer” or some other photo viewer. Do the same thing for video files, but change to something like “Windows Media Player” instead of “Twinui” or your preferred video player. This worked for me!</p>

            The problem I'm having is that Photo is the default on my system and I'm still getting the error. &nbsp;I've tried all of the steps here and nothing seems to work for me. &nbsp;Photo worked fine 2 days ago. &nbsp;Nothing on the system's changed (that I'm aware of). &nbsp;No

<p>It's the Photos app that's causing the error when starting. Reinstalling it solves the problem for most users. Check out&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This also did not work. &nbsp;The first process resulted in the following (SnipIt file)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c4ed458-ec4b-491d-8a3f-779f792a5aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c4ed458-ec4b-491d-8a3f-779f792a5aa7" /></a></p>
<p>The second process was a 2 step one. &nbsp;The first PackageFullName was not what you have in the blog. &nbsp;I changed the name to what the result was from my computer and entered that instead. &nbsp;Same result. &nbsp;Next SnipIt file...</p>
