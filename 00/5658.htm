    <title>When I paste from a document that has Arial in an existing word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danicafersovitch  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I paste from a document that has Arial in an existing word document that also has Arial the font and its size is often different. Help&#33;</h2>
                    So I go to copy and paste something from one document to another both Arial and the font is pasted in times new roman in a different size as well. These are on existing document precedents that have been in use for a long time (does this make a difference?)
 Precedents: documents with fields in them that I fill in. It doesn't help me to set the default font either.&nbsp;

            If you paste text in plain text format, it will assume the formatting at the insertion point.
<br />
<br />
But you haven't explained which kind of fields is being used. Is the document (target or source) protected in some way?

            Hi Stefan,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply, I don't believe the documents are protected in any way. I am able to make changes and save those changes no problem in both target and source document. The documents are simply precedents that we've created at our business to make
 writing letters and completing documents much quicker. The idea, fill in the name, tab or F11, next field, fill in their address etc. Does this help?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pasting the text in text format doesn't seem to make a difference. The documents have been compiled from a combination of different documents, so a lot of cutting and pasting has occurred in the precedent document's past, will this change things? Is there
 anything else you can think of that could be the problem?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            <p>OK, since you can move between fields with F11, most likely the document or template was designed with MACROBUTTON fields. These are (usually) used without document protection.<br />
<br />
How exactly did you paste in plain text format? What were the steps?</p>

            I think that there has been a misunderstanding somewhere here. It sounds like the product key Microsoft is asking for is for Office "&nbsp;<em>I want use add and delete or modify excel document then It shows enter product key on packaging</em>"? And it seems
 that Office came preinstalled on the laptop, indicating that it was a trial version.&nbsp; Maybe AN can clarify?

<p>Let us see the difference between a Mac with it's limited hardware, and oh yeah, then there is Windows that must run on thousands and thousands of different configurations that are out there. Not only covering the latest but also systems that predate quite
 a few years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you understand what MS is up against here. Mac only has a few configurations to write code for. You cannot compare apples to oranges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It ultimately boils down to choice, we could also throw in Android and Linux. Been a Windows user since 3.0. Have a great weekend.</p>

<p>Pardon the numbers I mention here, I may be way off but anyways:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Microsoft updates a code base of over half a million lines of code in Win 10 alone. Considering they also support older consumer versions and server versions and Xbox versions and
 phone versions and IOT (Internet OF Things) devices such as ATMs (I understand Windows runs on 95% of North American banks ATM machines, about 1/2 million or so), in dozens of languages, that probably runs easily north of 5 million lines of code. I may be
 a million or so off here, but you get the idea.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now also consider this....</span></span><span><span>This code has to accommodate running on 1-2 &nbsp;billion devices globally that are anywhere
 from one day old to 10 years old or more, produced by dozens upon dozens of vendors or home hobbyists, that may have been heavily customized by thousand of other vendors hardware and software, and modified an uncountable number of user homegrown hacks and
 business jacks on the directory and OS itself. Microsoft now pushes out 2 major upgrades and 12 OS updates every year (not counting the one-off emergency fixes for day zero type of hacking), to deliver functionality that users like us all ask for, to support
 industry standards</span></span><span>, to play with other vendors products or with its own other dozens of products and services,
</span><span>or just to be competitive in the marketplace</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>This is what the engineers have to deal with.
</span><span><span>Can you imagine the complexity of such an operation? Nothing I can think of compares.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But if you feel that the constant advancements of one solution is frustrating and another solution changes less
 and thus works better for you then go with what works for you.&nbsp; That is the beauty of the marketplace. You have options. For my part I have been in there since the DOS days, and have no intention of jumping to another ship......</span></span></p>

<p>Hey Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With me it's personal. Despise Apple and this goes back to the early iPod days, spent 500 on one with 60Gig drive in it, remember those with the big dial on front. It died 1 week after warranty expired, sent it back, cost me over 350 for replacement, so
 asked for black one instead of the white. They sent me a white one anyhow. That, and their limited software choices always annoyed me. Proprietary nonsense for me anyhow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Macs were cool, and cost more. Granted. I have been a diligent user of windows all through school &amp; college..but with the newer editions, especially after Win 7, I've been seeing a significant drop in productivity.Lost my unsaved work numerous times due
 to windows freezing up on me abruptly. Cursor placement and selection is super inconsistent. Taskbar search often freezes up. Online forums suggest opening task manager and end task for Cortana application. This post sounds like a rant because it is a result
 of frustration with using a software product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have spent a high dollar amount on a Macbook, and have had a seamless experience like none other. Trust me, I am NOT the typical Apple Fanboy..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Used this forum so someone listens..&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are free to disagree - that's your opinion. I am hoping someone resonates with what I am going through and is able to give answers.</p>

<p>Wish I could my friend, there are times I get frustrated with the way Windows works sometimes but overall, I am generally pleased with the product. At this point in time, just would not be worthwhile for me to change OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess you could say one gets trapped in an environment, more so with the smart phones these days. Too costly to ever switch unless one wants to re-purchase programs that one has already.</p>

            Sorry to hear of your issues. Issues such as you describe are not necessarily OS upgrade problems, but they also occur because of the hardware you run it on, how many modifications over time have been made to ,OS, H/W, and S/W (apps) etc. as I described
 above. Sometimes you just have to spend some time to know your system, not just use it. You did what you felt you needed to do. And for what you needed to do, the Mac may do. Welcome to the Apple Zone....Wish you luck....

<h3> steve_mes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recipient cannot open my pdf attachments</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen similar posts on here, but nothing I can relate exactly to at the moment, my problem is thus:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp;my colleague&nbsp;sends a pdf document (made using CutePDF) and sent using outlook (office pro2010, on windows 8.1) the recipient cannot open the attachment with the message "There was an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be
 repaired".&nbsp; This appears to be happening with all recipients no matter which program/webmail they are using to open it.&nbsp; When composing the email and once pdf has been selected, double-clicking the file opens it up perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears to be specifically on this PC as I can take the same pdf document from the server and send from another PC so I assume that the problem is here with the sending and not with the manufacture of the pdf itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using ZoneAlarm Extreme security, I have seen people suggesting to try sending while outlook is in Safe-mode, this makes no difference - I am assuming this is a problem with outlook, possibly during compression prior to sending???
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no computer expert - I can learn to use the programs but anything more technical is beyond me so keep any suggestions simple please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help/advice you may be able to give</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I had this problem and it is very simple to solve!</p>
<p>When you save the file name put .pdf at the end so-</p>
<p>myscan.pdf</p>
<p>this will help the computer associate adobe reader to the file.</p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>
<p>PS having no file association may also cause the anti-virus to have a fit too...</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 cannot open large file saved by Word 2010</h2>
                    I have a large thesis (~500 pages) that can be opened and saved fine within Word 2010. However, I cannot open it with Word 2013. I get the following error:<br />
<br />
We're sorry. We can't open thesis.docx because we found a problem with its contents.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
Operation aborted: max-element-depth constraint violated.<br />
Location: Part: /word/webSettings.xml, Line: 2, Column: 53870<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
A subsequent dialog box does allow me to recover the file. However, a further Show Repairs dialog has a single "Summary Info 1" item that does not provide extra information. Moreover, even after saving again, errors are continuously being found in the document
 every time it is opened. There is no permanent way to resolve these errors.<br />

            Yes. After recovery, I do save it with a new file name. When I try to open the new file, it gives the same error.<br />
<br />
By renaming thesis.docx to thesis.docx.zip I could extract the webSettings.xml file. Its contents do look highly suspicious (although balanced) in terms of how deeply the nesting structure is. I don't know how to attach any files here (copying the contents
 removes all whitespace), so I have sent you this file via email.<br />

<h2>            Lost Aero Snap, Alt&#43;F4 to Close Modern Apps and Modern Skype with 9860 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a thoroughly successful and usable initial release of the Technical Preview, I updated to 9860 last night and now have lost the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Aero Snap. I can no longer grab windows (legacy or modern) and drag to snap. Snapping via WinKey+Arrow *sometimes* works, but right now is not</p>
<p>2) Closing Modern Apps with Alt+F4. I can no longer close modern apps with Alt+F4</p>
<p>3) Modern App Title Bars are all black now</p>
<p>4) Modern Skype cannot sign in - it just says "ooops there was a problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a few posts in the Feedback app saying some of the issues above. For me, everything was fine on the previous build. I clean installed the TP, then of course did an in place upgrade to 9860.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            My system is the same. 9860 Snap Off will not turn on. I work with it off.&nbsp; The system is flaky. Things work then they don't. Last boot I had two boot logos. They were both the same. A good thing I presume as there is only one user.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you Ronnie, I guess the black title bars is a UI regression as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have just seen the news about Modern Skype at:</p>

<p>
</p><p>So that solves that issue. The other issues with Aero Snap for all&nbsp;windows and Alt+F4 in modern apps remain. Thank you!</p>

    <title>How do I submit a bug report for Outlook 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyson_l  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I submit a bug report for Outlook 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've discovered a way to consistently crash Outlook 2016. &nbsp;Someone sent me multiple calendar invites (more than 20) for the next few months. &nbsp;(School holidays, etc.) &nbsp;It was sent to two separate account, in two different domains. &nbsp;I tested this on three
 separate machines, all running Outlook 2016 on Windows 10. &nbsp;One of the mailboxes is on-prem (Exchange 2013), the other is hosted in Office 365. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the list of calendar invites showing in my Inbox, I started accepting them (and sending responses). &nbsp;After as few as three, or as many as six acceptances, Outlook will crash. &nbsp;I'm accepting them fairly quickly, but it is very repeatable on each machine.
 &nbsp; If I wait a second between accepting each one, there is no issue. &nbsp;If I accept as fast as Outlook will allow, it will crash. &nbsp;Every time, after two or three acceptances (more if I'm not clicking as quickly.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not expecting a solution for this (beyond slowing down), I'd like to submit it as a bug. &nbsp;Any advice?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; For future reference, how do I narrow it down to the *<strong>most appropriate</strong>* forum?&nbsp; I have one mailbox in Office 365, and one in Exchange 2013.&nbsp; All three clients are running Office 2016 on Windows 10.&nbsp; It does not
 appear to be related to the email domain or server version, it seems to be specific to the client application (Outlook 2016).&nbsp; Thus I posted in this forum.&nbsp; (I was looking for a forum specific to just Outlook, and the menu required that I pick a client OS
 as well.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I'm not looking for a solution to the problem (I believe it to be a bug in the application), I'm looking for advise&nbsp;on how to report that to the product group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t the live tile of the Microsoft Weather app update on my Start screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I really love the simple Weather app on my Lumia 822 running WP8. I keep it pinned to my Start screen, but I noticed its live tile doesn't consistently update with current conditions until I open the app, which kind of defeats the point of having a live
 tile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, right now it shows 70° and a moon icon, even though it's 9 AM. When I tap the tile and launch the app, it shows current conditions as sunny, clear, and 66°. When I return to the Start screen, the live tile now shows updated conditions. And
 those will remain, until the next time I launch the app. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've even noticed that when I change my phone's theme color, the Weather live tile keeps the former color...until I launch the app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug, or just a app or system setting I need to change? I really want to like this app. Please help!</p>

<h2>            rename OneDrive folder</h2>
                    <p>I have Office 365 Business Essentials, and the synced OneDrive folder is named "OneDrive - My Rather Long Business Name Ltd". This makes absolutely no sense to me, and to prevent me from changeing rather easily it is even more confusing.</p>
<p>Suppoedely there are a fix, a thread to annother thread to annother thread (...) pointed to a solution, but I didn't find it in the end (or maybe I didn't understand that I found it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is it possible to change it and could someone in that case please describe the proecedure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<span>It isn’t feasible to change the tenant name from the OneDrive synced folder. The</span>

<h2>            Apple mail cannot see or use public contact folders</h2>
                    We have a small office with office 365, mixed macs and PC. Mac users use Apple mail, but could switch to outlook. But we need to have a shared, dynamic contact list. first, import several thousand contacts for use by all, and then, assure that anytime
 any user adds or updates a contact, it is visible to everyone. Yet allow folks to keep private contacts private.

<p>hi leiblurie4586,<br />
<br />
i understand that you want to create a shared contact list which could be access and manage by users. you can follow the steps below to create such a shared public contact list and access it in outlook for windows and mac clients. however, it is not feasible
 to achieve your requirement in the default mail app on mac.<br />
1. create a public folder mailbox in office 365 eac (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>) with an admin account.</p>
<p>2. create a public folder in office 365 eac.</p>
<p>3. create a contact public folder in outlook for windows. please refer to this thread:<br />
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/415975<br />
it’s not feasible to use the same step to achieve that in outlook for mac. once the contact list is created, every normal users in the organization can create a contact in the contact list. you can use the following steps to access the contact list in outlook
 for mac.</p>
<p>4. then in owa &gt; mail &gt; favorites &gt; right &gt; add public folder to favorites &gt; choose the contact you created &gt; add to favorites.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3a98518c-3593-4991-9386-b7217c6da1a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3a98518c-3593-4991-9386-b7217c6da1a9" /></a></p>
<p>after that, the contact list will show up under people &gt; other contacts and you can create contact lists in it.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9c8a0ebd-57a5-408f-a89a-9396575c3aef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9c8a0ebd-57a5-408f-a89a-9396575c3aef" /></a><br />
5. in outlook for mac &gt; tool &gt; public folder, you need to subscribe to the contact public folder.
<br />
<br />
moreover, the shared&nbsp;public contact list&nbsp;can be accessed by everyone&nbsp;who has the&nbsp;permission. and the private contacts of each users will be kept private and will not be affected by the shared contact list.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<h2>            My PowerPoint doesn&#39;t open when I try opening it again on my USB after I have saved it</h2>
                    I saved my powerpoint i created on my laptop to my USB and when I tried to open it from the USB on to another computer, It said 'powerpoint has found a problem in this file, click repair' and when i click repair it says sorry powerpoint cannot read the
 presentation. I came back and tried re opening it on the laptop i created it in from the USB drive and it gave the same message. I'mnot sure how to sort this as the USB doesnt have any viruses so I'm not sure what the problem is. Its difficult because i have
 to give my assignment in and if it doesnt open i will fail. word documents and everything else opens from the USB but not powerpoint, please help. I have powerpoint 2013.

            Saving to, or editing while on, a USB drive is the easiest way to corrupt Office documents, though it happens more often with Word than PowerPoint. It's very unlikely your file can be retrieved, but if you can upload it to Dropbox or other cloud storage,
 then post a Share link here, I'll see if I can repair it or at least recover the text.

<h2>            On all my Office 365 apps none of the title bar or scrol bar icons show up.</h2>
                    <p>See the picture below.&nbsp; (The white box is just where I blanked out my name).&nbsp; Notice that in the upper left hand corner there are none of the standard windows icons that have been there since Windows 1.0 (minimize, maximize, and close).&nbsp; If you have you
 get the littler helper text and and if you guess where the icons should be, you get the right functionality.&nbsp; (In other words click upper left corner of title bar closes app.)&nbsp; Also on the scroll bar, the up and down arrows at top and bottom of scroll bar
 don't display.&nbsp; the little slider on the bar to show position and to click and drag is also invisible.&nbsp;Same thing on horizontal scroll bars when they are displayed.&nbsp;Again, the functionality works, you just can't see anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on all of the Office 365 apps under windows 10.&nbsp; I am up to date on office and windows and all drivers.</p>

            <p>Newly created documents documents or converted documents show the same problem. &nbsp;Also outlook (and all the sub programs, mail, calendar, tasks, etc) have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried repair. &nbsp;It got through step 1 or 4 and then quit and removed all icons from the task bar and start menu. &nbsp;No office 365app was visible on control panel uninstall program screen either. &nbsp;I did a new install and still have the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't tried powerpoint yet, so I took a look and happened to open up a file that came up in protected mode. &nbsp;There I could see the scroll bars (but not the title bar min/max/close icons). &nbsp;Word behaves the same way in protected mode. &nbsp;The scroll bar icons
 aren't there in powerpoint in compatibility or new mode, so same behaivor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da6fd391-af4f-41b5-8bed-7c05b85637bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da6fd391-af4f-41b5-8bed-7c05b85637bc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example outlook. &nbsp;Notice the missing next and previous week icons next to the dates. &nbsp;You can see the blue square were one of the triangles should be because I had the mouse hovering over it and the helper text popped up but isn't captured in
 the screen shot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Not having basic functionality like scroll bars works shakes my confidence. &nbsp;Unless there is a quick fix I will just go back to Office 2010.</p>

            <p>Hi Byron,<br />
<br />
The feature limited issue in Excel or other Office apps could be caused by the Compatibility Mode. You could first change your Office sign-in account from Hotmail account to Office 365 account. Here are the steps: Open Word &gt; File &gt; Account &gt; Switch account
 &gt; Add an account &gt; Restart the Word. <br />
<br />
You can try the following methods to see if the issue can be fixed:<br />
1. Open Word &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Save &gt; select <strong>Word Document (*.docx)</strong> in
<strong>Save files in this format</strong> section &gt; Ok &gt; restart Word to check the outcome.
<br />
Please&nbsp;also try to uncheck "<strong>Open e-mail attachments and other uneditable files in reading view</strong>" option present in&nbsp;<strong>General</strong>&nbsp;tab.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ee73b51-f662-48ed-b9ea-ee00f444e578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ee73b51-f662-48ed-b9ea-ee00f444e578" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the issue persists, you can enter <strong>%appdata%\Microsoft\Templates</strong> in Run box (right click
<strong>start</strong>) &gt; find <strong>Normal.dotm</strong> file &gt; rename it to another name or delete it &gt; reopen Word to check the outcome.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a5fe7a5-a913-47df-b736-65a433dc92d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a5fe7a5-a913-47df-b736-65a433dc92d2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could give it a try to check the outcome with us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, to protect your privacy, i have masked the private information in your post.</p>

            <p>Thank you for blanking out name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail email address is used as my microsoft billing account, onedrive, skype, etc. &nbsp;It
<p>
</p><p>Also, notice that I have this all office apps, not just word so don't see how change normal.dotm will help. &nbsp; I deleted it, and needless to say, it had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Word&gt;File&gt;Options&gt;Save, the Word *docx was already selected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking at the last option about openning email attachments which seems very unlikely to effect the powerpoint main window title bar close/max/min icons. &nbsp;When I open that winow, it doesn't look like above. &nbsp;Notice now of check boxes are displayed.</p>

    <title>Howto restore quarantined file originally on network share - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Howto restore quarantined file originally on network share</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with a file that was put into quarantine by Forefront Endpoint Protection (same engine as Security Essentials) but which is&nbsp;false positive. Trying to restore the file gives error 0x80508014. Using Process Monitor it is revealed that MsMpEng.exe
 tries to create the file on the network share (using UNC syntax). But since MsMpEng runs as NT Authority\SYSTEM it has no access to network shares and so there is the access violation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quarantine database is encrypted, how can I restore the file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Greetings</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            <p>Thanks for the tip with the other forum. I was given the solution there: the executable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client\MpCmdRun.exe<br />
has the option</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; -restore -path</p>
<p>to retrieve the quarantined files to a different folder.</p>

<p>It's still not working but I have updates on some weird anomalies. In summary,&nbsp; Repair doesn't fix the issue but when I use Test Email in check OK and sends a test email which I receive to verify the account. How is it possible for Repair to fail but Test
 Email to validate the settings?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi CTMaverick,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me, we are sorry to hear that you are still having this issue, I will try my best to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the error message, may I confirm if you have&nbsp;configured&nbsp;a Google Apps Sync for Microsoft Outlook account and a Microsoft Exchange Server account in the same Outlook profile?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then it is recommended to configure those two accounts in two separate profiles and then check if the issue persists. Here is an article for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/3028159/the-operation-failed-error-when-you-send-email-messages-in-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"The
 operation failed" error when you send email messages in Outlook</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above information helps, please feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h3> michaelconner22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 install from my account states product key not valid...</h2>
                    I checked with billing, and my account is unlimited in date of use. I checked with tech support, and I was walked through troubleshooting steps for uninstalling and re-installing my Office Professional 2013 because of a "Bad Image" error I was receiving.
 After it seemed to start correctly, I hung up with tech support, and then realized that Office had not automatically activated itself like it was supposed to. When I tried to start the activation, I get an error stating that the product key is not valid. How
 can this be the case? I checked and was confirmed that my account was tied to this active subscription to Office Professional 2013 on this device, and has never given me an issue until the initial "Bad Image" error. I have tried several times since to uninstall,
 restart my computer, and re-install from my account at www.office.com only to have this same issue of the program stating that the product key not valid. When I click the link that says, "Click here to learn more about this error.", I am sent to a webpage
 that has been removed. Below is a screen capture of the error I'm getting.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3844fab0-366c-4146-b91a-20f6a3f25da3" />

            <p>Raju,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for the reply. However, the links you provided did not help me with my issue. I did try to call the number and active the product by telephone, and the automated recording told me that the product was not a valid product. The number I entered was
 exactly the same as the ID I was prompted to give. I'm getting rather upset at not being able to use the product I paid for, and I have tried again and again to troubleshoot problems on my end to no avail. Please help me find a way to use this product again.
 I have updated all my drivers, made sure Windows is totally up to date, checked for errors on my hard drive, installed from my active account, and tried to activate by both internet and telephone. Still no luck. I'm not even getting a prompt to enter a product
 key. It acts as if it is already entered and accepted, but the product itself tells me that it is invalid. Is there a way that I can be contacted directly through my account so I can give you guys the details that I was told not to post on the forum(i.e. account
 info) so that we can get this issue figured out? Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Michael Conner</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.- I also tried to change my anti-virus program's settings like was one of the possible solutions presented in the links, and that did work either. I'm running out of changes to make on my end to fix this issue. Again, thanks for any help you can provide.&nbsp;</p>

This did not help (accidentally clicked on "YES"). The problem has persisted for ~1 year, and it absolutely driving me crazy. Does anyone else edit manuscripts?</p>

<h2>            Printer not printing text.</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows&nbsp;Insider&nbsp;Preview Build 15014 and have an&nbsp;Epsom XP-950 printer. With this build of Windows and the previous build I am unable to print&nbsp;text although it will print graphics fine. When the previews were first downloaded and installed the
 printer worked fine. It seems that after the computer has been shut down and restarted that the problem arises. Is this a problem with Windows or is it my printer.</p>

THIS THREAD</a> and find that you are not alone and also a workaround to get your printer working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the printer problem, builds 15007 and 15014 have a problem managing the printer queue resulting in the outcome you describe.&nbsp; It has been reported on Feedback Hub and discussed at length on another thread in this Forum&nbsp; as many, many folks
 have the same problem.&nbsp; As a temporary workaround until MS gives us a fix,&nbsp; right click your default printer listed in Devices and Printers and choose Printer Properties. Click on Advanced tab and select "Print Directly to Printer" Apply, OK.
</p>
<p>This action bypasses the printer queue and is a little slower printing than normally but at least it works. When MS gets around to fixing it you can return your setting to where it was.</p>

<p>When can we expect to see Bluetooth AVCRP with the LG Optimus 7? I like using A2DP to connect to my car stereo, but at the moment it's no different than connecting an auxiliary cable because I still have to control the music on my phone (which can become
 quite a pain with the 5-minute maximum screen time-out, and no this isn't from an Exchange policy it's built in to the phone).</p>
<p>AVCRP would make this pretty awesome.</p>

            I think this question would get a better answer if it was directed towards the handset manufacturer. I have the HTC-HD7 which supports AVCRP so we know the OS supports it.
