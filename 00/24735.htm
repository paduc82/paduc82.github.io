<h2>            Currency keep showing double decimals. ex &#36;25.0.00. Why is that&#63;</h2>
                    Whenever I type a value in a accounting or currency text box it incorrectly display it with two decimal points.
<div>Ex. $25.0.00 instead of just $25.00</div>
<div>or $154.550.00 instead of $154.55</div>
<div>How do I change this?</div>

    <title>Creating Data Infographics with Shapes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating Data Infographics with Shapes</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Expert
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />Technical Level:&nbsp; Advanced Applies to: PowerPoint 2010, PowerPoint 2007
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>
</p><p>We‚Äôve all sat through presentations that contain slide after slide of charts and graphs.&nbsp; The chart may be well designed and clearly display the data, but still, all it‚Äôs displaying is the data in relational context. Either the speaker or the audience or
 both are required to perform the thought processes to turn that information into something meaningful.</p>
<p>In the hierarchy of knowledge, data moves to wisdom in three steps: </p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From data to information by applying context</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From information to knowledge through analysis</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From knowledge to wisdom through action</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ed92c1a-646f-445c-af67-8014eaadb1ad" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While charts apply relational context to your data, your audience is still required to perform the analysis of what they are seeing.&nbsp; Consider the following scenario: A car lot has 30% red cars, 20% blue cars and 50% yellow cars.&nbsp; In the last year, blue
 cars account for 50% of sales, red cars 30% and yellow cars 20%.&nbsp; In a typical presentation this data might be displayed like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0163d87-2d07-4019-bfd5-9840c7a0d3bf" /></p>
<p>While the data is accurate, this display of the information requires a lot of work on the viewer‚Äôs part to draw conclusions.&nbsp; In other words, turn the information into knowledge.&nbsp; They need to bounce back and forth between the charts comparing the data multiple
 times.</p>
<p>You could significantly improve the display of the information by simply combining them into a column chart.&nbsp; However, you‚Äôll lose your color context in order to display the two series clearly.&nbsp; If you switch your data rows/columns in order to keep the color
 context, the comparison isn‚Äôt much better than the pie charts.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b3fc4fc-a602-4fec-a9eb-95f580703e19" /></p>
<p>Prudent use of Infographics allows us to not only put the data in context but, through the use of the familiar, display some level of analysis that the audience can grasp in a glance.&nbsp; Rather than use traditional charts, by combining familiar car shapes
 and dollar images, we can display the data in a format that allows the audience to quickly analyze the information and make informed decisions for action (wisdom).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4db7b8e6-746d-47b5-b978-9de3add4299e" />This Infographic immediately tells the viewer:</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You‚Äôre understocked on blue cars by 30%</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You‚Äôre overstocked on yellow cars by 30%</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You‚Äôve got the right amount of red cars</p>
<p>The viewer can easily determine the actions needed:</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Stock 30% more blue cars</p>
<p><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Take actions to increase sales of yellow cars</p>
<p>There are a six easy steps to create your own data infographics using shapes in PowerPoint 2013:</p>
<p><b>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Find your graphics.</b>&nbsp; In the example above, I simply inserted some clip art images and then ungrouped them to remove the parts I didn‚Äôt want.&nbsp; I then regrouped them and changed the colors to fit my information.&nbsp; If you
 cannot find a graphic, you can easily create your own in PowerPoint 2013 using the improved Merge Shapes feature on the Contextual Drawing Tools tab.&nbsp; You can learn how to merge shapes by reading this
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/combine-shapes-to-create-a-custom-shape-HA102749749.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office.com article</a>.&nbsp; I also suggest checking out fellow MVP Julie Terberg‚Äôs article on
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2010/11/18/mvps-for-office-and-sharepoint-2010-custom-shapes-made-easier-with-powerpoint-2010.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Custom Shapes Made Easier with PowerPoint 2010</a>.&nbsp; Although it is an earlier version of PowerPoint, she does a great job of walking you through the steps to create your own custom shape.&nbsp; If you don‚Äôt have the time or tolerance to create your own graphics,
 I recommend <a href="http://www.getmygraphic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get My Graphic</a>.&nbsp; Other stock image companies are great for pictures and design, but Get My Graphic has an amazing library for infographics and the graphics are easily customized to meet
 your needs.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6dd18a18-7b77-4904-8ead-980c1e2d1f27" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Figure out your ratios</b>.&nbsp; In my example, it was pretty easy for me to use one car and one dollar to represent 10%, but real data is rarely that cleanly divided.&nbsp; If you don‚Äôt need to be exact and general values are ok,
 by all means do round up/down to make it easier to figure out your ratios.&nbsp; If however, you need to display more accurate values, check out MVP Dave Parade‚Äôs
<a href="http://www.thinkoutsidetheslide.com/proportional-shape-comparison-diagram-calculation-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Proportional Shape Comparison Diagram Calculation Tool</a>.&nbsp; Yes, that‚Äôs a mouthful, but it does perfectly describe exactly what the tool does.&nbsp; While you may not choose to display your elements laid out as Dave has, use the tool to determine the sizes you
 need for your objects.&nbsp; If you find you need to display only a portion of a shape, you have two choices: save the shape as an image and crop it to size or use two colors on your shape and set one of the colors as your background color.&nbsp; See the next step for
 color coding.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33b65e40-99d6-4e70-ad2a-83e2c34a10f4" />= 60%</p>
<p><b>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Determine your color coding.</b>&nbsp; In my example I used red, blue, yellow and green as my colors.&nbsp; This might be an issue for persons who are red/green color blind since red and green look like the same color for them.&nbsp; However,
 in my example, it‚Äôs the dollar signs that are green and the cars are red, clearly differentiating the information by shape as well as color.&nbsp; Additionally I was able to use a single color for each of my objects, but you may find you need to display your object
 with two or more colors to accurately represent your data.&nbsp; See this <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/add-a-gradient-fill-to-a-shape-HA010355174.aspx?CTT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office.com article</a> for applying gradients to shapes.&nbsp; And MVP Echo Swinford has an excellent tutorial on
<a href="http://echosvoice.com/tutorials-2/powerpoint-2007-tutorials/creating-gradients-in-powerpoint-2007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Creating Gradients in PowerPoint 2007</a>.&nbsp; Again, although it‚Äôs about an earlier version of PowerPoint, the gradient interface is essentially the same and Echo gives the best explanation on how to use it.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68c0702b-e80c-4a9f-b573-a5b644456233" />&nbsp; = 30% blue, 70% red</p>
<p><b>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Determine placement of your shapes.</b>&nbsp; Arrange your shapes so that they‚Äôll clearly display the information but retain their familiarity for the viewer.&nbsp; In my example, I chose to use the dollar bills as a ‚Äúroad‚Äù metaphor
 for the cars.&nbsp; If I had stacked the bills next to the cars it wouldn‚Äôt have been as effective.&nbsp; I did toy with arranging them all in a straight line but, while it looked cool, the data wasn‚Äôt as clear as each set of cars/dollars arranged vertically.&nbsp; Smart
 Guides, introduced in PowerPoint 2010, make it easier than ever to align shapes.&nbsp; Read this
<a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-powerpoint/archive/2012/11/09/powerpoint-2013-smarter-guides.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PowerPoint 2013: Smarter Guides</a> article to learn how much better they are in PowerPoint 2013 and how to use them.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/78f1ec52-601c-447e-80b7-93de58ec18a2" /></p>
<p><b>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Determine your background and slide placement.</b>&nbsp; You want to be very careful with this step.&nbsp; You can easily obscure your information if your background is too busy.&nbsp; Your background should enhance and add context to your
 infographic as opposed to obscuring the information.&nbsp; Since most slide backgrounds are determined by your template, you‚Äôll want to choose your template carefully or make your own.&nbsp; If you regularly create presentations, you should seriously consider getting
 the book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789749556/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=echos-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0789749556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Building PowerPoint Templates Step by Step with the Experts</a>.&nbsp; Placement on the slide is also important.&nbsp; As you can see in my example, I placed the primary infographic in the lower right quadrant.&nbsp; In most cases this is the weakest position on a slide.&nbsp;
 The upper right and center areas are the strongest positions on a slide for most languages because they are read left to right, top to bottom.&nbsp; I overcome this constraint through the use of vivid colors on my primary infographic and duller colors on my background
 graphics.&nbsp; When viewing the slide, your eye is immediately drawn to the infographic of the brightly colored cars.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3baf163f-e368-4833-9f22-bf378242949d" /></p>
<p><b>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Finally, follow the KISS principle.</b>&nbsp; KISS stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid.&nbsp; Avoid over-cluttering your slides with text and elements that add no value.&nbsp; You want your audience to absorb the information at a glance, not
 have to visually wade through a bunch of junk to find it.</p>

    <title>Phone Quick notes location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derek mckinnon bf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phone Quick notes location</h2>
                    <p>When I open OneNote on my computer I have a notebook called Quicknotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open OneNote on my Android Phone I have an app that saves things to quicknotes. &nbsp;When I use this it saves to a Quick Notes section in a workbook called Derek @ My Company Name &nbsp;(with spaces and no final .com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not appear in the Quick notes built into my computer OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the computer I cannot find the Derek @ My Company Name notebook to link to - and I wouldn't want to operate this way as they should be visible in the default Quick Notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all the accounts seem to be set up fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I tell the phone's Quick Notes to save it to my computers' quick notes folder?</p>

            <p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the confirmation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can confirm that it is indeed an issue on the version you're on (7369.2118).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fix has been released with the update 7466.2038.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reference thread:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10/onenote-2016-application-issue-with-quick-notes/d0b8901e-c610-4e20-b9e3-a4c5bfc1fbcd">OneNote 2016 Application
 issue with "Quick Notes" stuck loading</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I'd like to explain why you're still not getting this update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the version you're on, you are currently using a Deferred Channel release of Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fix has been deployed to a Current Channel release. Generally, it takes around 4 months for a Current Channel release to propagate to the Deferred Channel. The next Deferred Channel release is
 scheduled for June 13, 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reference for the channel releases:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-SG/library/mt592918.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Version and build numbers of update channel releases for Office 365 clients</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, we can suggest the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Wait for the next release for the Deferred Channel which
 should fix the issue.</span></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3185078/how-to-switch-from-deferred-channel-to-current-channel-for-the-office-365-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Switch
 from Deferred Channel to Current Channel</span></a><span> to receive the fix now.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p>For option number 2, we suggest you consult with your company's IT department / Global Administrator, as there may be a number of line-of-business applications, add-ins, or macros that are used by
 you or your company that may not have been tested yet on the latest Current Channel release of Office.</p>

    <title>Searching in Outlook for hyphenated numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ric norman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching in Outlook for hyphenated numbers</h2>
                    <p>I need to search emails for numbers that often include hyphens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: I search for 555000-002&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is all of my emails (sometimes 50 or so)&nbsp;that contains 555000 and 002</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to find exactly 555000-002</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is there a way to designate the - as a searchable character instead of a seperator?&nbsp; Can I set it&nbsp;to be a searchable character by default?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>fyi:&nbsp;&nbsp;We did these searches all the time with Outlook 2000. We upgraded and now our easy to use files are not so easy to use.</p>

            Unfortunately, Outlook's search works in such a way that the hyphen is treated only as a separator. The same thing would happen if you replaced the hyphen with a space or an asterisk or most other punctuation marks. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, Outlook has always
 worked that way, but it has been a LONG time since I last used Outlook 2000.

<h2>            Changing hyperlink colors,  cannot get any &#34;Hyperlink&#34; to show up when I launch the Style group</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
Suddenly, my hyperlinks started to be purple. So, I wanted to change the color back to blue. Had no idea how to do it until I came across Shauna Kelly's page
<br />
http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/formatting/change-the-colour-or-remove-the-underline-from-hyperlinks-in-microsoft-word.html<br />
<br />
"To do either of these things, modify the Hyperlink style.
<ol>
<li>Display the Modify Style dialog. To do that, in Word 2007 or Word 2010, click in a hyperlink. On the Home tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Styles group. (The dialog box launcher is the tiny tiny arrow at the far bottom right of the Styles group,
 under the "Change Styles" button.) The Styles pane will appear. In that pane, right-click
<span>Hyperlink </span>and choose <span>Modify</span>."</li></ol>
<span>Hyperlink </span>and choose <span>Modify</span>."</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, I am not sure what she means by "Click in a hyperlink". Place the cursor there? Ctrl+Click (which is what I need to do to run the hyperlink)?</p>
<p>In any event, I cannot get any "Hyperlink" to show up when I launch the Style group. I see</p>

            If your hyperlinks used to be blue and all suddenly turned purple, the problem probably isn't in the definition of the Hyperlink style. In Word 2010, the color in the Hyperlink style is defined as one of the 12 theme colors. So if you changed which theme
 is selected, or played around with the colors of the existing theme, then the hyperlink color could change even though the Hyperlink style is still the same.<br />
<br />
To check this out, go to the Page Layout tab and click the Colors button near the left end. At the bottom of the gallery, click Create New Theme Colors. In the dialog that opens, look at the last two colors -- Hyperlink and Followed Hyperlink. Also look at
 the sample on the right. If the Hyperlink color is purple there, that's the reason for your purple hyperlinks.<br />
<br />
You can choose one of the other color palettes on the Colors gallery -- most of them use blue for hyperlinks -- or you can make a custom palette and name it.<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong about the theme color being the problem, then to answer your original question: at the bottom of the Styles pane, click Options. In the dialog that opens, set the boxes to show All Styles and Alphabetical order. Then you can see the Hyperlink style
 and modify it.<br />

            Doing what you suggested made me realize that my links were purple becasue that was the color of "Following hyperlinks". However, it seemed to me that even when I made new hyperlinks, they were purple. So, I followed your second procedure, Jay, and set
 my settings to to apply to new documents, not only the existing one.<br />
<br />
Thank you for clearing this up for me. It seems to work fine now.<br />
<br />

<p>Under WP8.1 there is an option to save the password:</p>

            <p>Hopefully my question is&nbsp;related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Passwords are currently synced across my Lumia 930 on Windows 10 and my PC also running Edge Win10. However, when I visit a website using my phone, the log in credentials for that site are not being filled in. I have tried visiting both the desktop and the
 mobile version of the sites. When I try using my PC it works fine. This creates a problem as the mobile browser doesn't give access to actually view the passwords so while it is stored I can't log in to a website without remembering my log in credentials.

    <title>New Design for Senior Citizen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old_man---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Design for Senior Citizen</h2>
                    Cannot remember the model no. but Nokia very basic have the only model with keypads far apart and of course monochrome screen. Mobile hv come a long way... by just browsing thru Nokia models, all have the keypads side by side.<br />
<br />
In Malaysia where I live, a lot of senior citizen is carrying that old phone, why, not throw at robbers or wild dogs, because easy to input button since their fingers are large and more than often clumpsy. since no phone todate offer both worlds, for large
 fingers with huge colour screen and cheap!<br />
<br />
I think many children can afford a good phone for their parents but than the best choice is the old model phone. We are too engrossed with latest gadget(camera/3g/fm radio) that sometime we forgot about the basic. a good basic idea phone would be:<br />
<br />
1. slim(time to make it slim)<br />
2. colour but with huge screen and MUST be REAL HUGE number alphabeth/numbers when inputting.<br />
3. keypads far apart(not too sensitive as senior citizen sometime press too hard or too long, its goes into alphabeth or double.<br />
4.simple design and not the complicated one.<br />
<br />
fm there, next in line for future upgraded model<br />
1. camera<br />
2. 3G - children calling their parents<br />
<br />
hope nokia would be the first....

            You hit the nail on the head m8! I'm also browsing in every phone shop whatever model that somehow fits what you have described but to no avail. I wanted to give one to my mom; she needs to communicate too, when walking around the blocks. Communications
 is for everyone!

            Have you taken a look at the 3110 classic. It doesn't have the REALLY large screen you are looking for, but it seems to be close.

            Bobby, 3110 design are just like any of Nokia current design. pressing the send and stop key are so close including the number. perhaps a design with round large keypads individually and more important not only large screen but when keying in number must
 show large no or alphabeth.<br />
<br />
Each time I saw the old nokia phone(will try to find the model no.) use by senior citizen i would ask them why they chose this phone and the obvious answer would be easy to input number with their large fingers. as one age, so is their sensitivity to touching.
 the only set back is no large colour screen. i dun think if nokia were to come up this phone for senor citizen, there are many whom prefer a simple phone to call and sms only. of course with key pad position far apart, sms would be difficult but we are catering
 to another group of ppl, incl.me! hehehehe.....

            A very big , old and heavy Nokia was the 2110, which here in Italy had been very successful at that time. My father bought one in 1997 if I correctly remember, still fully functional if one finds the batteries (now quite impossible).

            2110 that one i recalled when company gave us the phone, it was the greatest moments when not many user around.<br />
<br />
if take at one glance at the phone company site, they are all almost similar. in sony case,every phone launch seems to have walkman, guess to cater to younger generation. working class ppl do not hv time to listen via phone. in our country where car is a necessity,
 they would prefer to listen to car audio.<br />
<br />
Nokia in reading, be different and launch something for the old folks or folks whom only need call/sms and easy to press with large colour screen. put in camera/3g/bluetooth and command a price of usd180-250 should grab a lot of seniors or to put it in a nicer
 way...working class ppl.

            We appreciate your need. We trust Nokia would be reading your post and come up with a No frills senior citizen model, exclusively crafted for older people with a nice large readble colour screen with large fonts, well spaced keypad which will endure hardkey
 presses light in weight and a battery that will last for 15 days atleast

            Two questions:<br />
1. Does it really have to be a mobile ... or just a GSM phone that looks and feels moreless like a traditional desktop with extra features (e.g. SMS capability)?<br />
2. Do you insist on Nokia?<br />
<br />
If you are contemplating a "NO" to those questions, check out this:<br />

I actually know someone who uses it and likes it (not that much of a senior, but a seriously disabled person with very restricted mobility and no feeling in his hands). I guess that for the less mobile seniors, this is an interesting solution!

    <title>How do I change the header in an Outlook email I&#39;m replying - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackson88  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the header in an Outlook email I&#39;m replying to&#63;</h2>
                    This should be extremely simple, and it used to be. <br />
<br />
I've received an Outlook email, I want to reply but with a different header (title) on the email.<br />
<br />
Searched all over, googled, checked previous posts, wasted a lot of time unnecessarily, as the old hotmail format was much more user friendly.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
PS - Is there any way I can revert to the old Hotmail format with Outlook email?<br />
<br />

    <title>DNS Error&#58; Domain name not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosscons  say:</h3>
<h2>            DNS Error&#58; Domain name not found</h2>
                    <p>Office 365 handles email to my domain.&nbsp; Starting yesterday, I started getting mail rejected because the domain was not found.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 365 mail handling was set up more than a year ago and hasn't been touched since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The domain is registered by Network Solutions, the account is current, &nbsp;and I don't see any problems on their system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The domain is active in WhoIs and shows the following nameservers:&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">nameserver:&nbsp;ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com<br />
nameserver:&nbsp;ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked at the Office 365 records, it showed that my domain was "verified" and my Office 365 account is current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having DNS problems?&nbsp; Any suggestion where else to look?&nbsp; Do you have a phone number for Microsoft Office 365 support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Access 2010 Query Not Recognizing Number in Table</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a table with multiple fields.&nbsp; When I query a specific number, Access does not return the number which I know is in the table because I have checked.<br />
Is there a protocol to follow when Access does not recognize a number?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>First thing I would check is to design the table and see what the datatype of this field is. Is it numeric as it should be? If there should be only whole numbers, check that the Field Size property is set to Integer or Long Integer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next thing to check is if there is an Input Mask or a Format property set that could "distort" the number.</p>

<p>1. Sometimes there's no sound with call function. Neither I get any voice nor does the caller. The problem can be temporarily solved by swaping from sim 1 to sim 2 and then back to sim 1. But the problem keeps arising too frequently.<br />
2. From yesterday on the phone is not detecting its own earphone neither the others.</p>
<p>3. Using windows insider to upload to windows 10 is always stuck at 0% or at 8%. Even after restarting and resetting the phone theres no improvement.</p>
<p>4. last one. Whes is windows 10 coming to INDIA!</p>

            <p>I was forced to switch to Outlook from Hotmail.&nbsp; I inquired about Outlook.&nbsp; But I did not want to switch, which was done automatically without my okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked Hotmail.&nbsp; Outlook is confusing and just doesn't work correctly.&nbsp; It makes it hard to forward emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft is smart, they will switch back.&nbsp; I tried to switch back myself, but they "boxed me in" to Outlook</p>

            <p>Hi michael bbbb.7099,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The option to switch back to Hotmail is no longer available. The reason behind this is that because all accounts will be upgraded to the new Outlook.com interface for&nbsp;a better browsing experience.

    <title>2nd Skype number and call forwarding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janderson1  say:</h3>
<h2>            2nd Skype number and call forwarding</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have currently a UK Skype phone number. I purchase and use Skype credit to make calls to the UK from Skype. I do not have call forwarding set up, so when someone dials this number, the Skype app on my mobile rings and I answer as normal. When I make a
 call, I have it set up so this UK number is visible on the receivers screen where relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to buy a second UK Skype phone number and use call forwarding to forward any calls to this new number to a UK mobile (not the one that has the Skype app on it). Therefore I want to know if someone dials this number will it go straight to the mobile
 and the Skype app on my phone will stay inactive. And on the mobile phone that receives the forwarded call, will they be able to see the number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would like to know if this second number will affect my existing set up, where if someone dials the first Skype number, my app wakes up and shows the caller ID on my phone. Basically I dont want my existing set up to be compromised by the new number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can purchase a new number and activate the call forwarding, however, if you will use the same account that your first number is attached, the call from the second number will ring to your account first, then if not answered, that is the time it
 will be forwarded to your mobile number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the caller will not be able to see the mobile number where you forwarded the call. The caller will also not know if the call has been forwarded or not. Only you can know that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to avoid your account to ring upon receiving the call from the second number, you will need to use a separate Skype account to purchase a new number. This way, even if you're not signed in to that account as long as the call forwarding is active,
 you will be able to receive it.</p>

<p>Your issue is with your network rather than Nokia. In return for a subsidy when you bought the phone, your network sold you a phone which is specific to them with network branding. Now that your phone is free from contract, you should ask your network for
 their written permission to remove the branding. Once you get this letter, any Nokia Care Point should able to take care of the rest for you. This is the correct way to do it and any other way will invalidate your warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid this in the future, you can always do as I do and get non network branded phones.</p>

<p>My issue is with nokia not with the network.... If you read my post carefully you noticed that I wrote that I didnt' get any subsidy. The phone was free from the moment i bought it. It is nokia fault because they mock their customers :(</p>
<p>The phone is NOT locked to any network. It is because of the product code, and that is nokia's fault.</p>

            Did you purchase the phone directly from Nokia? I got mine from Nokia and there is no branding on it. If you bought the phone from a retailer and they sold you a network branded but simfree phone then it was up to them to inform you of that fact. All branded
 sets were originally supplied to the relevant network. Those networks purchase hundreds of thousands of handsets at a time and insist on the units being branded. Nokia have very little control over what the networks do with them thereafter. There is no reason
 for Nokia to supply you with a branded set directly. They would have to buy back a set from the network which would not make any sense.

<p>Have a read of a recent news article linked below which will give you an idea of what happens after nokia sells the handsets to a network or a big retailer.</p>

<h2>            office 365 continually want to be activated after windows 10 update</h2>
                    My windows 10 did an automatic update this past weekend and now when I open any of the Office 365 apps they all say I need to active Office 365. It will not let you do it over the phone but only online.&nbsp; When I click next it then comes up with error that
 the server can not be contacted error 0x80072F8F and will not proceed any further. Now it has set a countdown of days and then my product becomes unlicensed.&nbsp; I had purchased and installed and activated Office 365 back in March and have had no issues until
 the last windows 10 update.&nbsp; The Office 365 is currently version 16.07167.2060.&nbsp; Any help to fix is greatly appreciated.

            Windows and office are both up to date. I did the install of office 365 with and with out virus scanner running-no difference.&nbsp; The only change is now the countdown clock of days has run out and my office programs now say unlicensed and I can not access
 the functionality of these programs.&nbsp; I log into my microsoft online account and the office 365 registers as active install.&nbsp; It is frustrating when you pay for the product and it has been working just fine for 6 months and then the manufacture updates the
 os and now their program does not work.&nbsp; Seems like there should be a simple solution published as to fix it or pump out another update to fix.
