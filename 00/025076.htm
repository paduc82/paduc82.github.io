<h2>            Error Logging in to Office 2011 from SharePoint &#40;Error Code&#58; 0x800434d4&#41;</h2>
                    I am a contractor with my own Office 365 account logged in from my personal Macbook.&nbsp; I can access any of the Microsoft Suite of apps from my desktop with no issues, but attempting to open a word doc using"Open Word" from my client company's SharePoint
 prompts me to login, which fails using either my personal or company credentials and yields the
<strong>error code: 0x800434d4</strong>. Any assistance with troubleshooting would be greatly appreciated!

<p><span>INSTALL UPDATES:</span></p>
<p><span>I think the first troubleshooting step to take is:
<strong>Ensure your Mac and Office have the latest updates</strong>. Here’s how to install updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure your Mac has a working internet connection, then:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Update Mac OS X</span></strong><span>. Open the App store and click on the Updates button. Install the updates.</span></li><li><span>After, in any Office application go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates to launch the AutoUpdate app.
<strong>Let AutoUpdate install updates and then restart your Mac.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates for these programs if you have them.</p>

            <p>How are you trying to add it to Outlook 2016?&nbsp; Copy the .PST file from the USB stick to a folder on your HD where it won't overwrite any existing .PST files, open Outlook, "File &gt; Open and Export &gt; Open Outlook Data File", navigate to the folder you copied
 the .PST file to, and click OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming you have Google setup as an IMAP account, you can then drag and drop email from the .PST to your Google account.&nbsp; The only issue that comes up once in a while is if the .PST file was set to Read Only during the copy
 process to the transfer medium (this always applies to CDROMS, rarely, if ever, to USB sticks).&nbsp; In this rare case, the .PST file would need to be set back to Read/Write before Outlook will open it.

<p>thanks Hal&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Outlook 2016 and have 2 email addresses and use Google Apps to synch it. the account says Exchange ActiveSync</p>
<p>I am trying to add the PST file from the local HD into one of the email addresses i have.</p>
<p>The file that i am adding was a PoP email account or i think may be IMAP. i was using Google for open it on the web browser.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>The PST file does ask me for a password which i created when i saved it on the USB.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense. I did follow your instructions but its still no working.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Forms - calculated control source help needed. After entering data - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forms - calculated control source help needed. After entering data into a form, how do you have the calculated results display in fields within that same form&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am converting a very old DB (Q&amp;A) into Access 2007.&nbsp; I am a beginner level user.&nbsp; I've managed to get all the years of data converted and have my tables, forms, queries and mail merges setup so that my employees can start using them.&nbsp; I'm sure what we
 need in our DB can easily be done, but I've read many posts from many sites and have watched many videos and I know that I'm just not putting the pieces together&nbsp;and not seeing what it is I need to do.&nbsp; I feel like I'm cheating by posting and not figuring
 this out myself, but I'm ready to be done with this conversion.&nbsp; (I'm seeing brackets and parenthesis in my dreams!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old program we used, we were able to enter data into a form and prior to going to the next record, we would hit a function key to tell the program to perform the calculations&nbsp;and then it would enter the results in other fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Access 2007,&nbsp;I have created a form for data entry (the form's record source is the underlying table).&nbsp; I've also created a&nbsp;parameter query&nbsp;that does all the necessary calculations&nbsp;in order to be able to quickly calculate fees to date owed by a customer
 (which changes daily).&nbsp; The query works fine for looking up fees for an already created customer record.&nbsp; But I would like to also be able to get this information calculated in the form as I'm entering a new&nbsp;record (kind of totaling as we go).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've experimented with using the control source fields on my form to perform calculations using the expression builder and I've also copied the&nbsp;working expressions from my query into the control sources and that doesn't seem to be working either.&nbsp; Currently,
 my fields are displaying the error msg. "#Name?"</p>
<p>I didn't reference my table in my expressions since the fields are on the form.&nbsp; One of my attempts is as shown below:&nbsp; Help, what am I missing??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The first&nbsp;field totals up various fees from one dept.</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; =[Exp1]=NZ([SvcChg],0)+nz([MiscFee],0)+NZ([AmtLtrSCDMV],0)+NZ([AmtLtrOwner],0)+NZ([AmtLtrLienh],0)+NZ([AmtLtrO/S_DMV],0)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The second&nbsp;field is a DateDiff field that calculates an amount of days</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; =[Exp3]=DateDiff("d",[DateTowed],NZ([DtReleased],NZ([DtofAuction],NZ([DtDocsRcvd],Date()))))+1</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The third field multiplies the DateDiff number (from field two) by a&nbsp;daily rate&nbsp;
</strong></span>=[Exp2]=[AmtDaysStored]*[DailyStgFee]</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The fourth field totals&nbsp;fees from another dept., and then adds the totals from fields one and three&nbsp;
</strong></span>=[Exp4]=[SubtotalStg]+[TotalAdminFees]+[TowingFee]+[CleanUpFee]+[MiscFee]+[GateFee]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure that&nbsp;some of these&nbsp;functions can be combined, but for various reasons, our employees need to see the subtotals as&nbsp;described above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all assistance would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access is an amazing program, but when&nbsp;self teaching, even with all the tools available,&nbsp;it can be&nbsp;a bit daunting.</p>

            <p>Well, one problem I see is that you're referring to "fields" on a Form. Forms don't&nbsp;<em>have</em> Fields: they have Controls, which may be bound to Fields in the form's Recordsource table, or may be calculated on the fly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calculated fields - such as your first three - should not be stored in any Table; they should instead be calculated on the fly. For instance you can display the sum of fields A, B and C in a textbox on a Form by simply setting that textbox's Control Source
 property to</p>
<p>
</p><p>=[A] + [B] + [C]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need the Exp3, which probably came from trying to do the calculation in a Query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To look up data from some other table, as it appears that you're doing in the fourth expression, you can use the DLookUp function:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DLookUp("SomeFieldName", "SomeTableName", "optional query criteria")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also (<strong>VERY STRONGLY!!)&nbsp;</strong>suggest that you avoid using special characters such as period., slash, or even blank in the names of fields or controls. Access can and will get confused; in particular, a period is a delimiter used for constructs
 like tablename.fieldname or formname.controlname. Having a field or a control named&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">[AmtLtrSCDMV] is just asking for trouble - on a Form, each control will usually be bound to a single field in the Form's
 Recordsource query such as [trSCDMV].</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>That said... if you have any number of calculated controls on a Form, you can put a line</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.Recalc</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the VBA of a button's Click event (or any other appropriate event, such as the AfterUpdate event of a control which goes into the calculation) to recalculate all the calculated controls on the form.</p>

            <p>As John said you shouldn't use the =Expx. That is probably what is causing your error. The #Name error indicates Access can't find a object name, which is probably the Expx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, You really should review your table structure. If you have fields as described with the name of each fee, then your database is NOT normalized properly. Your fees should go in a child table like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblCustomerFees</p>
<p>CustomerFeeID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>CustomerID (FK)</p>
<p>FeeTypeID (FK)</p>
<p>FeeAmount</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fees would be entered into a subform and you would only enter a record for applicable fees. You can then add controls to SUM() all or specific Fee types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would add a lookup table for fee types.</p>
<p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my original post, I'm a beginner level creator so keep this in mind if I seem a bit stupid about this.&nbsp; I had considered setting up the DB as you had suggested but I just couldn't see that it could or should be done that way to suit our needs.&nbsp;
 We really could get away with using Excel to do this work, but I&nbsp;thought it best for our users to have the form feature for data entry.&nbsp;Let me explain and if you have a moment, let me know if you still think my DB setup may still be problematic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We operate a towing service for different police municipalities.&nbsp;Each vehicle we tow has&nbsp;an incoming&nbsp;date, outgoing date&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;some or all of&nbsp;eight&nbsp;various fees may be added, depending on circumstances.&nbsp; After the tow, administratively, a process is followed
 to send a letter to the DMV/law enforcement&nbsp;to obtain owner/lienholder information.&nbsp; As the info is returned to us,&nbsp;we&nbsp;complete the owner&nbsp;and lineholder information for that vehicle on the vehicle form and we notify the owners/lienholders via mail merge on
 the status of their vehicle and various info.&nbsp; For us, it is important to be able&nbsp;to view all of the vehicle info.&nbsp;and the admin. steps we've taken to be able to process each vehicle in a timely manner due to very explicit laws.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because every&nbsp;owner is different for each tow, I'm not seeing how it would beneficial to create the database as you suggested.&nbsp; I guess we could create a table for each owner, vehicle, lienholder and for our fees, but since they will probably each be&nbsp;used
 only one time (with the exceptions of our fees),&nbsp;it seems&nbsp;easisest just to have all the data/fields in one table.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I do not have&nbsp;any&nbsp;calucated fields in the table, only on the form.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>With this being said, do you think I should still do the subform for the fees (or anything else)?&nbsp; I'm definitely open to suggestions.&nbsp; As I said earlier, what I like about our setup is that we can view everything about the vehicle in one place on one form
 with one&nbsp;click.&nbsp; The only drawback that I can complain about is that when&nbsp;certain actions on a vehicle are not necessary to do, the form ends up with a lot of blank fields on it. But&nbsp;when this is the case, the vehicle is gone and the file is closed and we
 usually never have to refer to the record again.&nbsp; So I think setup may work for us, but if you think that this structure is still not as it should be, and/or will be problematic, please, please just&nbsp;let me know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, thank you for taking the time to respond to my earlier post.&nbsp; I am constantly amazed at your's and others generosity and time taken to answer and help others out on these sites.&nbsp; I certainly wish I could "pay it forward" and do the same. &nbsp;I love computers,
 but as is obvious, I am not in the position to answer questions - usually just ask !!!</p>

            <p>First, I suggest you do some research on Normalization.&nbsp;Over 40 years ago, the design requirements for a relational database were first postulated. The rules of normalization have existed virtually unchanged since then. They have stood the test of time and
 represent the most efficient way to store relational data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you are saying it is not possible that a car would ever be towed more than once or that a car owner would never have a car towed more than once? I can understand that it may be rare, but not impossible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, I do think you need to normalize your data. And why do you think a normalized structure means you can't do everything on one form? The way I envision it, the user would enter the vehicle's VIN. Access would then check to see if that VIN was ever
 towed before. If it wasn't then you main form would be opened to blank record with the VIN filled in. Otherwise it would bring up the record of that VIN. You would have separate subforms for the vehicle owner and lienholder and another one in Continuous form
 mode for the fees. If there is a new owner or lienholder, the user deactivates the old one and either selects or enters new ones. Then the user enters the fees, again only entering the applicable fees. This would make invoicing easier and eliminate a lot of
 blank fields. It also eliminates the complex expression to sum the fees. You could also categorize the fee types so you can get subtotals very easily. Also, if you ever add a new fee, you just need to add it to your fee types.. Otherwise you need to modify
 your table, form and reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, there are very good reasons, the principles of normalization have existed, virtually unchanged for over 40 years. I urge you to look more closely at this.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I've not really ever known the term about normalization and databases.&nbsp; I guess it is time to learn and make some changes.&nbsp; What you say makes sense - it was exactly what I thought your response would be (but was hopeful that you wouldn't say

            <p>The old Q&amp;A Program, while it had its good points, was not a real relational database like Access is. &nbsp;What you have done is common to database newbies, especially those used to working with spreadsheets. Relational database tables should be tall and thin,
 not wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I see at least 6 tables for you:</p>
<p>tblOwners: OwnerID (PK Autonumber),Names, address, phone, etc.</p>
<p>tblVehicles: VehicleID (PK Autonumber), VIN, Model, OwnerID (FK), LienholderID (FK) etc. (Note, even though the VIN would be a unique identfier, I would still use an Autonumber as the PK and set the VIN to be unique. The VIN is too long a text field to use
 in joins.</p>
<p>tblLienholders: LienholderID (PK Autonumber), Name, contact info etc. I'm assuming here that lienholders are the car loan lender, so I would assume there would be duplications here.</p>
<p>tblTows: TowID (PK Autonumber), IncomingDate, OutgoingDate, Pickupaddress, MunicipalityID (FK), VehicleID (FK), etc.</p>
<p>tblTowFees: TowFeeID (PK Autonumber), TowID (FK), FeeTypeID (FK), FeeAmount</p>
<p>tblMunicipality: MunicipalityID (PK Autonumber), Municipality, address, contact info, etc.</p>
<p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia 925 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richslumia925---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925</h2>
                    
<p><strong>An Open Letter to Nokia and Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p>I recently purchased a Nokia Lumia 925 after months of saving for it.</p>
<p>Whilst I love the look, feel and style of the phone I am bitterly disappointed in the total lack of functionality of the phone.</p>
<p>I have had many happy years of service with previous Nokia models.&nbsp; After seeing the trouble my friends have with their iPhones and trying to synchronise them with a PC or Laptop, I decided to stay with a Nokia.&nbsp; I’m the only person that doesn’t have an
 iPhone or similar smart phone.&nbsp; I [wrongly] assumed that a phone designed with a Windows platform would interface seamlessly with my computer, which is running Windows 7 beautifully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you set out to design a child’s toy or something for a Social Media user, you’ve achieved your goal.</p>
<p>If you set out to design a phone to be used for work purposes, you have failed miserably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my phone for work as well as personal reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Synch facility to the cloud is next to useless to me. I need my data on my computer.</li><li>Contacts are difficult to create on the phone and easy on PC Suite.&nbsp; When I add a Phone contact I DON’T want to add the number as a Hotmail contact.</li><li>Contact Groups can apparently contain only 20-25 members. On PC Suite I have one contact Group of over a hundred Volunteers that receive a monthly update about Community Events. Other Groups are in the 30-35 number range.</li><li>There is NO facility to make Global changes to your contacts.</li><li>What PDF documentation on the 925 that is available, differs depending on whether you are looking at the US or GB versions of the Operating Manual.&nbsp; I couldn’t find one for Australia.</li><li>Both Nokia and Microsoft Support websites invariably take you, in a very circuitous fashion, to a Cloud/Crowd Support are where there are thousands of threads from people all asking for help. I don’t see this type of so called ‘Customer Service’ being of
 any service to your Customers.&nbsp; I actually got an email from one ‘real’ person from both of your organisations.&nbsp; All other contacts were Crowd sourced.</li><li>I tried connecting a Bluetooth keyboard in the vain attempt to actually get the phone to work.&nbsp; The phone will pair with the device but there is NO functionality.</li><li>The caller Voice Announce facility seems to be missing from the Lumia, unlike the E51.</li><li>Trying to synch my Outlook Calendar with my Windows Phone account is nearly impossible, some appointments that appear on my Outlook Calendar, fail to show on my phone’s calendar.</li><li>Why does iTunes open EVERY time I connect my phone to my computer?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m afraid that after 10 days of trying to set up and use the Lumia I’ve given up on it and gone back to my E51, because it ‘just works’.</p>
<p>I don’t know what you guys are paid, but I’m on just over $800 per fortnight. A Lumia in America costs $99.00. &nbsp;So I could conceivably just throw the phone in the garbage bin.&nbsp; The same Lumia in Australia costs over $500.00.&nbsp; You can see that it would take
 me quite some time to save for a phone that I really like, but after experiencing the manner in which it works, I’m going to try to recover some of my money by selling it on e-Bay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, I have just bought myself a disgustingly expensive Satellite Navigation unit.&nbsp; By the way, I love the Drive App.&nbsp; It just works perfectly and is much better than the Tom Tom that it replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will <strong>NOT</strong> be recommending the Lumia range to any of my contacts, unless they want to buy a toy for their children.&nbsp; I am still loyal to the way Nokia has made their phones in the past and will look forward, to see if Nokia ‘gets it right’
 in the future.&nbsp; Maybe you should change the name from Operating System [I.S.] to Inoperable System [I.O.S], like Apple.</p>
<p>For the moment, I’m a very unhappy Customer, but happily going back to my E51, because that ‘just works’.</p>
<p>yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Richard Forrester.</p>

<p>It is confusing: In Australia, the global variant (GB) is linked because there is no special variant for Australia. Yes, that is the same version as for Great Britain, nevertheless, in the terms of old Nokia it is the global version. The company is not yet
 American. The US variant differs (a lot) because many menu items are labeled completely different with US English. Did that answer your question? I know, it is confusing as the file should be labeled just ‘UG_en’ without the GB.</p>

<h2>            How can I make WORD 2010 my default WORD when I also have OFFICE 2007 installed&#63;</h2>
                    I have OFFICE 2007 and 2010. &nbsp;I want to use WORD 2010, but after a Microsoft auto-update about a month ago, WORD 2007 comes up whenever I click on a WORD document. &nbsp;That's a minor issue but the major problem is that the Microsoft Office Small Business
 2007 configuration processor leaps into action (every time) and it takes forever to complete.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have let the configuration process run to completion several &nbsp;times but the next time WORD 2007 comes up, so does the lengthy Configuration Process.<br />
Is there a way to do away with the configuration process, once and for all?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked at making WORD 2010 the default for Word programs, but I'm only offered WORD 2007 as the choice. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Is there a way to add WORD 2010 to the selection?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked at uninstalling WORD 2007, but it seems all of OFFICE 2007 needs to be uninstalled. &nbsp;<br />
Is there a way to uninstall a single application of OFFICE 2007?</div>
                </div>

<br />
To set Word 2010 as the default, right-click a .docx file and click Open With, and then "Choose default program". In the dialog box, click the Browse button. Go to the folder that contains the Office 2010 programs (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14
 or C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14) and click the WinWord.exe file. Repeat this for the other Word formats (.docm, .dotx, .dotm, .doc, .dot).<br />
<br />
If you really want to remove Word 2007 after that, click the Office 2007 item in the Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features and click the Change button. In the first page of the installer, choose Add or Remove Features. In the next page, click the icon for Word
 and click Not Available. Then click the Continue button and let the installer finish. If you don't make any other changes in the list of programs/features, the rest of Office will remain as is.<br />

It allows downloading as often as needed but activating on a max of 3 computers at any one time. Simply repeat the process on another computer.<br />

<h2>            5800 XPressMusic in O2&#47;UK - GPS and map - paid connection to positioning server&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
I live in UK. I have 5800 XPressMusic Nokia in O2. I have all programs/maps/software up-to date.</p>
<p>I want to use:</p>
<p><strong>1.Maps</strong> - I let phone to swich bluetooth on, but then there is info on the screen: Positioning server, connection to network positioning server required. I choose NO, as I am not sure if I have to pay for connection. Do you know if this is
 internet connection and if I have to pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>2. GPS</strong> (I choose Location/GPS data), I enable Bluetoots, but have the same info on the screen: Positioning server, connection to network positioning server required.Do you know if this is internet connection and if I have to pay for it?</p>
<p>I am suprised, by the way, because if I use Garmin in my car, it works by it self, there is no need to use any connection as works immediately after I swich it on.</p>
<p>I thought, I can use GPS and Maps in my Nokia without using any connection I have to pay for. It looks 5800 is not a geal GPS device (cause I have to use paid connection).I am right or not?</p>

    <title>why nokia is a FAIL &#40;based on 6303&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            why nokia is a FAIL &#40;based on 6303&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>First of all, I'm quite patient person, but no man on earth exists, that can take such amount of failures and still use nokia products.<br />
<br />
I have nokia 6303i, i'm useing it almost 2 years, before that I used Siemens and Samsung products, but only nokia has such lousy GUI and major programming-logical bugs. Such bugs cannot be in a product, that is completed - not a beta or a preview version.<br />
<br />
The major bug is security based - if you set phone password and set timeout, after which the phone should lock itself, there are unpredictable cases, when it fails to do so!!!!! imagine - i have some very private information on the phone, i'm living not alone
 and today is second time, when unauthorized person was able to read aftermentioned information (when i was in bathroom)!!!<br />
<br />
Will I receive a compensation from nokia maybe??<br />
<br />
There are other bugs, that cannot be treated as minor:<br />
<br />
Handling SMS's (when there is big ammount of SMS &gt;4000, and you're starting to move them to other folder, some of them magically reapear at the end of SMS inbox).<br />
<br />
Working with bluetooth - if sending of the files via bluetooth fails (example - connection problems), nokia file systems hangs - you cannot cancel bluetooth - nothing, only way is to turn off phone and turn it on again.<br />
<br />
If you write an SMS and press "hang up phone" button - SMS is not allways saved in the drafts folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Logical problems (few of them):<br />
<br />
To do some simple task takes many steps (button clicks) Siemens and Samsung have fewer, for example - to delete unwanted SMS message without reading it, to leave SMS message without saving it, to zoom picture, to unlock keyboard,&nbsp; if you don't want to save
 an SMS, even if it has no text - you must go to the meniu, scroll down, choose "exit" and confirm that you really don't want to save that empty message..<br />
<br />
Menu is not intuitive for non nokia user.<br />
<br />
Help tips in menu shows after ~1 minute. so if you have menu with 10 choices, you have to spend at least 10 minutes to clarify what those choices are for.<br />
<br />
If you create a group of contacts, you cannot select contacts and move them to that group, you must&nbsp; first select this new group, and then move desired contacts one by one - imagine doing that with 30 contacts! And after you move a contact to the group and
 go for another one, nokia returns to the start of the address book!!<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Lousy nokia - there were so many times, when i've wanted to throw that lousy phone in the wall, i'm sorry, that i didn't made that earlier :(((<br />
<br />
P.P.S.<br />
Sorry for my english, but I'm sooo frustrated, that i have no energy left to correct anything.<br />
And nokia - please don't say "thanks for your opinion"...<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>We currently have 599 users and it appears we are capped and can no longer add new users to the conversation without kicking some. Is there a way to unlock additional space for new skype users to join the skype conversation? We use Skype as a chat room for

            <p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's get this done by starting an application in Safe Mode. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hold down the CTRL key on your keyboard while opening the Office application. To ensure the application is in Safe Mode, check the title bar:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f0cd7e762-ecb1-4b08-b100-0e5afb87911f.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Use the /safe command line. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button and choose <strong>Run</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Type this command:<strong> excel /safe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to start Excel.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If you get a "can't find" error after typing the command, check if you included a space between the app name and /safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If the Office application doesn’t start in Safe Mode</strong>, the problem isn’t with add-ins. Check for incompatible or older device drivers and update them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Zeus virus scams</h2>
                    Since I have a Dell computer there's been a group that have been calling me. " Hello we're from the Dell technical support and we've noticed that there has been someone that has been trying to hack your computer so we need you to download some software
 updates. They are not updates they're just backdoors to give them access to my computer.&nbsp; And since I believed them the first time they will not stop calling me&nbsp;Then today I received an error message while I was online &nbsp;say that I have the Zeus virus on your
 computer so you need to call this phone number that was listed. I know&nbsp; if I call that phone number they're just going to want me to pay a ridiculous fee. What should I do? I'm running a thorough scan right now without any viruses appearing in the scan&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>The two issues are not related, but you better get rid of whatever "Dell" installed even if you have to reinstall Windows. For this issue.............</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's a common scam. Click the OK button at the bottom of the popup. You should then see a box Do not allow this site to create new messages. Check it and then close the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
If that does not resolve it, use the Task Manager to exit the browser. Reboot and see if the pop-up goes away.</p>

<h3> judy zhu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge with Blackbaud</h2>
                    <p>I use mail merge to create acknowledgement letters. The content of my Word letter template is exactly one page with footer and I have graphics and words in it. The excel data source are generate by Blackbaud a fundraising system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My challenge is every time if I have a record with extra long address, the extra lines will mess up the next/other letters. For example, the last few words of the first letter will be pushed to the next page and every time I have to manually 'fix" each letter
 by add or delete some spaces and this can be very time consuming when I have more than a hundred letters to edit.</p>
<p>

<h2>            The &#34;Suggested meetings&#34; plug-in on Outlook 2016 is failing on two layers.</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
Outlook 2016 correctly detects a suggested meeting in my email, but I get an error on the Suggested Meetings tab saying:&nbsp;<em>Sorry, we couldn't load the add-in because your version on INTERNET EXPLORER is not supported. Click "See Details" for a list of supported
 browser versions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
When I click on "See Details", I'm sent to an error page on microsoft.com:&nbsp;<em>Sorry, the page you’re looking for can’t be found.</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">
Most important issue I have with these connected errors is, Internet Explorer is the only supported browser for Outlook 2016? Even back in 2016 that was "a bit" outdated, wasn't it? :)<br />

<p>Same issue when using Office 365 Version 1708 (build 8431.2250 Click-to-Run) on Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1. I have IE UN-installed via Windows Features turn of utility. I use Chrome only and have that installed and up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I am running the desktop application and not a web app there is no reason why Outlook cannot talk between an email and it's calendar. This is a built-in function and should operate independently&nbsp;of any web browser.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a problem with my ribbon object<br />
In the onload callback&nbsp;I set a global variabel "myribbon" to the ribbon object<br />
It all works ok but if a error is thrown, all global variables is set to nothing and I need a way to get hold of my ribbon object again so that for ex the myribbon.invalidate can work again.<br />
Is there a way to find the ribbon object again?</p>

<p>I have a problem with my ribbon object<br />
In the onload callback&nbsp;I set a global variabel "myribbon" to the ribbon object<br />
It all works ok but if a error is thrown, all global variables is set to nothing and I need a way to get hold of my ribbon object again so that for ex the myribbon.invalidate can work again.<br />
Is there a way to find the ribbon object again?</p>

    <title>Outlook cannot connect to the Exchange server. Error code&#58; -18597 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> capcitydude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook cannot connect to the Exchange server.  Error code&#58; -18597</h2>
                    I am trying to connect to my company's Exchange server using Outlook 2011 (Version 14.4.8) on my iMac running Yosemite (version 10.10.2). &nbsp;I can connect fine to OWA by going to webmail.companyname.com and entering DOMAIN\username and my Password. &nbsp;Similarly,
 I can use the native Mail app on the Mac with no issues to read and send mail. &nbsp;Within Outlook, however, I am getting multiple error codes, with -18597 being the latest. &nbsp;I am using the "User Name and Password" method and have provided the full DOMAIN\username
 in the "User name" field. &nbsp;I have specified the webmail.companyname.com Server in the Advanced window and using the default port of 443. &nbsp;Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            <p>Try removing and re-adding the account and check if this helps to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Start Outlook. From the&nbsp;</span><span>Tools</span><span>&nbsp;menu, select&nbsp;</span><span>Accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.In the left column select the account you want to remove, and then click the&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;(minus sign) button in the bottom left of the window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.Click&nbsp;</span><span>Delete</span><span>&nbsp;when you are asked if you are sure you want to delete the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link to know how to add an Exchange account:</span></p>

            Thanks for the quick response, Joe. &nbsp;Unfortunately, neither option worked. &nbsp;If anyone else has any suggestions, please let me know. &nbsp;Again, I have no issues connecting to my work email using the native Mail app so I'm curious as to why I can't use Outlook

<p>i cannot access my onedrive through an invitation to a folder being shared with me, i've had access before with no problems.&nbsp; i also cannot add this email address to my desktop outlook (2016).&nbsp; i had no problems and suddenly my outlook wouldn't load at all,
 reinstalled many times and it works with my main office 365 login but i cannot add profiles (which i had before).&nbsp; i believe there is some conflict between the profiles but i cannot figure it out.&nbsp; any help is appreciated as i need to get to these files on
 the onedrive asap.&nbsp; here's a screenshot of the error:</p>

<p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>
<p>Seems that the screenshot was not uploaded properly. On this forum, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click <strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon to upload it again.</p>
<p>Additionally, the files shared from others won’t be synced to the computer. As a result, we will need to access it from the web. I wonder if you mean that you cannot access your OneDrive for Business on the browser. If so, can you access it directly (not
 through an invitation).</p>
<p>For the Outlook 2016 client issue, I suggest you open a new thread with detailed description on this forum because it seems to be different from the OneDrive issue, and it helps you get a quicker solution to the Outlook client issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>April</p>

<h2>            streaming problem of asha 210</h2>
                    
<p>hi! i just bought my asha 210 three days ago. i have been trying to watch videos from youtube but it always wont load completely. it would just be 60% loading then it would display "no response." i have spoken to the nokia customer service rep and she told
 me that the model does not support streaming, so i cant watch videos online. i dont get it. why would nokia have youtube app built-in the nokia asha 210 in the first place, if i wont support&nbsp; watching youtube video?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please somebody enlighten me.</p>

<p>I also got the same problem. Once I go to youtube and launch a video, the loading period doesn't go beyond 60% and the video does not load at all. This is so frustrating. Tricking buyers by putting a youtube icon and the phone does not suport video streaming?

<h2>            Adobe Flash Player 10 in Win 7 - lost access to Adobe Flash after running updates</h2>
                    
<p>Up until last week I was able to see Flash content on Windows 7, I ran updates and lost the Flash functionality.</p>
<p>I look in Control Panel, Programs, Uninstall a Program, I see Adobe Flash Payer 10 ActiveX listed as a program to unisntall.</p>
<p>When I look in Windows Explorer - All Programs, I don't see Adobe Flash Payer 10 ActiveX as a program.</p>
<p>I have tried the suggestions most often listed on the Forum, Downloaded the Uninstaller and Installer from Adobe and run as Admin.</p>
<p>I've tried using the Windows Internet Explorer 8 32-bit version, I've downloaded Mozilla Firefox and still don't have the ability to see flash video.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions as to what my issue with Flash could be and how to resolve it.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or suggestions</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That makes me think you tried to have Flash running on a 64 bit browser. That won't be possible: there is no Flash player for 64 bit Windows. You must use the 32-bit version of IE on your system.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Hans</p>
