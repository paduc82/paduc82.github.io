<p>So I took out my 1020 and 720 which have been in a drawer for a few years. After charging they connected fine. I checked the store and a couple of apps updated, my Microsoft account is connected and working fine and I got all my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I felt pretty good and was about to post this but decided to try a different device that was in my drawer for quite some time (over a year since I started it). It still had a charge, started but I got a similar error (not the same error code but similar
 and it would not let me into my account. I deleted the email accounts (leaving it only with my primary) and still no luck. So I performed a hard reset to see what would happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it hard reset then I began the setup. When I got to add my Live account, it said it can't connect. Interesting to say the least. I'm not sure why that is happening but I will try to figure it out. My initial belief is that something has been turned off
 on the Microsoft end. It cannot be the device because it was working and is not on a fresh start. Hopefully, I can work through it ... time will tell!</p>

    <title>5 things WP8 phones sorely lack - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            5 things WP8 phones sorely lack</h2>
                    &nbsp; 5 things WP8 phones sorely lack <br />
<br />
Is there a place where one can ask Microsoft to look at user requests rather than places where experienced users/mvp (to no fault of theirs) just respond saying something is available or not or show some roundabout way of getting something done?.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(have a Nokia 1520 fantastic hardware, call quality etc, software lacking basic things like below...but very stable)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5 things WP8 phones sorely lack<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) No convenient way (and QUICK) to switch between silent and vibrate and ring modes (and not have all 3 available at the same time too!). WP8 is great but sorely lacks these features<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound control (ring, ring+vibrate and silent ALL 3 not available at any given time. What is compromised by offering toggles and an additional sound mode? Why so much restriction on something so basic?
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(note: I know the workaround of going into ringtones and setting vibrate off to replace it with silent but that is not what I am asking for)<br />
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) True toggles for wifi, data, sound etc (sound shortcuts do not even exist)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the 'toggles' available through apps are nothing but shortcuts that require an additonal 2 steps (one to to get to the feature and then to exit it)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Call forwarding and gps on/off toggle would be another one desired. (not the location shortcut that one can place now using any of the several apps out there like system tiles, insider etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3) A third irritant is battery levels getting updated only every 1/2 hr or so (this is the percent level that one can get from apps)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The toggles and battery % extracts are restricted because of restrictions that developers cannot get by per their own app descriptions (several of them say the same thing)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the above have nothing to do with fancy apps like instagram etc. I am talking of basic features one might expect. Even so-called 'dumbphones' have access to such features like 3 ring modes. My Nokia 5310 had a meeting mode too where you could just get a beep
 for alerts (calls etc).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) In windows store, there should be a way as on Google Play to show which apps have already been installed and if updates are available for your downloaded/built-in apps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5) No proper file manager. The apps that exist say that they are restricted in what they can offer because of Microsoft restrictions. I can see the pain developers are in when they go to copious lengths to explain why they cannot offer XYZ. As far as users
 like me? forget it (yes I know the phone can be connected as a workaround to a computer but that is not what I am asking for...and yes Iphone does not have a file manager (although Android does have several)...so what? You would think something as basic as
 a file manager and intutive given Windows legacy, would be not be omitted while trying to dish up fancy apps like what is around you based on the picture you are taking...COME ON!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>As an aside, have yet to find a way to have a home page assigned to Internet explorer (it always goes back to the last page browsed)
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>one more thing (minor) would be a soft button (on screen) to lock the device rather than have to go to the power button always to do so.</p>

            Details! what is your system? which Insiders build? as this is the forum for testing newer builds of windows 10 before being released to the Public, and isn't a general support site for Public builds. Sounds like your display drive may need to be updated.

<h2>            All goes well with update BUT installed updates are not listed under update history</h2>
                    <p>This problem started with Build 10576 for PC.&nbsp; 10586 did not clear it up.&nbsp; Windows Update does all correct but does not display installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere recently that when this happens updates were installed;&nbsp; don't worry.&nbsp; Still on my mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did sfc /scannow and shut down and restart of update componnents.&nbsp; No problems found to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran update again.&nbsp; It took along time, about 4 minutes to run.&nbsp; Installed a defender update ok.&nbsp; But, not listed in update history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I started messing with this tonight I had an entry that showed Insider Hub installed.&nbsp; After messing around this entry is gone but I still have the Insider Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is Windows Update working ok but not displaying installed stuff???&nbsp; Can I live with this???&nbsp; Yes, but I'd rather not!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp; philav</p>

            I believe Microsoft has changed its mind on including Windows defender updates in update History in Settings-Update &amp; Security-Advanced Options-View update history. Build 10586 which looks to be build used by Microsoft for Threshold update this month does
 not show defender updates in view history either. I am not sure that defender update history was really necessary. I will not miss it.

            <p>I have already put into Feedback that the Windows Defender definitions were not included in the history.</p>

<p>In the seperate sheet, which would be a "report", I need displayed the top three company's name's. In this case it would be,</p>
<p>Company 1 - 1st (8 entries)</p>
<p>Company 2 - 2nd (6 entries)</p>
<p>Company 4 - 3rd (3 entries)</p>
<ul>
<li>1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd need to be displayed in order with the Company Name next to it.</li><li>The Company Name could change from month to month so no "standard" data can be obtained.</li><li>Totals of the results for&nbsp;top three companys may need to be&nbsp;calculated and shown.</li></ul>
<p>Is there a formula for this? Or multiple formulas that can be put together??</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Basically, you'd use an IF field in the header, coded along the lines of:</p>
<p>{IF{MERGEFIELD ConditionField}= "TrueCondition" "WaterMark Text &amp; ImageAnchor go here"}</p>
<p>If the Watermark is just text or an in-line image, you can simply insert it where indicated, between the double quotes. If it's a floating image, you'll need to change the horizontal layout alignment to 'left of &gt; character' and move the anchor so it's between
 the double-quotes Once you've done that, lock the anchor in place. Do note that you may need to need to re-position the image after this, so that it displays in the correct location when the merge executes; it's position when the field code is displayed isn't
 the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above example are created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practicable to add them via any
 of the standard Word dialogues. </p>

<h2>            How to prevent history from being deleted</h2>
                    I am a home user of Windows Vista and have come across an issue that I cannot find an answer to-&nbsp; How do I prevent history from being deleted- I am not referring to internet browsing history that deletes itself but the option of right clicking over a link
 in the history's tab and deleting the link.&nbsp; Are there step by step instructions to remove this ability?&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span>I wish to inform that you dont have the option to remove the delete option when you right click on the History link. It is designed by default when you right click the option to
 delete will be there automatically. There is no way to remove it. <br />
<br />
Hope it helps</span></p>

    <title>Some Arabic words with character styles applied display as Times New - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendrajones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some Arabic words with character styles applied display as Times New Roman instead of the underlying font Tahoma</h2>
                    <p>I have a document where the majority of the time the character styles (e.g., Bold, Bold/Italic)&nbsp;applied to text correctly use the underlying font of Tahoma. But, when the character styles are used in the first line of a bulleted or numbered list, the font
 on the character styles is Times New Roman. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All of the paragraph styles are based on the Normal style, which is set to RTL and the script font is set to Tahoma.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>95% of the time, Tahoma is used when a character style is applied. It is just in the first line of a bulleted or numbered list (e.g., step 1) where the font assigned is Times New Roman. All other bullets or steps in the list are ok. There is no style in
 the template based on Times New Roman.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have done the following:</p>
<p>Set the default script&nbsp;font to Tahoma.</p>
<p>Set the Language to Arabic (U.A.E.).</p>
<p>Deleted and reecreated the list styles&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deleted and recreated the character styles</p>
<p>Set the default printer to the Microsoft XPS Printer.</p>
<p>Set the character styles' complex script font to Tahoma.</p>
<p>Followed recommendations in this article (which may or may not apply): <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/font-gets-changed-to-times-new-roman-after-2-3/8b6a6128-1dee-4592-87ee-fa05745bd47b">

<p>Hit your Window key and W to bring up the search.&nbsp; Search for default and then choose Default Programs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>select Set your default programs and then locate the app or application (Word) you wish to use with certain files types from the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, you can select Set the program as default—to use this app or application for all possible associated file types—or click Choose defaults for this program to see a list of the possible file types you can associate.</p>

<p>I'm trying to re-install Carbonite to try to get my online cloud backup working again and bl**dy Windows "Smartscreen" (Or dumbscreen as it should be known) keeps stopping me installing it. It doesn't even give me the option to allow it to run, I just get
 a half drawn window with the don't run option clickable but no allow option available.</p>

<h2>            E-Mail Font When Using Snipping Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We defined our Outlook Body font as Calibri 11. When I take an image from the Snipping Tool and send it as E-mail Recipient (image placed in the body of the e-maill) the font is Times New Roman 12.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I attach the image then&nbsp;it's correct (Calibri 11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know why the E-mail Recipient&nbsp;is using Times New Roman 12 or where it's coming from?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>You may have already figured this out but just in case:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going crazy trying to figure it out too. I tried pushing some of the buttons and found that they didn't do anything. EXCEPT for number "1". Then I realized that is not a keypad. It's a field entry system for 9 sets of numbers that just happens to have
 a keypad-ish layout. You may have noticed that "1" looks a bit different. That's because it's ready for input first. Touch that box and a normal keyboard should appear. Thanks Microsoft!</p>

<p><span>As
</span><span>OneDrive for Business is online storage intended for business purposes</span><span>, y</span><span>our OneDrive for Business is managed by your organization</span><span>. Thus, it is an expected

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Can you add a group card (<a href="https://sway.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/432996-stack-and-group-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sway.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articl...</a>) in which you add the header and the text card?
<br />
<br />Alternatively you maybe could use the title + text card instead of header + text card.
<br />(<a href="https://sway.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/432992-title-and-header-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sway.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articl...</a>)

<p>Thank-you for the super swift response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both options but it doesn't appear to work. Which is strange because the first link you provided clearly states:</p>
<p>"except Group Cards can contain any type of Card. In other words, there are no restrictions when adding to a Group Card"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which I don't think is correct unless I am doing something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create a group and then add text cards but I don't have an option for a header card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create a group and drag a text card into it but I can't drag a header into it.</p>
<p>

<br />Have you tried playing around with the layout? (01.png) You can see it while previewing / playing the presentation.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ae11cac-fa6b-429f-bdc1-c9a857e90ef7?upload=true" />

<p>I have the "change layout" option in your photo above set to Slides as that is how I would like it to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this option is selected you can't have a header and text grouped which is strange because the following link has this passage of text..</p>
<p>"<span>When giving a presentation, you might want to use the
</span><span>slideshow<br />
</span><span>layout, where you move through the Sway frame by frame. In this layout you can group<br />
content to ensure it fits on one slide. "</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>https://sway.office.com/dJQCjmsXgGNXhl9g</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect I am doing something incorrectly as this seems fairly basic.</p>
<p>

            Okay so probably the layout you chose defines in which order Headers and texts will appear.
<br />Here are some example images on how the layout changes the positions of the headings and texts (scroll to Layout):
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2016/08/17/sway-design-tips-and-new-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/b...</a>
<br />
<br />Furthermore here is some more information in which it is said that different styles lead to different positions of the content:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sway-mso_o365brs/several-questions-from-a-frustrated-new-user/463eeab7-81b5-4118-8406-569ada8db8f0">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>
<br />
<br />Maybe the combination of style, layout position etc. leads to the unwanted positioning you experience.

<p>Thank-you for the effort you have put into helping but unfortunately it doesn't resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully understand the scalable nature of Sway and the benefit of it adapting to the display size, hence not fixing sizes etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that leaves it relatively unsuitable for serious presentations where you don't want pieces of information blending across screens or peeping in at the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Love the concept and its definitely suitable for newsletters or informal stories, but I think I may need to revert back to Powerpoint or Prezi for this particular presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has any suggestions I would really appreciate them.</p>

</p><p>You are correct that Heading cards cannot be grouped with other content.&nbsp; Content in Heading 1 cards will always appear on its own slide.&nbsp; Content in Heading 2 cards, however, will appear across the top of all slides following that Heading 2 card (until
 a new Heading 1 or Heading 2 card occurs).</p>

    <title>Windows Mobile 6 - Remove Programs is empty and cannot synchronize PDA - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mobile 6 - Remove Programs is empty and cannot synchronize PDA with computer...</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a HTC Touch Cruise Pocket PC with Windows Mobile 6.1.<br />
<br />
Several times i had the following problem that is only corrected by doing a hard-reset. Now it happens again and since i have a lot of things in PDA i would like to avoid more hard-resets.<br />
<br />
At this time, i cannot see any programs in the Remove Programs application (Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Remove Programs). The Manage Certificates aplication also do not show any certificate (is empty&nbsp;in 'personal', 'Intermediate' and Root' tabs). I also cannot delete
 files in the Storage Card since i am getting a "Access is Denied" when using the file explorer (but i can remove the files created by Word if i delete them inside the Word application).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When this problem occurs i also stop to connect to to ActiveSync (the connection always fails and i get a message to restart the device and try again). I cannot synchronize my PDA with my campany by Bluethoot or even by USB. i also cannot install any application
 for backup since the installation always gives me an error. <br />
<br />
This problems did happen to me at least 5 times in a year period. One of the times was when i was doing a bluethoot syncronization (then i tought that i shall do by USB in order prevent this issue) but this happens to me later again. It seems to be something
 related with Policies and some kind of change that ActiveSync can do with Policies.<br />
<br />
The first 3 occurences occured when my PDA has Windows Mobile 6 but now i am getting the same with 6.1.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion in order to correct this? I read in another Forum that some other people are getting the same issue (HTC and not HTC people), so this seems to be an error in the Windows Mobile OS.

            Well I might strongly consider a hard reset at this point in time

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to remove the YouTube app that came with the phone today, but my Remove Programs list only had the 3 programs I installed since the hard reset. &nbsp;Should I do another hard reset, or is there another possible issue with it.</blockquote>
If the YouTube application was "pre-installed" then you cannot remove it ... it is embedded in the ROM
