<h2>            Maps App for Windows 10 Not Working</h2>
                    I tried the new map search on Windows 10 and the map won't display. A marker appears in the window after a search, but no map. How do I get the map to show up?&nbsp;The apps Location setting is turned to ON. And it looks like there is a small map of my area
 that shows up on the live tile, but not when I open the app.

            <p>Windows 10 Maps will use an Offline cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the cache (locally downloaded and stored files) is empty, as in first use, or corrupted, Maps may not display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If new (empty cache) it may take a minute or more for a download to fetch the map data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the cache is corrupted, you may get gaps in the display or Aerial maps not displaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Settings &gt; System &gt; Offline Maps to select your region, download the maps, set update options, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just had a couple of days of poor download speeds, and the cache became corrupted on one of my computers. Aerial views would not show anything except the location symbol. I needed to delete the downloaded maps and restart Maps to get it working again...
 then set the download maps to rebuild the local cache.</p>

            Thanks for the suggestions. I downloaded some maps and it works better. Only now when I search for driving directions it says that it "could not find any driving directions between these two places." I use my phone for driving directions in the car, but
 if I'm going somewhere new, I like to view a map first and choose a route before I leave, so I have a visual in my head. It isn't precise with "my location" either. Is the app unable to pinpoint smaller towns?

<p>It's a wireless network location limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so many years back, we used GPS satellites for geolocation. Civilian accuracy is about 10ft (3 metres).</p>
<p>Mobile phones often do not have GPS receivers in them - they use triangulation from phone network towers. Satellite GPS is usually more accurate and reliable than phone network&nbsp;location&nbsp;in open country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In small towns the distance to phone radio towers may be far with not many in between. If you are driving, your phone is constantly registering itself with the phone network and it is auto-switched between towers as you move and as network loads change.
 Your mobile phone network is tracking you so that it may switch you to another tower as you move.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Map Location on a phone when you are driving is not going to be very accurate in regions where there are not many phone towers. If your phone has satellite GPS - try using that as well as network location. There are pros and cons. Phone networks are
 probably better than GPS in most cities. Small towns: satellite GPS may be better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using wireless&nbsp;network Location to a phone, whilst driving ?.... amazing it works with any accuracy at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Ian</p>
<p>PS: when I use wireless Location with a 3G unit alongside my Surface Pro it gives me about a 10 to 50metre accuracy; occasionally the wireless network drops and Location has placed me well over a thousand kilometres away where the central exchange is for
 the network provider... an Australian phenomenon... big country; few mobile&nbsp;network providers. Have not yet tried to get my Bluetooth GPS unit working&nbsp;with Windows 10 Maps</p>

            <p>I read that the new Maps app for Windows 10 was made in collaboration with Bing Maps. So I went to Bing maps, entered my address, &amp;&nbsp;received a pinpoint location.&nbsp;I then entered it as a favorite &amp; logged off of Bing search. Next, I went to Maps in Windows
 10, entered my address (again)&nbsp;and<strong> now </strong>I receive pinpoint location. Next, I searched for directions to a certain destination, and it worked! Oh, and I also turned on location service for Search, which I think is for Bing Search or Cortana?
 Glad it is working. Never had a problem before with using other map services&nbsp;in receiving pinpoint&nbsp;location and driving directions. (FYI the Location setting for Maps has been on since the start.) This is for my PC.&nbsp; On the other hand, map services while being
 mobile are a different experience. I understand the whole 4G, 3G or No G services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

            <p>Glad to hear that things are now working better for you. Do you get the driving directions error for any place or just in specific cases?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that it may not pinpoint your location accurately is a known issue the team is looking to improve and it is usually worse on PC's since the accuracy of location for cable or&nbsp;WiFi is lower than cell towers or GPS usually available on phones.

<h2>            slow wi-fi using internal dell network card</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Asking for help in diagnosing and solving a problem with slow wi-fi speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell desktop running Windows 10.&nbsp; Spectrum internet.</p>
<p>Using wired connection to Spectrum router, getting almost 400 Mbps download speed.</p>
<p>Using wi-fi with Dell 1705 internal adapter getting less than 5 Mbps.</p>
<p>Other devices getting 80-100 over same wi-fi network.</p>
<p>Tried a USB adapter (Linksys USB6400M-RM2) and getting same symptoms. (download speed &lt; 5Mbps) on both 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands.&nbsp; (Internal card only discovers the 2.4 band.)</p>
<p>I have tried eliminating all other devices from the wi-fi network, and I do not think there is interference from other devices since I get much better speeds with Windows 7 laptop and Chromebook over same network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It appears that router is working as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to diagnose?&nbsp; Is my network card defective?&nbsp; Is there a setting in my desktop that is restricting the download speed using the internal card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />The first thing I would try to do is make sure windows is fully up to date. 
<br />
<br />After that, you can try to reset your network settings. This will take everything to default and re-install drivers. 
<br />To do this open settings -&gt; network &amp; internet -&gt; network reset -&gt; reset now
<br />This will make sure there is nothing on the computer settings that would be limiting the speed. Your computer will restart and you will have to reconnect to the network. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then I would try installing the driver direct from the manufacturer. In case Windows is downloading an incorrect driver.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Its possible you might need to update your BIOS and chipset driver to improve performance.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the following for the extremely helpful suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>franco d'esaro,</p>
<p>Andre,</p>
<p>Thagstrom, and</p>
<p>Linksys support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a variety of the recommended suggestions and also spent about an hour on the phone with Linksys tech support, who made every effort to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We never were able to improve the wifi speed using either the installed dell 1705 wifi network card or the linksys usb adapter, although the Linksys usb adapter (WBUSB6400M) worked very well with other devices and provided both the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an older Netgear range N extender (WN3000RP) with ethernet output, and I thought I would give it a try.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; After I set up the extender I connected my pc to it using the ethernet port and was able to get ~75 download speed.&nbsp; This solves
 the immediate problem, and I will monitor results for a few days.&nbsp; &nbsp;I only have the 2.4 band, but it is satisfactory for my needs.&nbsp; The setup is now Spectrum modem (wired)&gt;Spectrum router (wireless)&gt;Netgear range extender (wired)&gt;pc.&nbsp; I have disabled the pc
 wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still do not know for sure what the problem has been, but I expect that my installed dell 1705 card is defective in some fashion.&nbsp; I am happy with the results for now, and perhaps later I will look into replacing the installed internal network card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the folks using this forum and being so generous in sharing your knowledge.</p>

            <span>Have you tried connecting wirelessly to the Extender range network using both the internal wi-fi adapter and the Linksys USB wi-fi adapter?</span><span>
</span><span>Otherwise, try to disconnect all other devices connected to the desktop PC either via USB or LAN and remain connected only in wi-fi to the router network or to the Range Extender network.</span>

<p>thanks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I am connected via ethernet to the 2.4GHz band on the range extender, which is connected to the local Spectrum router via wi-fi.&nbsp; This is a convenient setup and it is working well for now--getting 75 down and 20 up.&nbsp; Eventually I will try to figure
 out if my installed, internal, Dell 1705 wifi card has some kind of defect.&nbsp; I am not using the USB adapter, which worked well with other devices, but did not speed up the wifi connection to my pc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just got an email saying they couldn't bill me for the 3 month 60% off deal they was doing in September before/after Gears of War 3 was released and they charged me money again and I already paid the first time, I even have the statements for that month
 too on my Paypal history. Is it possible to get a refund?&nbsp; Because this isn't right and unfair.</p>

<h2>            Finally broken.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox fans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have recently decided to give up on Xbox this morning. I have been a fan since the original xbox with NFL fever. This morning, I got up to make sure I was not missing E3 you know waiting for the announcement of Mass Effect 4 and possibly some information
 on the next Halo game. Only to find out my xbox one would not load up, and the screen eventually turned black. I looked up some information online, and eventually called xbox one technical group. He was a nice guy but end up telling me that the console has
 to be replaced and that it will cost me 115.00 dollars. Now, for me this is upsetting because I was renting the xbox one and just paid it off with the retailor on this past Thursday. I have an xbox, 2 xbox 360's and now the xbox one or had the xbox one. I
 cannot afford another to pay for a new xbox. I really am broken over this. I just played destiny last night or early this morning with my friends. Now I cannot. Now I feel like a fool. So, many of my friends told me not to go down that road. Now, I wished
 I have listened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, try leaving the Xbox powered on and at the black screen for at least an hour, it may boot up fine. Lots of people have had the same issue and that seems to fix it in a majority of cases.</p>

<p>Or a hard reset. Once the console is on,turn it off via the power button on the front &amp; unplug it from the mains for 5 minutes.Plug it back in &amp; switch it on &amp; see if that works.</p>

<p>at least urs worked right for awhile. always liked the playstation, but when i heard no backwards compalibility, and seen xb1 did well i got xb1 instead, what a HUGE mistake this was. from day 1 problems with controllers to optical drive not reading dvd's
 blue rays or even games. then looked the problems up, and was blown away at the many other people with the same problems, take a look around this and other boards, always same answers and usaully ending in same answer 'send in and pay for it to be fixed'.
 i can't play the 360 games i have on disc due to optical drive, and the ones that do can't enjoy because controller drifts or just stops conecting, even inputting this post is taking so *** long because controller. and now they releasing a newer console before
 fixing what's wrong with older models. thats just a slap in the face. weather at wal mart or overhearing i know i have stopped people from making the same horrible mistake. and i will continue to do so as much as i can. its a *** shame when a used older xbx
 360 works better than a 5 month old xbx1. good luck to u, and have a good day</p>

<p>^^ If your console had issues since day one why didn't you take it back to the store &amp; get it exchanged or a refund??</p>
<p>Failing that it would of been in warranty so sending it of for repair would of been free.</p>

<h2>            Safely remove hardware notification shows internal hard drives</h2>
                    My sata hard drives are shown in the "safely remove hardware" icon list and among "devices".<br />
<br />
I would like them not to show in this list, as they are obviously not removable.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7, I did a registry fix to solve this problem as here, second post down:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/my-internal-sata-device-appears-in-devices-and/722221d6-d59c-4cf7-803c-8203e6344b93<br />
<br />
However, this does not work in Windows 8, as it seems the registry is different.<br />
<br />
Is there a similar fix that works in Windows 8?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the internal SATA drives show in the notification area when you go to remove an external drive safely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try these methods to check if the issue gets resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Update BIOS.</p>
<p>Please contact the system manufacturer to update the BIOS.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your
 computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Update chipset drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please visit the system manufacturers website and download and install the latest chipset drivers for Windows 8.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to use the forum for any other Windows questions you may have.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Yes, the internal SATA drives show all the time in the notification area to remove an external drive safely.<br />
<br />
The computer is own built: motherboard Asus P5q Deluxe, cpu Intel Q9650, gpu GTX 470, ram G Skill 8Gb ddr2, hard drives, Intel 520 120Gb, Samsung 160Gb and Samsumg 320Gb.<br />
<br />
I am using the latest BIOS update:<br />
<br />
Brand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American Megatrends Inc.<br />
Version&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2301<br />
Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 07/10/2009<br />
<br />
As for chipset drivers, the latest offered by Asus are for Windows 7 64bit dated 2009. I tried to install these, but it said unsupported operating system. I also tried installing Intel Rapid Storage Technology, but this caused the system to hang on reboot.<br />
<br />
So, I assume there is no solution to this problem in Windows 8?<br />
<br />

            We need a fix for this problem from someone who knows the Windows 8 registry.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 it is possible to set the SATA channels to "Treat as Internal Port".
<br />
<br />
Surely this can be done in Windows 8 also?<br />

            <p>Microsoft needs to add an interface option&nbsp;to&nbsp;disable hot-plug per drive (someone log this request up the chain please).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up until recently, installing Intel RST drivers&nbsp;made internal SATA hard drives register as fixed drives. Problem solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;Intel have dropped support for older&nbsp;SATA controllers for Windows 8.1, which means that&nbsp;installing Intel RST&nbsp;may not be an option for many users (especially those with P5Q motherboards which have&nbsp;a controller that is no longer supported as of the
 latest driver pack). Apparently, Intel thinks the 8.0/8.1 transition is the ideal time to hit users for a motherboard upgrade, even though Microsoft intends it as a minor update!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Windows runs OK without the Intel drivers, there are problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal hard drives can only be protected with BitLocker to Go and cannot be automatically unlocked when the system boots. This is a big problem!<br />
</li><li>Windows Media Player&nbsp;displays some (smaller?)&nbsp;internal hard drives as portable music players for syncing. This can be disabled in Device Manager, so no problem.<br />
</li><li>It is all too easy to accidentally disable an internal hard drive while ejecting a USB thumb drive or similar. Irritating, but probably&nbsp;not fatal for most systems.</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8e054781-41e5-44b5-8b8c-323b9e61611d"><font color="#0072c6">luceberg</font></a>&nbsp;I do not know why your system could not take the Intel RST. Did you install the latest Intel Chipset INF&nbsp;pack
 first? It's a pre-requisite. Download them from Intel directly to get the <em>latest</em> version of the INF pack and the
<em>second latest</em> version of RST (check the readme file to make sure your controller is covered).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this time, I do not know if Intel's driver policy stands in the way of a successful upgrade to Windows 8.1. The actual controller driver for P5Q (in the Intel&nbsp;INF pack)&nbsp;is Windows 8.1 certified, but the RST package is not. It may still work, for all we
 know.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, this is normal if your Bios is set for AHCI Mode for the SATA Drives and not IDE....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When in AHCI Mode, the drives are Hot-Swappable, and this makes it possible to "EJECT" them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My machine is like this regardless as to whether I have Win 7 or 8 loaded....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Reg Fix you mentioned is for an entirely different issue I think...</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with sata being confused with esata....</p>
<p>It is intentional for the purpose of hot-swapping drives...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me awhile to get used to it also....</p>
<p>Just Customize your Taskbar so that the icon isn't visible all of the time...</p>

<div>That's exactly what is annoying me. How do you stop Windows Media player treat hard drives as removable? Cause when i open it up it keep indexing all video/photo/audio files forever. You said this can be disabled in Device Manager.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have 2 SATA internal hard drives connected and they show up in "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media". I accidentally ejected my second hard drive once or twice, instead of the USB flash drive. They run in AHCI mode, with the settings for SATA Ports
 0-1 to run in Native IDE mode (instead of Legacy IDE).</div>

<div>I am running Windows 8.1 Pro on a Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3L with ICH9 SB chipset. I can't install and run any Intel Rapid Storage or Matrix Storage drivers.</div>

<div>I tried the Win 7 registry fix. MSAHCI is now STORAHCI but the TreatAsInternalPort registry value doesn't seem to work in Win 8.1. This is getting very annoying.</div>

            <p>There is no 'msahci' in Windows 8 so solution you mentioned wont work,&nbsp; but there is another way, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\Parameters\Device look for value 'IgnoreHotPlug' open it and add hardware id for hard drive,

 the inability to open up windows programs. I followed the instructions online<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> when trying to repair the sound. All of the wires are intact, and are not

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know some information about this issue.</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error code or error message?</p>
<p>2. What all <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/see-which-windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try uninstalling the Volume Manager and restart the computer. Once after restarting the computer try re-installing the program and check if it helps. This issue might also cause due to file corruption in the Volume Manager program
 file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Uninstall or change a program:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Install a program:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you sort out the issue.</p>

            <p>Tip: Stop thinking about <em>sound</em> volume &amp; start thinking about <em>computer</em> volumes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;QP&gt;</p>
<p>The highest level of organization in the file system is the volume. A file system resides on a volume. A volume contains at least one partition, which is a logical division of a physical disk... A volume that contains data that exists on one partition is
 called a simple volume, and a volume that contains data that exists on more than one partition is called a multipartition volume.</p>
<p>&lt;/QP&gt;<br />

            <p>Thank you for your attempt to help, but none of those suggestions worked.<br />
<br />
The printer is already connected to the same computer via USB and works fine for Windows printing.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;our core product we use is DOS based and requires any USB printer to be mapped to an LPT port.<br />
<br />
I've been using the NET USE command to accomplish this and never had&nbsp;trouble&nbsp;with Win95, Win98, Win2000, WinXP, or Win7 in the past.</p>

            A few&nbsp; comments:<br />
<br />
I assume that your second command was an attempt to delete the connection ... but (a) you forgot the colon after LPT1 and (b) according to
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490717.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a>, you should use /Delete rather than /D (although I wouldn't be surprised if /D really does work).<br />
<br />
This syntax is confusing to me (I haven't tried it)<br />
<br />
<blockquote><strong><em>DeviceName</em> </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong>: </strong>
Assigns a name to connect to the resource or specifies the device to be disconnected. There are two kinds of device names: disk drives (that is, D: through Z:) and printers (that is, LPT1: through LPT3:). Type an asterisk (*) instead of a specific device name
 to assign the next available device name. </blockquote>
<br />
That is, if you use the command<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net use * <strong>\\</strong><em>ComputerName</em><strong>\</strong><em>ShareName<br />
</em>I don't know whether the "next available device name" will be a drive or a printer<br />
<br />
<br />
You might take a look at the the ports in use (click on any installed printer, then click "Print Server Properties" at the top of the Devices and Printers window, and then select the "Ports" tab.&nbsp; It may be that some other installed application has already
 grabbed LPT1: (on my Win 7 computer, that would be Quicken, which installed its own pdf printer on LPT1:).&nbsp; BTW, Quicken's use of LPT1: is NOT revealed by the net use command because it is not a network resource.<br />

            <p>I encountered this same issue (inability to restore the connection after deletion, error 85, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much searching, I came across a suggestion that Adobe Drive might be the culprit; uninstalled that and *bingo* all is well again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you type "NET USE LPT1" (no arguments) and it returns "remote Name \\ADVirtualDisk\???", then that's the problem.</p>

<h3> felio&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applications trying to write files get the &#34;Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the items&#34; error</h2>
                    It only happens with some applications. Firefox and Steam (the gaming application), for example.<br />
<br />
It used to happen very consistently whenever trying to download a file with Firefox, regardless of which folder I tried to save the item in. Turning off UAC helped. It happens anyway from time to time, however. I can usually just download the file again to
 the same place, and it works fine.<br />
<br />
With Steam, it happens 100% of the time when it tries to update. I'm in the process of troubleshooting with them, but I strongly suspect there is an underlying problem related to Windows. I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.<br />
<br />
It may be relevant that all of my folders have the blob (not a checkmark) in the "read only" box.
<br />
<br />
There have been no recent changes to my computer.<br />
<br />
I've tried:<br />
<br />
Creating a new user profile. The issue persists for that user as well.<br />
Using the attrib command from the command prompt to reset folder properties.<br />
Running the System File Checker (no errors found).<br />
Taking ownership of the folders.<br />
Ensuring that I have full permissions with the folders.<br />
Right-clicking to run the applications as admin.<br />
Checking to see if the applications are blocked.<br />
Trying it in selective startup mode (Microsoft services only, no startup applications).<br />
Reregistering the Windows Installer.<br />
<br />
My only antivirus software is Microsoft Security Essentials. I've done full scans. It's prompted me with no warnings.<br />

            Hi,
<div>Do you face the same issue while downloading from Internet Explorer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to try the steps in the article and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>"Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file" error when you try to install, update or start a program or file<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2669244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2669244</a></div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> There is a chance of data loss if any files are infected and which may be deleted in the cleanup process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue is not resolved I would suggest you to 
backup&nbsp;the files&nbsp;and run an in-place upgrade to fix the permissions.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span>
 An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system. Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through
 this process.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 keeps changing my default printer settings, how do I stop it&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 7 keeps changing my default printer settings, I'm using a large format HP Designjet T610 and print anything from A0 to A2 size in colour, but I need the printer to default to A1 as that is size we use majority of the time, I can change size manualy
 when I need to.<br />
<br />
Windows keeps saving last size used as the default everytime I print, so the next time I go to print a drawing I have to check the printer settings again and usually change them back if I printed anything unusual.&nbsp; This doesn't seem to be a HP driver issue,
 as I have another large format plotter made by KIP, used for black and white drawings from A0 to A3, and Windows does the same thing to that as well.<br />
<br />
I have been searching for solutions to this problem but It only seems to be mentioned in passing on other forums, its possible that people aren't aware of it as you would have to be printing documents out at A0-A2 to notice the problem, limiting it to a smaller
 group of users.<br />

<br />
The printer/driver doesn't seem to have any problems, prints fine, i just need it to stop windows saving the last settings used to print, that is after all the point of setting up your printer preferences to start with.<br />

<p>I am having this same issue with Windows 7.&nbsp; It was previously not a problem, but now it won't duplex without a bunch of clicks.&nbsp; This is a real pain.&nbsp; I have macros set to buttons for our "less tech-savy" employees (i.e. most of them) and one button click
 will print 15 different documents.&nbsp; That really eats a lot of paper when the realize that it printed single sided, then try it again with the same result, then print them all manually anyway.</p>

            I think this applies to your situation.
<blockquote><a href="http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/default-printer-changing-its-own-14274.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">One</a> of the little-known features of Windows is that the default printer can be set to automatically change based on the
 network you're currently connected to. In some cases this can be useful, but if you're constantly switching between networks – for example, if you use your laptop at work and at home – it could become an annoyance. To prevent your default printer from changing
 on its own, disable the feature in the Windows Devices and Printers folder. </blockquote>
I encountered the same situation and did what the website said. My problem was solved now. Here's is snapshot of the setting.

            <p>why did windows remove the feature to set default printer?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem appears to be a windows update which removed the ability to set default printers and instead always reverts to the last printer used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>set default printer use to work however now we are told to go to "manage default printers" tab, and it is not visible in my win7 pro issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if we print an invoice on one printer and a label on another printer we are constantly changing back and forth to the intended printer, instead of just changing 1/2 of the time to the label printer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Network Security</h2>
                    <p>Windows networking is the greatest of all IT-related pains I have ever come across in like thirty years of using PC's and why I am in the process of going all Mac (just have the one Windows machine left in the house, and yup, it is the problem here).&nbsp; That
 machine does not allow data in or out, I get that message related to some network password (or maybe home group password - my mind is turning to jello here).&nbsp; It is not my WiFi password (I can just see someone suggesting I find that out, lolol), or the home
 group password (that is easy enough to find out), Windows 7 wants something else altogether and I have no idea what that is (clicking around online, seems like a lot of people have this terribly annoying problem with Win 7). I want to be able to transfer files
 back and forth between this machine and others on the network, when I go to computer/network, I can see two other machines, I can navigate the files on those machines, from the Win 7 machine, all day long;&nbsp; if I were to navigate to a file on one of those machines
 on the right R, then right click to drag it to the Windows machine in the L pane, as soon as I get past the bar separating the L and R panes, as soon as I am into the L pane where I am trying to drop the file into the Windows machine, I get that red-coloured
 circle with a red slash through it (meaning NO CAN DO this operation).&nbsp; At that point I also get error pop up from Win 7, it is as follows:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Security</p>
<p>Enter Network Password</p>
<p>Enter your password to connect to:&nbsp; *name to the computer I am trying to transfer a file from*</p>
<p>*Box to type the password into, with the name of the Windows machine above it*</p>
<p>*checkable box* Remember my credentials</p>
<p>The next line gives me the option of using another account</p>
<p>*error "x"* . Logon failure:&nbsp; unknown user name or bad password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this "network password"?&nbsp; It is not the&nbsp; homegroup password, I tired that;&nbsp; there is a setting, inside of view network connections/advanced, that deals with this network password business, I unchecked that (require network password, or not), makes
 no difference.&nbsp; I do not want security, I want ease, how do I disable this network password busilness? (or figure out what it is supposed to be).</p>

            I didn't really think it was a matter of setting up a home group on the Windows machine, judging by the nature of the error, but I went through the motions anyway and no change, I can allow anyone I want and uncheck the option to require a password, it
 still just keeps asking for this mysterious network password (mysterious, since no one is suggesting where to find this password).&nbsp; From a Mac machine, connections to the Windows machine just fail.

<p>I didn't say anything about setting up a HomeGroup nor do I recommend that anyone do that.&nbsp; In fact, in the "Answer" at the first link I provided, you'll see this (emphasis added):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span>On Win7, go to Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Network and Sharing Center. Click on "Change advanced sharing settings".
<em><strong>You do not want to be using Homegroup.</strong></em><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As Cmdr Keene says, it's the password of an account on the machine where the files are.&nbsp; The link I gave you suggested that you set up an account on the target machine with the same username and password as an account on the Windows machine, but that's not
 strictly required.</p>

            Didn't make a difference, home group set up or not, and I did those other things.&nbsp; Telling me it is a password on the Windows machine helps me in no way whatsoever, if you know what this password is and how to get to it maybe . you can elaborate on that.

<h2>            Skype credit and Office 365 subscription</h2>
                    I have Office 365 Home subscription. One of its benefits is 60 mins of calls to landlines and mobiles. I can see the subscription in my Skype account but can not make calls to landline or mobile numbers (in Finland). What's the problem? &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>The free 60 Skype&nbsp;minutes from Office 365 only cover calls to landline numbers in Finland. To view the countries covered by the subscription, please refer to this link:

https://www.skype.com/en/offers/office365/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have checked here, you do not have call attempts to landline number in Finland, mostly are calls to mobile numbers. You can try to make a call to a landline number in Finland again and if did not connect, let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to continue making calls to mobile numbers in Finland, you can add Skype credit on your account or purchase a subscription.</p>

<h2>            BDS due to irql not less or equal, ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    With the previous version of Windows 10 I saw BDS approximately once per month, and the reason was "irql not less or equal" and ntoskrnl.exe (in accord with Nirsoft BlueScreenView). I made the anniversary update today in the hope of an improvement of this
 driver. However, I obtained BDS at the same day. There was no such problem with Windows 7. Is there any possibility to overcome these BDS-s? If it helps I can provide the dump file, output from BlueScreenView or any other info.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Could you please mention the updates that you are trying to install?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. What Operating System is installed in your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the meantime, you may want to follow the steps mentioned below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Temporarily disable all security software and then try to install the updates, follow the steps mentioned below<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a><br />

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong> : Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access the link below and follow the appropriate steps mentioned in the Microsoft KB article and check if that fixes the issue:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>You cannot install some updates or programs<br />

<div>Since you haven't given complete details of the issue, I am just shooting in the dark.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.</div>

<h2>            Rainbow six Vegas and Vegas 2 inviting friends</h2>
                    
<p>When playing Vegas and Vegas 2, the system will not allow me to invite fiends to matches/ terrorist hunt/ co-op story.&nbsp;&nbsp;the only thing I can figure is that since there is no invite friends option in-game, it is not possible through back compact.&nbsp; I don't
 think how invites are sent through Xbox live via the friends list was worked out from a technical standpoint. Can someone either confirm this or at least let me know if this is a common issue.</p>
