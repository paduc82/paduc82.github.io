<h2>            Unable to connect to second monitor in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hours after my old Win 8.1 PC was appropriated and updated to WIN 10 without my permission my PC just went silent without any warning signs.&nbsp; I have a HP Z400 Work Station from Ebay that had Win 7 disks. After a couple of errors of about 6 hours I was successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Z400 has dual monitor&nbsp; capability. The second monitor was connected&nbsp; but it's blue light wouldn't go on so the red screen got an error because the software timed out waiting for the second monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I try to access my 8.1 's data from the cloud for this WIN 7 OS? Or Upgrade to WIN 10&nbsp; and then get the 8.1's cloud data for WIN 10?</p>

            <p>The new title/question was not my concern.&nbsp; I know that the missing blue light meant The monitor wasn't powering up for some reason. I was explaining why the install took so long.<br />

<h2>            Stop &#34;Disable apps to help improve performance&#34; message</h2>
                    <p>I am working on preparing a base image and&nbsp;group policy&nbsp;for an enterprise Windows 10 deployment.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am trying to prevent this message from appearing:&nbsp;

<p>All of the apps that is flagging as slow startup have a valid need to start with the computer (such as Skype for Business).&nbsp; I can go into Security and Maintenance and toggle the message to not appear however this is a step that could be overlooked on each
 setup.&nbsp; The checkbox is the "Startup Apps" box on Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Security and Maintenance\Change Security and Maintenance settings.&nbsp; The registry key that is modified when toggling the checkbox is a unique string.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The below Group Policy has no effect:</p>

<table>

<tbody>

<td><span>Remove the security and maintenance icon</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>There is a scheduled task Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\StartupAppTask that may be gathering the data however I am hesitant to disable this as I have not found detailed information on what other things it may be doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do enterprises prevent disruptive security messages from appearing to our users using standard management tools?<br />

    <title>PC won&#39;t display to TV or monitor after last big Win 10 update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k74smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC won&#39;t display to TV or monitor after last big Win 10 update. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Somewhere during the update process, my newer Samsung TV, which I use as my monitor, went black and displayed the message 'resolution not supported'. Without knowing that the update finished I couldn't even shut off my PC for fear of screwing up my PC further
 before having to leave for work. Anyways, today I borrowed an actual monitor and am only getting a 'no signal' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I figure maybe I could somehow fix the display settings from safe mode but apparently without a monitor or any recovery or installation usb drive (which I have no way to make at present) booting into safe mode is easier said than done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how to proceed from here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help and also to reiterate, my computer won't display to a screen. Any solution that involves using the mouse is a non starter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I forgot I had Chrome Remote Desktop installed. I can now navigate my computer through my phone. The display settings show my resolution at the usual 1920x1080. And now funnily enough, while uninstalling my integrated graphics display driver allows
 me to display to my TV again, when I then update that driver my PC stops displaying to my TV again. I don't understand why this is happening.<br />

    <title>Toggle external display hotkey not working if Dvorak keyboard layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukaszmichalak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toggle external display hotkey not working if Dvorak keyboard layout is set in Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Lenovo u330p laptop with Windows 8. </p>
<p>I discovered that when Dvorak keyboard layout is used the Fn+F10 hotkey (toggle external display mode) that should bring the "Choose a presentation display mode" dialog (the one that appears when &lt;Windows key&gt;+P is pressed), locks the screen instead (triggers
 &lt;Windows key&gt; + L action).</p>
<p>I believe the issue would appear on any other modern laptop with toggle external display hotkey, in which BIOS sends the scancodes for &lt;windows key&gt; + P instead of separate event/scancode for toggling display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only minor annoyance of course, but I believe that behavior of laptop hotkeys shouldn't be affected by change of keyboard layout. It's also possible that other keyboard layouts are also affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expected result:</p>
<p>- laptop hotkey brings the "choose a presentation display mode" selection</p>
<p>- pressing &lt;Windows key&gt; + P in Dvorak layout (i.e. pressing &lt;Windows key&gt; + R physical keys) should also open the presentation display mode selection</p>
<p>- pressing &lt;Windows key&gt; + L in Dvorak layout (i.e. pressing &lt;Windows key&gt; + P physical keys) should lock the screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Łukasz</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but I'm sorry, I don't see how this is relevant to the issue I'm seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wan't to use my laptop's multimedia key to switch the external display mode (mirror displays, extend display, only internal screen, only external screen), but there is an issue with it when a layout like dvorak or colemak is set in keyboard preferences
 - the multimedia key for switching display mode triggers completely unrelated actions in such case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A partial solution would be to somehow change the built in windows shortcut &lt;windows&gt;+p to &lt;windows&gt;+l, but a) I could not find a way to do it and b) it would break current shortcut for locking the screen. So it appears to be a bug in Windows 8 where keyboard
 layout change breaks the multimedia buttons on the laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

</p>
<p>The issue is confirmed with dvorak and colemak layout set in Keyboard preferences (i.e. physical keyboard on the laptop is QWERTY), &nbsp;I have checked a few regional keyboard layouts (Russian, Greek) and it is ok in these.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur when you plug in an external keyboard?</span></p>
<p>Since I don't have external keyboard with extra button to toggle external display mode I cannot confirm if the issue occurs in such case.
</p>
<p>Currently the problem is with built-in keyboard's 'multimedia buttons'.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Lukasz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur due to broken or out dated keyboard drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may access the computer manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest keyboard and chipset drivers for the computer. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if
 the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was already using the latest drivers available for my laptop so this doesn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually did some research on the issue and it turns out that the BIOS sends scancodes&nbsp;</p>
<p>0xe0 0x5b &nbsp;0x19&nbsp;</p>
<p>(that is &lt;left windows key&gt; and physical &lt;p&gt; letter key) when "external display mode switch" key is pressed.</p>
<p>In case of using dvorak layout the 0x19 scancode is interpreted as &lt;L&gt; letter key so the &lt;win&gt;+L shortcut is invoked that locks the screen, which is not desired behavior.</p>
<p>On my previous Windows Vista laptop the "external display mode switch" key sent a separate scancode that was handled by keyboard driver to trigger the correct action, but in current laptop such key simulates &lt;win&gt;+p keys pressed.</p>
<p>It appears that laptop/BIOS manufacturers are following your recommendation doing this (e.g. I have found a blog post about it here: http://www.advogato.org/person/mjg59/diary.html?start=243).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible workaround I see is changing the default Windows shortcuts, so that &lt;win&gt;+L changes the presentation mode instead of &lt;win&gt;+P, but I couldn't find a way to do this - perhaps you could point me to a right direction here on how to modify the shortcuts.
</p>
<p>Ideally the &lt;Win&gt;+P simulated keys press from the BIOS should be distinguished from user pressing the same keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Łukasz</p>

            <p><span>Hi Łukasz,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to change the default Windows keyboard shortcut keys, you need a programmable keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A programmable keyboard is a keyboard which can be configured to perform a variety of custom commands with the use of hot keys. Many keyboards
 have some degree of programmability, allowing users to set up several hot keys which can be used to access frequently used applications, but other keyboards have been specifically designed for programmable functions, with a range of potential configurations.
 Typically, a programmable keyboard is managed with a computer utility which can be used to record the desired commands.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A very basic programmable keyboard might have a row of buttons along a margin of the keypad which can be used to access favorite programs with
 one click. For example, the user might link the first button to an email program, another to a web browser, and another to a word processing program, allowing for quick access to these frequently-used programs. The keyboard may also have hot keys which can
 be used to magnify or reduce the size of an image on the screen, or to put the computer into a state of suspension or hibernation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you.</span></span>

 &nbsp;They happen randomly and it doesn't occur when I'm doing something specific. I uploaded my minidump files.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> reece coombes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Windows Hello Isn&#39;t avalable for all computers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been a lot of confusion over the much-anticipated Windows Hello feature coming to Windows 10. While Microsoft have been making out that it is a big feature of Windows 10, most of us won't be getting it... ever! Don't stall your upgrade though,
 Windows 10 still has loads of other great features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those of you who don't already know, Windows Hello is a sign-in method introduced in Windows 10. It uses Microsoft's '<strong>Passport</strong>' technology to not only log you in to your computer using advanced methods, but allows you to log in to websites
 and buy items online with these methods. These methods include fingerprint scanning, iris detection and facial recognition! However, only a tiny amount of us will be getting any of these features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, Windows Hello is only available for computers with a special "depth camera" which uses infrared sensors that are far better at figuring out who you are. For security reasons, unless you have one of these cameras, your computer will not have the
 option to use Hello. For some weird reason, even if you have a compatible fingerprint scanner, Hello is still unavailable for your computer in the form of fingerprint scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most new computers that are over £300 ($450 roughly) or so will have these special cameras. As will computers made in the last year or so (mid-2014 or later) that are very high spec. But always check that it has one before you buy a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Reece Coombes</p>

<h2>            Moving the location of one quick access folder also moves another</h2>
                    <p>My documents folder and music folder are somehow messed up. Whenever I move documents for example, the location of the music folder also moves and they both have the same name. Its so frustrating since I have no idea how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of the quick access folders</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cea29b4b-709f-4068-96f6-12a867744fdc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cea29b4b-709f-4068-96f6-12a867744fdc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I move the location of the documents folder, it also moves the music folder to that same location, and both folders are named "Documents".</p>
<p>If I move the music folder, the documents folder also moves to that location, and both folders are renamed to "Music". Its an endless loop I cannot escape</p>

 your OS? You can check it by pressing the <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>
R </strong>and type <strong>winver</strong>.</p>

<p>Hello. Apologies for the late reply. I've been busy recently</p>
<p>Yes, I was moving my folder locations to a different drive to free up space and then the problem occurred. After a day of tinkering with the registry I've managed to unlink the two folders so now its all good. Everything is as it should be. I am currently
 not at home so i could not verify the version of my windows.</p>

<p>Hello, how do you know your hard drive is causing your XBOX 360 to run slower, have you actually taken your hard drive off of your XBOX 360 and turned it on to see if it's actually running faster without it. If this is the case contact XBOX Support and try
 to a new hard drive sent to you, if you do not have a warranty it's cheaper to get a hard drive from a store like Gamestop or you can try eBay but be forewarned eBay actually has a lot of fake (not original XBOX 360 hard drives). Don't know why you think the
 update caused the XBOX 360 to go slower, it could just be normal wear and tear it could be the hard drive there's a bunch of different reasons but your XBOX 360 going slower because of an update is definitely not the case. Try another hard drive out.</p>

<p>Again, you said you hadn't touched it in more than a year, anything could happen to a console in a year without it being touched. Like I said normal wear and tear is totally possible, dust etc etc anything is possible. Suggestion stays the same try without
 a hard drive and see if it slows down, if to doesn't then get a new hard drive.</p>

<h2>            Potential windows update database error detected 0x80070490</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e45155d4-3a77-4ef9-a6c0-cf0a4d9d300d" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the response I get when I run the Windows update troubleshooter from the Windows 8.1 Action Center.&nbsp; If I click next it reports the errors have been fixed.&nbsp; However if I run it again it reports exactly the same errors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After searching the Internet I have found&nbsp;that several users have reported having this issue.&nbsp; As result of the aforementioned search I have tried the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Run the Fixit tool for Windows 8.1 located at: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) Run the System Update Readiness commands: DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth and DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth located at:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) Saved contents of C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 to a temp folder and then deleted contents of C:\Windows\System32\catroot2.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4)Renamed C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution.old</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5) Restarted Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6) Verified that C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 and that C:Windows\SoftwareDistribution folders had been rebuilt.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7) I then ran the Windows update troubleshooter from the Window 8.1 Action Center again and got the same response as listed above. The errors still exist and are not fixed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>8) Finally, I did a completely new clean install of Windows 8.1 and without installing anything else&nbsp;(no updates, no software, no antivirus) the above errors appeared within an hour of the install.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions&nbsp;that will help&nbsp;fix this issue will be of great help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. B</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue is not about a specific update or a particular knowledge base article.&nbsp; This issue is about why the Windows Update troubleshooter found in the Action Center identifies two problems (See image from original post).&nbsp; When I click "Next" the troubleshooter
 supposedly "fixes" the problems.&nbsp; I say supposedly because if run the Windows Update troubleshooter again it identifies the exact same problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;"<font color="#000000">third party applications or startup items are causing the issue" I think I covered that in step 8:</font></p>
<p>8) Finally, I did a completely <strong>new clean install</strong> of Windows 8.1 and without
<u>installing anything else&nbsp;(no updates, no software, no antivirus)</u> the above errors appeared within an hour of the install.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally,&nbsp;what I want is for the Windows update troubleshooter to run and not find any errors.&nbsp; Then I would have confidence that Windows update is functioning properly.&nbsp; At this point I feel that something is wrong with Windows update and my confidence in
 it is low.</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Dyer</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1a The computer was purchased 08/20/2009.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1b No. The computer came with Vista Home Premium 64bit installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2a Yes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2b Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit was installed 12/15/2013.&nbsp; (Upgraded from a Windows 8.0 Pro 64bit image, which was made&nbsp;before I installed Windows 8.1 Preview) This is my current configuration.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3a Windows update completes normally without any errors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3b Yes.&nbsp; The Windows update troubleshooter shows the same errors in the Windows 8.0 Pro 64 bit image.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4a For troubleshooting purposes I cleared a partition and did a clean install of Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit yesterday 01/03/2014.&nbsp; I waited about an hour after install and&nbsp;I ran the Windows update troubleshooter. The errors "Potential&nbsp;Windows Update Database
 error detected 0x80070490" and "Windows Update components must be repaired"&nbsp;were present.&nbsp; I deleted this clean install because the errors were present and not a result of something that I have added.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4b This was a clean literal Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit install.&nbsp; During the hour that I waited I did not install any updates, any software, or any third party antivirus software.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5a Yes.&nbsp; Avast14 (2014.9.0.2011) is currently installed.&nbsp; Never used any Norton or McAfee applications.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6 Yes.&nbsp; Norton free-trial was included with Vista Home Premium 64bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7a Windows Defender was disabled when I installed Avast14.&nbsp; Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7b&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Automatic updates is on, but is set to Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them. So far I have installed every update offered.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>8 This is the same computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>Are you using a computer with&nbsp;Windows 8.1 installed?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If so, does the Windows Update troubleshooter found in the Action Center complete without errors?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

Huh?&nbsp; How did you "delete" the clean install?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Have you done another clean install of Win8.1 since 03 January 2014?</p>

this thread</a>, Norton AntiVirus v21 beta was installed while you were running Win8.1 Preview.<br />
<br />
Were NAV and Avast both installed &amp; loading at boot back then?<br />
<br />
Assuming NAV v21 beta is no longer installed, did you uninstall the application then run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot?</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Dyer,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I deleted the clean install of Windows 8.1 Pro (done 01/03/14) by simply deleting the partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No, I have not done another clean install of Win8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No, the clean install was not done using a Win8.1 image.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No, I did not upgrade Win8.1 Preview.&nbsp; I upgraded my Win8.0 Pro partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Win8.0 was installed sometime in the spring of 2013.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes, all the updates you listed are installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The reason I ran the Windows update troubleshooter was because after my first upgrade attempt to Win8.1 Windows Update found two updates for my HP J4680.&nbsp; After installing a program that I later decided I did not want, I deleted the upgrade Win 8.1 partition.&nbsp;
 I then copied my saved Win8.0 partition and&nbsp;then upgraded to Win8.1 again.&nbsp; This time after the upgrade Windows Update never found the&nbsp;two updates for my HP J4680.&nbsp; This what led me to run the Windows update troubleshooter.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To be more clear, I have never run NAV v21 in Win8.1 final.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No, I would never allow two separate&nbsp;antivirus programs&nbsp;to be installed at the same time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have never installed NAV v21 in my current partition of Win8.1 final.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am glad to hear the Windows update troubleshooter is working somewhere.&nbsp; It gives me hope.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
Not sure I can&nbsp;even <em>begin</em> to understand the partitioning, deleting, installing, uninstalling&nbsp;&amp; copying you've done but...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume&nbsp;the two (2) updates were&nbsp;driver <em>upgrades</em> for the&nbsp;HP J4680 printer, yes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming it's still installed, is the HP J4680 printer working properly <em>especially</em> when printing in IE11 (or via the IE print engine)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is <strong>HP Printer Install Wizard for Windows v3.1</strong> (30 Sept-13) installed?</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Dyer</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes, I believe that they were driver upgrades for my HP J4680 printer.&nbsp; Whatever they were they are not currently installed because I have only seen them the one time and really did not pay much attention to them and that partition has long since been deleted.&nbsp;
 The fact that they have never shown up again is what&nbsp;prompted&nbsp;my investigation&nbsp;with the Windows Update troubleshooter.&nbsp; I suppose that if they are that important they will show up again in Windows Update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The HP J4680 printer is working fine.&nbsp; I have no problems scanning or printing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes I have run the HP Printer Install Wizard and it did not find any problems.&nbsp; The Test Print and Test Scan worked fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for the Windows Update troubleshooter errors, I now believe that&nbsp;they&nbsp;are the result of an unfortunate combination of old hardware(my HP laptop)&nbsp;and new software(Win8.1).&nbsp; I cleared a partition and installed the Windows 8.1 Enterprise Evaluation last
 night.&nbsp; There were no Windows Update troubleshooter errors immediately after the installation.&nbsp; I checked again about ten minutes later and the errors were present.&nbsp; The exact errors that are shown at the beginning of this thread.&nbsp;</p>

You will find support for Win8.1 Enterprise (Evaluation Edition) in these forums =&gt;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Did you run the Win8.1 Upgrade Assistant before you installed any version of Win8.1 on any/all partitions? Have you considered formatting ALL partitions and then doing one (1) clean install of Win8 (not from an Image) &amp; then upgrading to Win8.1?</p>

</p>
<p>I will take a look at the Win8.1 Enterprise forum.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No I did not run the Win8.1 Upgrade Assistant.</p>
<p>This is an interesting suggestion.&nbsp; I will have to give it considerable thought as this would involve seven partitions on two hard drives.&nbsp; I do not know if I have the resources to do this.</p>

    <title>Subtitles in videos in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leviathantheesper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subtitles in videos in Windows 10.</h2>
                    I've got some mkv videos with internal subtitles. In Windows 8.1 these files played smoothly with the subtitles in Windows Media Player. Now in Windows 10&nbsp;some of them don't show the subtitles. Not only Windows Media Player, the new video app does not
 show the subtitles either. This new app shows an option for activating captions but when I press it it crashes. What can I do?<br />
<br />
I've noted that the codec icons don't appear anymore when opening these mkvs.

I think he meant playing subtitles with video files in the new Movie &amp; TV app for windows 10. There is no right click function for a&nbsp;playback option but in windows 8.1 there was. This is something I'm concerned about as well, my wife is not an&nbsp;English speaker&nbsp;so
 all our movies need subtitles. Is there a solution for this?

            <p>To clarify the scenario, I think most users would have a separate mkv&nbsp;(or other) video file and a matching "srt" subtitle file. The bug is that neither the old Windows Media Player or the new Videos app is picking up the subtitle files on Windows 10. (The
 subtitle file should have the same name as the video file, except for the extension, of course). This has worked in all previous versions of Windows and media players. I tried it with mkv files only so far, not sure about the other formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip until Microsoft fixes the bug: install media player classic (bing MPC-HC), that one works as expected.</p>

            Rakesh. There is not a "Video" app, there is a Movies &amp; TV, as&nbsp;samblaze says. And Right clicking it does not show anything.<br />
<br />
Mic414, in my case there is no .srt, the subtitles are into the .mkv file. Some of them show just fine, other do not.

            I "Solved" it using Media Player Classic. I mean, it's not a real solution, I like the new video app, but it's discouraging when it doesn't read the subtitles of half of the videos well.

    <title>No internet connection after latest Windows Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgilostov  say:</h3>
<h2>            No internet connection after latest Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>The latest updates(cumulative update KB4467702 and some others with it) broke the internet on two machines for me. Both computers are connected through Ethernet. One through router, one through switch. I tried almost everything I could find as a potential
 fix and nothing worked:</p>
<p>1. Tried returning to the previous version of Windows, it gives me an error "Unable to go back...";</p>
<p>2. Manually uninstalled the latest installed updates that I could;</p>
<p>3. Running troubleshooting returns "Ethernet doesn't have a valid IP configuration";<br />
4. Updating/Uninstalling&amp;Reinstalling network drivers from Device Manager;</p>
<p>5. Fiddling in cmd. ipconfig /release and /renew return errors. /flushdns works but doesn't help.</p>
<p>6. Typing ipconfig in cmd returns a random IP address and no default gateway. Typing the addresses manually in IPv4 still doesn't make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't know what to do anymore. One PC has a fresh 2-day old Windows install and it's not gonna be the end of the world to reinstall, but those updates are gonna go through again anyway, and most likely so will the issue, so why bother?</p>
<p>The other PC was actually in the middle of migrating the OS to another hardware and has so many installed programs that it would be an incredible pain to reinstall and get everything back.</p>

            There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

The expectation among users should be that they will either need to upgrade to final release or reinstall their previous version of Windows after they have completed their evaluation of the Preview. Microsoft officials recently indicated the intention of having the preview releases support upgrades to the final version. This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM. With the excitement surrounding the arrival of a new major release of Windows and the more public approach to testing Windows pre-release version in comparison to previous releases under development, a lot of persons who are normally not exposed to beta testing are jumping in without hesitation.

            Hello Bevan,<br />
<br />
After upgrading Windows 10 to a newer version, you can free up disk space by using the Remove previous Windows installations option using the Disk Cleanup Tool. Deleting the "Previous Windows Installation" will not let you go back to the previous version of
 Windows. This option is only advisable if you are very sure that you do not want to rollback to an earlier version of Windows.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you will need further assistance.

<p>Hello Lambouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. It is possible to stream through the Xbox One by using Mixer. This will require you to play the game on the console instead of the computer. The article entitled, "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/mixer/broadcasting/broadcast-game-mixer-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Broadcast
 with Mixer on Xbox One</a>" contains information about how to complete this process. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

            Hi Noah.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if these help:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/why-did-my-file-open-read-only-3ab4b792-da50-4b38-8628-14c64e1f1d15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/why-di...</a>

<br />
<br />This can also mean User account corruption.  Try creating a new Local Admin account, sign into it, test if the problem persists.  If not move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then I'd  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Noah -
<br />
<br />So even when you create a new Local Admin account and sign into it the files are still read-only?  Try transferring some of them to the new account to see how they behave.

            Are your files backed up or are you able to back them up now?  If so make sure they are fully backed up to external hard drive, to Onedrive (5gb free) or Google Drive backup (15gb free).  
<br />
<br />Note that you can copy the files out from a Command Prompt using bootable media when Windows is not running and cannot enforce Read Only restrictions.  Use one of these methods:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then Open a Command Prompt by typing: command in the Search tab, click Command Prompt
<br />Type: diskpart and hit Enter
<br />Type: list disk and hit Enter
<br />Type: select disk # and hit Enter  (replace # symbol with number of Read Only disk from list disk results above)
<br />Type: attributes disk clear readonly and hit Enter
<br />Type: exit and hit Enter to finish the process
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work or puts WIndows into an unbootable state then you'll need to  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            What if MS bought Nintendo&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was just browsing Game Informer, and stumbled across an article about Nintendo looking at possible mergers and acquisitions. If true, should Microsoft merge the Xbox division with Nintendo? It wouod make sense for MS to make a move like this since they
 are making a play for casuals, kids and the living room. Thoughts, comments, concerns?</p>

<p>From an ignorant consumers point of view it makes a lot of sense to me. &nbsp;The only reason I stopped playing Mario/Nintendo games is because they are only on consoles that do not interest me.....At first I wondered why they didn't release their games on all
 the different consoles. &nbsp;Then I realized it would automatically crush their console sales. &nbsp;I assume Nintendo super fans wouldn't want this to happen.</p>

<p>Yeah I can't see this happening, though on the same topic Microsoft could use a Japanese studio.</p>

<p>Nintendo is looking for business partners not to be wholly bought out.. they are struggling now but have something like 10 billion in the bank and almost no debt so they are still strong enough to stand on they're own two feet.</p>
<p>It has been my opinion for several years that the same person responsible for making Nintendo a power house in the video</p>
<p>game industry has also become they're biggest downfall. Myamoto was a brilliant software designer but he should never</p>
<p>be allowed to have input on hardware ever again.. It has been one bad idea after another since the decision to make the</p>
<p>N64 cartridge based. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I like Nintendo, and I want to see it go third party. Seeing Nintendo merge with a company specifically, especially Microsoft, &nbsp;would be the worst thing that could happen to it.</p>

<p>I would love to see them focus on games....Preferably not merged. &nbsp; With that being said, I would also prefer them to merge with Microsoft than to stay as they are now. &nbsp;I will never buy a Nintendo console so I will never see a Nintendo game until they merge
 or go 3rd party.</p>

<p>Well it would suit MS after all Nintendo have released a poor console, the Wii U and MS have released a poor console the Xbox One. &nbsp;Also the only gamers Nintendo cater too are Casual gamers, just like MS. &nbsp;It would be the perfect relationship.</p>

<p>From a gaming perspective that would be wicked to see a Mario or Zelda game on the marketplace. I would have never thought to see a Sonic game on anything but a Sega console in the past but the poor guy has been thrashed around. In a business perspective
 i would love to see Nintendo say alright Microsoft and Sony you have had your fun and but we want our reign back and drop a meaty console which means "it's time for Nintendo to turn the sweat to blood".</p>

<h2>            Replace 32-bit Vista on Dell XPS 420 running Intel E6850 processor</h2>
                    <p>Dell XPS 420 has dual 3.0 GHz processors and has been a great home computer.&nbsp; Am having issues with lack of support for vista and compatibility with our other Windows 10 computers.&nbsp; Would like to upgrade to Windows 10 (or Windows 7) but have questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the Intel E6850 processor actually supports 64-bit (though am running 32-bit Vista now.&nbsp; Can I install a clean Windows 10 (64-bit) or Windows 7 (64-bit) on this computer.&nbsp; Any better solutions?</p>

            <p>Well, a clean install is your only option if you are migrating from Windows Vista to Windows 10. If you choose Windows 7, you have the option of performing a direct upgrade or clean install.

Windows Vista came to market in January of 2007 with a focus on security, making the PC easier to use and manage and providing a great user experience. In this article, we discuss some of the options users have going forward and what you should do before and after April 2017; if you decide to continue using Windows Vista. The decision to stick with Windows Vista can happen for a variety of reasons: application and hardware compatibility, nostalgia, inability to run later releases of Windows on existing hardware or it just works.">Windows
