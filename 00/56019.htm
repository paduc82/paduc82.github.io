<h2>            Elite controller - menu&#47;back&#47;select&#47;start buttons</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>just picked up an elite controller, and compared to my old xbox controllers the menu/back buttons feel very soft with no noticeable on/off position. Feel very mushy.<br />
</p>
<p>Is this as it should be or should they feel exactly the same as they do on a standard controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            Hi, as DerVaddi says they do feel different. Just been pressing my buttons on elite and normal controller. The elite does fell smoother and not as clunky as my normal controller.&nbsp;

<p>
Thanks for my answer in the end to remove the MacAfee&nbsp; I called them on a free phone number and the MacAfee rep who answered talked me through it all. He done exactly what you recommended. It's just all very&nbsp;new to me and thought if I disabled some other program
 and not know how to undo it. I just need more confidence but basically more knowledge.Ihave since put my windows firewall and defender on. The site's you surgested would I have to disable my window's defender, does it act like&nbsp;a third agent?&nbsp;Or&nbsp;can I&nbsp; use
 it for free to see if I have any viruses or trogon's and do they repair them again for free.It can't be free can it. My&nbsp;&nbsp;laptop beeps at random times very quietly it starts&nbsp; all diferent&nbsp; times this might tell me why thanks</p>

            sorry for being so dense. But I use them all in that order or pick one. This might have nothing to with the beeping but I stupidly downloaded a screen saver it was a beautiful fish tank. Then my comp just froze wouldn't do anything I had to just turn it
 off at the power button and not shut it down. then AVG told me&nbsp;after they&nbsp;scanned me. that I had 11 out of date drivers. Also that my trial &nbsp;had ended and I had to pay to get them to fix it ive since been able to turn this off and put windows fire wall and
 defender back on. I think I read somewhere that it could be over heating of a graphics card or mother board. Also my internet connection goes off more but this has only been happening in the past week, when trouble shot it&nbsp; it says its my wi-fi adapter but
 it fixs it

            <p>Is the computer still playing up, or has it now stared working correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you can use this Program too to scan for Malware, as it&nbsp;is not an Antivirus and does not cause cause conflicts with Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just make sure that you do not accept the pay for Trial option&nbsp;at the end of installation of it.</p>

            <p>hi it is still beeping, i downloaded what you recommended i just clicked on the link you left thank you for helping me. can i ask you how would i know if my network &nbsp;wi-fi adapter &nbsp;driver was up to date. I am asking this because when i first downloaded AGV
 it told me that i had 11 out of date drivers and i written them all down. One of them had something to do with the wi-fi adapter. Anyway when my internet goes off i just go to action center, troubleshooter, internet connection. When it has run its diagnostic
 scan it tells me that it had to reset the wi-fi adapter &nbsp;and their is a problem with the gateway access. My laptop did'nt always beep i am sure it started with that stupid fish-tank screensaver witch was about 4 weeks ago also can i say it even dose it when
 my laptop is on mute. I am on windows 8.1 hp where on my laptop can i find the beep coads or somewhere that i could ask it whats wrongMy dad brougth this laptop sometime last year never used it then gave it to me about 6 weeks ago so its not full or on storage.
 Any advice would be very welcomed also what is the little light next to the standby light [not the one near the button] the little one on the side it looks like three pieces of paper. Thank you</p>

            <p>Do not download drivers that any program you have installed tells you to.</p>
<p>They are mainly scams that can do more harm than good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why have you still got <strong>AGV</strong>? on your laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That fishtank screensaver is very likely to have Malware with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you installed, updated and scanned with Malwarebytes what were the results from that scan?</p>
<p>Did scanning with Malwarebytes find any Malware/Virus problems that needed to be removed?</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player will not Seek</h2>
                    <p>Windows7 Home Prem 32BIT\Windows Media Player 12</p>
<p>When playing back a DVD Movie, Media Player opens,&nbsp;seek feature&nbsp;works.&nbsp; Playing the Movie a 2nd time, the Seek Feature will not work,&nbsp;it Re-starts the movie from the beginning.&nbsp; If I re-boot my PC, play the Movie, seek works, but only for 1 playback.....2nd
 playback, same issue.</p>
<p>I have PowerDVD, no issuses&nbsp;FF &amp; FR works fine no matter how many times the Movie is played back. &nbsp;I also played the Movie on my Home DVD Player, no issues.</p>
<p>I used several Movies, Media Player's Seek&nbsp;feature acted the same way, 1st playback fine, all following playbacks without a re-boot....using&nbsp;seek restarts the movie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given a re-boot the seek issue works fine it is like something is getting hungup in memory....Media 12 has some sort of coruption, its a bad install......</p>
<p>Other issue I have; I cannot burn a DVD using media Center, it burns what appears to be shortcuts so when you play the burned DVD....it starts Windows media center and the music plays back....but from the media center...not the DVD.</p>
<p>Suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Following those steps.....it did not fix the issue. First time playing back a DVD Seek works fine, 2nd Playback, using SEEK...movie just re-starts. If I re-boot my PC, Seek will again work fine for the 1st playback</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I open Windows Media player, Click on the DVD Movie......it will start and the SEEK feature will work no matter how many times I start the Movie.&nbsp; The issue with the 2nd time playing the Movie...SEEK Re-Starts the Movie.... is only when I insert the DVD
 into the drive and let it start Media Player to playback the DVD.</p>
<p>Step 1; running the Troubleshooter......clicked APPLY THIS FIX......I got "Issues Found.....Configuration settings might be set incorrectly".....with a Yellow Trangle ..... I couldn't tell if that issue was corrected automatically...or not? I doubt it is
 since I ran the Troubleshooter again and saw the same "&nbsp; "Issues Found.....Configuration settings might be set incorrectly".....with a Yellow Trangle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it seems the troubleshooter could not correct the Configuration settings...whatever they are, where
 ever they are.&nbsp; Is there some other way to correct the Configuration Settings either by a tool, or, manually?</p>

            <p>I have Roxio Creator 10.1 installed on my PC....after following the steps to correct the WMP issue...when I opened Roxio Creator to duplicate a DVD.....it showed " No Drives Detected".&nbsp; I used this software several days before performing the WMP steps and
 it saw both my DVD Burners....and I used it to copy a DVD.</p>
<p>I have not done anything on my PC except for the WMP steps as outlined here.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To fix the issue with Roxio Creator I have, deleted low and high filters, I have uninstalled and re-installed Roxio Creator, I contacted Roxio\Sonic Tech support who will not assist because there is a newer version of the software I can purchase.</p>
<p>Both my DVD Burners are displayed in "My Computer", both DVD Burners&nbsp;are&nbsp;seen by several other softwares that utilize the Burners, it just Roxio Creator that no longer seens the Burners.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or suggestions will be appreciated........</p>

<p>The minds still sharp! The eyes are good!&nbsp; BUT, the reflexes have slowed a little.&nbsp; I am looking for seniors (50 +) to play on Xbox live.</p>
<p>I play any Call of Duty title, Borderlands, Battlefield or any first person shooter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would love to be able to play some of these games on Xbox Live and live for more than 20 seconds before getting killed.</p>
<p>If you are interested, let me know!</p>

    <title>How do I safely remove a Goflex Desk Adaptor usb 3.0 from a Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaitlynntomaselli  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I safely remove a Goflex Desk Adaptor usb 3.0 from a Windows 2008 R2 Standard Server and then plug in another server back up Goflex Desk Adapter usb 3.0&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm an intern for a company and they asked me to switch their already plugged in Goflex Desk Adapter usb 3.0 to the back up server Goflex Desk Adapter usb 3.0. They mentioned that before I unplug the one that's already attached to the Windows 2008 R2 Standard
 Server, that I have to stop the automatic updates and turn it off (I don't know if they mean turn off the Goflex Desk Adapter usb 3.0, server, or the updates).
</p>
<p>Then to plug in the back up server Goflex Desk Adapter usb 3.0. When that one is plugged in they said to do a back up.
</p>
<p>My main question is how do I do all of this safely with out messing anything up? My second question is what are the steps to remove the already plugged in device from the computer? My third question is, what are the steps to set up the server back up device
 after I plug it in?</p>
<p>They've done this before, I can tell because their are 2 dates on a sticky note on the back up server. I know that the Goflex Desk Adaptor isn't really a Microsoft question but I tried to contact Seagate and they told me to contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Built-in Webcam Error 45</h2>
                    I have a HP envy dv6 7245us Windows 8 laptop. I went into the device manager and it reads (error 45) no webcam detected or connected.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I haven't used my webcam in a few weeks so I cant tell you when this problem started.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried a few answers already posted to no resolve.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have an answer to this problem? I would be grateful for it.</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;HP&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Update BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board device drivers. If no Windows 8 versions exist try the latest Windows 7 versions.<br />
Be sure to ASK HP Support and in their forums because there are likely to be known<br />
issues.<br />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Translate the Windows 7 methods to Windows 8 (there is little difference) :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually
<br />
included with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Directx diagnostic not finding CPU - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Directx diagnostic not finding CPU</h2>
                    I am running a 2 year old self built computer running windows 7 ultimate. After a reinstall of windows I have been facing slow processing speeds. I was told CPU is usually the last to go so I looked into so many other things to no avail. I found out about
 the Directx diagnostic tool so I ran it. When it completed, the processor showed n/a... There was a button for running 64 bit diagnostic. After clicking it the button went away and I still get an n/a for processor. Does this mean my processor is failing/dead
 or is there another tool to test its processing speeds?

            <p>Hi Toby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Performance tab in Task Manager to see how your computer's CPU is being used by Windows and other programs running on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar, and then clicking <span>
Start Task Manager</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Performance</span> tab.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f3e796f82-cf05-4f65-9556-1e5aef7a7e05_44.jpg" /></p>
<p>Performance graphs</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top two graphs show how much CPU is being used, both at the moment and for the past few minutes. (If the CPU Usage History graph appears split, your computer either has multiple CPUs, a single dual-core CPU, or both.)
</p>
<p>A high percentage means that the programs or processes that are running require a lot of CPU resources, which can slow your computer. If the percentage appears frozen at or near 100%, then a program might not be responding. For more information, see
<em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/exit-a-program-that-isnt-responding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Exit a program that isn't responding</span></a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view advanced information about CPU utilization, at the bottom of the Performance tab, click
<span>Resource Monitor</span>. <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide
 confirmation.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Resource Monitor shows information similar to that shown in Task Manager, but with more details. For more information about Resource Monitor when you're using it, click
<span>Help</span>, and then click <span>Resource Monitor Help</span>.</p>
<div>To determine what kind of CPU is installed on your computer
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open System by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, right-clicking
<span><strong>Computer</strong></span>, and then clicking <span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.</span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <span><strong>System</strong></span> section, next to <span>Processor</span>, view your computer's CPU speed and type.</p>

            <p>I may have not been fully clear in my inquiry... Prior to this new install of windows, I only had one issue: the browser would give me IP conflict errors. All else worked fine. I kept all my documents on a seperate HHD and formatted my my entire SSD to run
 windows on. I already knew all the software I needed, so this new install has only the programs I wanted from the old setup which should reduce registry issues. But ever since the new install, I have dealt with incredibly slow speeds, hangs, BSD, and some
 weird frozen states (a screen that is just messed up). I have stopped the critical errors by reducing the services that start automatically only to the ones that safe mode starts plus the few that prevent some of my programs I want to start on startup is they
 are not set to auto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running the exact same software without all the services reductions on the old install, I had no issues...</p>

<p>I have been on the phone to the MS support, Xbox Live Staff and even emailed them a few times with no response. I have been doing this for nearly 6 years and currently no one has given me an official answer of "When" or "If" it is coming. All I got was:
 We are making Xbox Live available to as many countries as we can.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that you can connect and play Multiplayer with Xbox Live no problem. Like I say, I have been on Live for 6 years and I am based in Cyprus. As long as you have a high speed internet connection (mine is 6Mb with Cablenet) then you should
 be fine with playing all games on and offline.</p>
<p>The issue is when you try to download a movie, or a free game ie Halo 3. Those are region locked and when you try to download it, a message comes up saying that you are not allowed to download it from that region. Same with specific apps and other DLC add
 ons.</p>
<p>Whilst some DLC works ie Mass Effect: Citadel, Fifa Gold Packs, and other free games work, others are indeed limited, publishers right I guess.</p>
<p>Xbox One will not have any region locks with regards to its games, but I do not think that applies to digital content or applications.</p>
<p>In any case, I am getting the Xbox One and have preordered it from Amazon.co.uk and a local retailer here in Cyprus. The reason is no retailer in Cyprus has confirmed the Day One Edition, but Amazon.co.uk (who ships to Cyprus), has confirmed it. So I am
 going to leave it to the last minute to decide if I want to pay the extra delivery charge and wait a little bit for the Day One Edition from Amazon.co.uk or get the normal Edition locally.</p>

            <p>Hey AlarmedMink, </p>
<p>The error you are receiving is likely due to the fact that you are not in a Live supported region. Issues when purchasing and redeeming content can mostly be caused by being in an unsupported region. You &nbsp;may not be able to redeem the Sniper challenge content for Hitman unless you moved to a supported region.</p>

<p>When I bought the computer and the software I was never given a product key.&nbsp; I paid $ 117 for MS Widows Software and a total of $1374.79 for a computer that is basically unusable for me.&nbsp; So I guess I have a useless computer.&nbsp; Does this mean have to buy
 another Windows 7 software to make my computer usable??&nbsp; I am so ready to smash the computer.&nbsp; I am on disability and can not afford to purchase another computer or the software.&nbsp; I guess I got taken to the cleaners when I bought this new computer.&nbsp; I only
 have a few more days and then I will be completely locked out and it will be unusable, so I guess I better get use to not using the computer.&nbsp; I an at the end of my wits on getting this problem resolved.</p>

<h2>            Dolby Audio Driver and Lenovo Yoga 11s after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>My sound has not been working great since I upgraded to windows 10.&nbsp; Here is what I have done to get the dolby products to work.&nbsp; So far nothing has helped.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the Conexant Smart Audio HD device and restarted my computer. &nbsp;It did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to start Dolby Digital Plus I get the following message: &nbsp;The current Dolby Digital Plus audio driver version is 7.36.4.9 and the software application expects driver version 7.3.2.2. &nbsp;Please install a valid driver and software application
 combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to start Dolby Home Theater I get the following error message: &nbsp;Unable to start the Dolby audio driver. Please restart the computer or reintall the driver if the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I restart the my computer and it did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reinstalled the Realtek Audio driver version 8.66.4.0 WHQ (2013). &nbsp;When the computer restarted at the end of the install I got the following blue screen error message; &nbsp;Driver IRQL not less than or equal to CHDRT. &nbsp;(I missed a small part of the
 error message because the screen shut too quickly).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reinstalled the Realtek Audio driver again and got the following blue scree error message: &nbsp;Reference by pointer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem remains unresolved and I get the same error messages when I try to start either Dolby program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do get sound out of my computer, but it is real tinny and there is very little bass. &nbsp;When I attach some Bose speakers it still sound the bad..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to get the Dobly programs working so I can get decent sound out of my computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Skype for Business using wireless over wired, despite network provider - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonthompson-tnc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business using wireless over wired, despite network provider order settings</h2>
                    <p>Why does Skype for Business insist on connecting with a wireless connection over wired, despite settings in Network Settings -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Adapters and Bindings tab -&gt; Local Area Connection at top of list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I (or anyone else in our organization it seems) start a S4B call, and forget to manually disconnect from our wireless network or neglect turning off Wi-Fi altogether, S4B always uses the wireless connection for the call instead of my wired connection,
 even though my network preferences are set to Local Area Connection being the preferred connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our environment, this inevitably causes voice issues during the call and/or especially video issues if webcams are in use or presentations being shared/presented, even if pre-loaded for the call.</p>
<p>Disconnecting from Wi-Fi (when ethernet is already present) often disconnects users from the call, despite a wired connection.</p>
<p>After reconnecting with just the wired connection, call quality and viewing of video or shared presentations is always much improved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know I and others should remember to disconnect or turn off Wi-Fi before starting a S4B call, but try telling that to 100+ users here who find it convenient to just leave Wi-Fi on, despite our suggestions and the security issues that can present.&nbsp;
 This is one of the many reasons why we set wired over wireless in provider order preferences for every laptop we roll out, which I think is fairly standard practice.&nbsp; I do also realize that some wireless adapters have the option of turning off when sensing
 a wired connection - some through the properties and also through the BIOS, but that presents some unique challenges that have led us to stop using that setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question remains, why does S4B always use the wireless connection even though wired is set at the top of the list in Adapters and Bindings -&gt; Connections?&nbsp; And, is there any way to change this in S4B or Windows7?</p>
<p>

<br />
<del>I’d like to clarify that the Skype for Business client can’t select which network to use. The Skype for Business client will use the network that your computer connected to. So it is not feasible to direct the Network in the Skype for Business client.

<span>Hi JonThompson-TNC,<br />
<br />
</span><span>I’d like to clarify that the Skype for Business client can’t select which network to use. The Skype for Business client will use the network that your computer connected to.
 As you said the Local Area Connection has been set to the highest priority, I would suggest you check if you have restart the computer to let this setting take effect. Also please check in your organization to see if there are other third-party software or
 policy to change the network connection to wireless automatically.<br />
<br />
If all the settings have taken effect and there are no other software or policy to change the network connection, the only way to avoid this would be turning off Wi-Fi connection before starting a Skype for Business call or meeting.<br />

<p>When I try to display the Firewall settings, a dialog box is displayed saying "Due to an unidentified problem, Windows cannot display Windows Firewall settings".</p>
<p>I read a thread about making a file to merge with the registry in XP SP2. I haven't done this as not sure if this would work with SP3? or do I need to do something else?</p>
<p>Also, why is this happening? What is wrong with Windows Firewall? If this has been going on for some time is there a Microsoft patch that can be downloaded instead of trying to do registry merges (which I'm not very happy about doing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows installer si attiva sempre con un programma specifico</h2>
                    <p><span><span><span><span>Da quando ho installato AutoCAD, ogni volta che apro&nbsp; il programma (Norton Utilities) per pulire un po il&nbsp; PC dai file temporanei ecc., si attiva windows installer, e mi si apre una mascherina che
 mi dice che si sta per fare auto configurazione di autocad e po mi dice fallita,io faccio annulla ,ma esso si ripropone subito e non mi fa adoperare il programma, pare che entri in conflitto. Me lo fa solo con questo programma. Adesso ho tolto autocad dal
 PC però me lo fa lo stesso il problema. Ho fatto diverse cose con le istruzioni di microsoft per eliminare la problematica, ma niente da fare.
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Su servizi, windows installer è settato su manuale, premetto che&nbsp; io ho windows 10 home, versione 10.0.17134 build. Mi può dare una soluzione sicura perché non mi si attivi più windows installer,

            Benvenuto.
<br />Norton va accuratamente disinstallato utilizzando anche il suo remover proprietario.
<br />Troppi conflitti.

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My work just installed a new Wifi router which is a Vodafone HG553 Home Gateway and I can't connect to the network. &nbsp;When I choose the network name and click connect it gives me the error "Windows was unable to connect" and Network diagnostics give no
 help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have never had a problem connecting to my other wifi links, and other people are able to connect fine under winxp.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just recently installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. &nbsp;I have a Dell 1737 Studio</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Drivers are up to date. &nbsp;I disabled the Virtual Wifi Adapter, but no go.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Connecting now only via ethernet cable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are looking for some usual generic answers on the Internet then; temporarily disable firewall, update the drivers for the wireless adapter and other reasons that may prevent you from connecting to Internet wirelessely. My serious suggestion would be
 to contact Vodafone and they should probably have technicians to fix the issue free of cost.<br />

            <p>I was able to get a hold of Tech Support and after providing the old key, the installation ID, and the part numbers on the front &amp; back of the original disk, I was issued a new key.&nbsp; Apparently the original key was blocked for being "used too many times"
 (?!) -- it's a 10-year-old key, I've had quite a few systems in that time, and I tend to do a lot of reinstalling (but ALWAYS within the terms of the license).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation is hence resolved, but I'm dreading the day that I'll have to go through this again with some other Microsoft product.</p>

    <title>Two XBOX Live Accounts with two separate gamertags and Borderlands 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> racketyzebra6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two XBOX Live Accounts with two separate gamertags and Borderlands 2 dlc</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have an old XBOX Live account with a gamertag that has a high-level character on Borderlands 2. I have a new XBOX live account with its own gamertag that I used to buy the DLC's for Borderlands 2, because that first XBOX Live account has parental restrictions
 that cannot be removed because we can't access the parent account as the phone number tied to it for security does not exist anymore.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can get to play the DLC's with my old gamertag? The DLC's are tied to this new gamertag and I'm wondering if I follow these steps (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a>)
 to switch my old gamertag to the new microsoft account that has bought the DLC's, if I would be able to redownload the DLC's or if they would instead transfer to the old microsoft account because that gamertag has the licenses to the content?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that make sense at all?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>So I guess a better question would be, are DLC licenses tied to the specific xbox live account that bought them, or the gamertag associated with that account?
</p>
<p>If one transfers a gamertag using these steps (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a>),
 does that transferred gamertag have access to the download history of the account it was just transferred to?

            <p>Hi there RacketyZebra,</p>
<p>The DLC will stay associated with the Xbox Live profile, not the Microsoft Account (the email address) behind it. This means that even if you use the steps you linked to transfer the gamertag to a different Microsoft Account, the content would still be owned by the same Xbox Live profile, just on a different Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>As such, there is no way to transfer the content ownership from the purchasing Xbox Live profile to the other profile.</p>
<p>However, on the console that you downloaded the DLC, the second profile (older one, with the Borderlands saves) should actually have access to the content, as per the DRM on content. The console will hold the 'content licence' for the content, and as such any user profile on that console should have unrestricted access to it, even if offline completely.</p>

<h2>            Problems with your WOT game, easy fix from WG Mods</h2>
                    

<p>"use this:</p>
<p>-Restart World of Tanks<br />
-On the "Press Start" screen, hold Left Bumper + Right Bumper + Y<br />
-while holding these 3 buttons, press the Start button (small black button to the left of the “X" button)<br />
When done correctly, you should see some activity in the Launcher (Managing Layout, progress bars) instead of just immediately getting pop up on screen "Press A to Continue"</p>
<p>This will start an Integrity check the files on your hard drive and automatically fix any damaged files that might have been damaged during the download or update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this time there is no point in deleting the game while this will fix any fragmented files you might have.</p>
<p>Why waste all that time re downloading if you don't need to.</p>
<p>If you see no activity in the progress bar, your running fine or if you do see activity, your now fixed up.</p>
<p>Also if you want to give this a shot at helping your late load in game it is what we ask folks to do to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and just for good measure:</p>
<p>1) Go to your System Settings and find Storage then press “A”.</p>
<p>2) Highlight Hard Drive and press “Y”.</p>
<p>3) Press “A” on 'Clear System Cache press “A” to confirm. Do this 3 times in row.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<p>1) Turn off your system, unplug your modem, unplug your router and unplug your Xbox for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>2) Once you have done that plug in your router and let it boot up (around 45 second).</p>
<p>3) Then you may turn on your Xbox and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps."</p>

<p>If all else fails, full deep system delete and reinstall of the game will fix many odd problems, sound, late loading, missing items.......</p>

<p>Every console comes with a free month trial for up to 3 gamertags. In order to get the trial you have to create a brand new account on the console and it will offer you the trial during the gold subscription sign up. You do have to add a payment method in
 order to get the trial.</p>
<p>Otherwise, some games do include 2-day, 7-day, or 14-day trials.</p>
