<h2>            Force MyPhone to download contacts onto the phone</h2>
                    Is there a way to force MyPhone to download the contacts to the phone? I deleted a sync relationship with a computer, and all my contacts were deleted. (Thanks for that, MS). My last backup is on MyPhone, but every time I sync, it says everything is up
 to date. I don't want to reset the phone, but I've already re-installed the MyPhone app. It keeps telling me that everything is up to date.

            How did the contacts get on your phone in the first place? Was it through an Exchange connection? If so, MyPhone doesn't back those up. It sounds like that is what has happened because I don't think data is deleted when you remove Outlook partnerships,
 but it is when you remove server partnerships - security thing.

            I had the contacts in Outlook, and I synced them. It was built up over a long period of time. The contacts do exist in MyPhone on the web.<br />
<br />
I just want to force them to download back down, but not sure how.<br />

            Go out to your My Phone site, select "Connected Phones" and delete your phone.&nbsp; While there make sure that your data is in the "active" area of My Phone (and not in the archive).&nbsp; Then set up a new My Phone syncing relationship between your phone and the
 My Phone service and select the items you want to sync.&nbsp; The My Phone service should then recognize the phone as a new device and sync the data over to your phone.<br />

            Is there an easy way to restore calendar items that were archived? I just found out that the calendar was deleted as well.<br />
<br />
I found all the contacts in the archive. As I move them back, they show up on my phone. Without the category of course.<br />

<p>I want to learn to use the "what if",,,GS was my first attempt and I thought I could use my portfolio as the tool for learning.
</p>
<p>I can figure the rate of return quite easily with GS so maybe it isn't the best tool for this learning experience. But, I thought if I learned how to use it I could do what if on all or portions of my investments.</p>
<p>I guess the first hurdle is know the formula used to calculate the desired result?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Again:&nbsp; "I think we need more details about your problem in order to&nbsp;offer proper guidance.&nbsp;
<strong>At a minimum, a concrete example that shows what you know and what you want to calculate</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you use the phrase "<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">required</span></em> rate of return", it is not clear to me exactly what you want to calculate using Goal Seek.&nbsp; But I'll offer an example of my own.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hope it is not too far afield.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose you want to calculate the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>internal</em></span> rate of return (IRR) for the following regular cash flows:&nbsp; -10000 in A1, and 2000 in A2:A13 (12 periods).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, we could use =RATE(12,2000,-10000) to calculate the "exact" IRR, namely 16.942550857<strong>9397</strong>%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you want to learn how to use GS.&nbsp; (BTW, Solver is typically better to use because it offers more control.&nbsp; But GS is certainly easier to&nbsp;use.)&nbsp; The set-up might be as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IRR is defined as the discount rate that causes the "net present value" (NPV) of a series of cash flows to be zero (or relatively close to zero).&nbsp; The math formula can be found in the help page for the Excel NPV function (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/NPV-function-8672cb67-2576-4d07-b67b-ac28acf2a568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click
 here</a>) [1].&nbsp; The Excel formula might be [2]:</p>
<p>
</p><p>B1: =SUMPRODUCT(A1:A13 / (1+B2)^(ROW(A1:A13)-ROW(A1)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>where B2 is the IRR.&nbsp; So the GS set-up would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set cell:&nbsp; B1</p>
<p>To value:&nbsp; 0</p>
<p>By changing: B2</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result in B1 (Excel 2007) is about 3.55E-7 ("close" to zero).&nbsp; And the result in B2 is 16.942550857<strong>0867</strong>%.&nbsp; Compare with the "exact" IRR above.</p>

<p>You bring up something I wasn't sure about and the the abbreviations to us when entering the formulas...I am used to using MV, PV, FV, I, Pmt but not sure if they all work in GS.</p>
<p>So, specifically, I thought it would be interesting a startup tool in GS to figure what rate of return I would need to earn on a 490,000 portfolio over one year to have it reach 510,000. I know the simple approach is 20,000/490,000...</p>
<p>I was hoping that simple situation would be a starting point for me....</p>
<p>You may discourage me from approaching it any further.</p>

                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The heading is pretty much the question. Is it posible to protect a worksheet or an object so that it can't be edited or deleted, but it can be copied and pasted? I don't know if protecting data has some sort of options or if I can do the copy and pasting,
 but not the deleting and editing in other way, through macros maybe.</div>

            <p>Actually, there is one other alternative.&nbsp; Place the chart on its own Chart Sheet...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-click on the chart &gt; Move Chart &gt; New Sheet &gt; OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Review tab &gt; Protect Sheet ("Contents" checked, "Objects" checked) &gt; OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That chart can no longer be editited (as long as the sheet is protected).&nbsp; But you can still do Home tab &gt; Copy and then paste it into another worksheet, or paste-special as a picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you can right-click on the chart sheet's tab &gt; Move or Copy &gt; check "Create a copy" &gt; OK, but in this case the new chart sheet will also be protected....</p>

<h2>            What are the chances of a N95 Black Edition&#63;</h2>
                    Hi guys ive been really tempted to get a N95 but im wondering if it would be worth waiting a few more months to see if there is any news of a black version. What do you guys think?

======================<br />
<b>kevineu </b>,<br />
yes, it is Dual LED.<br />
As xenon has been proven its weakness to assume much more battery power and to flash lights "much" the makers (specially the multimedia phone makers)are thinkin' of puttin' a Dual LED in high-end multimedia phones.<br />
Xenon does give us much more clearer and brighter image than a single LED flash but when the subject is close it just exceeds the required light it should give, on the other hand, a single LED is proven worse in all conditions except semi-light/night conditions
 while a Dual LED could give it a more success.<br />
<br />
And, now to the fact, as y' know nokia has unleashed the N95 then , even if they think about a new varient of N95 such as Black edition/music edition or N95i their possibility will be stuck to that LED or to give a Dual LED. For Xenon, I think they will apply
 it to another new model of convergence. As for a new edition of N95 it will be sufficient to meet the battle against the battery against a dual LED if it is possible.<br />
Thanks.

            black edition? it might be m8! i get burn twice with this ploy of Nokia releasing a lets say half model.. in 8910(Titanium non colored to 8910i(colored), 8800 to Siroco (Black thn Gold).. i waited when they releases the first harddisk base phone N91 &amp;
 sure enough my wait not wasted after less than 4 months i got an 8gb black edition(Nokia call it music edition, N70 etc) N91-2 with WIFI as added feature &amp; not so buggy FW!

            Just thinkin bout one thing.<br />
A convergent product has lots of productivity.<br />
It has 5 MPix camera.<br />
Has 64 MB of RAM along with 330 MHz processor,<br />
Has High speed data transfer rate.<br />
Has great screen to enjoy great movies and sound.<br />
And then, if it is <b>Not one, It'S Many Inside </b>then why it is stuck to only 2-4 GB SD cards?<br />
One major issue is if nokia developes it to grab 8-32 GB of HCSD format, it will destroy ipod or multimedia product very easily.<br />
Remember one thing: a powerful battery is needed indeed.

            Well, Nokia is planning to release - or have released a black N95, however no idea whether it has Dual LED or not, as I've just heard about this release; however I do hope that the camera will not be so grainy

<br />

    <title>Word 2010 VBA changing font style and size in macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeyljacobs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 VBA changing font style and size in macro</h2>
                    <p>Problem with styles and macros.</p>
<p>I created a new multilevel list to use with different styles i.e. I have modified the built-in styles Heading1 to Heading5 to link to this new multi-level list which is called AgtNumbering etc. These Heading1 to Heading5 styles will be used in an agreement
 where there is a heading to a clause. I then have AgtBody1 up to AgtBody5 which will be used for the bodies of paragraphs. Heading1 to Heading5 will be pulled into a table of contents where the bodies won't be pulled in.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I cannot change the font of Heading1 style as I am linking my AgtBody1 to Heading1 Style but not marked to be included for table of contents. Apart from that the styles are the same and the numbering must following example.</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>HEADING 1 (using Heading1 Style) (included in TOC)</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body level 2 (using AgtBody2 Style)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body level 2 (using AgtBody2 Style)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Body level 3 (using AgtBody3 Style)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>HEADING CLAUSE 2.1 (using Heading2 Style) (included in TOC)</strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Heading level 3</strong></em> (using Heading3 Style) (included in TOC)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Body level 4 (using AgtBody4 Style)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically sometimes&nbsp;we have a level 2 which has a heading which&nbsp; must be included in the TOC and sometimes we have a level 2 para with no heading which must therefore not be included in the TOC therefore my thought process and&nbsp;reasoning above. (fonts
 etc. differ whether it is body or a heading and we would like to automate this).</p>
<p>I then thought it best to create a macro to make provision for the different fonts and bolds and italics and my macros are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Agt1H()</p>
<p>' Heading 1 Style Macro</p>
<p>'</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("Heading1")</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Font.Bold = True</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Font.Italic = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Agt2H()</p>
<p>' Heading 2 Style Macro</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("Heading2")</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Font.Name = "Arial Black"</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Agt3H()</p>
<p>' Heading 3 Style Macro'</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("Heading3")</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Font.Name = "Times New Roman"</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Font.Bold = True</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Selection.Font.Italic = True</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works well in that it applies the correct styles to the paragraph numbering etc. However when I use Agt2H or Agt3H it applies the correct style, changes the font, bold and italics on. Once I have typed the
 words of the HEADING and press ENTER it changes the look of my paragraph numbering so my number 2.1 is suppose to stay in arial font however when I press enter the actual number of the clause 1.1 changes to Arial Black.
</p>
<p>I have removed in options auto format as you type all the lists etc but still the same problem.</p>
<p>I have never encountered this before. Any comments / suggestions. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>No Stefan. I created one multilevel list which I linked&nbsp;to styles called AGTHeading 1 through to 9 where I changed the font to Arial Black, Times New roman etc for my headings. I then created AGTBody 1 through to 9 which I based on AGTHeading1 through to
 9 and changed the fonts back to Arial 10 point. So I still have 1 multilevel list. What I did first was I had 1 multilevel list and used Microsoft Default Heading1 through 9 styles and then based my bodies on the default Microsoft Heading1 to 9 styles. The
 only thing I did different was to create my own Heading style called AgtHeading1 to 9 and based my body on those instead of basing my heading on Microsoft Default Heading1 to 9. Once I did that it accepted my default styles and didn't give me further problems.</p>

    <title>Outlook Web App Lost folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomaswhite9045  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Web App Lost folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello Outlook,</p>
<p>I mistakenly dragged a folder out of my personal folder tree into the white area below my new emails and accidently let go off the button. off it went into the email abyss. I have done a lot of research and the folder or emails are not archived or deleted.
 Wgere does a folder go when dropped into this area? I am going to call it a white hole. I tested some empty folders and folders with items in them and dropped into the whate area again to see if I could recover but again no luck. Please let me know if you
 can help.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tom White</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>You can try restoring the emails in the disappeared folders via<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd353189%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Office 365 eDiscovery search</a>.
<strong>Note: The detailed steps should be performed by an admin of your organization. If you are not an admin, please contact your admin for help or involve your admin in the post</strong>.</p>
<p>If the above method doesn’t help, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation:<br />
1.&nbsp;What the disappeared folder do you refer to, a personal folder manually created one)?<br />
2.&nbsp;Can you upload a screenshot about the “white area (hole)” in your OWA? To upload a screenshot: Click “Use rich formatting”&gt; “Insert Media”.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. I will try to get the admin to help me but I am part of a global company with 30,000 employees. This may be a challenge even figuring out who the admin is. Our line of work is real estate and I work at an owners building as an
 owners rep. I do not report to a corporate office. I have attached a screen shot and the area just below the last week tab with an email from Stephen is where it disappeared over the area where it disappeared. Yes this is personal folder I created labeled
 Amazon in my projects folder which had about 8 sub folders. I also tested this area with other folders I already backed up and they were empty and full. I could not recover any with the typical resolves that I found on the web. I will have to be patient with
 the eDiscovery search as it may take some time to get someone to help me. please let me know if you receive the screen shot.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for your screenshot, and I have received it. To protect your privacy, I have removed some private information.</p>
<p>For” I tested some empty folders and folders with items in them and dropped into the whate area again to see if I could recover but again no luck”, did you mean this issue can always be reproduced on your side? If so, please provide some screenshots or a
 movie, so that we can check whether it can be reproduced on our side.</p>
<p>Also, I’d like to share the information with you: by default, if the mailbox isn’t enabled in-place hold/litigation hold, eDiscovery search can only retrieve emails which are deleted/lost within 30 days.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>hi sophia,</p>
<p>your welcome.</p>
<p>thank you for removing the private info.</p>
<p>yes i have reproduced this issue many times now in a test environment with folders that i have backed up and empty folders. if you use outlook all you have to do is drag a folder out of the tree and drop into the white area below the last email in your inbox.
 this folder should disappear and cannot be found by me anywhere. this has only been tested on the web app for windows 10. i have attached another screen shot and i will also test this on the office 365 site that my company offers.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>hi tom,</p>
<p>from the screenshots, i understand the issue you are experiencing only happens on the outlook client in windows 10. it can't be reproduced in
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>. if anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>i also notice the mouse selected <strong>inbox</strong> under<strong> favorites</strong>.
<strong>mit</strong> folder is under the manually created folder named <strong>folders</strong>.
<br />
based on this information, i did a test and failed to reproduce. <br />
(789 is the subfolder. test folder is manually created.)<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=807042b1-fb15-4bf6-887c-4c8876ad62e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d807042b1-fb15-4bf6-887c-4c8876ad62e8" /></a><br />
when i drag 789 from the tree to the white area below the last email. however, 789 will appear under
<strong>inbox</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b957af2d-a58a-43ad-aed5-7dbe87c729af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db957af2d-a58a-43ad-aed5-7dbe87c729af" /></a></p>
<p>so, could you double confirm whether the missing folder is in<strong> inbox</strong>? or can the emails be searched? (choose
<strong>all outlook items</strong>.)<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=889fcd68-454d-43e7-9bf0-49bda861cfba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d889fcd68-454d-43e7-9bf0-49bda861cfba" /></a>
<br />
in addition, i configured my test account via exchange activesync in outlook 16.0.6001.1068. to see if this issue is related to configuration mode and the version, please share them with us.<br />
<em>check configuration mode by clicking file&gt; account settings&gt;account settings…&gt;type.</em><br />
<em>check the version by clicking file&gt;office account&gt;office updates.</em></p>

<p>Sophia thank you for all of your help. I cannot recreate this issue either. I tested and yes it goes back the inbox or if I am previewing a folder email and drag and drop it now appears back in the tree for folders. Yesterday afternoon the particular folder
 that went missing showed up in the personal folders as a sub folder so I am all set. Just to let you know none of the test folders that I created and dropped into the white area ever came back which is no big deal. I figured you don't need the configurations
 anymore as I cannot duplicate either but let me know.</p>

    <title>Getting temporary unavialable or errors, which has been for a month - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ganwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting temporary unavialable or errors, which has been for a month now so can&#39;t get Office.</h2>
                    I've recently have gone back to college and one of the big things they have is Word 2016 so a month ago I tried to buy it, I had no luck, kept getting errors, somehow Word did start working randomly then stopped working again, but I was not able to get
 the program subscription or buy itself so not sure what was going on there. &nbsp; &nbsp;Deciding to try and getting a copy that won't blink off and on for me I ordered a copy of Office from amazon and went to activate today and guess what, getting the same errors.
 &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's at the point where it tells me to add my name, my first and last one. &nbsp; Odd because I'm pretty sure I already have them added, none the less I put in my name and what do I get? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This site is temporarily unavailable<br />
This site is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance. Please try again later.<br />
<br />
I've been getting that for a month as I said in my thing up there. &nbsp; It doesn't go away, no matter when I try it.<br />
<br />
Even when I go into my account which is actually possible and redeem the code itself I get this:<br />
<br />
Sorry, an unexpected error has occurred. The error has been recorded and we will investigate. Please try to redeem your code later.<br />
ekOJZdpHi0yycgcF.26.21.1.10.2<br />
2016/03/17 - 01:16:13 UTC<br />
<br />
And it just keeps happening, again and again and again and again.<br />
<br />
In short I got no idea what to do since waiting doesn't seem to do anything but actually redeeming the code or being able to way to activate it the normal way just won't co operate here. &nbsp;I've tried it in IE, Edge, Firefox. &nbsp;It just won't give at all so I'm
 puzzled. &nbsp; Absolutely puzzled. &nbsp;I got no idea what to do, so here I'am hoping you can help me out.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yeah safe mode with networking does not good too.

Office “Came With” the computer
<p><span>`<span>If “<b><i>Office came with</i></b>” your new computer but you did not explicitly order Office
 and PAY for Office separately from the computer, it is either the "2010 Starter" version, or a time limited trial of Office versions.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Starter 2010 consists of feature limited, ad supported, Word and Excel. Starter is yours to “keep” as long as you have this computer.
 It may NOT be transferred to a new computer, and it cannot be re-installed by a user after it is uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><b><span>The sticker on the bottom of the laptop/computer is rarely the Product Key for Office. If you look
 closely, you will see that it only mentions a Windows version, nothing about Office.

<div>
<span>Buying Office 2010: Summary</span>
<p><span>When you buy, it is my personal preference to insist on the "FPP" or Retail license for home and small business. In the Retail version you
 get the Installation disk built into exactly the same price you would pay for software only in the online download. And, it gives you the best set of user rights of the license. It allows you to install on 2 or 3 machines at the same time and to transfer the
 installation when you want to. The "PKC" or Product Key Card is slightly cheaper, but allows installation on only 1 machine and no transfer rights. If your brand new computer "melts down" in the warantee period, it will be replaced, but you will have to BUY
 another PKC license!</span></p>
<p><span>An additional benefit of the Retail version is that by using the DVD for installation, you completely avoid the
 possibility of MS “sneaking” the “Click to Run” crapware to you. </span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>no matter how you buy Office you need to keep "physical" copies of 3 pieces of information. The purchase receipt (credit card statement), Product Key, and the installation file on CD/DVD. With the first 2 you can get replacment copies from MS, with the
 last 2 you can re-install at your convienece without talking to MS (ie 5 years down the line when you retire this machine and get a new one).</span></p>
<div>
When buying Office 2010 you have to make 3 decisions:
Genuine MS Software -
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/genuine/default.aspx?displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>https://www.microsoft.com/genuine/default.aspx?displaylang=en</span></span></a><u><span><span>
</span></span></u>
<p><span><span>-</span></span><span>which version of office you
 want to buy: </span><span><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>-</span></span><span>how
 you will buy the&nbsp;Product Key used to activate the license.&nbsp;<br />
(Full or Product Key Card license)</span></p>
<p><span><span>-</span></span><span>What type of installation you
 want (“normal” install vs Click to Run)</span></p>
<p><span>Here is more info about those decisions:</span></p>
Product Key Card vs “Traditional” Retail disk -
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/products/office/Pages/office_2010_sell.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/products/office/Pages/office_2010_sell.aspx</span></span></a><span>
</span>
<p><b><span>“Medialess” Installations: Product Key Cards PKC (2010) / OEM / MLK(2007):</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>For
 use on new, preloaded PCs only</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>1
 license / 1 device / non-transferable</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Activates
 preloaded Office or Downloaded installation files</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Does
 not include media</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft® Office 2010 Product Key Cards contains a 27 char “PIN” which you have to enter at this site:
</span><span><span><span><span><span><u>https://office.getmicrosoftkey.com/</u></span></span></span></span><span> to retrieve your 25 char product key. This
 key will activate Office on only one PC. No disc supplied. The PKC license is not transferable to another PC. Next week if your cat uses your computer as a litter box, you have to BUY A NEW PKC.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Take a look in the Help screen for the PRODUCT ID. OEM activated Product ID’s will include the letters “OEM”.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Retail Box with CD: FPP:</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Home
 and Student: 1 license, up to 3 concurrent devices</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Home
 and Business and Professional: 1 license, up to 2 concurrent devices</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>License
 is transferable to another PC or Owner</span></p>
<p><span><span>·</span></span><span>Includes
 installation file on CD for backup</span></p>
<p><span>This license type, often referred to as Full Packaged Product (FPP) in the past, includes a DVD, a 25-character Product Key, and a Quick Start Guide. The
 25-character Product Key will activate an Office 2010 preloaded PC. The DVD may also be used to install Office on another. The number of installations (2 or 3) and users (1 or 3) depends on the specific Office suite purchased.
</span></p>
<p><span>A Traditional Disc product license can be transferred to a different PC if the user upgrades to a new PC or if the owner wants to sell it to someone else.
</span></p>
Office Discount Deals
<p><span>There are 2 ways you can get an even better deal on Office. The “Academic” discount for college/university students USD100 + USD15 for backup
 disk (also can get Win7 Pro Upgrade for USD30)<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/student/office/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/student/off...s/default.aspx</span></a>
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and the “Home Use Program” for corporate employees.
</span></p>
<span>HUP, Home Use Program</span>
<p><span>The Home Use Program is a deal where companies with a site or volume license activate part of that license agreement that allows their employees
 to get a copy of Office to use at home. The HUP is the best discount you can get.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/contactus.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/contactus.aspx</span></a><span>---click

Worldwide HUP - individual or corporate bulk downloads

</span>-</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Click to Run (CTR) Information</span>
<p><span>MS will automatically give you CTR if it detects a High speed internet connection when you are downloading an online purchase or trial version.
 My personal preference is to avoid CTR for home use. You have to look carefully on the page for the 'advanced' link to get the "normal" installation file.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the MS Office site
</span><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/</span></a><span> and search for “click to run” you will see titles such as

<h3> raiyansp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5800 XpressMusic- No Apps show up after upgrading memory card</h2>
                    
<p>My Nokia 5800 XpressMusic shipped with a 4GB memory card. But that was too small for me, I used up almost all of it, only 500 MB is left.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I bought a 8GB MicroSD HC memory card. I then took the 4GB out and inserted the new one. And then I transferred all of my data (pics,vdos,music,docs, apps etc) using a backup of my 4GB memory card which I created using Nokia Ovi Suite sometime before
 that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the backup was not successful, though all of my Images,videos,music, docs etc were restored, I dont see any of the apps I installed on that old memory card restored here in this new one.</p>
<p>But the main problem is that they are there, they were transferred. But they don't show up in the applications folder. I think they are hidden cuz when I tried to install one of the missing apps (Google Maps), my phone said that app already exists and asked
 me if I want to replace that etc. Also same with the Ovi Store app. If I try to again download the missing items, It doesn't work (the download button is greyed out).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem happened though I restored my backups twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please give me a solution on how to fix this. I really need it. It took me a lot of time to download all of those apps. So I really need it now. How do I make them appear?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls</p>

            Since you already have the back up of all your content, do a soft reset and only restore contacts, messages photos, music etc but not any apps. Then see if ovi store let you downloade them again.<br />
<br />
You do the soft reset by dialling *#7370# with default code 12345 (if you have not changed it your self)<br />
<br />
This will wipe the phone memory - therfor the back up. You might also have to format the memory card if there's something there triggering ovi store to believe the apps are already installed.

            Hi SSG, 
<br />
<br />Let's clear the update cache, repair the office installation, and try again. 
<br />
<br />click start and type cmd, right click and run as admin. Type:
<br />“net stop wuauserv” and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type control panel - file explorer options - click the view tab, and make sure “show hidden files...” is buttoned off. 
<br />
<br />Once done, navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and delete the content of the Download folder. 
<br />
<br />Click start again, type cmd, right click and run as admin, type:
<br />“net start wuauser” and hit enter.
<br />
<br />Once done, reboot. Then, click start and type "control panel" - find Programs and Features. Find office 2016 on the list, right click and repair. Once done, let's go back and try to install updates. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

Did you check in your bios settings to see if the USB ports are turned on, as you didn't provide any info about your system it is hard to give any good directions. and are you using the RTM version or the Insiders preview of Win10.

            <p>AFAICT, the generic is displayed when the document was created by a different version of Word &amp; saved without a file name extension. Continuing to save to the same file will not restore the icon. However, if it's important to you, use File&gt;Save As to create
 a new copy of the file, then Trash the prior copy or use it for a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This screen shot shows the Title Bar of 2 identical documents. The one with the generic icon was saved by a previous version of Word: The one with the Word icon was created from that same document by using the method described above...</p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW: Word 2016 always appends an extension when saving a <em>new</em> file, even if the user doesn't expressly include one. Some prior version of the program allowed
<em>not</em> appending extensions.</p>

    <title>Deleting temporary internet files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#161;firedog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting temporary internet files</h2>
                    <p>Until recently, I had a problem with deleting files stored in TIF but put there by other applications, notably Windows Live Mail. WLMail's temporary files (wbk<em>hhhh</em>.tmp and wbk<em>hhhh</em>_bogus[1]) remained after using Internet Options'
<em>Delete browsing history</em>. Since reading a message in WLMail generates two files, they can soon mount up in both numbers and volume.</p>
<p>I now find that <em>Delete browsing history </em>does remove these WLMail temp files. I guess that this is new&nbsp;behaviour in&nbsp;IE9, but I'd be grateful if someone could confirm this, or explain the change otherwise.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

I managed to get rid of them by using&nbsp; Ctrl-Shift-Delete and checking&nbsp; *only*&nbsp; Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that would be at the expense of Favorites favicons only.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's pretty good because it completely wipes the Low\Content.IE5&nbsp;including its&nbsp; index.dat.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Naturally it doesn't affect the size of the main&nbsp; index.dat.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that you need to take more extreme measures such as killing all tasks which hold handles on that.&nbsp; E.g. Run...&nbsp; ProcExp&nbsp; and do a&nbsp; Ctrl-f&nbsp; Find&nbsp; for&nbsp; Content.IE5\index.dat&nbsp;&nbsp; and then use&nbsp;
 rd&nbsp; in a cmd&nbsp; window&nbsp; (switches and parameters omitted to protect the naive. &lt;w&gt;)</p>
<p>BTW do you think that this is better than using&nbsp; WE?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

            <p>I've never found anything in the \low folder's cryptically-named sub-folders, so I'm not at all clear why they're there.&nbsp;I just had a look - they're empty (apart from a desktop.ini), but index.dat is at 2,400KB slightly larger than the regular one (2,385KB).
 The last purge (sometime last week) rid me of 57,000 TIFs, including all of the wbk* files.
</p>
<p>There was a case <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/a6539d3a-a315-4d53-865d-e64d851e0eac?threadId=abbacb1d-1678-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">
elsethreads</a> of someone with IE9 having 170,000 TIFs which wouldn't go away using normal methods. Something makes me think, then, that IE9 incorporates some mechanism to deal specifically with wbk* files, however surprising that may seem. Since I hadn't
 noticed it earlier, I wonder if it was sneaked in with KB2530548.</p>
<p>I'm very happy not having to use your cryptic cmd solution or indeed my (almost as cryptic) WE one. I'm nonetheless a great fan of WE in W7 (with Classic Shell).

Really?&nbsp; I would only expect to see that if you were running with Protected Mode: Off (or something like that.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low\Content.IE5 &nbsp; should be where most of the TIF files go (but not the WLMail offences).&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, compare&nbsp; dir/a/s Content.IE5\*.htm&nbsp; with&nbsp;
 dir/a/s Low\Content.IE5\*.htm</p>
<p>BTW compare also how long WS takes to get the same result.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

            <p>Ah, yes. It was quite some time ago that the only way I could get something to work was to turn
<em>Protected mode </em>off. I can't remember what it was, but perhaps I'll run into the problem again if I turn it on. I've just spent some time re-reading Eric Lawrence's excellent posts about
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/03/19/wininet-temporary-internet-files-cache-and-explorer-folder-view.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

LMZL</a>, but there's just too much stuff for me to be able to remember it all.</p>
<p>I wonder if having protected mode off has any bearing on the behaviour of <em>
Delete browsing history</em>.</p>
<p>The size of index.dat - as Eric&nbsp;reminded me, <em>the cache index is overwritten with zeros
</em>on deleting browsing history, so its size won't change much.</p>
<p>&gt; <em>compare also how long WS takes to get the same result</em></p>
<p>Depends how you do it. The fastest I've found is ext:htm, because you're restricting the search to only file extensions. *.htm will (depending on your settings) trawl through all indexed content (if it is indexed) or through all content looking for that
 string (if it's not). With about 10,000 files in my indexed TIF, ext:htm was just about instantaneous.</p>

<p><br />
Right now, after having been left alone for a while,&nbsp;the Low one is huge compared to the main one.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think a problem is, as noted and formerly corrected by CacheSentry, that the index.dat never shrinks.&nbsp;&nbsp; So once you've let it get too big you may as well
 make sure you delete it.&nbsp; Fortunately, in the case of the Low one that seems to be happening (at least with the combination of checkboxes that I mentioned).</p>

            Your best option is to put your phone in airplane mode when you put it on charge.

            Windows phones must be on when charging due to the software running on the device. It does not impact the charging ability. Some have found that putting the phone in airplane mode will appear to make it charge faster because then all radios are shut off
 and updates/notifications do not come to the phone when in airplane mode.
