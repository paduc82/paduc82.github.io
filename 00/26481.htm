<p>
</p><p><span>To pull up the correct account, </span>follow this link: <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Continue.</strong>&nbsp;From there, you'll be able to see the Skype accounts related to the email address. Identify the Skype account you wish to gain access with and proceed with password reset on the same page.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any experience with running remotely via Citrix, but I know from reports I've read that this can be made to work.&nbsp; Do you have the front-end running on the remote Citrix server in a separate user profile, linked to a back-end that is either
 on the same server or on a server that is accessible via LAN from the server?&nbsp; I believe that's how it's supposed to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have it set up that way, I can imagine that something in the Citrix configuration for the user profile might affect it.&nbsp; Conceivably there is a limit on the amount of disk space allocated to the user.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925 battery and heat problems.</h2>
                    My wife's Lumia 925 has been plagued with issues.&nbsp; We both bought the same phone at T-Mobile the day it was released a few weeks ago.&nbsp; My phone is fine but she is on her second phone already.&nbsp; The first Lumia shut off on her and it needed a soft reset
 to turn back on.&nbsp; The second time it turned off it would not turn back on at all.&nbsp; T-Mobile sent a replacement right away about a week ago.&nbsp; Everything was fine until yesterday when the phone started getting very hot on the back of the phone.&nbsp; The battery
 dropped to 20% in 2 hours.&nbsp; I did the hard reset and everything seemed fine until last night it died, so I plugged it in overnight.&nbsp; This morning the phone dropped to 47% within 2 hours of non use.&nbsp; I will continue to change settings but this doesn't make
 any sense.&nbsp; My phone has been working great.&nbsp; This is my 2nd Windows phone "Lumia 710" and my wife's 1st. &nbsp; Anybody have any ideas on how to get this issue resolved?&nbsp;

            It is the strangest thing. My Lumia 925 is just fine (crossing my fingers). We are getting a 3rd phone tomorrow. I did have about 5 problems with my launch Xbox 360 so maybe it is bad luck.

<h2>            Re-add ability to disable ads on Windows Spotlight&#63;</h2>
                    I'm a huge fan of Windows Spotlight, as are people in our organization. There used to be a GPO to disable the ads that sometimes appear, but this seems to be disabled now. Are there any plans to bring this disabling feature back? In a business setting,
 we don't want our employees downloading random ads. On the other hand, the Spotlight photos are a neat feature to provide some lock screen variety. I know you can disable ads on Picture &amp; Slideshow mode, but would love to see the same thing on Windows Spotlight...at
 least in Corporate environments.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In theory this can go and and return the 1st, 2nd, third etc but as you will see by the time we get to the third it's all getting a bit silly and it's time to resort to VB code. However:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All ARRAY formula</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First</p>

            <p>Based on some Googling I did, here is one possible route.&nbsp; It requires on extra column - you can't go directly to the text label, so the middle column is a "helper" that holds the cell number of the most frequent, second most frequent, etc, entry.</p>
<p>If you have in column A this data:</p>
<p>Black</p>
<p>Black</p>
<p>Black</p>
<p>Purple</p>
<p>Purple</p>
<p>Grey</p>
<p>Grey</p>
<p>Grey</p>
<p>Grey</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then in cell B1 place this formula to get the most frequent item:</p>
=MODE(MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0))
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the formula below in cell B2 to show the second most frequent.&nbsp; You must make this an ARRAY FORMULA by pressing SHIFT-CTRL-ENTER instead of just ENTER:</p>
<p>=MODE(IF(COUNTIF($B$1:$B1,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0))=0,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0)+{0,0}))</p>
<p>Now you can drag that formula down to cell B2 to get the third most frequent, etc:</p>
=MODE(IF(COUNTIF($B$1:$B2,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0))=0,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0)+{0,0}))
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, in Column C, cells C1, C2 and C3, place the formulae below.&nbsp; Note again that the second two are ARRAY FORMULAS!</p>
<p>=INDEX($A$1:$A$9,MODE(MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0)))</p>
=INDEX($A$1:$A$9,MODE(IF(COUNTIF($B$1:$B1,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0))=0,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0)+{0,0})))
<p>=INDEX($A$1:$A$9,MODE(IF(COUNTIF($B$1:$B2,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0))=0,MATCH($A$1:$A$9,$A$1:$A$9,0)+{0,0})))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result should look like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div>
<div>Black</div>
</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>Grey</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Black</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Black</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Black</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>Purple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grey</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grey</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grey </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grey</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>P.S. - Someone smarter than me can probably fit this solution into a single column instead of two!</p>

<p>Thank you, Lemuel.&nbsp; I was able to use a recovery USB to get into the system.&nbsp; When I did, Explorer.EXE was not found, and my start menu did not function.&nbsp; However, the Recycling bin WAS on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to go through Recycling Bin to access my folders and grab backups of my files.&nbsp; I then did a clean install, as the Reset and other recovery options were not functioning.</p>

            Hi Azgar, <br />
<br />
Based on the details your system is currently on, it is a possible case for driver issue. Make sure all drivers are all up to date. I recommend manually downloading the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website to make sure the one installed on your
 PC is updated. Outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issues such as this one. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since you are unable to perform the recovery through the Advanced Startup. I suggest to follow the method advised by Greg Carmack in this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/cant-boot-windows-10-or-recovery-mode/0b8aa9fd-5741-45b3-ae40-e130631c14ce">
thread</a>. <br />
<br />
Update us with the outcome.<br />
<br />
Regards.

    <title>Need solution to sync iCloud Calendar with Outlook 2010 while Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granteck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need solution to sync iCloud Calendar with Outlook 2010 while Office 365 is installed</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a subscription to Office 365, Click to Run Install, but found that Outlook 2013 does not reliably download my various email accounts when set up as IMAP accounts. I wanted to use IMAP so that all my emails stays sync'd across all of
 my computers and devices. After talking with Microsoft and they could not offer any solutions to the download issue and after searching the internet the best solution seemed to be to change to Eudora or revert back to Outlook 2010. Being a long time Outlook
 user I choose to revert back to Outlook 2010. However with Click to Run installation I cannot uninstall Outlook 2013 and when I go to configure iCloud to sync my calendars, contacts and tasks it will not let me as there are 2 versions of Outlook running.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know of a solution or workaround for this? Or should&nbsp; I just change to Eudora or another mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I set up a Google Calendar sync'd to iCloud and then sync my Outlook 2010 Calendar to the Google Calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            What I have worked out as a work around is to use a google calendar linked to my iCalendar and to use an addin in Outlook from gSyncit to sync to my google calendar. So far it is working. I can add or edit from any of my devices now. The iCloud option
 was easier to set&nbsp; up, but it won't work with 2 versions of Outlook installed.

<h2>            Photos does not Slideshow or even allow changing pictures</h2>
                    <p>I am using Win 10 Pro Insider Preview and now Photos is acting like it can't read the starting directory when it loads. When it loads (from Explorer with only the first image selected) that's the only image it will display. I must highlight all images in
 the folder and open Photos before Slideshow or the arrow keys will function.&nbsp; If I highlight only 5 images in the folder then ONLY those 5 images will be displayed. Therefore, Photos is not reading the directory, only the selected items in the directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a change from previous versions.&nbsp; When will this issue be fixed?</p>

    <title>How to stop page numbering at a particular page in a Word Template - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to stop page numbering at a particular page in a Word Template</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a document template for office use, which means number of pages varies depending on the contents of the document. The document contains an appendix section and I would like the page numbering to stop at the page before appendix. The problem
 is that the main document contains several 'section breaks' to allow a mixture of page orientations (some in portrait and some in landscapes); and this is bound to change depending on the template user. Is there any way that I can fix page count to the page
 before the appendix section?</p>
<p>

            <p>If you are talking about the y of Page x of y page numbering, if you insert a bookmark on the first page of the Appendix (using the bookmark name of appendix would be&nbsp;a good idea, then to get the y for the pages in the preceding Section(s) of the document
 use the following field construction</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You must use CTRL+F9 to insert each pair of field delimiters { } and ALT+F9 to toggle off their display.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 not saving Office 365 Credentials in Roaming Profiles</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
We have migrated one of our Exchange Mailboxes to our Office 365 Environment, we have had all the relevant DNS entries put in place, so when the user logs on and opens Outlook 2013, the Wizard picks up there Office 365 Mailbox and configures, it asks you for
 User Credentials, and you type them in and select remember and then Outlook open fine with all the emails presented,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
THE PROBLEM: After this user logs off and logs back on to either the same computer or another computer, and they open Outlook, you are yet again asked for your Credentials again, it remembers the username and not the password, once you enter the password and
 click remember password it opens Outlook fine</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Looking in Credential Manager, I can see that after selecting Remember Credentials, it is putting an entry in Generic Credentials, however when you log off and on again these disappear, I have added Manual Entries in Credential Manager and these are saving!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I have noticed that in %USER%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials when you open Outlook and select remember password, it is adding a system file in here, so I decided to try copy the file to %USER%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials, when I log off this
 is writing back to the server, and when I log back on it is downloading, HOWEVER when I open Outlook, it still asks for the password! And when I type it in and select remember, it adds the system file back in&nbsp;%USER%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials, and
 ignores the Roaming one,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
So currently I am using a Logoff and Logon Script to copy these Files too and from the relative folders and this works, however it is not ideal</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
The Script:</p>

<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">'Test</span><br />

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
MY QUESTION:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
So I guess my question is how can you get Outlook to look at the&nbsp;%USER%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials instead of the Local one?</p>

            <p>We are also experiencing this problem.&nbsp; We have roaming profile domain accounts using Office 365 email with cloud Exchange servers.&nbsp; Each time the roaming account logs in it asks for Outlook credentials again to connect to cloud based Exchange.&nbsp; The credentials
 in Credential Manager don't seem to save with the roaming profile when the user logs out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An Internet search on the issue brought me to Andy's query in the Office365 forum.&nbsp; The Microsoft response in the Office365 forum was to post the question to the Outlook forum.&nbsp; The Microsoft response in the Outlook forum was to post the question in the
 TechNet Exchange Server forum.&nbsp; The Microsoft response in the TechNet Exchange Server forum was to post the question in the Office365 forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone at Microsoft know how to answer Andy's question?<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>So, if the issue is with Office 365 Business Subscription then you will have to post your query in the Office 365 forum link given below.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The question is not related to a subscription problem.&nbsp; The question is not related to an Exchange server problem.&nbsp; The question relates to how the program Outlook stores credentials in Credential Manager.</p>
<p>The question is: how can you get Outlook to look at the&nbsp;%USER%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials instead of the Local one.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem. I found the issue was caused by Microsoft Office Outlook Update KB2956170&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I removed the update the password box never popped up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be KB3085579, as we have 2 different builds and these were the numbers that caused the problem.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, I am not sure if this is the right place for my question or not, so if it isn't, please feel free to move it.</p>
<p>Basically, what I am trying to establish is what can synchronize with what. &nbsp;I have the following setup....</p>
<p>Laptop with Outlook 2010 and Outlook Connector for Hotmail</p>
<p>Desktop with Outlook 2007 and Outlook Connector for Hotmail.</p>
<p>HTC HD2 with Microsoft My Phone and partnership's with each of the computers.</p>
<p>All of that works quite well, however, I want to extend the usage of the Windows Live Services including Windows Live Calendar etc. &nbsp;This also works, to an extend, I can create an appointment in Windows Live Calendar, and this will come down onto the laptop
 and the desktop, and when I sync the phone, it will appear there. &nbsp;However, I am not able to do the same for tasks. &nbsp;Why is this the case? &nbsp;Windows Live Calendar has the concept of a To Do List, which I am assuming is Tasks, but they don't synch?!? &nbsp;Yet, I
 can synch Tasks from my phone into Microsoft My Phone.</p>
<p>It seems to me that what is missing is a synch between Microsoft My Phone and Windows Live.</p>
<p>Is there something that I am missing that can glue all these components together? &nbsp;It seems like they are almost there, but just now quite.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Gary</p>

            Tasks are not supported by the Outlook connector. Whatever sync software you use with the phone supports tasks.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to respond.</p>
<p>So, that confirms what I thought, i.e. that Outlook Connector does not synchronize tasks, however, this seems like a glaring omission on their part. &nbsp;Do you know if there are any plans to include this?</p>
<p>Do you know of any way to synchronize "Microsoft My Phone" tasks with tasks in Windows Live Mail?</p>
<p>Bottom line, I am trying to find a way to have email, contacts, calendar, and tasks synch'ed between my desktop, laptop, phone, and online. &nbsp;I can get three out of the four, but just can't get tasks.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Gary</p>

<p>Its a requested feature but I have not heard if its under consideration.</p>
<p>I don't use a windows mobile phone, so i don't have any experience with syncing the tasks with live mail. Activesync should sync tasks between the phone and outlook-&nbsp;so you can&nbsp;get 4 of 4 on 3 of 4 and 3 of 4 on the last (online).</p>

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>Looks like I might have found a solution to my problem.</p>
<p>The details are listed here:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/08/30/hotmail-now-supports-push-email-calendar-and-contacts-with-exchange-activesync.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/08/30/hotmail-now-supports-push-email-calendar-and-contacts-with-exchange-activesync.aspx</a></p>
<p>So basically, from my mobile, I now use an Exchange connection to synchronize mail, contacts, and tasks, to Windows Live, and then I use the Outlook Connector to pull mail and contacts down onto my desktop. &nbsp;I am still missing the tasks synching between
 Windows Live and Outlook, but hopefully that will come as a new feature for Outlook Connector.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Gary</p>

            you can sync tasks if you use activesync on the desktop&nbsp;to sync&nbsp;outlook to the mobile - or it might royally screw&nbsp;up everything and not be worth the effort. &lt;g&gt; &nbsp;

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>ActiveSync to the desktop would synchronize tasks on the desktop/laptop. &nbsp;However, with this model, Windows Live is the repository for all the information, so it would be better is Outlook on my desktop/laptop was able to pull information down from Windows
 Live. &nbsp;What I haven't tried yet, is to establish an Exchange connection to Hotmail directly from Outlook on my desktop/laptop, rather than going through Outlook Connector. &nbsp;However, if this were possible, why the need for the Connector in the first place.</p>
<p>I will do some more digging.</p>

            You can't make an "exchange connection" from outlook to hotmail - EAS is activesync and Outlook doesn't do ActiveSync to exchange. You need to use the Outlook Hotmail Connector.

<p>Ah, I guess that would make sense then.</p>
<p>I will have to wait and see if the task synchronisation makes it into the Outlook Connector. &nbsp;Do you know if there is an RSS or something that says when a new version is ready?</p>

<p>Yes I am now able to copy and paste a phone number to the dialer from address book notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still cannot beileve I cannot copy and paste a chunk from an email to say diary.
</p>
<p>Example would be to copy and paste Hotel or flight info from an email to the diary.</p>
<p>So if you need it that day you only need to get to the calander and not look for an older email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do this on the PC but not WM. </p>
<p>I hope this is useful feedback for Microsoft via people like yourselves.</p>

<p>Hello Marvin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Dynamics 365 (online) subscription doesn’t include Office 365 applications such as Exchange Online or SharePoint Online. You can significantly enhance your company’s online, collaborative experience by integrating Office 365 applications with your Dynamics
 365 (online) subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, if you want to migrate from an Office 365 for Business tenant to another Office 365 for Business tenant, you need to manually backup the data from the old tenant and then import them to the new tenant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            switch &#92;b seems to prevent merge fields from displaying</h2>
                    <p>I have a Word Merge utilizing the switch \b, which&nbsp;worked fine when I created it in 2007, but does not work when I try to create it in 2010. If I keep the merge simple, the fields display fine. When I add the switch \b and the text, space or commas that
 I would like in front of the merge field, the field stops displaying. I am not typing the switch manually, I am right-clicking on the merge field, choosing edit and selecting the Field option "Text to be inserted before:" I tried to add the switch manually
 and that did not work either - same result, the field stopped working.</p>

If the text is restricted to alphabetical characters without any spaces, you can get away without enclosing it in quotes, it is better to enclose the text in quotes.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the links. The Repair link is what started me on this quest because SCANPOST.EXE would not recognize my .ost file for repair and apparently not using a .pst file seems to be the wrong course of action. I seem to understand that I should be
 using a .pst file since I'm not an Exchange user.<br />
</p>
<p>For the second link, I'm worried about creating a new .pst and losing something in the process if the current data file is corrupt in some way. Hence, I'd like to create a .pst from the existing .ost warts and all so I can run SCANPOST.EXE on it.</p>

            <p>Okay, I guess I understand now. When I read "About Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)" I understood that to mean the .ost file was a copy of a .pst file that I should be using.
<br />
<br />
So that means I am either unable to repair potential issues via SCANPOST.EXE or the is some other magic spell necessary to vanquish the demons that plague my Outlook installation pretty much 24/7/365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New issue since posting the question: After installing Outlook on my Mac at home my work machine no longer retrieves my mail at work.
<br />
<br />
At least I can probably fix that, unlike the winmail.dat plague that will not respond to every recommended course of action to bring it to heel.

Do I lose any data on the server? </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>There is a whole lot of information missing from your post and as stated in my post to which you responded, you really need to "start from the beginning".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, there is absolutely no way that your "POP email account suddenly started using an ost data file rather than a pst data file". The only way an email account would use an .OST file is if it was configured as an IMAP (or Exchange) account. That would
 happen if you configured the account entering just your email address/password which would result in the account defaulting to IMAP. If you want to configure it as a POP account, you'll need to do that manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to answer your specific question, you would not lose any data on the server since an OST file is a mirror of what is contained on the server.</p>

</p><p>We have no way of confirming if your account has been hacked. We also cannot say if the hacker truly had access to your account and how he had gotten your contact list. The system would have detected the unusual activity and block it at once if it had.
</p>

</p><p>Since you mentioned that it was not your video, it is possible that the 'hacker' is just using it for phishing or to get some more information on your account.

            Is yours the handsfree with iDrive? I find that on first pairing, you need to leave the phone and car alone to download the phonebook properly. In my case it took around 5 minutes but could be longer if you have a large phonebook. If you use the phone
 during this period the download may fail.

            I have only ever used the BMW system with iDrive. When I switched from a 6230i to the N80 (my first N series) It would not dowload the contacts until I got the iDrive firmware updated. They all worked perfectly with the 6230i before that. I haven't had
 to do this with any of the later BMW's and N series phones. I don't know if the non iDrive version uses the same system, just without the display. But if it is the same and your car is 2007 or older, you may want to consider a firmware update.

<p>You would have to get it done by BMW I'm afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I switch from my old 6230i to an N80, it would pair but not download the phonebook. BMW didn't want to know because as far as they were concerned, they would only support phones that were listed as being compatible and the N80 was not.Anyway, I eventually
 convinced that there were other issues with the car and a firmware update may resolve everything and they agreed.N80 work after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had no problems with all my later BMW's except having to try a few times and wait for a bit straight after pairing.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Full stop appearing after .co email addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mad hatter&#39;s wife  say:</h3>
<h2>            Full stop appearing after .co email addresses</h2>
                    When I am sending an email to a .co extension, Outlook is automatically putting a full stop after the .co so you end up with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you don't manually remove the extra dot after the .co, you get an error message that says "invalid recipient" and it won't send it. It took me ages to figure out what the problem was. My question is: is there any way of stopping Outlook from automatically
 putting a full stop after a .co email address?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>

<h2>            Opening up a single occurrence of a recurring meeting freezes Outlook.</h2>
                    <p>A client is using Outlook 2016 32bit installed on a Server 2008 R2 Citrix server and connecting to Exchange 2013. When opening up a single occurrence of a recurring meeting, Outlook hangs. This isn't for every recurring meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've tried recreating the recurring meeting and setting it to end on 31st Dec 2016 and this still happens. We also recreated the meeting, offsetting the start and end times by 1 minute and it still freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other steps we can try to troubleshoot?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time for posting your concern here in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Outlook.com automatically blocked attachments coming from your contact that was added on your Safe sender list. I'm glad to assist you on how to resolve this issue. To set your proper expectation, t<span>here
 are certain file types&nbsp;that automatically blocked&nbsp;when detected by Outlook.com server to reduce the risk of viruses being received through email.<br />
<br />
These are the&nbsp;file&nbsp;extensions that&nbsp;are blocked:<br />
<br />
.ade, .adp, .asp, .bas, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .crt, .exe, .hlp, .hta, .inf, .ins, .isp, .its, .js, .jse, .lnk, .mda, .mdb, .mde, .mdt, .mdw, .mdz, .msc, .msi, .msp, .mst, .pcd, .pif, .reg, .scr, .sct, .shs, .tmp, .url, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, vsmacros, .vss,
 .vst, .vsw, .ws, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh <br />
<br />
</span>If the email that you are supposed to receive is from a trusted contact, I would highly advise that you ask your contact to use a&nbsp;file compression software to change the attachment to a zip file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, we would to know if the issue happen to all file type of attachment&nbsp;that&nbsp;the sender is trying to send you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
