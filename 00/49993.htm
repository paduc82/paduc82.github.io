<p>
</p><p>I was using my Laptop casually and just flipped to show one of my mates the presentation I made after that wooooshhhhh! my touchscreen driver or the general screen calibration just died. I have tried everything, almost every single post on the Internet to
 figure how to fix this problem but no... I checked for windows updates, Installed various drivers from the Dell website and lots of other actions which didn't help (I forgot to mention... I have another copy of windows installed which isn't activated the laptop
 came with and ubuntu software which is harder to use than Mac OSX so I decided to use this copy version of windows......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I swear this bug is so annoying!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It will be great if &nbsp;you guys can find me another solution that can help me solve this problem.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw stopped working again&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Yet again, after an automatic windows update, Microsoft jigsaw has stopped working. Despite that fact that majong and the solitare collection work fine,&nbsp;&nbsp;and still have all my previous games from the cloud, Microsoft jigsaw will not let me log in to xboxlive, no matter what I do so I have lost all my points and&nbsp;all my jigsaw collections. This is the fourth time this has happened. The last time it happened,&nbsp;I was unable to recover any of my collections or points and it refused to let me&nbsp;log in for roughly 2 months and then suddenly gave the the option of getting everything back.</p><p>I have a PC with windows 10 so I can't understand why a Microsoft game breaks every time Microsoft does an update to a Microsoft computer!</p><p>If I don't get an immediate fix to this problem them I will give up and uninstall the game and find something else that is more reliable</p><p>Kathy Slater</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My computer will not open certain programs, and the network is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kal storch  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer will not open certain programs, and the network is not responding.</h2>
                    
<p>I really have no idea what is wrong with my computer, so I will just list the symptoms.</p>
<p>The first and foremost problem is that my computer won't open certain programs.&nbsp; I first noticed it when I tried to open iTunes and it did not open, no matter how many times I tried.&nbsp; I proceeded to restart my computer, and that opened a host of new issues.</p>
<p>My antivirus software - Windows Live OneCare - will not open.&nbsp; I tried to turn on Windows Defender to scan for malware, but it freezes up when I try to do so.&nbsp; Not only does iTunes not open, but neither does a few other programs I have on my computer - mainly
 the ones that could help me fix this, such as System Restore.&nbsp; When I try to uninstall a program - any program - nothing happens and it refuses to let me try to uninstall anything else, insisting something is uninstall already.&nbsp; And my computer no longer detects
 my printer.</p>
<p>Which leads to my other problem:&nbsp; I have two computers connected to a network via an Ethernet cable.&nbsp; The other computer is fine, and can access the Internet fine, but when it sends something to the printer, nothing happens on the printer's end.&nbsp; There is
 a red "X" on my network symbol on my computer in the lower right corner (next to the time), so I'm assuming that confirms my worries about the network.&nbsp; I don't understand exactly what the problem is, just that the other computer can't print (it's not connected
 directly to the printer; mine is).</p>
<p>Because Windows Live OneCare and Windows Defender are not working, I can't scan to see if this is the result of spyware or malware.&nbsp; And because whenever I click on System Restore, nothing happens, I can't revert the computers settings to anything else.&nbsp;
 I'm completely stuck.&nbsp; Most critical functions are simply not working.</p>

<p>The option for System Restore might be available from Safe Mode.</p>
<p>What you are describing sounds like you may have run into some nasty malware.&nbsp; See if you can download these two programs and run them on the failing machine.&nbsp; They will run from Safe Mode as well as Normal Mode.&nbsp; Safe Mode might be a better option.</p>
<p>I see lots of recommendations here for programs like -</p>

<p>Do update (the definitions) if you can.</p>

<p>Check your other abilities from within "Safe Mode with Networking" and see what else, including Print jobs, might run from there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried running&nbsp;out of the Windows environment?&nbsp; If you have an install DVD that you can boot to (or a Startup Repair option via the F8 Safe Mode screen), try launching the System Restore from the options provided when you go down the Startup Repair
 path.</p>
<p><br />
Do not perform the Startup Repair, just look for, and go to the option for System Restore (from the Choose a Recovery Tool dialog), as to whether it can help you or not is debatable as your last few restore points, and any later created ones will probably contain
 malware already, that is if it is a malware problem.&nbsp; After you clean out malware you should in any case delete all the old restore points to&nbsp;avoid the risk of reinfection.</p>

<p>If you have Vista then the Windows 7 Upgrade will pick that up and install with no problems, but the editions between operating systems must be suitable, Home Premium to Home Premium, or higher, you can't upgrade to a lower version.</p>

<p>Were you ever supplied installation disks, it is nit unusual for OEM's to supply a Recovery Partition on your hard drive.&nbsp; Check any manual supplied,&nbsp;or go to the manufacturer's website and see what your machine comes with.</p>
<p>One reason CD's or DVD's fail to boot is because the Boot options in the Bios have the hard drive booting ahead of any other media.&nbsp; You might have to check the settings in the Bios and set them accordingly.</p>

                    I am trying to Install Windows 8.1 on my computer.&nbsp; I currently have Windows Vista, but it seems that the install disk won't let me go directly to 8.1 with the existing operating system.&nbsp; Is there a way to reformat the computer inorder to install Windows
 8.1, or a less invasive way to get 8.1 from Vista?&nbsp; Thank-you....

            You must boot to the disk, not access vista at all. And Vista cannot be upgraded. The installation will completely remove it and all your files, so make copies of photos, docs, photos, etc. to reinstall afterwards. The disk will be reformatted and windows
 8.1 will be installed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Before starting the installation, you should run the Upgrade Assistant to make sure your hardware is compatible. You might need to upgrade or remove any hardware that cannot be used in 8.1. You might decide not to install 8.1 if your hardware cannot run
 it. MS does not recommend upgrading to 8.1 from vista or xp. Read this--</div>

<h2>            How to hide user account name at startup and disable password after logoff</h2>

</p><div>
<div>Hello,<br />
<br />
How can I hide the user account name during startup, after the windows 10 logo? There is only one account, the admin (me). It signs in automatically (no password input).<br />
<br />
I have also tried to disable the password after I logoff, but it still asks me for one when I login again.<br />
<br />
Thank you. </div>

I hate when i open a folder and it has changed the view, i&nbsp; usually use medium icons, and i don't know why but sometimes it changes like it had will of it´s own, from medium icons to details view.&nbsp;Please, does anyone knows how to prevent this from happening
 once and for all.<br />
<br />
Be well.

                    If I upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 10, can I run my existing copy of Rosetta Stone on Windows 10? I paid a lot for Rosetta Stone and I don't want to lose it.

            <p>I just upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10. &nbsp;I had Rosetta Stone German version 3.2. &nbsp;It runs fine in Windows 8 but will not start in Windows 10. &nbsp;Tried compatibility mode, Run as Administrator etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rosetta Stone offers an upgrade which they claim will work however you will be hard pressed to find a more greedy upgrade plan. &nbsp;You practically have to purchase it again as if it wasn't expensive enough when you bought it originally.</p>

            <p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported.

            <p>Hi Ashwin0,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great that you are making this effort to support me. Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried your methods, but both do not seem te work.</p>
<p>After that, I contected the Canon helpdesk and they sent me the driver for the MP600R. It still did not work. After I contacted Canon again, they confirmed that there is no driver for a MP600 for Windows 8 (yet). Sadly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it is already quite an aged printer, but it still functions well. Am I too emotional here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is buying a new mulrifunctional the only option?</p>

            Mike's right. If they have not made a driver thinking that the scanner is old, they won't.<br />
Here you have two options:<br />
<ol>
<li>Buy a new one that works with Windows 8( recommended).</li><li>Dual boot your OS with Windows X P or a similar OS that supports the printer( not recommended because dual booting can cause problems and it is recommended usually to install an old OS first and then a new one).</li></ol>
<p>The choice is yours finally....</p>
<p>Here is a page that shows you some of the new printers+ scanner( they're known as multifunction printers)</p>
<p>You prefer Cannon so the page shows all multifunction of Cannon.</p>
<p>The website is Indian but if you select it here you can either get it shipped or you can search for the same model on your country website.</p>
<p>The website also has a compare feature so making the choice won't be very hard.....</p>
<p><br />

<p>For further assistance, reply to this post.</p>

            Guys,
<div><br />
<div>A quick and easy trick - use the Windows 7 drivers (32-bit or 64-bit, depending on your OS)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a Canon MP600, downloaded the Windows 7 64-bit drivers, installed on my Windows 8 Pro 64-bit OS and hey presto! a working printing and scanning Canon MP600 multifunction device</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are the links to the drivers I used (in case you are interested):</div>
<div><br />
<div>32-bit version:&nbsp;<a href="http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0900190803.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0900190803.html</a></div>
<div>64-bit version:&nbsp;<a href="http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0900220403.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0900220403.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I can confirm the 64-bit windows 7 drivers work on my windows 8 pc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have used this trick many times before - the drivers for the previous OS usually work</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just one word of warning - don't install any 3rd-party applications. just install the drivers for your device, let Windows apps do the rest</div>
<div><br />
<div>Luke</div>

            <p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, I solved the problem - that I posted in May - by buying a new printer. I tried the windows 7 drivers then, but that didn't work.</p>

            Thank you so much. &nbsp;Even on my old XP desktop the scanner function would only work in conjunction with MP Navigator. When Canon told me they didn't have a Windows 8 driver, I tried downloading MP Navigator to an older laptop, but kept getting the message
 that the scanner driver was not installed. The printer works fine on all platforms, but I was getting so frustrated that I couldn't upload photos. Now my MP600 works like a dream with all functions active, and I don't have to keep switching laptops to use
 it. Thank you again, Di

</p><p>Thank you, so much. It worked a treat. (8.1 64Bit) I was at the head-banging stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled MP Navigator 3.0 and re-downloaded it from Canon as a precaution. The program started with no warnings about scanner drivers and imported a scanned document from my MP600 first go.</p>

<p><span><span>I’m French-Canadian, so I went to the European Canon website and chose France in order to download the MP600 software, and drivers. I then chose English Canada to download them to my Operating system Windows 8.1 (x64).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I’m really making this EASY for everyone because, Instead of going through the steps I did, AFTER my downloads were done, I went back to the Europe&nbsp;website and found the UK site which is in English for those who only speak one language. Prior

<h2>            Windows 10 freezing</h2>
                    Hello there, I recently updated my computer to windows 10. It appears that whenever my computer is plugged into the AC charger it works fine, but when it is not plugged, all I can do is log on then when my home screen loads, it completely freezes. I can't
 move my cursor let alone open a program. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

            I am still having issues however I have put them off since my laptop works normally with the power cord in. However when I unplug it, the mouse will continue to move for a few seconds then freezes in its place. If I plug the power cord in after it has
 froze, it will remain frozen until I restart my computer. Another thing I noticed was I can turn on and log into my laptop without freezing, however once it has gotten to my desktop screen, it freezes and will not do any actions.

<p>
This error message (0x800ccc02)&nbsp;<span>can be broken down to 2 causes:</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span>2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</span></p>

<h3> bloodiedcrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Won&#39;t Read Game Installation Discs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a new laptop and am currently running Windows 8.1 with a 64-bit OS and 16gb of RAM. When the new Diablo III: Reaper of Souls expansion came out I attempted to install it with the installation disc and my computer does not recognize the
 disc as existing. It does recognize the existence of CDs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The disc itself is brand new with no damage whatsoever and it works on my desktop just fine, but for the heck of it I tried some of my other game DVDs to see if they'd install and they do the same thing. The computer acts like they do not exist and the same
 happens for regular movie DVDs even though I do run VLC player. What's going on here and is there any way I can fix it? I know it's not the game discs that are at fault here since they work fine on my desktop and I would think if my drive were broken it wouldn't
 be able to run CDs and it does that just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Original Title:&nbsp;<strong>"IP address issue RE: ipconfig /release"</strong></p>
<p>I'm having issues with my internet. I called my isp and we've figured out that it's my computer, but we can not figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>My isp provider suggested I run ipconfig /release. The only problem is I get the following error response when I enter it into the command prompt:</p>
<p>An error occurred while releasing interface wireless network connection : The RPC server is unavailable.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>As a first step do Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, click on Services.<br />
Scroll down to <strong>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</strong> start it, and configure it to start automatically.</p>
<p>Then go over these steps and tell us where the breaking point is.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>

<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</p>
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If everything above is OK you have to be able to connect to the Router.&nbsp; A Window that says Connected does not means that your are really connected. Connecting to the Router means that you can enter the Router's core IP into an address bar of a browse,&nbsp;
 be able to connect, see, and configure the Router's menus. If it does not connecting to the Router log from any computer that can connect to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, (make sure that the Wireless broadcast SSID) is On,&nbsp; and
 try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>I really checked and configured every thing and it does Not work.</strong></p>
<p>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is <strong>On </strong>
.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>From a command prompt type ipconfig /all &gt;Desktop\Ipconfig.txt and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Paste the content of the Ipconfig.txt file that is on the desktop onto a post.</strong></p>

<p>Cdnees,</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused by your response to Jack's post. Did you ensure the RPC service is running, as Jack suggested?</p>
<p>Also, did you ensure your wireless adapter is working correctly by opening the Device Manager?</p>
<p>As many details as your can provide would help&nbsp;tremendously! Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Xbox360 at my moms house recently got the RROD (red ring of death) and we tried everything to fix it and we don't have it anymore. I had games that i bought on it (Skate 2, and Fable 2) and i was wondering if there is anyway I can get those games from
 that xbox360 and transfer them to my Xbox360 at my dad's house. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Had a quick question about transferring downloadable games as well. I have Ultimate MK 3 &amp; am planning on getting a new xbox slim soon. I have been told UMK3 is no longer available in the marketplace. I checked and have not seen it so when I get a new xbox
 will I not be able to transfer that game?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 upgrade - error message - unexpected store exception</h2>
                    after installing the free Windows 10 upgrade I keep getting the blue screen error message :( an error has occurred and your computer needs to be restarted. &nbsp;error code is "unexpected store exception". &nbsp;It then proceeds to restart. &nbsp;This happens when I
 turn the computer back on after being off or idle.

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            Thank you for the replies. &nbsp;I am not confident enough to try the suggestions offered unless someone walks me through it. &nbsp;I did try one thing from another thread. &nbsp;I unchecked the "turn on fast" and "sleep" buttons and it might be a little better but still
 get the error message "unexpected store exception" &nbsp;several times a day. &nbsp;It is also extremely slow to start up. &nbsp;I would really appreciate some help from microsoft on this.

            <p>Can you do the following to copy the minidump files to a folder on the Desktop and then zip them up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, create a folder on the Desktop and call it <em>Minidumps</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;open the C:\Windows\Minidump folder&nbsp;and do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home &gt; Select all &gt; Home &gt;&nbsp;Copy to &gt; Choose location &gt; <em>Minidumps </em>&gt; Copy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then right-click the <em>Minidumps</em> folder &gt; Send to &gt; Compressed (zipped) folder.</p>
