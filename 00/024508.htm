<h2>            Pivot Table &#124; Calculating Percentages in Subtotal Rows</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;I'm trying to calculate a percentage in a subtotal row using the following formula. &nbsp;Column M = Column L / Column D. &nbsp;My goal is to show the actual percentage in each row, including subtotal rows based on the values in two other cells. &nbsp;My raw data
 sheet already calculates these values however I can't figure out how to carry this calculation into the subtotal rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Columns D, L and M are highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.</p>

<h2>            &#60;domain&#62; was already added to a different Office 365 account NETORGxxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com.</h2>
                    
<p>I know other people have been able to get this resolved through private responses on this board, so I'm hoping for the same luck.&nbsp; I originally had my O365 business account set up through GoDaddy, but now am trying to move to Microsoft.&nbsp; I set up the account
 on Microsoft, cancelled everything on GoDaddy two days ago, but still get the message in the subject when I try to add my domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides talking to both Microsoft and GoDaddy support and getting fingers pointed at each other, here is what I've done so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleted the account and cancelled the service through GoDaddy.&nbsp; </li><li>Called Microsoft Support - They said that there is nothing they can do and GoDaddy needs to release it.&nbsp; BTW, when I mentioned I'm trying to not miss emails, the response of "at least it's a Sunday" was not helpful.
</li><li>Called GoDaddy Support - They said they've removed it from their system and Microsoft needs to update on their side.
</li><li>Removed all DNS records (MX, A, TXT) related to the Office365 service, with the exception of the TXT record for MS=msxxxxxx that I keep updating when I test if this works yet.
</li><li>I attempted to reset the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** password so I can get in, even though I think GoDaddy configured that automatically.&nbsp; It had my alternate email and office phone number, and would send me the email confirmation, but the phone
 call always just stated "We cannot confirm your account at this time".&nbsp; Actually, I only got the full sentence once; it was often the end of the sentence, or nothing at all.
</li><li>In the meantime, I've migrated my email to Google on their 30 day trial.&nbsp; When you can only get one service to work, you use that service instead of losing emails.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>Any advice to get this resolved would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Since I obviously have control of the domain, I'd really just like Microsoft to push this through.&nbsp; This doesn't include the fact that I've been paying for my new email for a couple days but
 can't use it yet.</p>

<p>I worked on the phone with John and Aleksandr, who were able to get the issue resolved by having me add GoDaddy to the call. &nbsp;Once GoDaddy was on the call, Aleksandr led them to resolving the issue, which is getting their advanced support involved to "remove
 the domain name from the tenant". &nbsp;Once this was resolved, they said it may take up to 24 hours, but I was able to immediately add the domain to the new account. &nbsp;For anyone else who gets this issue with a NETORG xxxxxx.onmicrosoft.com account, the end result
 is that GoDaddy needs to fix it from their side, even after your Office365 is complete cancelled and removed from your account. &nbsp;One other note, the old account would have finally expired on it's own from the Microsoft system in a month.</p>
<p>So again, the solution is to contact GoDaddy, have them escalate to advanced support and remove your domain from the "tenant" for your old Office365 account.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the support guys who helped!</p>

<h2>            Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure that the disk you want to save the file on is not full, write-protected or damaged</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently performed a clean install&nbsp;of Windows 7.</p>
<p>I am trying to save a Word document into My Documents. When in the Word window I click File &gt; Save as &gt; and browse to My Documents, on every attempt I get a popup with the above message.</p>
<p>The disk is not full. 80% is free. To my knowledge nothing is damaged.</p>
<p>I have tried to find out whether the C: drive is write-protected. I do not know where to find out. I went to&nbsp;Start &gt; Help and Support &gt; and typed 'write-protected' in the Search box. This produced no results.&nbsp;Help and Support&nbsp;does not appear to&nbsp;have an alphabetical
 list of all topics as was the case with XP so I do not know where to look for help.</p>
<p>Do I need to change some permissions to make the saving of a file to My Documents possible?</p>

<p>Go to <em><strong>Control Panel / Programs / Turn Windows Features on or off</strong>&nbsp;</em>and turn it ON.</p>
<p>

<p>As far as I know, .Net 4.7 or 4.8 supersedes all previous versions so I'm not sure why they specifically require v4.0 to be installed. Here's the link to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>.Net
 4.0 standalone installer</em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think anything bad will happen if you install it manually, maybe not even possible if Windows complains for being an older version. If it doesn't work, you can always uninstall it.</p>

<p>Are you sure that .NET is even an issue?&nbsp; Did you try using Compatibility mode to run your software?&nbsp; Find the EXE for it and right-click to find the Properties. You should be able to run the Compatibility Troubleshooter, or else just tell it to
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows 7</strong>.&nbsp; Your software may be checking for Windows 7 and does not recognize Windows 10.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response Don, I didn't know about that.&nbsp; It seems to&nbsp; have taken a little longer, but still tells me that it fails to install because it it incompatible with this version of windows during the scan to check for windows 7.&nbsp; I don't
 know what else to do.</p>

            Thanks Roger, I am not sure what to do.&nbsp; .net 4.7 includes 4.0, in addition I seemed to have been able to install part of the program (or at least it checked and confirmed that .net 4.0 is present) after I tried running the install .exe file in compatibility
 mode.&nbsp; Unfortunately I am still receiving the message and the install is hung up on "this version of windows is incompatible" when checking for Windows 7.

<p>I looked up Sage and they have had many different versions. I am guessing that you are running an older version. Do they offer free upgrades? Maybe you just need to upgrade.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response Don, I didn't know about that.&nbsp; It seems to&nbsp; have taken a little longer, but still tells me that it fails to install because it it incompatible with this version of windows during the scan to check for windows 7.&nbsp; I don't

<p>You could try the install executable by using the Compatibility Troubleshooter to run it. Just right-click it and a menu will appear. Select Troubleshoot compatibility.</p>

            If this software is definitively incompatible with Windows 10 which I doubt, maybe another option would be to have a dual boot system with W10 and W7 in different partitions. I will make sense if you use this software often. Good luck!

            I was thinking the same, depending on whether his Windows 10 was originally an upgrade from Windows 7. I have never had any trouble with activation of my original Windows 7 Ultimate on my primary PC. Mine was upgraded to Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and then
 Windows 10 Pro. If I clean-install any of those to a small partition (on this same PC that they are associated with) they still activate.

<h2>            Excel 2013 freezes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10, after which my excel started to crash. To fix the problem, I &nbsp;did the online repair through control panel/programs and features. Once it finished, excel told me I needed to enter my product key or would lose functionality
 by 2/29/16. I have lost my product key info, but can furnish an invoice showing I bought the software preinstalled in February, 2015.</p>
<p>How can I maintain the full functionality of excel?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>Given the situation you're using product key to activate your Office, you're using the MSI version Office product. Since Office 365 for Business plan doesn't provide this kind of activation method, we suggest you post in our

<p>This is normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access is backwards compatible, therefore 2019 can run older versions (2016, 2013, 2010, ...), but isn't forwards compatible.&nbsp; No software can be forward compatible as it doesn't know what is coming, what new feature will be added...&nbsp; This is why the golden
 rule of development (and this apply to all technologies typically, not just Access) is to always do all your development in the oldest version of the software that will be used to run the file/application/database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So say you have users running Access 2010, 2016 &amp; 2019 you need to do all the development in Access 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can do at this stage is create a new blank database in the oldest version of Access you have and try importing the various database objects.</p>

            The 2019 file probably uses features of 2019 that are new to 2019. You cannot expect to be able to open files created in newer versions with older versions.
<br />
<br />You will need to go back to whoever created the 2019 file and ask them to save it as an older format. That's the only way you may be able to open it.
<br />
<br />As a rule of thumb people should develop in the lowest version their users will be using.

            I found this URL before.&nbsp; I tried what was described, I still don't have access to the resume assistant.&nbsp; I just ran the updates from the account page and it said I had the latest version.&nbsp; Is the resume assistant available on Office 365 Home?&nbsp; Any other
 suggestions

            As far as I know it should work. I'd suggest trying to repair the installation.

<h2>            Reinstall of Office 2013</h2>
                    
<p>I recently, unfortunately, upgraded to Office 2016, not realizing the issues with Exchange Server 2007. &nbsp;I have since followed the posted instructions for uninstalling 2016 and reinstalling 2013; however, when I start any Office application now, I get a
 pop up box that instructs me to ""Choose my product". &nbsp;When I select Microsoft Office 365 Business Premium it tells me that my product isn't installed. &nbsp;When I select "Go to your account to install it" it bumps me to the Office 365 website and expects me to
 install Office 2016 again. &nbsp;I don't want this, I just want to reactivate my 2013 copy. &nbsp;This has been an extremely frustrating experience and I have lost hours of my time trying to revert back to 2013.</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>Please check what Office 365 subscriptions you have before you roll back to Office 2013. To check it: Log into the

<h2>            Outlook, Reply &#61; Reply to self... not reply to other</h2>
                    i guess i am too used &nbsp;to Gmail but i reply to something in outlook or really anything in the Hotmail system, and i end up replying to my self if i sent the last message not to the person i sent or received the message from. so my question is why does
 it do this and how do i fix it so that when i reply to something i NEVER send myself something unintentionally.&nbsp;

<p>its a bug an needs to be fixed i don't ever need to reply myself. and technically it is not Hotmail but an live.(school).edu account. but yeah it ain't a feature, it's a bug. if i hit reply i need to reply to the person that i originally sent or received
 the message from even if i have replied prior.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The only way it would use your address in a reply all is if you are using connected accounts or mail forwarding - if the email address the message was sent to is not the same as your account, outlook doesn't know it's you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Reply on a message in the sent folder, it will be to you, because your address is the from address. Use Reply all and delete your name or open it and use Actions &gt; Resend message and add your new comments to the message.

            <p>so so i did some poking about with the rules and it looks like i can run a script when this happens, where would i go to find out how to have it automatically redirect to the intended recipient?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;code&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>while(has next line())</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;line = &nbsp;get line;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; if line -&gt; contain ('@')<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if line != "(me)@live.(school).edu"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;redirect mail(line);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;/code&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>that should work but i don't know the scripting language or the functions i would need to scan the message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>also it seems that your first explanation is the most logical, our account system is set up a little wonky, we have an student ID based address and a Name Based address. we use the student ID account base to login and i believe we can use either to send
 email or receive email, but the system may convert the ID based email to the name based one. &nbsp;</p>

 it up (outside the don't run any other commands on it, which i was not planing on doing anyway.) i just don't have an API. i'm also too lazy too look it up some days.</p>

<h2>            Profile picture folder</h2>
                    
<p>In Sharepoint and on the Delve page the URL refers to 3 different folders, for different users, such as:</p>
<ul>

</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This gives errors, as in fact all the pictures are placed in "Profilbilleder" (the Danish folder), but the URL on the profile page points to the now non-existing English og Czech folders. These folders used to exist, but we deleted
 them and hoped that Sharepoint would start using the remaining Danish folder. But it seems still to point to the now non-existant folders, probably for the users that were created at the time the default picture URL for the tenant were set to these folders.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We would like all pictures to be placed in the English version "Profile Pictures" folder. So we'd like to move the pictures to that folder and ensure that the picture URL points to that location for ALL users, and the for new

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>You seem to want to update all users' photo location and make the picture URL points to the new location. If it’s the case, I recommend that you may have a look at the discussion here:
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sharepoint/en-US/d3010532-ae20-4eda-8f58-359f77d17e1e/user-profile-pictures-pointing-to-old-mysitehost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
social.technet.microsoft.com/.../user-profile-pictures-pointing-to-old-mysitehost</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, we may need scripts to do this as not an option available in SharePoint Online interface to achieve this. As a result, please also visit the TechNet forum above and find a possible method. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Hi PeterMalling9612,</p>
<p>Currently there is no manual settings which controls localized folders that is being used for new users because user profile pictures are saved in the default folder in my site host in SharePoint Online. I think your need should be met by scripts as April
 said. The engineers on the TechNet forum will give the best solution to you.</p>

<h2>            How to use Favorites folder on C&#58;&#92; drive in IE9</h2>
                    <p>1. How do I force IE9 to use the Favorites in my Favorites folder on the C: Drive?</p>
<p>2. Where should the Favorites folder be located (path)?<br />
</p>
<p>The reason is because I wish to use Windows Explorer to manage my Favorites. It is much quicker than using the Organize Favorites within IE9. I've been using this method for years and want to sort-combine-merge favorites from several
 PC's.<br />
</p>
<p>Currently, IE9 appears to be storing Favorites in some type of hidden database file, and I wish to avoid this.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,<br />

Run...&nbsp; shell:Favorites&nbsp; (or enter that in an Explorer window's Address bar).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then press Alt-d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that path where you think IE should be accessing Favorites?</p>

    <title>decimal places to be affected by combo box selection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darren blackwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            decimal places to be affected by combo box selection</h2>
                    I have a combo box where the selected abbreviation will affect the number of decimal places in another cell where figures are manually entered. The decimal places will range from 0 to 5.
<br />
<br />
The combobox contains abbreviations of product codes i.e TM, FGGT, etc up to 40+ &amp; the range of value can vary from 4 digits to possibly 10.<br />
<br />
So what I am looking for is if I select TM other columns require digits to be manually input with 2 decimal places, however, if I select FGGT the same columns in a different row will need to be 4 decimal places as per the product code selection from the combobox.
<br />
<br />
e.g TM = 2 decimals<br />
FGGT = 4 decimals,<br />
<br />
Any assistance is greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Can this be done? <br />
<br />
If so how?

            Ok I have worked it out....problem solved.<br />
<br />
The solution was quiet simple in the end. As the selections from the combbox is dynamic the ability to add over time is of value when finding a solution.<br />
<br />
One solution is to use multiple conditional formatting, perhaps others exist if so please add to this post. The solution can work for multiple conditions i.e number, letters, colour, etc.
<br />
<br />
Select in the following order; <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>conditional formatting</li><li>manage rules</li><li>new rule</li><li>use a new formula to determine which cell to format i.e =A1="TM"</li><li>format, to display Format Cells</li><li>number tab then number (or other condition) from the list</li><li>choose number (or other condition) number of decimal places i.e 4, click "OK"</li><li>click "OK" again</li><li>either repeat to add other New Rules when finalized or add additional rules, click "Apply"</li><li>"OK". Your done. <br />
</li></ul>
<p>Hope this helps someone. <br />

            Hi Ms. Anita,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. According to your description, you want to turn off the two-step verification of your Outlook account.<br />
<br />
If it’s a Microsoft account, you can sign in this account to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Security basic page</a> &gt; select <strong>more security options</strong> &gt; under <strong>
Two-step verification</strong>, choose <strong>Turn off two-step verification</strong> to turn it off.<br />
<br />
If it’s an Office 365 for Business account, you may need to contact the admin in your organization to help you turn it off. Once your admin
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enables-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enables</a> your organization with two-step verification (also called multi-factor authentication), you have to set up your account to use it.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

    <title>Count Characters of specific text fields of a multi-field form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanmic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Count Characters of specific text fields of a multi-field form</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a form that will be sent to a number of individuals for them to complete and return to me. &nbsp;The form has 50 fields that the user needs to complete. &nbsp;Upon receipt of the completed form, I copy text from 20 of the 50 fields, combine it, and paste
 it into a single text box of an online database application. &nbsp;The text box within the application has a character limitation that will not allow more than 4000 characters including spaces, punctuation, etc. &nbsp;I often receive forms that exceed this character
 limitation, which requires me to go back-and-forth with the users asking for them to revise and abbreviate their responses in the form, so it is revised to be under the character limitation. &nbsp;I am sincerely hoping that someone can assist me with a way to count
 the characters of only the fields I need. The goal would be to arrive at the total count of positions (i.e. - characters, spaces, punctuation) for the combined 20 fields I require. &nbsp;I was hoping to have the character count display in the form so users know
 when they are exceeding the maximum allowable amount.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried for days to figure this out, but I was only successful in getting a count for the total document, not the specific areas needed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best Regards,</div>
<div>Sean</div>

            You'll need a macro that takes a list of the names of the 20 form fields, and sums the counts of characters in those fields' results.<br />
<br />
It would be very difficult or impossible to make the macro display a running count as the user is entering data, because the kinds of events that are available to macros are quite limited. It could be set up to run whenever the document is saved, and pop up
 a message showing the total and an "exceeding the maximum" warning when appropriate. However, be aware that some users (or their companies) don't allow macros to run, and you can't force them to allow it.<br />
<br />
The basis of the macro will be code like the following:<br />
<br />
Sub Example()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fldList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fldListAry() As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fld As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim idx As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim totLen As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim flds As FormFields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Put the list of fields to count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' between the quotes, separated by commas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fldList = "Text1,Text3"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fldListAry = Split(fldList, ",")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set flds = ActiveDocument.FormFields<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For idx = 0 To UBound(fldListAry)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fld = fldListAry(idx)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totLen = totLen + Len(flds(fld).Result)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Total length = " &amp; totLen<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Assign your list of field names to the fldList variable as described in the comment.<br />
<br />
Getting the macro to run whenever the document is saved -- by any of several user actions -- will take additional code.<br />
<br />
This is not something that can be recorded by the macro recorder; it will have to be written from scratch. If you don't have the knowledge of VBA to do it, reply with the list of field names and someone here (if not me) will write it for you.<br />

    <title>Phantom email address in EVERYONE group - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Phantom email address in EVERYONE group</h2>
                    
<p>When a user sends an email to our EVERYONE group we always get a undeliverable message for an email address that doesnt exist anymore. There is no mailbox for this person in office 365 or on the exchange admin. There is no Active Directory Account for this
 user. I have not been able to find any forwarding rules or connectors to this address, or any groups that it belongs to. I am at a loss where to look to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>hi jaredparks,</p>
<p>firstly, may i confirm if it’s the scenario: the user who send an email to the group will receive an ndr (non-delivery report). if so, i need to collect the following information to narrow down the issue:</p>
<p>1. may i know what type of the “everyone group” you mentioned is, distribution group, security group or dynamic distribution group? also, where did you create the group?<br />
2. please provide an ndr (non-delivery report) for our analysis.<br />
3. about “there is no active directory account for this user”, may i confirm if you’re using exchange on-premises, pure office 365 or hybrid environment?<br />
4. follow the steps below to see if you can the details of the mailbox using remote powershell:</p>
<p>a. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to exchange online using remote powershell</a>.(n<strong>ote: you need to use a admin account to connect to exchange online</strong>)<br />
b. run the following cmdlet:</p>
<p><em><strong>get-mailbox -identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></em></p>
<p>if you get any error message, provide it with us for further investigation. to upload a picture, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click <strong>insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>

<p>Hi JaredParks,</p>
<p>Thanks for the NDR via private message.</p>
<p>However, to further narrow the issue, the rest information I mentioned above is also important for our analysis:</p>
<p>1. May I know if specific users or all users encounter the issue or all users in the Group?<br />
2. About “There is no Active Directory Account for this user”, May I confirm if you’re using Exchange on-premises, pure Office 365 or Hybrid environment?<br />
3. Follow the steps below using remote PowerShell to see you can get corresponding information:</p>
<p>a. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>.(<strong>Note: You need to use a admin account to connect to Exchange Online</strong>)<br />
b. Run the following cmdlet to see if the none existent email address is listed in the result.</p>
<p><em><strong>Get-Recipient -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></em></p>
<p>c. Use the following cmdlet to see if the user who received the NDR have set up corresponding inbox rule:</p>
<p><em><strong>Get-InboxRule -Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></em> (Use the account which received the NDR to replace *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>If you get any inbox rules, please contact the user to check if he/she has set up such forward/redirect inbox rules.</p>
<p>d. Use the following cmdlet to get the members of the group to see if the none-existent@yourdomain is listed in the result.</p>
<p><em><strong>Get-DistributionGroupMember -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></em></p>

<p>Hi JaredParks,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>According to the NDR you provided, I noticed this: X-MS-Exchange-Inbox-Rules-Loop:
<em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em></p>
<p>So I would suggest you check whether there is an inbox rule created in this email address. It may cause email delivery in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>We look forward to your update.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Lance</p>

<p><span>Hi Тремичев Иван Андреевич,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your above information, maybe it is related to the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync. To confirm it, please follow the below steps to check it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Confirm that ActiveSync is enabled for the user</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Confirm that the mobile device isn't blocked by an ActiveSync quarantine rule</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Confirm that ActiveSync can be set up by using Autodiscover</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Set up the mobile device without using Autodiscover (if you don't want to use Autodiscover)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: If you are an end-user, please involve your admin here to check the above steps one by one. And let us know the result. Please see the
<strong>Solution</strong> part in the below article to get the detailed information:<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, could you please also provide us a screenshot about that pop-up window for further checking? Also, please involve your admin to confirm if you are in the Hybrid environment? And if the domain (like
 @<strong>contoso.com</strong>) in your Office 365 account is a federated domain? If so, if the ADFS server is hosted on third party or not? It’s important for us to narrow down this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, admin may know any group policy blocks the mobile device access the resource in your organization. Please also confirm it.

<p><span>Hi Тремичев Иван Андреевич,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings. This is Alan Wu from Office 365 forum support and I am here to follow up on this thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Via your PM, we have found that</span></p>
<p><span>1. Your account's SSO test is completely successful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your account (domain) hasn't been added the Outlook Auto-discover DNS record.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About the above second point, it is mostly like to be the issue's factor. So, I suggest you re-confirm whether it works fine after the domain's Auto-discover record is added. You may contact your admin
 for help as adding the domain's DNS record needs to be done by an admin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are here looking forward to your update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,<br />
Alan</span></p>

    <title>Multiple employees in a mail merge on the same page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lostinmerge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple employees in a mail merge on the same page</h2>
                    <p>Need help with a Microsoft Word Advanced mail merge with multiple employees and their leave hours which they have currently, projected, and need to take or forfeit&nbsp;on the same letter with their respected supervisor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the basic merge but don't understand how or what and where to&nbsp;input the proper codes to advance the next set of employees and their supervisor and for them all to have their own page so that eventually can email the one&nbsp;document&nbsp;with ALL there
 employees leave hours.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;working with a database of about 300 employee est. and I would say about 50-100 supervisors to have to send letters to showing their staff has these leave hours currently.&nbsp; I also have inputted the information in a table if that
 helps the merge&nbsp;or would it hurt me more?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have explained enough to get a clear answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for help and patience.</p>

            You can use Word's Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge facility for this (the terminology depends on the Word version). To see how to do so with any mailmerge data source supported by Word, check out my
<strong>Microsoft Word Catalogue/Directory Mailmerge Tutorial </strong>at:<br />
<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154370-Microsoft-Word-Catalogue-Directory-Mailmerge-Tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/154370-Microsoft-Word-Catalogue-Directory-Mailmerge-Tutorial</a><br />
or:<br />
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Zips/Catalogue%20Mailmerge.zip</a><br />
The tutorial covers everything from list creation to the insertion &amp; calculation of values in multi-record tables in letters. Do read the tutorial before trying to use the mailmerge document included with it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The field coding for this is complex. However, since the tutorial document includes working field codes for all of its examples, most of the hard work has already been done for you - you should be able to do little more than copy/paste the relevant field codes
 into your own mailmerge main document, substitute/insert&nbsp; your own field names and adjust the formatting to get the results you desire. For some worked examples, see the attachments to the posts at:<br />
<a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/9180-mail-merge-duplicate-names-but-different-dollar.html#post23345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/9180-mail-merge-duplicate-names-but-different-dollar.html#post23345</a><br />

<a href="http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/157725-Word-2010-Merge-from-excel-into-Table-Directory?p=928391&amp;viewfull=1#post928391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowssecrets.com/forums/showthread.php/157725-Word-2010-Merge-from-excel-into-Table-Directory?p=928391&amp;viewfull=1#post928391</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Another option would be to use a DATABASE field in a normal ‘letter’ mailmerge main document and a macro to drive the process. An example of this approach can be found at:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/many-to-one-email-merge-using-tables/8bce1798-fbe8-41f9-a121-1996c14dca5d">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/many-to-one-email-merge-using-tables/8bce1798-fbe8-41f9-a121-1996c14dca5d</a>. The output is a table emailed directly to each supervisor.<br />
The DATABASE field can even be used without recourse to a mailmerge. An example of such usage can be found at:
<a href="http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/21847-mail-merge-into-different-coloumns.html#post67097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.msofficeforums.com/mail-merge/21847-mail-merge-into-different-coloumns.html#post67097</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Alternatively, you may want to try one of the Many-to-One Mail Merge add-ins, from:<br />
Graham Mayor at <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm</a>; or<br />
Doug Robbins at <a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
In addition to a 'Many to One' merge, the latter handles:<br />
• Merge with Charts<br />
• Duplex Merge<br />
• Merge with FormFields<br />
• Merge with Attachments<br />
• Merge to Individual Documents<br />
• Merge, Print and Staple

            <p>I assume that&nbsp;by "borders"&nbsp; you mean the table gridlines&nbsp;and not an actual printing border. Since labels are formatted as a table, when the insertion point is in a label, you will get the contextual Table Tools tabs. Select the Table Tools | Layout tab.
 In the Table group (far left), click on View Gridlines to turn it on.</p>
