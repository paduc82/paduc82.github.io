<h2>            Map chart not available in Excel 365 Pro Plus</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office365 Pro Plus subscription [Deferred Channel Version 1701 (Build 7766.2092)].&nbsp; Last week I received an Office update which got the map chart.&nbsp; I know&nbsp;that because when I go to File &gt; Account &gt; What's New, I see Maps there.&nbsp; As you can see
 in the snapshot below, I can also see maps in File &gt; Options &gt; Customise Ribbon.&nbsp; However, I do not see maps&nbsp;under the Insert Ribbon (see image below).&nbsp; Why do in not see Maps under the Insert Ribbon and more importantly, how do I get it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

    <title>Unable to send SMS &#40;N95&#41; Has been working fine until last - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n95dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to send SMS &#40;N95&#41; Has been working fine until last night ...</h2>
                    Any help with this will be most appreciated!<br />
<br />
I have an N95 original.<br />
I live in Australia and my carrier is Optus.<br />
I have been using this phone without problem since I purchased it in October 2007.<br />
I have not installed anything or changed any settings recently.<br />
Last night, out of the blue, I sent a text message to a friend and noticed the Outbox sending icon remained at the top right of the screen. My friend SMS'd me ten minutes later saying they received the same message 4 times. I rebooted my phone and deleted the
 message which was still sitting in the Outbox folder.<br />
Ever since then, I have not been able to send any SMS messages. Every SMS message remains in the Outbox until finally I get the sending failed message.<br />
I can recieve SMS messages without problem.<br />
I can make and recieve voice calls and video calls.<br />
This problem is limited to just sending SMS messages.<br />
I have tried using my SIM card in another mobile phone and I've successfully sent SMS messages. The problem only occurs when I try to send SMS messages on my N95.<br />
I am using the latest software/firmware version (checked today).<br />
I have also verified the following with Optus tech support:<br />
menu/messaging/options/settings/text message/message centres/smsc1/+61411990001<br />
<br />
I am totally stumped and do not know what to do.<br />
PLEASE HELP!

    <title>Microsoft Word document card led me to scammers and said I had an IP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> desmajones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word document card led me to scammers and said I had an IP infection</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new computer, a H.P.&nbsp; I wanted word document etc and was disappointed that you cannot by the c.d.s to download. You buy a card instead and scratch off the numbers and enter them and then download. After I set up my computer and got it running,
 I decided to immediately download the word document. A page come up telling me that there were problems with my computer and that to call a number in the United States. There were other numbers for different parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These guys told me that I had a virus in my IP address. Because the card was from Microsoft, I thought it was valid though my spirit inside me told me something was wrong. I should have looked up that your IP address cannot get infected.&nbsp; They did a kind
 of "teamview" program and gave me a virus protection and said that they removed the infection from my IP and they downloaded the Microsoft word etc.&nbsp; They said that they were called Addnox. I paid with an online check. They did not want credit card of debit
 card. I do not bank online and I do not pay my bills online. The check cleared. I guess they could have moved the decimal point . The cost was $259.00 in all. I called the bank everyday to check our balance etc. I am thinking that the consequences would have
 been worse if we banked online. They could have hit us at an unsuspecting moment. When I called the two numbers that I got from them, they are no longer in service and disconnected and that really sent another red flag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took my computer back down to Office Max and a technician looked at it. They run their own virus scan and he said that he found nothing unusual. I had also ran a McAffee scan the day before, a full one. I did have him remove and shred the so called virus
 protection that they gave me.&nbsp; In time I am sure it would have probably clashed with the McAffee anyhow even though I asked the so called "Addnox" tech if it would clash and he said no. I caught them in a couple lies so I don't trust that either and that is
 another reason why I had it removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to keep the cd's out so horrible crap like this does not happen and we get taken. At least it was not for a huge amount. It is a brand new computer and when I put those numbers in, that should not have happened. It should have directed me
 to Microsoft and I should have been more alert on that too. I thought maybe Microsoft had other people working on the side for them.&nbsp; I checked the numbers a couple times too to check in case I entered them wrong. My new computer came with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What happened to you was a coincidence. It had nothing to do with Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a common scam that you could have ended with the Task Manager. Now you must consider everything on your computer has been compromised. Passwords, PIN numbers, financial account information. A clean install of Windows is the best option and what I would
 do myself. See the following and decide if you want to tempt fate not knowing what they may have installed on your computer.

<p>You were not talking to Microsoft! I get these popup all the time. Scammers hijack links and insert a script that keeps the popup going. This is what you could have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a common scam. Click the X to close the window. You should then see a box at the bottom, Do not allow this site to create new messages. Check it and then close that window and finally the popup.</p>

            I put in the numbers that I scratched off from the back of the Microsoft word document card that I bought. When I put the number it, a page come up. I knew I was not talking to Microsoft. Where do I report scammers like this. I just got done talking with
 one of them on the phone. The bank did a check on the check they cashed from me and was able to find the bank and got a phone number. I called it and it was them. He sounded afraid and wanted to know how I got the number. I would not let him know.&nbsp; He said
 that they would send me a refund. I told him that I would believe it when I see it. They sound Indian. He said his name was Simran. They are located in New York and bank at Chase Bank. I was able to find that out.&nbsp;

            There is a typo in the message above where I said that I knew I was not talking with Microsoft. Since it was a whole page that come up and not a pop up, I thought that they were connected with Microsoft. I cannot even remember if I asked them if they were.
 I was so flustered that I had bought a new computer and new card to download word document etc. I sure wish you still sold the CD's. with the activation numbers. Way safer. Microsoft should care more about the buyers rather than how much money that they make.
 I paid $149 for that ca.rd. Hope you can find them. If you move fast enough you may be able to. I doubt that a scammer would send a refund check.&nbsp;

            I did report it and gave the name of the bank that the man at our bank checked into where the check was cashed. They are in New York State at Chase Bank cashing their checks under Addnox. That should be easy to catch and the law could put a lean on their
 account and a lawsuit started.&nbsp; I have reported it at two different places.&nbsp;

<p>Baloney! This can happen when you Google or visit any site. It is not limited to Microsoft sites. And it isn't limited to Windows browsers. You can use Apple's Safari and have this happen. It's a scam period.</p>

<h2>            Printing problem with old Word 97 to new HP Envy Photo 7855</h2>
                    I am using old Word &amp; Excel 97 program for many years and with several printers.&nbsp; I cannot get any Word 97 document to print to my HP 7855 printer installed today.&nbsp; New printer does show up in Word dialog box and I selected it - but when I do this causes
 Word to stop responding and I have to close it.&nbsp; All my Excel 97 documents print fine.&nbsp; Also all other software and web sites print fine to the new HP 7855.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            There is probably some incompatibility between the printer driver and Office.&nbsp; It is really an HP issue, even if they deny it.&nbsp; You might try a more generic printer driver than the one specifically for the HP Envy. &nbsp;

            Thanks for the suggestion Doug.&nbsp; I am not sure how to go about using a generic printer driver.&nbsp; Could I use it just for Word 97 and leave the other programs using the HP Envy driver?&nbsp; If so, how would I do it?

<p>Before I tried the Compatibility Pack, I went back into Word97 and found that if I click on the Print icon on my top toolbar the document printed.&nbsp; Also if I select Tools and print Envelopes and Labels - from that dialog box I can print envelope.&nbsp; So this
 is making me think something is not working in my File Print dialog box - which I use all the time as it gives me the choice of what page, two-sided, etc.&nbsp; Printing from the toolbar Print icon, it prints whole document without any choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Word97 from my original CD and that did not fix this problem.&nbsp; Also I find I cannot print to my Adobe PDF driver either from the File Print dialog box.&nbsp; Any thoughts on just this issue in Word97?</p>

                    <p>We have Windows 10 PC at home, we already have&nbsp;My Family setup for the kid to use the computer. And it is working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, we are trying to setup a windows phone for the kid. But nothing can't be downloaded or updated&nbsp;from the store, due to persistent error message "My Family needs to be set up before you can get this app."</p>
<p>I have read most of the support blogs online. Everything looks correct in My Family setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The kid has been identified as Child in the My Family Setup. And the Microsoft account is the same account that's been used to register the windows phone.
</p>
<p>- I have turn off all blocking setting in My Family. So, her online access is not restricted.</p>
<p>- And the Purchasing for the kid is set to "Free and Paid". </p>
<p>
</p><p>========</p>
<p>What do I miss? Please advise</p>

    <title>Year to date totals - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard g wynn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Year to date totals</h2>
                    <p>Please can anybody help me with a problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the same spreadsheet in Excel, I want weekly sales and year to date sales. I can enter weekly sales figures in column A, but how do I add them on cumulatively via formulas to column B to show the running total of sales to date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Column A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Column B</p>
<p>Weekly Sales &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Year to date Sales</p>
<p>
</p><p>535 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1068</p>
<p>487 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15223</p>
<p>658 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1823</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to have a formula so when, in the example above, I enter 535 in column A for sales this week, it automatically is added to 1068 that is the year to date figure, PRIOR to entering this weeks sales of 535 - (column B should read 1068 + 535 =
 1603)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate I could have a Column C and write a simple formula to add col A and Col B to go in Col C to have the running year to date total, but when I enter the following weeks figures in Col A, the Col B figures will be incorrect as the figures I need
 will be in Col C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you haven't shot yourself out of boredom reading the above, but I find it difficult to explain. If anybody is kind enough to answer, please can you make the answer easy to understand - imagine I'm an 8 year old, because when it comes to computers,
 I'm a bit of a dinosaur! &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Samsung GT-S7530 will not fully turn on before shutting down</h2>
                    <p>I live abroad and I went to turn on my UK phone after 3-4 months (the Samsung GT-S7530) and it turns on, shows the Samsung screen, then shows the blue Windows screen and the bleep that goes with it, then immediately says Good Bye and switches off.</p>
<p>If it's on charge it cycles between these repeatedly, off charge it will just turn on and off once. It does this with or without the sim card in.</p>
<p>Any ideas? I don't really want to have to buy a new phone for my once per year usage if I can help it.</p>
<p>Also - not sure if it is relevant but I switched from Pay Monthly to PAYG and they sent me a new sim card for this.</p>

<h3> peter in alaska  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controlled Folder Access in Windows Defender blocked MS Office 365 &#40;Sept 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>There is a good discussion of this issue but the thread has been locked. I am having the same problem today. A file I worked on in MS Word on September 7th is now unable to be saved a week later. The only system changes have been Updates. How do I seamlessly
 get MS Office (include Excel, Access, Word, etc.) to be able to write to the My Documents folder? Even more confusing, other family members are not experiencing the same problem. (But maybe that is me not setting up the controlled folders correctly for them?)
 My current work around is to save it to an external drive. I really don't want to start adding Microsoft Products to my Controlled Folder Access particularly since the Office exe files are already on an "exploit protection" list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thread with more background:</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. I do want to acknowledge Rob's lengthy summary and explanation for why the above thread has been locked. I have not tried running "Repair Upgrades" as it seems an upgrade was what caused the issue to begin with.</p>

            Controlled Folder Access is still maturing and the best way for users to overcome scenarios like this is to just disable it. Its not gonna be the end of your world. Its really to protect against ransomware. Considering, prior to 2016, over billion Windows users never had ransomware protection for nearly 30 years in Windows, I am sure you can live without. 
<br />
<br />It needs work. 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />in later versions
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Ransomware protection
<br />Toggle off Controlled folder access

            Hi Javablood,<br />
<br />
First, we suggest you check the excel file content and use <strong>Save as</strong> to save a copy of it in your local drive, then import the data from the copy.<br />
<br />
For further troubleshooting, we would like to confirm a few questions with you, could you take a look?<br />
1. What if you create a new blank database and import the same Excel file? Still have this notice?<br />
2. Could you share a screenshot of the Security notice?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

<p>Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is bizarre because the security notice said the file was under Program Files yet the trust center in Access had the files under Program Filex (x86).&nbsp; Do not know why as I am running 64 bit.&nbsp; Anyway, I added MS Office and sub directories for both locations.&nbsp;
 Tried again, no go.&nbsp; Checked Excel named manager and it had the Access table in with no reference (not sure how that got there) so I deleted it.&nbsp; I tried to import and everything looks good yet no data in the table.&nbsp; Argh!!!<br />

            Is this perhaps a situation of some 64-bit components (Excel) and 32-bit components (Access)? Nothing good can come from that.<br />

<p>Hi javablood,<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing.<br />
<br />
The path in the image you have shared is a default database file in Access: </p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\ACCWIZ\ACWZLIB.ACCDE.</p>
<p>Can you open the database file in that location?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you try Quick Repair at the beginning of this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair an Office application</a>. The process might take some time.<br />
<br />
Besides, What if you click Open?<br />
could you share a screenshot like this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39071143-edf7-4226-b2d3-e7a180d651d8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39071143-edf7-4226-b2d3-e7a180d651d8?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Just to clarify, does this happen to other workbooks?<br />
<br />

<p>Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a quick repair and an online repair before I even made the post.&nbsp; I also checked to make sure Office 365 was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the file in the location yet did not try to open it.&nbsp; Does Access create it each time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had the opportunity to try other workbooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is what happened.&nbsp; I tried a different worksheet in the same workbook (import as print area) and it worked.&nbsp; So, I copied/pasted the trouble worksheet into a new worksheet and tried again - no go.&nbsp; So instead of using the print area, I set a named
 range and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was bizarre and I still do not know why it happened!&nbsp; Any ideas would be appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

    <title>Error with Visio Professional 2010 install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billbites  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error with Visio Professional 2010 install</h2>
                    I just purchased and downloaded MS Visio Professional 2010. It downloaded as an .ISO file which I burned onto a DVD. When the DVD autorun started, I selected run setup.exe. Setup started, and after awhile I got the message "Setup cannot continue because
 a required file is either corrupted or not available." I have Windows 7 Professional and Microsoft Office Pro 2010 installed. It just amazes me that Windows is unable to install an Office suite program with an existing office suite installed. BTW, all office
 programs run fine, the DVD player/burner that I used is fine, etc.

            Copy the file from the DVD to your hard drive, then install it from there.<br />
Might not be the right answer, worth trying anyway.<br />

            Thanks for the response Paul.
<div><br />
<div>I was able to solve the problem today, but it was a work-around. The volume distribution website where I purchased the product offered two options for Visio Pro 2010: with and without SP1 upgrade included. I had been trying to install the version with
 the SP1 upgrade when I ran into the problem described above. Today I downloaded the plain version without the SP1 upgrade and it installed fine. Not sure why this would make a difference, and it's possible that there was just something wrong with the other
 iso (even though the dvd opened fine and you could browse through it with no trouble). Anyway, now happily Visioing...</div>

            <p>Hello Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the ISO file gets corrupted in some fashion, either on the server side or during the download. Personally I would let the site you purchased it from know so they can resolve the issue for other users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for you purchase and I hope you are enjoying Visio. </p>

            If the ISO became corrupted would that not affect thedigital signatures of the contained files? Surely that would bring up some warning!<br />

<h3> an irish lassie  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot access casino in msn games</h2>
                    <p>I was actively playing Solitaire at the msn zone casino / vegas world yesterday when the site disconnected me. This has been a frequent problem to MANY players at the game site. The times it has happened to me has for the most part been few. However, over
 the past few days has been more fequent. Up until yesterday, Tuesday, March 7, 2017, I have been able to stay at the site when selecting the "try again" option in the disconnection notification box which appears.
</p>
<p>However, since the disconnection yesterday, the site will not load. I get to the site, but have a black screen and nothing loads.</p>
<p>I have checked my browser, flash player, and java. All are the current versions per their sites.</p>
<p>Is there anyone out there who encountered the same problem and what have you done to correct it ?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            The installation files might be corrupt. Can you try downloading another copy then try again? If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the file again.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to disassociate your Gmail account in Outlook.com. I will be glad to help you out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on how you setup your account in Outlook.com. Did you use this Gmail account as a direct email as sign in credential in Outlook.com or did you set up your email account as a send and receive account in your Microsoft email account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            The screen seems to have changed and the 'Delete' option is no longer available. I want to keep my Microsoft account and outlook alias, but not import or manage my Gmail email into Outlook, as my Gmail account is apparently too large for outlook.com to
 swallow.

    <title>Linking to Sharepoint List from MS Access Programmatically in VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pklocke01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking to Sharepoint List from MS Access Programmatically in VBA</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using sharepoint lists as a kind of poor man's DB server.&nbsp; I link to the lists via MS Access and literally every table in&nbsp;my&nbsp;Access&nbsp;DB (other than internal "work" tables) reside on the Sharepoint server (believe is SP 2007).</p>
<p>Others who perform a similar job to the one I have, would like to leverage the development work I have done inside Access, with the linked tables.</p>
<p>What I am looking for a way to programmatically create, and remain linked to, sharepoint lists.&nbsp; Thus, for example, if I just emailed you my DB, you could run, perhaps, a switchboard items that says "Create my sharepoint lists", and it would go out to a
 provided sharepoint URL (likely an input box I would provide), create all the tables and link to them, out on the sharepoint.</p>
<p>Is this possible to do?&nbsp; Most of my work has been "for me" and I create my own sharepoint lists, and simply link to them.&nbsp; But, to share my work with others who may not even know how to create a sharepoint list, much less link to it, I am thinking I should
 just do it for them.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

            &nbsp;
<p>Hi pklocke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I follow what you're looking to do, but from the little I found in playing around with the process, it may not be worth it to try to do this programmatically rather than using the built-in functionality
 that allows you to transfer your tables to SharePoint.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was able to get the following code to work for me . . . sorta:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Dim objTable As Object</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">For Each objTable In CurrentDb.TableDefs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If Left(objTable.Name, 4) &lt;&gt; "Msys" Then</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>DoCmd.TransferDatabase acExport, "WSS", Me.txtSitePath, acTable, objTable.Name, objTable.Name</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>DoCmd.DeleteObject acTable, objTable.Name</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>DoCmd.TransferSharePointList acLinkSharePointList, Me.txtSitePath, objTable.Name, , objTable.Name</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>End If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Next objTable</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to use TransferDatabase to export as there is no export TransferType argument for the TransferSharePointList method.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in the code I had to test for whether or not the table I'm exporting is a system table (that's the check to see if it starts with Msys), and that's just the tip of the iceberg of potential
 problems that might crop up with this method.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other issues I encountered that I'm didn’t address in the sample code here were relationships keeping a table from being deleted and linked tables being exported to SharePoint.<span>&nbsp;</span>There
 of course could be others that I'm not thinking of or didn't see as well.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should note that the code above is running on the click event of a button I created on a form and that form also includes a text box control called txtSitePath where the user would enter his or her
 site name.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 acting wonky - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lar_51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 acting wonky</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook 2013 has recently started acting strange. First, it won't log onto my gmail account; it keeps prompting me to enter the gmail password, but when I do it gives me an invalid password error. But the password worked in Outlook for a long time, and
 the password still gets me into gmail from the Google website, so it's not a password error, it's something screwy with Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, when I try to add a new Outlook Exchange account, it says I've maxed out on the number of allowable Exchange accounts. But I have only one Exchange account set up, so I'm pretty sure the local Outlook 2013 is the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, when the program starts up, it tells me it can't find the .pst file. It's where it's always been, but Outlook is expecting to find it on a nonexistent drive (e:, but I don't have an e: drive and never have).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a repair install, but no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Office 2013 in Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like a pref file may have gotten corrupted or something. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks!</p>

<p>I go to OneDrive settings on disable "File-On-Demand" which copy all files to my local OneDrive folder and I quit OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I must be stupid;. &nbsp; I go to Microsoft OneDrive online and open up my account. I don't see any disable "file-on-demand" thing to click on.&nbsp; I just can't seem to get to SETTINGS where is gives me the options I keep reading about and so many&nbsp; answers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This all started from&nbsp; when I went to my folders for OneDrive on my PC and opened up a picture folder and counldn't view the&nbsp; pictures that were there. On the bottom left of my screen it said they were "online", but I can find how to change all of that to
 "offine' I appreciate your help. Microsoft help is totally USELESS. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My problem is when I right click on the taskbar OneDrive Icon it doesn't help me at all.&nbsp; That's been my main problem is I read what to do but when I try to do it nothing ever matches up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't view what pictures there are in a OneDrive pictures folders. They are there and visible in the OneDrive online. I'll probably have to take it to a repair guy. I think I've messed with it so much I've screwed it up.</p>

            Does this happen to involve an IMAP account? If yes, and if your contact/calendar data was stored in folders with the added label of "This Computer Only" in the folder description, then the data in those folders is permanently lost unless you manually backed up (exported) those folders to a PST file.
<br />
<br />If you have a copy of the original .ost file containing those folders, you would need a 3rd party OST2PST file conversion program to recover those folders.

Karl, thanks so much for your prompt reply - however devastating it may be because it does involve an IMAP account.&nbsp; I can retrieve much of my calendar &amp; contacts from having saved before I had to ship my HP notebook to HP for repair.&nbsp; However, I will have
 lost all updates from the past few months.&nbsp; I appreciate your providing information to prevent this disaster in the future.&nbsp; Tks, Dee

            Am confused with your designation of the answer not resolving the issue given the information provided in response by you.
<br />
<br />Given that you've acknowledged using an IMAP account and losing access to the Outlook profile/email account/.ost file for the account, unfortunately, you will have lost all contact/calendar data not backed up (exported or otherwise saved) prior to the system getting reset.
<br />
<br />What information are you looking for given that there is no way to recover the lost information?

<h2>            Office Lens Windows 10 phone how to close app</h2>
                    I am having difficulty exiting (closing) the Office Lens app on my Lumia 950 (Win 10) phone. The "back" arrow is "missing" on the camera view so I am forced to snap a photo just to proceed to the next step Saving the image. At this point no back arrow
 has appeared so the only way I can exit is 1. open the camera app 2. minimize the camera app 3. now the Office Lens is minimized and I can swipe down to close. This is convoluted at best. Please help what am I missing here?
