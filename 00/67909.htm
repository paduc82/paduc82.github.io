            <p>Yes, it is. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Windows 8 Pro upgrade assistant to determine your system readiness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also downloading it from the Store:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8-Pro/productID.257987100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8-Pro/productID.257987100</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.
</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model. </li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation

<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>

<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>
<p><strong>32 or 64 bit</strong></p>
<p>My recommendations depend on what you have installed. If you currently have 32 bit Windows 7 installed, use 32 bit Windows 8. If you have 64 bit Windows 7, use 64 bit Windows 8. This is to ensure a smooth migration, especially where driver compatibility
 is concerned. Another factor is RAM. If you have max 3 GBs of RAM, then 32 bit should be sufficient for your needs. If you happen to have 4 to 8 GBs or more RAM, then 64 bit would be suitable.
</p>
<p>Windows 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit
 Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 64 bit is more secure too, malicious
 code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.
</p>
<p><strong>Starting setup</strong></p>
<p>To start the installation, first boot to the Windows 7 desktop. If you are installing Windows 8 from a physical DVD these instructions will apply to you. Insert the Windows 8 disc. When the AutoPlay window appears, click ‘Run setup.exe’. Click Continue when
 prompted by User Account control.</p>

<p>Setup will then begin.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image16.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage16_thumb.png%3fw%3d447%26amp%3bh%3d337" height="337" width="447" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while setup prepares to install Windows 8. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image231.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage23_thumb1.png%3fw%3d441%26amp%3bh%3d346" height="346" width="441" /></a></p>
<p>If prompted to get updates, I recommend you do so. If you are not connected to the Internet, select ‘No, thanks’.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image27.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage27_thumb.png%3fw%3d435%26amp%3bh%3d341" height="341" width="435" /></a></p>
<p>Enter your product key. If you purchased Windows 8 from the Microsoft Store and you are using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, the key will be embedded. If you download a .ISO file or purchased Windows 8 on DVD, check your email when you registered to purchase
 the upgrade or check your Windows 8 product packaging for the product key. After Entering the product key, click Next to continue with setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image31.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage31_thumb.png%3fw%3d441%26amp%3bh%3d346" height="346" width="441" /></a></p>

<p>In addition to being able to keep your Windows Settings and Personal files, you can keep your personal files too when upgrading from Windows 7. If you choose Nothing, Windows 8 will place your files in a folder called Windows.old. After making your decision,
 click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image43.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage43_thumb.png%3fw%3d451%26amp%3bh%3d353" height="353" width="451" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows 8 does some last checks. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image48.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage48_thumb.png%3fw%3d441%26amp%3bh%3d346" height="346" width="441" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on your configuration, Windows 8 setup might ask you to uninstall a program or driver then restart your system before it can proceed with the upgrade. Don’t worry though, Windows 8 will resume setup automatically. In my case, Windows 8 setup needed
 a restart before it could continue.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image58.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage58_thumb.png%3fw%3d405%26amp%3bh%3d221" height="221" width="405" /></a></p>
<p>After restarting, Windows 8 setup, asked if I would like ‘Continue from where I left off’. I clicked Next and setup resumed.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image63.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage63_thumb.png%3fw%3d440%26amp%3bh%3d345" height="345" width="440" /></a></p>
<p>At the summary screen, review the changes that will be made to your computer. If you are not sure, click Back and make any appropriate changes. As noted, you will not be able to use your computer during this period. The time it takes to complete the upgrade
 will be dependent on your system specifications such as processor speed, memory and your data set. Click the Install button to begin.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image69.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage69_thumb.png%3fw%3d447%26amp%3bh%3d336" height="336" width="447" /></a></p>
<p>Windows 8 setup will go into full screen mode and restart several times. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image_thumb62_thumb1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage_thumb62_thumb_thumb.png%3fw%3d381%26amp%3bh%3d286" height="286" width="381" /></a></p>
<p>After your computer restarts, Windows 8 will continue setup. Windows setup will go through several screens indicating Tasks it needs to complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows setup will say its ‘Preparing’ </li><li>Getting your devices ready. </li><li>Getting system ready</li></ul>
<p>Then restart and setup will continue. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image_thumb86_thumb1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage_thumb86_thumb_thumb.png%3fw%3d384%26amp%3bh%3d289" height="289" width="384" /></a></p>
<p>Windows 8 will now indicate it is ‘Moving your settings’</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer has stopped showing folders and files&#59; only &#34;libraries&#34; now.</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 and everything has been working fine. I have been using Windows Explorer forever. (I never liked right-clicking My Computer. It's not the same.)&nbsp; All of a sudden, all I see are "Libraries" listed when I start up Win Explorer.&nbsp; Useless.&nbsp;
 I like being able to see exactly what is on my hard drives when I want to see them.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what happened and how I can get Win Explorer back to "normal"?&nbsp; I have searched the answer forums high and low and have not gotten anywhere.&nbsp; THNX.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The Windows Explorer does default to the Libraries location, but you can set your own location that you would like to start at by:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click
<strong>Windows Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click
<strong>Windows Explorer</strong> (if in a pin-list)</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Properties</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Target</strong> field you will see <strong>%windir%\explorer.exe</strong>, you will need to add the path to the location you want to start in “”’s (for example:
<strong>%windir%\explorer.exe “%userprofile%”</strong> or <strong>
%windir%\explorer.exe “C:\”</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click

    <title>stuck installing developer mode package - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thinker101  say:</h3>
<h2>            stuck installing developer mode package</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new computer and put it in developer mode which worked no problem. I kept wondering why it looked like I had two different builds of windows 10 between my laptop and desktop and today I realized it was because my desktop was in sideload
 mode not developer mode but when I switched it back to developer mode it hangs trying to install the developer mode package. When I restart it hangs as well but not when I shutdown. I tried uninstalling the Linux subsystem that I loaded on to it when I originally
 had it in developer mode but that didn't fix the hanging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>My apologies I meant to post a reply earlier. I got this issue resolved with a Microsoft technician. The solution was to upgrade the system to the latest Windows 10 build. To answer your question though I was referring to the developer mode listed in the
 for developers tab in update and security settings. Just search "for developers" in the start menu and it's the first result. It would hang trying to install the package needed to enable that mode. (the circle of would just keep spinning forever)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised when I googled before making the question all I could find were solutions to fix error codes which didn't apply to me because I never got an error code. If anyone else runs into this issue check that you have the latest Windows 10 build.</p>

<h2>            Flash drives and memory storage&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, I just started using a flash drive for memory instead of the hard drive.. Also, I was wondering: is it safe to remove the flash drive while the Xbox is not running? Note: I just downloaded Blazblue onto a 4GB flash drive and I was thinking of possibly
 upgrading to two 16 GB flash drives for more memory. (Sorry, if this is a really dumb post, I was just wondering how things worked so I don't make a mistake and erase all my data when I take out the flash drive. Also, I have had data erased before when I took
 out memory cards on my Gamecube, so I don't want to make the mistake again. )</p>

<p>It's completely safe, to remove a USB Flash Drive from the Console, when it's not using it..&nbsp; The 360 does drive checks, every so often though &amp; you could could lose data, if you remove the drive at that time..</p>
<p>So, I would recommend, buying a 16GB USB Flash Drive with a LED on the end of it... When the LED isn't flashing, it is safe to remove the drive etc..</p>

<p>[quote user="GiNeRz101"]is it safe to remove the flash drive while the Xbox is not running?[/quote]Yes, however you'll want to wait for it to be completely off. The center light on my consoles continues to blink for about a minute after power-off, during
 which time the activity light on my USB flash drive continues to blink as well. I wait for both the center light and my USB flash drive light to go out before pulling the flash drive from the console.[quote]Note: I just downloaded Blazblue onto a 4GB flash
 drive and I was thinking of possibly upgrading to two 16 GB flash drives for more memory.[/quote]This is entirely possible, though you may wish to buy 32GB flash drives.&nbsp;A 16GB flash drive only allows a USB Memory Unit&nbsp;of about 14.2GB in size. A&nbsp;32GB flash
 drive will allow for a 15.9GB Memory Unit (yeah, not sure what the 128MB is as the reserved space is supposed to be&nbsp;512MB and outside the user-allocated space)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that USB Memory Units have limitations compared to a 360 HDD. Some DLC will not install on a USB Memory Unit and some games require a HDD for full functionality. Official 250GB and 320GB HDDs can be had for $100 or less if you shop around a
 bit.</p>

<h2>            NVidia Quadro FX1500M &#40;HP NW9440, Dell Precision M90, and others&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of systems&nbsp;here which I've so far managed to keep running on the same version of Windows (currently Windows 7 x64 Ultimate).&nbsp;&nbsp; The one I use most is the HP NW9440 laptop which has a NVidia Quadro FX1500M graphics card running the 259.47 drivers
 from the WHQL driver repository.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to update to&nbsp;Windows 10, but the system checker tells me that I can't upgrade because&nbsp;the FX1500M isn't supported.&nbsp; This a real blow ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the Windows&nbsp;7 (or 8, 8.1) WDDM 1.0 drivers work on Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any hope of getting the existing drivers updated to support Windows 10, or have I reached the end of the road here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Dave&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The "Get Windows 10 App" is incorrect.&nbsp; The FX1500M works fine (at least on this HP NW9440 laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Windows 10 Pro x64, I manually un-installed all the NVidia drivers and nView etc. from "Programs and Features" and then went to Computer Management/Device Manager, and right clicked the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter to get to&nbsp;"Update Driver
 Software".&nbsp;&nbsp; From there it was a simple&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;browsing to the folder where I'd stored&nbsp;the NVidia 259.47 driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NVidia drivers and nView etc. then install&nbsp;and appear to work just fine.</p>

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>There are several reasons why you are unable to launch Forza Motorsport 7 on your computer. It is possible that the game installation files are corrupted or your
 graphics card driver needs an update. To resolve your concern, we recommend that you perform the suggested solutions below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 1</span></strong><span>. Update the graphics card driver on your PC.<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;button, type<strong>&nbsp;Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your display adapter, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards, expand
 the&nbsp;<strong>Display adapters</strong>&nbsp;category, right-click your graphics card and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></li><li><span>Right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the display adapter.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>

            <p>Sorry to say it but this answer looks as if the question wasn't even read. I found it because I'm running into the same issue. The JBL E50BT Stereo "Headphones" do show up in the Playback Devices / Playback tab. So does JBL E50BT Hands-Free "Headset" and
 (in Recording) JBL E50BT Hands-Free "Headset".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that neither of them can be connected. They all show status "Disconnected" and when "Connect" is selected from the context menu, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is "Paired" in Devices / Bluetooth. Also, the devices works perfectly fine for me with Windows 8.1 (on another machine), Mac OS X and the iPhone. I made sure that all of those machines had the headset removed.</p>

            <p>Hi, I had the same problem. but I noticed that my JBL E50BT already paired with my mobile phone. So after turn off bluetooth device on my mobile phone, my&nbsp;JBL E50BT can pair &amp; connect to Win10 correctly.</p>
<p>So if you already pair you&nbsp;JBL E50BT with other bluetooth device, just turn off your bluetooth on the device before you connected it to Win10.</p>
<p>Hope it is helpful.</p>

            <p>It would probably only require the .msi file if it was trying to repair or install the program or part of it.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to show Both Hidden and System Files, and also to uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, to navigate to or search for the mentioned .msi file location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see which MSI files are for which programs etc, either <br />
browse to your C:\Windows\Installer folder&nbsp; (a Hidden and System file) or click Start Menu, RUN, and type
<br />
Installer and hit OK. Then click the View menu of the resulting window, click Choose Details
<br />
and select the checkbox called "Subject", leave alone any already ticked boxes.&nbsp; The Installer folder will populate after a few moments and you can see which .msi files you have and what programs they relate to via the "Subject" heading (Tab) listing.</p>
<p>If you don't have a View menu item, click on Organize/ Layout, to get the Menu Bar showing.</p>
<p>If you had .msi's in there (you perhaps wont) a right-click on it will offer you an uninstall option.</p>

            I noticed several things here, you are still on an older version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />I would first upgrade to Windows 10 1809:

<br />
<br />I noticed Toshibas website does not list a driver for this audio. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound controller and grab the hardware ID then post in a reply here.

            This appears to be a compatibility issue. You could try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1903 version later this week:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Feature Update 1903 from Versions 1507, 1511, 1607, 1709, 1803 or 1809
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Because of the age of the system, it probably would be best to go back to an earlier version where it worked. 
<br />
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1607 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1607 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />

<p>Hi Rameshchandra,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10</strong> tries its best to occupy the smallest possible storage. Since you've got a small disk storage, you can free up some storage spaces by using the
<strong>Disk cleanup tool</strong> on<strong> Windows 10</strong>. To do so, kindly refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026616/windows-disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more questions, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Windows Installer Error - Error Code 80246007 and 8007312.On Windows 8</h2>
                    I only just received a new Sony Vaio 15 Fit E laptop the other day so I was eager to get set up on my new device.&nbsp; I tried to connect an existing Kodak printer to my new laptop but it couldn't find the driver online so it obviously didn't install.&nbsp; I shut
 down the laptop only to find on my next boot up that chrome and all the apps I installed from the shop vanished from the tiles.&nbsp; Although I was frustrated, I didn't think too much of it until I came to install 14 updates fro my laptop.&nbsp; I have tried downloading
 the updates several times manually but to no avail.&nbsp; The error code 80246007 is displayed, but when I look online it seems to be an issue with most windows 7 OS, so I'm not really too sure what to do to correct the issue.&nbsp; I uninstalled the printer from the
 devices section, and no Kodak driver was present when I&nbsp;went to uninstall programmes from the control panel.&nbsp; I am running windows 8, I have&nbsp;not been&nbsp;unable to update to 8.1 -

            Since encountering this issue, it appears as if I have repaired error 80246007, but since then I have also encountered errors 80073712 (twice, repaired on both occasions) and error 80070002.&nbsp; Whenever I think I may have solved it, another error just seems
 to occur. Extremely confused!

            Hi Sarah -

There is this Vaio bulletin on getting keyboard to work in various editions of WIndows here:   https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/44357/p/48903,49902,57460,70853/c/65,66/kw/backlight%20

There are some successes in getting similar model Viao keyboard backlighting to work here:  https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/keyboard-backlight-not-working-in-sony-vaio-s/aaccc9a9-10c6-4c97-85ad-f4cdcd87c56f

Are there any drivers in error or missing in Device Manager?   Right click Start button to open Device Manager, look for any with a ! error mark, report back its name.  If unknown, click on it, on Details tab, drop down menu to Hardware ID, right click the long string to copy and paste back here and into Google to learn the exact device that's missing.  

Is Vaio Update working?  Check in the All Apps list in Start Menu, try to open and run it. If not try installing it from the Windows 8.1 drivers page to see if you can get it to scan and suggest

            Hi.  I very much appreciate the reply that resolves this ridiculous situation which is, aparently, the fault of COMCAST.  However, just FYI and as a rant, I never recorded my acct/pwd when I first set up Livemail so I was unable to get into my account setting to change it.  It asked for an account name that all my friends, family and probably the rest of the world can see when I'm logged in.  I do not want to be seen by anyone when I'm logged in.  I never log in unless I have to change a setting once every 3 years or whatever.  So I now have to drop Livemail.  Is there nothing left of the world of PERSONAL computing where I don't have to join some social group and make friends and Like This and Twitter or do some other sort of useless juvenile **** just to set up my email account?  Sheesh!  I know, I probably sound like some old fart - probably over the age of 30 - or 40 - or 50 - or 60 - or, or, or - OK, this is my day to come out - I am 65 years old and proud of it!!

            <p>If you fetch your Webmail using an e-mail client like Windows Live Mail, MS Outlook, Windows Mail, Outlook Express, Thunderbird, etc., a User ID and password is required when you set up the POP3 account. It is the same User ID and PW that you would use to
 logon to Comcast's Webmail site. All e-mail clients are like this and outside of some big time hacker, or an alphabet agency, (FBI, CIA, DHS, etc.), no one knows when you are online.</p>

            Bruce,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Point well taken although I think at least the Outlook Express is not a 'distributed'<br />
(across networks) piece of software and only requires handshakes between my pc and my<br />
Comcast host email server, so my client side (on my pc) doesn't require password protection<br />
and would therefor be likely easier for me to access - it would not require that I communicate<br />
with some outside controlling body for access issues.&nbsp; The MS Live Mail password requirement<br />
guarantees forgetfulness with an 8 char min that must include 2 upcase/2 lowcase/2 numerics/<br />
2 symbols - if I have that right, but it's hard to complain when password laxity is probably one of<br />
the easiest ways to breach the system at some level.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;And, again, the blame is with Comcast if they're changing port assignments without notice unless<br />
it was included in mail I failed to read which could be the case.&nbsp; By the way,&nbsp; I know you were not<br />
implying this, but it's not as if I'm paranoid about being watched.&nbsp; I just have a curmudgeon's view<br />
of social networking (the process, not those who seem to enjoy it) and I'm sadly aware that one of these days I will have to admit defeat and sign up.&nbsp; That's when the real paranoia will set in.&nbsp; If I<br />
can't control it (to some degree) I don't trust it.<br />
Best Regards and thanks for being there to help out.<br />
