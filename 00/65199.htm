            <p>I had the same issue w/ the above same message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Get to the start screen and type in&nbsp;wsreset, right click on it and click run as an administrator</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Shut down the computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Go back into the store and try downloading the Windows 8.1 Update again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my first laptop it worked the first try, it took two tries on my other laptop.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note: I only have a local account (not associated w/ a microsoft account) and this occurred on two new laptops.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player is adding multiple copies of ripped files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows  Media Player is adding multiple copies of ripped files</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 Professional some months ago. I used a clean install and then moved files back onto my laptop. All went well. Two months ago I started getting multiple copies of each track of the CD's. I get 2 to 9 copies of each track. I have tried
 deleting copies of the tracks but they soon come back. What causes this? Is there a duplicate file remover program that works well with the track files in the music library?<br />

            I did not solve the problem using these instructions. (One factor was it is better to enter .msc rather than .misc.) So&nbsp;I tried alternatives. I use Windows 7 professional. I went to control panel and used the troubleshooter. It noted the problem and suggested
 a data base rebuild also. I clicked on the command provided and it took care of all steps. After the Media player restarted all duplicate tracks were eliminated. Simple one step fix. Thank you for your time and interest in my problem.Ed<br />

2.&nbsp; No, it only happens with the CD "Mele O Hawaii."&nbsp; I have listened to this CD numerous times without a problem.&nbsp; The CD does have the correct music on it.<br />
3.&nbsp; The CD "Mele O Hawaii" has 15 tracks.&nbsp; The CD " Na Mele O Paniolo" has 14 tracks.&nbsp;

I suspect that the problem may be in the database that Windows Media Player uses for finding and downloading cover art and track information.&nbsp;

            The problem is not with this specific installation of Windows Media Player. &nbsp; The same thing happens if I try to rip the CD "Mele O Hawaii" in a different computer, a laptop running Windows 7 and Microsoft Windows Media Player 12. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>On both computers, Windows Media Player misidentifies the CD "Mele O Hawaii" as&nbsp;"Songs of the Hawaiian Cowboy: Na Mele O Paniolo."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The most likely explanation is that the problem is in the database used for identification of CDs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>May I suggest that Microsoft purchase a copy of the CD "Mele O Hawaii"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.amazon.com/Mele-Hawaii-Songs-Of/dp/B002G8HN86</div>
<div><br />
<div>and see if the problem happens with Microsoft's own computers?</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be interesting to know if the CD "Songs of the Hawaiian Cowboy: Na Mele O Paniolo."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.amazon.com/Mele-Paniolo-Songs-Hawaiian-Cowboy/dp/B000002NEX</div>
<div><br />
<div>is correctly identified of if it is misidentified as "Mele O Hawaii."</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. &nbsp;I reset my Microsoft account password and the password resetting process would not let me use the same display name. &nbsp;I had to create a new one.&nbsp;</div>

            I had already tried entering the metadata manually. &nbsp;This is why I emphasized that the two CDs do not even have the same number of tracks.
<div><br />
<div>When I try this approach, Windows Media Player finds the wrong CD "Songs of the Hawaiian Cowboy: Na Mele O Paniolo." &nbsp;The right CD&nbsp;"Mele O Hawaii" &nbsp;is not one of the choices on the drop-down list on the right. &nbsp;I cannot edit in the correct information
 because...</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. There are not enough tracks listed. &nbsp;Since the "Songs of the Hawaiian Cowboy" has 14 tracks and "Mele O Hawaii" has 15 tracks, there are not enough tracks listed to enter the right information.</div>
<div>2. There is no way to correct the album art that is found online.</div>

                    I have a computer that has windows 10 operating system but I have some old programs compatible windows xp or 16 bit that I need to use on that machine. How do I run these older programs in windows 10?

<p>Aha! You think you're the only one?&nbsp;<em>Lots</em> of people have old programs they want or need to run that aren't compatible with Windows 10. Fortunately, there's an answer for us: a virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A virtual machine is a computer created entirely out of software. It works just like a 'real' computer because, for all intents and purposes, it&nbsp;<em>is</em> a real computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you remember picture-in-picture on a TV? This is computer-in-computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you create the virtual machine, then you install the version of Windows you need on the virtual machine,&nbsp;<em>then</em> you install your program into that version of Windows, just as you would in a 'real' computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two of the most popular virtual machine programs are VirtualBox by Oracle and VMWare Workstation Player by VMWare. Both are programs that you install on Windows 10. Once installed, you use them to create a virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because these VM programs are so popular, the internet is filled with detailed tutorials on how to set them up. It's really not difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has its own, built-in VM program called Hyper-V. However, I think you'll find either VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation Player considerably more user-friendly.</p>

<h2>            lexmark z25 inkjet printer</h2>
                    <p>I have a <strong>Lexmark z25-35 Inkjet printer</strong> and in Action Center appear a
<em>Compatibility issue with inkjet printer.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some unsigned drivers made by a third party (since Lexmark stoped making drivers for it after XP) and those drivers work just fine in Windows 7 but&nbsp; Windows 8 doesnțt seem able to finnalize the instalation and the printer doesnțt work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to make those drivers work or I should go back to Windows 7?</p>

That is a really old printer and there are no Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 drivers<br />
available from Lexmark.<br />

As OEM&nbsp;Lexmark is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with&nbsp;Lexmark Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver. <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to get it to work by setting the Comaptibility Mode of "SETUP" on the installation CD to Win 7 or possibly XP SP2 or 3 depending on how new the model is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It probably has more features than anything you will download...mine turned out that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find setup on the CD, select Open or Explore instead of just running it.</p>
<p>Then right click on Properties...Compatibility Tab is at the top.</p>
<p>I used XP SP3 with a X5340 and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have previously tried to install the printer, REMOVE it from your system in Devices and Printers before uninstalling and reinstalling the software.</p>
        </p>

            Hi! As mentioned once they're expired there's not much you can do. In order to prevent this from hapenning in the future, just check this link once in a while where you can see what account balance will expire when:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments</a>

            Gift Card and other prepaid cards, usually until the end of the year they were purchased. Then you can not solve it anymore and you have to deal with this card problem with the dealer where he bought the console.

            Hi Josie,
<br />
<br />It seems your system cannot find Microsoft Word, try repairing your Office Installation . . .
<br />
<br />NOTE: Please be advised, if you are running Office 2013 or earlier, before attempting a repair, have your Microsoft Office Product Key at hand, Office may need to be re-activated in some cases
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

            Thanks for the details. Your Windows Store is probably set up to automatically update apps. Let's try to turn it off and see if that solves the issue. Here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open the Windows Store.<br />
2. Select the account menu.<br />
3. Select <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
4. Under <strong>App updates</strong>, set <strong>Update apps automatically</strong> to
<strong>No</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get back to us if the steps won't work.

<p>You had to upgrade by January 15, 2015 in order to receive the free copy. The upgrade offer is over so you would have to purchase the game for the One if you want to play it on the One. Upgrade offers are generally a limited time offer and most of them have

<br />
I have <strong>Windows 8.1 with Beats Audio and Realtek Audio Drivers.</strong> <strong>
Beats Audio</strong> does<strong> NOT</strong> seem to be the problem because<strong> I disabled it</strong> and it
<strong>didn't change anything</strong>. Also, <strong>I disabled, then enabled my audio driver</strong> and
<strong>disabled all enhancements</strong>; still <strong>did not work</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, <strong>I uninstalled various suspected programs but nothing was changed</strong>. I also
<strong>restarted my PC</strong> after the programs were uninstalled; <strong>nothing changed</strong>. And I did
<strong>NOT find any other audio controllers/managers</strong>. <br />
<br />
<br />
I put my <strong>PC in a clean boot for 2 days and ran the troubleshoot again</strong>.&nbsp; It said that there was
<strong>no problems</strong>. Also i <strong>created a new user</strong>, and <strong>
it said the same</strong>. I set my <strong>PC back to normal boot, restarted it, but the problem still existed</strong>.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I think this question is so frequent that Microsoft should REALY do something about this annoying setup in Realtek sound system (or just throw Realtek out the Window...). I called Realtek client service. I got THE answear ! ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;... Nothing can be done, as the auto level is quite in the Realtek soundcard DNA... "Please see your computer manufactor", and so on in vicious circle. I'm gona install W 10 but I'm not sure things will change.</p>
<p>So please, dear Santa Microsoft, ask your partners to demand Realtek to put an "on / off" button for this auto level function, or to make it less stupid. Anyway if a young listener thinks his noisy music is too weak on his computer, he will pump up the volume
 to such a level that peaks in sound will break his ears sooner or later.</p>
<p>Love, merry Xmas and happy new year</p>

            you are using an OEM SLP key which only works when OEM recovery media is used. It can not be activated by normal means.

<div>You will have to change your product key to the one on your COA.</div>

<p>
<span>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>A)&nbsp;&nbsp; OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's
 computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COA SLP:<b> This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer</b>. It is a valid product key,
 but should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate
 of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>

 my server (main computer, which the router is wired to - I am not running any special "server" software), my main computer recognizes itself only, not all the other devices in the home that it used to recognize. &nbsp;When I go into "Network and Sharing Center",
 under "View your active networks" the only one there is named "Network 1"; &nbsp;it used t be called "Network 2", the last time the home network worked properly and I was able to to share files across it, etc...&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the reply but the first link seems to be the one that could be relevant and that got me nowhere. &nbsp;There is no "Network and Internet" tab in Control panel, and when I get to "Network and Sharing" (what the tab is called in Control Panel - maybe
 a different Service Pack or something, I guess), there is no "Manage Network Connections" tab. &nbsp;I think I have no choice but to create the home network from scratch (there a lot of devices that used to be connected - will be no small task).

            Oh, okay, I never use the categories layout. &nbsp;Gets you to the same place when you go to "Networks and Sharing", though, and I don't see a tab "Manage Network Connections". &nbsp;I am able to to view all network devices, I knew that all but that computer itself
 would be gone from there, but how do I manually add the others back in? (I figured that ability may be there). &nbsp;I don't really want to start over, I'd rather try following those links (or some other route), but all my other devices are gone so I'm not sure
 that I have another option. &nbsp;I still think that this computer's think that all those other devices are on the network called "Network 2", not "Network 1" as is now the active network, I don't know if you can have more than one but if that "Network 2" still
 exists, re-instating that would certainly be the quickest and easiest route here.

            <p>Its not a tab it a menu choice on the left side of the screen. Also see the SevenForums<br />
</p>
<p>link which has graphics to indicate the choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the networks and then rebuilding them should keep your previous settings however<br />
since we don't know what caused the corruption we can't be sure of that. So you may end up<br />
having to redo them though I doubt it.<br />

            <p>Thanks for all the attempts to help me with this, but at the moment I am wondering if I have a corrupt version of Windows. &nbsp;Probably not, probably what I am looking at is just called something different with the version (or service pack, or whatever) of
 Win 7 that I have (I have the 64 Bit version, if that matters). &nbsp;I am &nbsp;just not seeing what, apparently, I should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the category layout of Control Panel I do get the tab "Network and Internet", if I click on that I then am able to select the "Network and Sharing Center" tab, as per the instructions in the link I have been trying to follow. &nbsp;(this is an area I
 have gotten to from Control Panel earlier, starting from the Icons layout); &nbsp;In there, there is a menu on the left, but there is no "Manage Network Connections" menu link (or tab, or whatever - those words appear nowhere on the screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this where I need to go in order to create a new Home Network? &nbsp;That would be a last resort, of course, but even if I end up having to go that route, it seems I cannot since I am not getting that "Manage Network Connections" menu item/tab anywhere. &nbsp;If
 I can't manage my current network nor start over and create a new one, any ideas what I can do? (short of reformatting my hard drive/re-installing Windows).</p>

            <p>I was just about to try to find the time to click on some of those links before going back to work, but actually I think I'm getting closer to figuring out what my problem is and I think it may be hardware related. &nbsp;Besides being unable to see other computers
 on the home network (sometimes - other times it works pretty much perfectly), I also completely lose even my internet connection on a pretty regular basis (only on this one, main, computer). &nbsp;When this happens I might click on the link to diagnose the problem,
 which Windows is never able to do anything about. &nbsp; I'm thinking I may need to change the network interface card, Device Manager is finding no problems with the NIC but I have no connectivity issues at the moment, so maybe I should try again later when I lose
 my internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a problem with not getting proper updates, the clock just changes to some random date/ time in the past, so I have to manually set it then check for updates immediately; &nbsp;I think that may be the battery so I guess I will change it and the NIC
 together. &nbsp;Does anyone know how I can figure out exactly what battery I need to buy (without taking the PC apart first)? &nbsp;I mean is every Pentium board the same, for example? &nbsp;I'm pretty sure HP will tell me, "Sorry, outa warranty, ur on ur own...". &nbsp;I used
 to have a third party hardware diagnostic program, forget what it is called, that would probably tell me this information. &nbsp;The chip is a P4, computer probably about ten years old.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
For the battery check with the motherboard maker's support and forums and/or a real<br />
computer shop can tell you what you need. Most boards for a make/model run will use<br />
the same battery. You can also look at the one in place on the board now - most are</p>
<p>button-cell types and are not hard to find since there will be many makers.<br />
<br />
Most system makers have instructions for replacing the CMOS battery on their websites.<br />
Their Support and forums (if any) are good sources of information.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>CMOS battery also know as RTC battery<br />

<h2>            Campaign Save Games Missing on BF4</h2>
                    What's the deal my save games on Battlefield 4 are not saving. I keep,seeing people post about a patch but it's been over a month. Where's the patch. I just started the campaign over yesterday, back out after a couple of missions, watch some TV and came
 back to see if they were still there. Lucky for me they were. Thought it was fixed. Came home today to play only to find out they are gone again. It's pissing me off. With this and the multiplayer server problems, this is not looking good fit BF4!

<p>Yeah, EA said they were working on fixing this but it's been a few weeks now.</p>
<p>If you want to finish the campaign, stay offline throughout the entire game. As soon as you sync to the cloud, the games saves mess up.</p>
<p>If you play online, it's best to wait until they fix the game save issue to play it.</p>

<h3> lwdaddio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t connect to non-broadcasting SSID</h2>
                    I've read the other posts about this problem but none of them actually gave a solution.&nbsp; Before you suggest that's it's not necessary, that is not the point.&nbsp; There is a setting in Windows 10 that says to connect to non-broadcasting SSIDs and if I want
 to do that, I should be able to.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even with that 'wireless network properties' setting checked, the diagnosis of the connection/adapter says that it is NOT set to connect and it doesn't.&nbsp; So why isn't the Windows 10 setting being passed on to
 the adapter or how do I change the adapter settings to do so?&nbsp; I'm using an HP Spectre x360 with an 'Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265' network adapter.&nbsp; I'm connecting to an Amped AC2600 router with both 2.4 and 5.0 bands set to the same SSID and key.

            Steps 1 and 2 didn't fix the problem, everything is up-to-date.&nbsp; I'm unable to try Method 2 since I can't find the driver on the HP website and the one on the Intel website is a year older and a major version older.&nbsp; HP seems to have the drivers for all
 the other peripherals and seems to have updated my system with the latest driver, yet they don't make it available for separate download.

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/358c12d0-9d40-4a21-9f00-4cf583bc5785" title="PhilipMYE">
<p>
</p><p><span>If you can't access your account and you don't have any access to the security information saved on your account,&nbsp;we strongly suggest that you fill out the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">"Recover

<p>
</p><p>Let me give you some tips to help you pass the verification.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Make sure that you use an alternate email address that you have access with in order to receive the security code and not the email address of the account you want to recover.</span></li><li><span>The 4 basic information (<em>First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identi</em>ty)
</span></li><li><span>Fill out the form from a computer and from a location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where the previous successful sign-in occurred.</span></li></ul>
<li>
<p>Please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information
 is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</p>

<p>Hello, I did this and it sent the recovery verification code to the new email address and when the recovery was successfully done and I signed in again to skype it still sent the skype verification code done at log-in to old email address. So I still cannot
 log-in. Please suggest another method.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
First of all - <i><b>' I have a 64 bit Windows 7 PC with 16MB ram.'<br />
<br />
</b>^^ </i>Are you sure? The minimum requirement for 32-bit Windows 7 is 1GB. <br />
<br />
Start &gt; right click Computer &gt; Properties. What does it say Under System - Installed memory (RAM): ?<br />
<br />
If you truly have 16MB's of RAM, you should NOT be on Windows 7 and you will need to upgrade your RAM ASAP (or possibly your computer if you really have 16MB's of RAM).<br />
<br />
<i>If you don't and that was a simple mistake, move on - </i><br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <b>WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (124)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<p><i>A fatal hardware error has occurred. This fatal error displays data from the Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA).</i></p>
<br />
<p>If we run an !errrec on the 2nd parameter of the bugcheck (address of the WER structure) we get the following:</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Overall, it appears you have a faulty CPU from the errors we can see and the consistency.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward:<br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -

http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<b>4. </b>The <i><b>only</b></i> software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. </b>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />
<br />
