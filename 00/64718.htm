    <title>Bring back snap an app&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmdbioodhunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring back snap an app&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This was the worst day of the Xbox One! We need the snap an app back this is the one thing that made xbox great to play. We could play and watch a video but no you had to dumb down the Xbox One and make sony look better with their online not having&nbsp;issues and their performance is so much better but we had this to beat them now were going down past the 360. It's very simple to bring back the snap an app feature it's already on the coding cortana still has it just bring it back please, you know everyone wants it back just do it for us already. It's 2018 bring it back or your just like the Tied pod kids.</p>

            The Xbox one was<strong> the</strong> console that stood out because of the "Snap an app" feature. It was the greatest feature because, when you was watching a guide of the game that you was struggling with you could just snap YouTube or Microsoft Edge,
 look/watch the guide. Not only that but you can watch whatever from YouTube while doing something that takes long. I miss the "Snap an app". Microsoft or Xbox

            They removed the Snap Feature because of performance issues as it was slowing the Xbox down and and so they removed it.

<p>Hi, Moonsith &nbsp;your not alone,</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem's with the wireless connection on my xbox slim with the same thing happening</p>
<p>For the last two week's since i first bought my Xbox all was fine, but over the last few day's i keep getting disconnected too, i've tried a connection test and it told me the problem was to do with the router (Netgear) and the MTU settings, i went into
 my router settings and they are all o.k with more than enough for the 1300 or so MTU needed by Xbox live.</p>
<p>Now today it has got so bad that i can't sign in at all, i wonder if this is because it is the weekend and the extra load on the broadband affecting thing's as during the week there has been no problem's, or because of wireless interference, so the next
 step i will try is to turn off all the equipment and then finally the router and wait 30sec before powering the router back on again and then to switch everything back on and try again, hopefully this might work</p>
<p>I had simular problem's with my "other console" and that is now wired as i got fed up with being disconnected and it all work's fine, i think that you get a better connection wired although it's a pain</p>
<p>This seem's to be a bit of a common Xbox problem recently judging by all the post's on the subject, i haven't tried the Xbox with a wired network connection, so i can't say if the problem will get rectified until i do, but i hope it help's.</p>

<p>I was after these:-</p>
<p><br />
<strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in? <br />
Modem brand &amp; model number: <br />
Router brand &amp; model number: <br />
Network Connection Type: Wireless/Wired<br />
If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using? <br />
Things you have tried: <br />
Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown<br />
Is NAT Type Open? <br />
Any Error Codes you encounter: <br />
What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G? <br />
Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? <br />
When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen?
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it doesn't matter now as I see your with Virgin and using the Superhub. Virgin have a known issue at the moment in that some parts of its network are unplayable for anything relating to gaming, Xbox Live, PSN, WoW etc etc... it will usually start after
 5pm when their traffic management kicks in, they are incorrectly managing Xbox live traffic meaning that you will experience lag and disconnects. It has been going on for over a month now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ring their helpdesk they'll no doubt deny there's any issue (they are still doing this) but it exists and their forum staff have confirmed it:-</p>

<p>Hi Stupid Haystack</p>
<p>I found that by turning off the ( Netgear) router for 30sec, unplugging the lead to the ASDL filter, then switching the router back on and plugging the line back in and trying again after it has re-booted, that i could connect to Xbox Live again.</p>
<p>Did this last night following my previous post and it was fine all evening, i don't know if it will be today but i remain optomistic.</p>
<p>The problem seem's to be to do with the wireless connection from what i can tell and the post's on it, still a pain though.</p>
<p>I Hope this helps &nbsp; </p>

<p>I also have the same problem and also NETGEAR router. I played black ops and it was fine. I tried to get on Mod2 and it disconnected me. I later tried Homefront and again i was disconnected every time i tried to load up the game. I had the same problem a
 few weeks back but after 10-15 mins it was ok.</p>
<p>I thought this was possibly down to my account as it was running slow all day so i have tried to recover my account and i wont recover completely. I left the xbox on to recover over night and it still has not recovered. I have other accounts and again i
 tried black ops and it was fine and also tried homefront and again it disconnected me.</p>
<p>Getting annoyed now!!</p>

 after. It happens so much I get annoyed at playing. Even during Netflix I get the message "connection has been reset, determining your video quality". The movies get almost unwatchable.

<p>Hey there Abraham, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems with your payment instruments. If you do have a past due balance on the account due to subscriptions go ahead and take a look at our support article for information on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/pay-past-due-balance-on-xbox-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to pay a past due balance on an Xbox subscription</a>. If you continue to run into the error messages then I would advise you to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Xbox Support</a> for more assistance with this matter. Unfortunately we would not have all the necessary tools to assist you through the Forums.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>

            <span>Hi Cunokyle,<br />
<br />
Did the issue started only after updating to Windows 8.1?<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong>I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode with networking and check if the issue persists. Starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate
 the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.<br />
<br />
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></span></strong></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span></span><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If
 the issue still persists, then the issue also could be due to some third party program causing the issue. Clean boot will
</span><span>eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict
 is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

<br />
Note: Follow <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

<p>&nbsp;This article lists the problems that are fixed in Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3). Service packs are cumulative. This means that the problems that are fixed in a service pack are also fixed in later service packs. For example, Windows XP SP3 contains all
 the fixes that are included in Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).&nbsp;&nbsp; Source:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946480/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946480/en-us</a></p>
<p>Steps to take before you install Windows XP Service Pack 3&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717/</a></p>

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsxp/sp3/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Download the full SP3 installation file and/or burn the ISO download to CD.</p>
<p>2) Ensure (as well as plausible) you have no spyware/malware by doing a full scan with SuperAntiSpyware and MalwareBytes.</p>
<p>3) CHKDSK</p>
<p>4) Defragment</p>
<p>5) Ensure your hardware drivers are up to date (from the hardware manufacturer's respective web pages.)</p>
<p>6) <strong>Reboot right before</strong> you try to install SP3.</p>
<p>7) <strong>Disconnect from the internet before installing</strong> (physically.)</p>
<p>8) <strong>Disable your antivirus and antispyware applications</strong> when you are about to install SP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>How do I go about installing a new icon which I loaded onto my Vista Home Premium?</blockquote>
<br />
I have an entire collection of 105&nbsp;Vista RTM Folder Icons I downloaded from deviantART site.&nbsp; What I did was place them in a separate folder&nbsp;(by themselves) in&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;<em>My Pictures</em> folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when I&nbsp;go to change the properties&nbsp;(icon)&nbsp;of a folder
 to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;my RTM Folder icons, it&nbsp;now takes me to either the default Windows\System32 folder or the RTM Icon Folder I set up.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
One caveat:&nbsp; <strong>Do not rename</strong>, <strong>move </strong>or<strong> change</strong> the
<strong>folder containing </strong>your<strong> new icons</strong> in any way once you've accessed the location to select an icon.&nbsp; It's not harmful or serious, but it will make the folders whose icons you've changed revert back to the default setting (I'm
 guessing because just like a broken shortcut, it no longer recognizes the location of your new icon)<br />
<br />
Don't know if this&nbsp;is&nbsp;the kind of info you're looking for or not.&nbsp; Hope it helps a little. :&gt;)

<p>Well, if he logs on to this so called user account and everything works fine, I would say, Create a NEW ADMIN USER ACCOUNT, and name it in HIS NAME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy all his stuff off this one to Public folder, log on to that new one&nbsp;and move those into his personal folders and set up his UI personal settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 30 -&nbsp;60 mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He can on the old account, even open the </p>
<p>C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</p>
<p>folder and copy the folder to public location for his new user account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</p>
<p>is the all users start menu folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>and if he installed some programs, there may not be shortcuts in the all user start menu, so he would want them from the old personal start menu folder to his new personal start menu folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basic 101 stuff there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why mess with something that has no problems to possibly having them&nbsp;after Reset and&nbsp;having problems when you can just create a new admin user account.

<p>That is a big IF, and he can uninstall any software that looks suspicious and on another User&nbsp;Account, chances are real slim to none this can happen. I do not think some guru wizard hacker sold a used PC for $100 and would be able to do this anyways.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, he can run the best Virus and malware apps and scan for anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, this could be a new PC or from family or friend that had 1703 or earlier on it,</p>
<p>and if he was signed into Microsoft account, then his folder is this way below. and Local or Microsoft on update, looks like a windows issue. So yes, Reset is maybe only choice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and if there is only a TEMP and Public folder, then something may have been messed up during upgrade or creators pack, That would be the folder Windows saved all your files and personal settings, replaced it there and somehow did
 not apply the actual user account name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is, he never came back and we have no real idea of anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned 5 letters and email as I missed the TEMP part, (too many threads going at once, my fault), but still maybe signing in with Microsoft account&nbsp;if update was done signed in&nbsp;and somehow on completion folder was not named
 and doing so and a restart might finish and fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>or a Local to Microsoft conflict, which who knows anymore, LOL,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with you 100% that reset is only option if there is really an issue with the OS or corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just answered you that there was other options if there really is no problem. He may just be stuck with TEMP user name for reasons named above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this happen before on XP and 7, where the User folder now became TEMP after service packs.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined to
<span>Adobe CS6 software?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Run the fix it from the article mentioned below:</p>
<span>Fix problems with programs that can't be installed or uninstalled:

<p><b>Method 2:
</b>Uninstall and re-install <span>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package and see if that helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Parent&#47;Child accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I have two kids and each has their own PC.&nbsp; I have upgraded them from Win 7&nbsp;to Win 8 and changed their local accounts to standard users.&nbsp; I am now interested in a MS account for each of them and using Family Safety in Win 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created the accounts already.&nbsp; One is under 13 so I had to do the verification for her and that account shows under my MS account as a child account.&nbsp; My second is 13 so that account didn't need to be verified.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since they already have profiles with settings, etc on their PCs they don't want to lose I changed their accounts to MS accounts using the Users screen.&nbsp; After that I logged in as my MS account on their PC and turned on Family Safety for their user.&nbsp; I get
 the popup saying it is active when I login as their MS account but for my 13 year old I don't see her in my account page at familysafety.microsoft.com&nbsp;as a child and didn't receive the email saying they are being monitored (read that an email would be sent
 acknowledging the monitoring somewhere).&nbsp; For each the controls seems to be working I am just not seeing any activity on my family safety page.&nbsp; I have since changed them back to their local accounts until I understand this process better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't figure out what I am doing wrong so I thought I would ask here.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible you have setup Family Safety to only work locally on your PC and not synced via the Family Safety website. We suggest to make sure that it syncs online so that what ever actions you do at the Family Safety website settings, it will take effect
 on the child's pc. Doing so will also fix the issue on activity reports not showing online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You can check the settings by going to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;
<strong>User accounts and Family Safety</strong> &gt; <strong>Family Safety </strong>
on a Windows 8 PC.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvoqwqw.blu.livefilestore.com%2fy1pu_7GxpyYbrlSfTn0VmRsKV8I-NXTsPXiJWuhJNSPzzSsADlPPClJse1NRv_HaNPFR3n8Ez8y50c%2flocal2.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" />.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to this one synced via Family Safety website:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fitm8dq.blu.livefilestore.com%2fy1pBC_MwHFd5mr42YTHkH4eQ7H7uFOLqClUYmI2L53dwr7KcNbXjQnp46dOGM9bMNgYdySr8B4On74%2flocal.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it sync with your settings online, click the <strong>Manage settings on the Family Safety website</strong>. It will direct you to the website online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to check if it works</strong></p>
<p>You can verify if Family Safety is now working by accessing a restricted website using the child's account. It will be best if the website you will try to access is added on the child's
<strong>blocked websites</strong> included in the Web filtering list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists after doing so, feel free to reply on this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and best regards.</p>

<p>Our support specialist wants to ask where do you get the error you are receiving. Is it from browser windows the pops up after clicking Manage settings on the Family Safety website or on the same window where the Manage settings on
 the Family Safety website was accessed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we would like you to try to reconfigure the Microsft account that has an Administrator privilege and give us an update to better isolate the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Richard, the error is popping up on the same window.&nbsp; IE never launches (visually anyway).&nbsp; I have not looked to see if a background&nbsp;IE task is being launched.&nbsp; What would you like me to reconfigure the admin account to reflect?&nbsp; I am using the same MS
 account on my other childs Win 8 machine and all is good there.&nbsp; If you can let me know what you would like me to change I am very happy to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi Bryan,
<div><br />
<div>We have reviewed the issue and it seems that your computer has problems syncing with Family Safety due to the local accounts being switched from local to Microsoft account, and back to local again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To troubleshoot the issue, we need to reset all the Family Safety settings on your computer and on the website. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Turn off the Family Safety settings for all user accounts.</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;<span>Sign in to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://familysafety.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://familysafety.microsoft.com</span></a><span>&nbsp;using the parent account.</span></div>
<div>
<p><span>3. Click <strong>Manage list of Family Members</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Select the <b>Parent </b>account, and then click
<strong>Remove</strong>.&nbsp;Click <strong>Remove and leave Family Safety&nbsp;</strong>to confirm.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Now switch the local accounts to Microsoft accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Enable Family Safety, and follow the steps given previously by Eugene_R to monitor the accounts on the website.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide us log files for Family Safety. I have sent you a private message for the instructions. After uploading the logs, please notify us in this thread.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Pen Delay on Huion Tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hopec1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pen Delay on Huion Tablet</h2>
                    There's nothing wrong with my tablet or my pen; there's something wrong with my computer settings. No matter what I've done, I can't stop my pen from having a few seconds of delay in art programs like FireAlpaca or Sai. I've also done whatever I can in
 those programs to fix it, but nothing has worked. I've disabled basically any setting that may interfere with drawing, but still there's a delay. I'm losing my mind over this. Can anyone think of anything that I may have missed, or something I haven't tried
 yet?&nbsp;

In my case I can't even read my old (2003/2004) .VEM files with this .VEM video player. If you have any news or update about it, let me know. I'll do the same here. Thanks!<br />
<br />
All I want is a way to convert these .VEM video files in something more common (.mov/.wmv/.mp4 etc)<br />

<h2>            Rogue devices showing up on windows 8 network in file exporer.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I connect to my wireless network (very secure and complex WPA2 password),&nbsp;I go to File Explorer and the click on the "Network" at the bottom left of the window.&nbsp; There continues to be a wireless device or phone that shows detected on the network.&nbsp; I
 have seen three different devices and mac addresses since logging on this morning.&nbsp; I have also checked the router and there is no record of these mac id's or devices on the router.&nbsp; Where would these be coming from?&nbsp; This doesn't show on my Windows 7 machines.&nbsp;
 And also, I do not own any of these phones that are appearing on the network.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You in advance for any help, </p>
<p>Phil</p>

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you click on Network in File Explorer it goes out and does a Network Discovery scan of the local subnet and reports and machines occupying an IP address within the same subnet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't explain why you are not seeing them in your router though, unless the Network Discovery results aren't accurate.&nbsp; They couldn't get an IP address unless they were able to authenticate at some point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to ping one of the IP's from a command prompt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press [Win key] + [X] then&nbsp;select Command Prompt.</li><li>Type <strong>ping xxx</strong> where xxx is the IP address.</li><li>Hit [enter].</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get request timed out or replies?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get request timed out then that device is no longer connected to the network.&nbsp; If you get replies then it is still connected to your network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick reply. The funny thing is that these devices are not issued an IP, it just shows the device and then the MAC id.&nbsp; So, I would have nothing to ping.&nbsp; I took a screen shot that I could post, but not sure how to do it.&nbsp; The correct computers
 and router show up correctly, but then there is a third section called phone and this is were the device shows up.&nbsp; Now it doesn't stay there all the time, it will just&nbsp;show up sporadically.&nbsp; And then sometimes a different phone/device shows up.&nbsp; This usually
 will happen when the computer is shut down and then turned back on later.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be easier if I could figure out how to post a screenshot.&nbsp;

            <p>If it's showing up in a network discovery scan, it had an IP address at one time.&nbsp; A device cannot connect to a network without an IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also ping by name as well if you don't know the IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like to me what you are seeing is someone's mobile phone that has connected to your wireless network.&nbsp; Since these devices are mobile yiou won't see them there all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are listed and the device isn't present, they should disappear as soon as the IP lease expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, as long as you have security enabled on your wireless network, this is a non-issue.&nbsp; If a mobile phone has WIFI enabled they will scan for local WIFI networks they can attach to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to extra secure, disable DHCP on your wireless network and then set up your machines with staic IPs.&nbsp; This way no other device will be able to connect to your network and get issued an IP unless you specifically set it up.&nbsp; But for the average
 person this is overkill.</p>

Hey Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information.&nbsp; It bugs me even though it may not be a threat.&nbsp; Just high anxiety.&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; FYI...the only phones that have connected to my network are apple devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two devices that have popped up are a Samsung galaxy and a&nbsp; Samsung
 SPH-L710.&nbsp; So...just not sure how they are getting popping up all day long.&nbsp; I also just bought this computer yesterday.&nbsp; Just frustrating.&nbsp; I did ping the device names and nothing came back.&nbsp; So they must not be there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for the responses!</p>

            <p>I don't blame you at all.&nbsp; I'd be curious as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like the Network Discovery functionality returns stale results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably a more accurate list of machines on the same machine's subnet could be displayed this way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press [Win key]+[X].</li><li>Select Command Prompt.</li><li>At the command prompt type <strong>net view</strong> and press [enter].</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will display a list of machines on the same subnet as the machine you are on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other works, if your machine is 192.168.2.10. it will scan all IP's between 192.168.2.0 and 192.168.2.255 to determine if it can find any machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>This appears to be a situation where locally connected devices i.e: a neighbour's phone may be shown in your network. This is not a security problem. As long as your internet connection is protected you should not be able to access the phone's files and
 it can't access any of yours. </p>

<p>Can you explain to me how a secure wireless network is going to have a neighbor's phone connect to it without being authenticated?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, can you provide a link to Microsoft documentation that explains how this is possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I am a bit skeptical about your possible answer but, hey, I don't pretend to know everything so I would like to read up more on this if you can provide me with documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I have this same issue.&nbsp; I assume this is because WPA2 does not protect the physical and MAC layers (after all, everyone, even the wireless network owner, needs a minimum level of wireless access in order to&nbsp;get onto&nbsp;the network). I suspect that the rogue
 cell phones attempted some sort of 'meaningful' access attempt&nbsp;in order to be seen in the Windows 8 networks view?&nbsp; Or is all it takes is for the rogue cell phone to show it's owner that there is SSID 'xyz' available that is 'secure'? Just curious.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Changes in the family settings after an update is one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening.
<br />
<br />
<br />- I suggest you to remove the account from the parent account and re add the account from the family settings and check if it helps.
<br />
<br />To remove your account.

<br />
<br />- After this perform Clean boot to eliminate software conflict

<h2>            wireless display delays when i play video.</h2>
                    I have a problem on my two windows 10 computers which i did not have before (maybe before updates.) When i connect to my tv by wireless screen project, it's okay, works fine. But whenever i play any video on the web browser, immediately wireless screen
 freezes, after a few minutes continues projecting from where it's left. it makes a few minutes delay when watching a video. And this wasn't happening 6 months ago.&nbsp;

            Persistence paid off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not get the installer package to run in Windows 7.&nbsp; Tried running it in compatibility mode and was able to install the software.&nbsp; Updated the firmware on the camera and all is working now.<br />

    <title>Trying to import my iOS camera roll to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to import my iOS camera roll to Windows 7</h2>
                    I've been trying to clear space on my iPhone because I am running low on storage so I thought I should upload my camera roll to my laptop. These are all of my photos that are not saved on my iCloud. Every time I try to import the photos i get and error
 saying "The parameter is incorrect. I tried to copy and paste my camera roll folder by folder but I get the same error. Then I tried opening them in Windows Photo Viewer and it said "... can't open this picture because it does not support the file format,
 or you don't have the latest updates to Photo Viewer". The files I tried opening are all JPG which I assumed was fine for Photo Viewer. How can I get passed this?

            <p>Hi Mar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many factors to consider why this is happening. For us to isolate the concern more precisely, can you provide more information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Itunes Version.</p>
<p>- Windows version.</p>
<p>- Update version.</p>
<p>- Try opening the files on a different viewer just to isolate if it's an app problem or file problem.</p>
<p>- Update photo viewer and check.</p>
<p>- Do a <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong></em> and observe if you can view those .jpg photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
        </p>

<h2>            hello there, why I can&#39;t install windows update kb898461&#63;</h2>
                    The windows update keeps telling me there are updates available to download, I click download but when I click install, after a while there's a message telling me there was an error on the installation. Then it goes again, there are updates available,
 and is the eternal cycle. What can I do?

            <p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>4. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2660465, KB2661637, KB2647516&nbsp;[<em>or KB2618444</em>]; KB2598479, KB2631813, KB2585542; KB2633171, KB2618451 &amp; KB971029</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>7. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> (or a clean install) of WinXP for any reason?
