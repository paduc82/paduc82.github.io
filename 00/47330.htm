<h2>            I am having problems with xbox 360 S HDCP Link not found&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have my xbox 360 slim hooked up with Hdmi for my video and my audio coming out of the original composite cable that came with the xbox 360 running to my sound bar. It works great for games and also works great for Netflix also, but when ever I try
 to watch a Dvd disc or Xbox video I get this message that the Hdcp link is not found how can I fix this so that I can watch Dvd disc and xbox video without get Hdcp Link not found?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Also in Xbox Video the movie previews work fine it's only on the stuff I bought from xbox video, I haven't rented anything from xbox video ever since I started getting this error that the HDCP Link Not Found.</p>
<p>Also my video settings are 1080p, Widescreen, Hdmi+A. And I have the display Discovery Disable also.</p>

<p>When playing back DVD Video or videos from Xbox Video, the Xbox 360 wants to encrypt the picture and sound with HDCP. If it cannot properly detect that the display can handle HDCP, or if the display is an older model which does not support it, then the Xbox
 360 will show this message. I'm surprised it doesn't happen with Netflix.</p>
<p>A possibility is that there is damage to the HDMI cable or connectors interrupting the Xbox 360 from communicating properly with the display, leaving them unable to share keys for HDCP encryption (this is done continuously while HDCP remains active).</p>
<p>Make sure that you turn on the display first and let it fully "wake up" before starting up the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Also, if you're using the original yellow/red/white AV cable for sound rather than an audio dongle, check if leaving the AV cable unplugged and only having HDMI plugged in will resolve the issue. If it does, then you might want to route the sound out of
 your display to the sound bar rather than directly from the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>What brand/model display is the Xbox 360 connected to? Also, has it worked before on that display?</p>

<p>@Zacabeb I just purchased my Emerson 50" Lcd TV on black friday of last year, I have never had it hooked up this way before on this display until a few days a go. I got it working now my problem was that I was using a universal composite cable that let you
 hookup either a xbox 360, Wii, or PS3 to the tv. I got my original Xbox brand composite cable out of the box and hooked it up with the HDMI cable the original cable and now Dvd's and Xbox Video works fine with everthing else, don't know why but it has to be
 the original Xbox cable for some reason. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be the way the ID pins are wired in the AV cables to idenfity the type. Third party cables can get this wrong (switching to S-video or SCART mode), and since the Xbox 360 expects only an audio dongle to be connected at the same time as HDMI, it
 may get confused.</p>
<p>I'm glad it works now.</p>
<p>Check though if your TV retains communication over HDMI with the Xbox 360 when switching inputs - if it doesn't, the Xbox 360 will reboot to output analog video over the AV cable instead. It's better to know in advance if this will happen than to discover
 it mid-game if temporarily switching over to another input. :)</p>

<p>@Zacabeb, Yes it reboots if I change my input temporarily are there anyway to stop it from resetting or do I just have to deal with it and not change my input when I am using my Xbox 360?</p>

<p>You can solve that problem if you get a used Microsoft AV adapter, or one of the third party brand AV adapters that have been confirmed to work correctly (I don't know off the top of my head which ones do).</p>
<p>The AV adapter is wired to ID as an audio-only connection, and the Xbox 360 will simply wait to re-establish the HDMI link with the TV if it's lost.</p>
<p>Beware though that many third party AV adapters ID as a composite cable, and have the same problem as the regular AV cable, confusing the Xbox 360 to reboot and output analog video.</p>

<p>Zacabeb is right on the money. The AV cable that let's you get analog audio and video has certain pin connections to let the console know what's plugged in. Using any AV cable or off brand adapter can cause issues. I know when I got my Chinese eBay adapter
 I had to open it up and resolder a couple wires for it to work.</p>
<p>Luckily now more third party companies make the HDMI audio adapter and you can probably get one at a local game store for around $20. Another way is if your using RCA red and white for audio most TVs have audio out so you could just connect your soundbar
 to that output and have audio from any HDMI source plus volume control with you TV remote.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Posted a similar question in the general forum.&nbsp; Did a clean install of Win 7 HP to an older system hoping to give better utility to the seldom used "kids" computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Install went quickly but the Ethernet, Network and Audio controllers did not install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The chipset is an Intel 965BFG, which Intel has no plans for providing a Win 7 driver for.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>I was playing on a silver account for the free gold week-end. Hadn't played MW3 on that account, so I had no "blind-eye", "assassin pro", etc. Seems like every map I got into, the "kiddies" were placing, betty's, claymores, etc. in all entrances, then sitting
 in their cozy corner with the heat-detection guns. Kill cam is great in this game. Now THAT"s camping. OP, don't worry about it.......</p>

<p>To say the least I am a predominantly run'n'gunner, I have no patience for sitting still and play with 2 other players of similar gaming styles. &nbsp;We're not great but hold our own against a lot of amateurs like us. Now I declare camping to be sitting in the
 same room down scope and a betty/claymore on one door and not moving. &nbsp;Thats my opinion. &nbsp;However of late I have been accused of camping:</p>
<p>Lets pick a map "Underground" I throw down a motion sensor under the bridge at the back (lower side of the map). &nbsp;I then move between the office, window and the outside ledge to cover 3 points of assault and a large area of the map minimising the chance
 of being flanked (but not enitrely. &nbsp;And rack up a pretty decent score (I play FFA and TDM) whilst supporting teammates from these positions. &nbsp;Of late this strategy has come under fire and I wondered what the communities opinion is? Discuss please</p>
<p>[/quote]If you are going to let whiners dictate how you should play the game, you play right into their pathetic, needing people to play how they expect so they feel their skill is validated, ways. No offense at all, but be a man and do as you feel. They
 didnt buy your game...or did they?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Your right. &nbsp;If they can get you to change they are happy.</p>

<p>weither it be tactical or camping it doesn't matter its always been a part of the game since day 1 and since people spent their hard earned $60+ on the game they can do whatever they want its that simple.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>So right on. Good camping is hard anyway. &nbsp;So many ways you can die.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 boot error - Automatic Repair error - SrtTrail.txt error</h2>
                    <p>I've followed multiple youtube tutorial fixes, looked at numerous microsoft community posts and tried everything I could find on the subject to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer specs:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell XPS 8500</p>
<p>i7 3770 4core</p>
<p>8gb Ram</p>
<p>1TB HD</p>
<p>Windows 8 clean install (no bloatware) and update to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was shutting the computer down during which it froze and I ended up forcing shut down with the power button on the desktop computer. I have a feeling this is associated with some sort of registry error as this is a new computer (few weeks old) and I've
 been installing all my software for Audio Production. After restarting the computer it went promptly to the Automatic repair screen, which went on attempting repair (for hours), and when I returned to the computer it had a statement saying "automatic repair
 couldn't repair your PC". Below that it reads:</p>
<p>"Log file: D:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have burned copies of both windows 7 and 8 with legit install Keys.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried running suggested solutions while using these windows disks as boot drives which still did not help.</p>
<p>I've disconnected all connected usb cables prior to attempting suggested repairs.</p>
<p>I've run CHKDSK from the command prompt and it has found no errors or corrupted sectors.</p>
<p>I've run "ePSA Pre-boot System Assessment" which is a built-in pre-windows scan which test all hardware. It finds no error with HD or memory, processor, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the Auto-Repair options to no avail. I was still loading software so I did not have a back up of any sort. Most of the support pages suggest something along the lines of "Read the Log file to see what the error is" yet I cannot find said "SrtTrails.txt"
 log file where the computer states it would be. I'm not particularly adept at command prompt operation though I understand and can follow directions well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like I've run out of options and and am considering dropping windows 8.1 and rolling back to windows 7. I do not like problems which have no clear description or solution and I worry that reloading 8.1 and spending hours installing software will bring
 me to the same error/issue. I'd really rather not reinstall everything so I'd rather not format and reinstall a system but currently see few other options. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>One last note:</p>
<p>I started into "Re-image your computer" and it asked me to look for an image file and brought up a search window. From here I headed over to the c: drive, entered the windows folder and found the srttrail.txt file that windows has been referencing as a log
 file for the boot error. I attempted to open it by right clicking and selecting "open".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It opened!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It lists all tests performed with no error codes (all are "error code = 0x0")</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the very last section says the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Root cause found:</p>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
<p>Boot Manager is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action: File repair</p>
<p>Result: Failed. Error code = 0x15</p>
<p>Time taken = 0ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>-----------------------------"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems significant but I'm not sure what to do with this info. I presume I have to somehow fix or replace the boot manager? I tried the procces mentioned in one of my prior comments ("method 3") but that didn't help as it didnt appear to recognize a
 windows operating system? So frustrating.</p>

<br />Sorry the previous answer was a mistake.
<br />
<br />As for the problem that you are presenting.
<br />In which of the 2 SSD's did you install Windows in 128 GB or 256 GB?
<br />

            Then you have installed the Windows in the SSD 256 GB that currently has a capacity of 238 GB at the end of the installation, so the space occupied belongs to the Operating System.
<br />What current capacity of available space is the 128gb SSD showing?
<br />
<br />In case the 128gb SSD shows little free space, check if you have saved the installation of the previous Operating System.

            Hi Ed
<br />
<br />If you have 118GB showing as unallocated in Disk Management, is that directly to the right hand side of your C Drive?
<br />
<br />If that is adjacent and to the right hand side of your C drive, right click your C drive and choose 'Extend Volume' and accept the default amount. That will recoup that extra storage for you
<br />
<br />if that unallocated space is not immediately to the right of your C drive, you will need to use a 3rd party utility to recoup that space, because Windows has limited partitioning capability
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download the free version of AOMEI Partition Assistant
<br />
<br />The free version of AOMEI is fully featured and will easily extend your C drive into that unallocated space . .

<p>Finally, someone is reading and afterwards comprehending the answer to the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the way Windows 10, or possibly HP, sets up the C SSD drive:&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the unallocated space is to the far right-hand side.</span></p>
<p>Therefore the MS Extend Volume procedure is not allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you for giving me assistance and I will now speak to AOMEI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            Hi Ed, glad to Help.
<br />
<br />If you install the free version of AOMEI that drive will be fixed in 2 minutes, It is great for doing the partitioning jobs Windows refuses to do . . .

    <title>Windows 8 Media Center-&#34;CANNOT PLAY DVD The DVD may be in use by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bretttaylor_mtl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Media Center-&#34;CANNOT PLAY DVD The DVD may be in use by another application</h2>
                    <p>Original title: The Windows 8 Media Center and resolution change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Center opens fine. It mostly plays videos from the hard drive fine. Photos and other features all seem okay. However, when I try to play a DVD, the resolution changes and I see the following message:</p>
<p>"CANNOT PLAY DVD The DVD may be in use by another application. If all other applications are closed, the video resolution may need to be lowered or the display connection type may not support playback of the DVD."
</p>
<p>The size of the cursor (arrow) is much larger, the font size increases and the screen is bordered vertically by black bars.
</p>
<p>I have been searching for an answer but haven't had any luck.</p>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated!</p>

 when I play a movie from the DVD it will change the resolution down to 640x480 and Windows Media Center says:
<div><br />
<div>"Cannot play DVD The DVD may be in use by another application. If all other applications are closed, the video resolution may need to be lowered or the display connection type may not support playback of the DVD."</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried another DVD but the same thing happened. I tried rebooting media center, rebooting the computer, different DVD's but nothing seems to work. I also can't seem to play DVD's in VLC on this computer either so I almost think it is hardware. I was able
 to play the same DVD's on Media Center on my windows 7 machine so the DVD's are not a problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems like BrettTaylor and I are having the same problem. We both have windows 8 pro with media center and we are not able to play DVD's in media center.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>This occurs when Hyper-V services are activated.&nbsp; Hyper-V services is the other application which is holding the DVD drive in use.&nbsp; You can verify this by deactivating / reactivating Hyper-V and checking the behaviour.&nbsp; To deactivate/reactivate Hyper-V carry
 out the following in an elevated command window:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off</p>

</p><p>Notice also that this problem is not codec related because Media Center is still capable of playing any DVDs which may have been ripped to the hard drive.</p>

</p><p>Here's almost the same problem described. And it's dated from october
<strong>2012</strong>! People still looking the solution, still waiting a fix from Microsoft. But MS's like a big politician: talking more, doing less.&nbsp;And they call it "operating system"... Maybe it is rocket science to make language input methods work?!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try locking your screen and unlocking it immediately after you set hotkeys. It helped me (I have Windows 10 Pro 2004) as well as some other people here
<a href="https://www.eightforums.com/threads/input-language-settings-problem.28133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.eightforums.com/threads/input-language-settings-problem.28133</a> .</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>* After you unlock the screen and check language hotkey settings, it will show 'None' for Ukrainian. But Ukrainian hotkeys should work anyway.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, it may also help if you toggle "Language preferences &gt; Administrative language settings &gt; Administrative &gt; Current language for non-Unicode programs". Mine is currently set to 'English'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if nothing helps, you can still use the following hotkeys for your set-up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows key + Space + 1 to switch to English</li><li>Windows key + Space + 2 to switch to Russian</li><li>Windows key + Space + 3 to switch to Ukranian</li></ul>

                    I accidentally deleted the People or Mail tile off the Windows 8 start menu. How can I get another one? I see my Hotmail has these tiles on my email account, but you can't just drop and drag this to the start menu. Is there another place I can drag it
 to to appear on the Start menu?

<h3> budstansbury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installation stuck at 95&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I've had Win 10 installed and running for several months.&nbsp; Then I discovered that my primary drive was producing random errors.&nbsp; Did a Western Digital test and came up with consistant errors.&nbsp; I decided to move the install to another drive.&nbsp; I used Acronis
 True image to backup the installation and then I installed it to 2nd drive partitioned exactly as the original "C" drive.&nbsp; This installation hung on the first screen and continued to flash the home screen on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a Window installation disk at 1511 and did the new clean&nbsp;installation update.&nbsp; The update creates the Windows welcome audio and continues with the blue screen and turning clock but never finishes the boot sequence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blue screen and clock run forever.&nbsp;
 In the repair mode I can make it to Cmd prompt but I don't know what to change at that point.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can view disk "C" and all seems oK.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clean that my installation is 95% done but something is holding it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; What can I do with Command Prompt?&nbsp; I've
 tried to do the Window Repair from the installation disk but it fails and says it can't do any repair.&nbsp; I've done chkdsk on C: and all is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

 know if it a bad file problem or missing file or bad display driver or what so I would welcome some suggestions of what I could try.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried SFC /scannow and it found nothing missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also done "Chkdsk" on C: and found no problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should
 mention that I've used the Media Creation tool to download a clean copy of Windows 10-64 Pro and used Nero to burn the ISO file to a DVD and I will try and do a clean install with that disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you have other suggestions.</p>

            <p>I just burnt the latest version of Windows 10 installation disk and tried it in my other system.&nbsp; It got to the Install screen and I started it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it showed "Setup is Starting" and froze at that point.&nbsp; Hour timer and mouse will not move.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weeks ago I had the system running fine on Win 10 until I found out about the disk errors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then it would boot fine and perform OK,..with the exception of a random error.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is when all the problem started as I tried to move it to a different disk.&nbsp;
 Just before I did the change I made a backup of the entire system using Acronis True Image 11 and I still have that backup.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I tried to recover the backup to the new drive it would lock up at a flashing desktop screen.&nbsp; That is when I started trying
 the Windows 10 installation disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm at a total loss on what to do next.</p>

            <p>None of the suggestions above help at all since the system will not boot.&nbsp; I have done all of the rest and used the 1607 installation/repair disk.&nbsp;It did boot to selection of repair and did the diagnostics and then attempted repair and after that it re-booted
 the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; However in never was able to complete the boot and just hung searching for who knows what.&nbsp; I did notice that the mouse was visible but I gave up waiting for it to boot after an hour.&nbsp; I tried the repair one more time and it did indicate it was
 attempting repair again and re-booted the system but it still would not boot by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave up on that and went back to the known good backup of the Windows 10 system I made with Acronis TI and restored that to the C: drive.&nbsp; The restore said it was successful but would not boot all the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I repeated all of the same "Diagnose and Repair"
 process with the Win10 Installation disk but the result are still the same.&nbsp; It never boots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the ability to look into the backup I made and find the Windows 10 key and I can find the old key in the Windows.old file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I have those I should be able to do a clean install of Windows 10 so I plan to try all of that tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just find
 it hard to believe that Windows does not have a better Repair disk or better diagnostics disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all of this time you would think that someone could have made a "Check list" of basic things to check with the Cmd prompt.</p>

<p>Se sim (vou dar um chute), pode ser alguma forma de divulgao do Halo 4 que tem lanamento previsto para 6 de novembro (isso justificaria o "s faltam 9 dias").</p>
<p>Mas como disse,  um palpite...</p>

<p>Valeu Gerson, acho que voc sacou a jogada. O jogo roda perfeitamente bem, o seu palpite faz muito sentido. Tambm andei pesquisando e toda vez que encontrei esse Protocolo UNSC  alguma invaso ou quebra de seguna em alguma fase do jogo.
</p>
<p>Brigado!! </p>

<p>Firstly, you shouldn't revive an answered thread from nearly 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Now as for your problem, the backwards compatibility is pre-installed on all official xbox hard drives. &nbsp;You cannot download the emulation software from anywhere official. &nbsp;If it got erased from your hard drive then you will need to purchase another. &nbsp;If
 you need to discuss this further you should start a thread of your own. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to set Windows Photo Viewer as the default program for all photo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reece.87  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set Windows Photo Viewer as the default program for all photo file types&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Win10 and now my default photo application is the Win8/10 "Photos" app and it is a horrible app. I want the old Windows Photo Viewer (WPV) application to be my default for viewing ALL images, but here's the problem - There is no way
 to set WPV as the default program. Right-clicking an image then going to "open with" doesn't work and going to control panel&gt;default programs does not work. WPV does not show up in any list using the right-click method and in controlPanel&gt;DefaultProgram settings
 WPV can only be set to the default for .tif and .tiff images. Do you have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>No worries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my&nbsp;systems I have changed to use&nbsp;Windows Photo Viewer with no problems.&nbsp; I don't know why your system is not showing that.&nbsp; Did you upgrade from 7 or 8, or is this the Insiders version?</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35ad6762-6169-48fe-b3ee-bda1560433e8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a look around and the only relevant clue I could find is here but the usual warnings apply about registry hacking - make a backup first.</p>

    <title>Wired network connection will not connect to a switch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rofrpe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wired network connection will not connect to a switch</h2>
                    We have 2 computers that are connected to a Netgear FS605V3. The Netgear switch is connected to a Cable modem provided by the Cable Company. My wife's computer connects to the internet without any problem but my new computer doesn't find the internet.
 I tried all the set-up's and when I make a broadband connection it asks me for a username and a password from my ISP which I don't have and what is not on my wife's computer either. Both computers use Vista Home Premium. My wife's 32 bit and mine 64 bit.<br />
The Ethernet Adapter local area connection is as follows<br />
Autoconfiguration IPv4 address is: 169.254.18.240<br />
Default Gateway: nothing<br />
This is the info from the computer that is not working.<br />
If I connect my wife's network cable to the switch and into the cable modem it works perfect. If I connect my wife's network cable direct to the cable modem it works perfect. I tried the same on my computer and nothing works. When I go to "View computer and
 devices" I have 2 icons, one is "unidentified network" and the other one is "Broadband".

<p><span><span>Hello Rofrpe,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The problem is you have only the one IP from you cable internet provider.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You need a Router in order to connect multiple networked computers to an ISP that assigns a single IP address to the account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A router allows multiple computers to share the single IP address.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With your current network configuration only one computer is going to be able to go through the switch and access the internet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your wifes computer is using the only IP address you have so your system will not be able to connect.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Screen glitch after Windows update</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6be0508d-0d38-4ac2-a7d0-9baf3edfe4f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6be0508d-0d38-4ac2-a7d0-9baf3edfe4f3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen has been appearing like this every few hours since I installed Windows updates (I'm not completely sure it's a result of the updates - it may be another issue, but it seems to have begun at the same time I updated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time it happens, I can't do anything with my computer. I have to switch it off at the tower and restart. When it starts up again, the screen is completely fine but then it happens again soon after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the menu on my monitor it appears as normal and not glitched so it would seem this is not a monitor issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This could be due to an incompatibility between the update and the device driver which triggers the issue. To isolate
 the concern, please provide the following the information:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Which build version currently runs on your Windows 10? (To check, type <strong>
<em>winver</em></strong> via Cortana search bar)</li><li>How long does it take before the error recurs?</li><li>By menu on my monitor are you referring to the adjustments that can be done on the actual monitor? (Brightness, Contrast, etc.)</li></ul>

<p>Thank you for the information. If the display options on the monitor appears fine, the issue could be due to the graphics driver of the device. To resolve the issue on device driver, we suggest checking this support article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers in Windows 10</a></strong>. The said article could be used as a guide on how to properly install/update your Windows device driver.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 themes</h2>
                    So when I go to settings to get themes it takes me to the themes but it is limited and most aren't for me. I want more themes but I am afraid or cautious about downloading malicious programs trying to get a theme. So is there somewhere I can download safely?

<h2>            Windows 10 installation failed</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Acer Tab 8 W810 with windows 8.1. I upgraded to windows 10 successfully and later decided to make a clean installation. However, it's stuck at a point that showed "Hi there, Let's get a few basic things out of the way" as shown in the photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completed the settings to let the installation continues. However, at one point the tablet will restart and prompt back the "Hi there, Let's...." Setting page. Regardless of how many times i completed it and next and next, it will always come back and
 i'll never be able to complete the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've done full reset and it's still the same. Please support. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I fixed it by reformatting the whole tablet, which also wiped out all the drivers. Completely back to zero (cleaner than clean installation) and download offline Windows 10 into a USB (or SD card, can't really recall) and boot from it. Once completed, went
 on to download the driver package from Acer website and finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>
