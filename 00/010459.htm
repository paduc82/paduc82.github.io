<h2>            No LastPass on Edge</h2>
                    I am on the Fast Ring. On my Dell laptop, i have Edge installed with several extensions. The LastPass extension icon on the upper right is not operational. It is a black with 3 white dots. If i click it nothing happens. When i go to a site that has passwords
 on lastpass nothing happens. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, still nothing. Edge itself seems a little unstable as i need to recover the page quite a bit, etc. Not sure what else to do so i have switched to Opera. I do like Edge and would like to use
 it.

<h2>            Getting a pivot table to sort rows by date order rather than the default Alphabetic order</h2>
                    
<p>I have a pivot table that has months as column headers and short alpha statements as row names. I am trying to get the Pivot table to sort the rows by ascending date order as defined by the month they occur in so I can pivot on a significant amount of task
 data that has a date associated with it and so create a kind of simple project plan. Short of copy &amp; pasting into the correct order I cannot find another way of doing this. Copy &amp; paste is not an workable solution for me as I want others to use this table
 and there is a significant amount of data in the source (which is in another sheet in the same Excel file)...anyone know how to solve this?</p>
<p>Many thanks in anticipation...</p>

<p>If you are using letter stock:</p>
<p>File, page setup, landscape.</p>
<p>On the publication page, Arrange, Page layout, set the margins to zero.</p>
<p>Arrange again, Ruler guides, Format ruler guides, Vertical ruler guides, 2.687 and 8.313. This will give you a 5.5 middle area.</p>
<p>Insert,&nbsp;Page, check Duplicate all objects on page 1.</p>
<p>The side areas on page 2 will be the part you will fold over. Refer to the illustration I suggested earlier. These are measurements taken from the first link I posted.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 Front facing camera blury, exaggerated skin tone changes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to understand if my frontfacing camera has a defect or it really is supposed to be that bad on a 920. I started noticing the images are always sort of blurry even though i try to hold it extremely still and that the colors are kind of bad.</p>
<p>What really put me over the edge was seeing my wife's iphone's result side by side. hers was crisp, clear, beautiful while mine looked like it was from a first generation digital camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this expected? has anyone else compared iphone 5 and 920 FF camera results side by side?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Just went to a Microsoft store and tried out some other phones on display.</p>
<p>The Lumia 920 DEFINITELY has a bug. The front facing camera does not focus. I tried on the 810 and got much better pictures. I tried the HTC 8X and also got better pictures. Lumia 920 just snaps the photo as is without any focusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please look into this and verify. I can't believe no one is making a stink about this already. its a glaring oversight.</p>

            Hi Amakhan,<br />
<br />
Traditionally front facing cameras have not had much technical focus as most people use the back facing cameras to take photos. However, with the advent of the Facebook-photogenic generation, there has been a sharp rise in the use of front facing cameras for
 impromptu poses.<br />
<br />
Now, there are differneces in the hardware between the phones you have listed. For one, the Nokia 920 only has a 1.3MP front camera, while the HTC 8X has a 2MP snapper (which HTC claim is even better with their proprietary imaging technology). Obviously, photos
 are going to look better on the HTC as they have obviously focussed effort on their cameras. The same case could be made for the iPhone, as their adverts always seem to have people making FaceTime calls.<br />
<br />
It all depends on your needs, if you find your front facing camera more important than your back facing camera, then by all means the HTC or iPhones are the phones for you. In upcoming firmware updates for the 920, the imaging of the front facing camera may
 be improved, but complaints about the quality are few and far between.

<p>I sure hope the firmware updates will address this issue. This is my primary request at this time.</p>
<p><br />
I don't think its right to have a dismissive attitude toward wanting a decent front facing camera. Nokia put the camera there, it should take good pictures. Facebook, youtube and myspace have been around for a long time. Many people like to take pictures of
 themselves. I dont think its wise to write off this segment of the market.</p>
<p>All i'm saying is that the phone has a camera. I'm sure it is able to focus. They just need to use some of the technology they use for the main camera in this one. I dont expect it to be as good, but it needs to be better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, FF cameras are usually&nbsp;used to take pictures of the user -- someone with a face. you can use the algorithm published over a decade ago (<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/viola/Pubs/Detect/violaJones_IJCV.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/viola/Pubs/Detect/violaJones_IJCV.pdf</a>),
 find the face, and focus on it like even the cheapest point and shoot cameras are doing these days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attitude that "this phone is not for that" is exactly why the iphone has done so well. Otherwise, why should we have internet or apps on the phone either -- heck, its for making calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might seem petty, but I was literally in the car with my wife. we were goign to go return her iphone and ger her a lumia. she happened to snap a photo of herself on my camera. it was terrible. we turned around and went home. That's one sale lost. There
 are lots of poeple that use Facebook and want to take and post photos of themselves. Lets not give up on that market because we dont want to put some software into one of the cameras on the phone known for its camera.</p>

            It's not that the is better on other phones. It's the fact that Nokia decides to place the FF camera right at the curved part of the screen making the upper half of the picture blurry and all stretched

                    <p>Greetings, okay I don't need anyone talking about backs ups and stuff I need answers here my scenario of what happened. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left my laptop on for an hour because I had collage, I was doing a download that had nothing to do with this and I couldn't install the software cause my files on documents, music etc disappeared. how ever the day before windows said it would schedule
 a automatic update that I forgot about I thought it may be some small update. When I return home I thought the download of my software would be done but unexpectedly I found that windows has perform an update but when it restarted the laptop all my files were
 gone and it look as if the desktop went to default and my icons were gone. I check C drive but it was normal but my work downloads pictures music and videos were gone. Then I followed some forum to find a windows.old &nbsp;and moved my stuff back but when I never
 had time to move everything as I had to go back to class and turn my laptop off. But here's the problem upon start up the laptop said window were reverting back to a earlier stage presumably before the update the music files where there but the other files
 were gone and the window.old is not there I can't find it I tried clicking on show hidden files but it's gone is there another way to get the windows.old again &nbsp;</p>

It would make a big difference as this is the site for testing the preview versions and would help us to know if it's a problem with the version released to the public, if it is the preview version we were all advised not to put any files or programs unless
 we have a backup. and not to use the Preview version as our main system as it may crash and delete files, you can check to see what version you have&nbsp; by going to&nbsp;
<strong>Settings </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Updates/Security&nbsp; </strong><strong>updates</strong>&nbsp; and click on
<strong>activation</strong> it will tell you if it is the preview version

            You cannot force users to run macros so there is no way to do this with macros that is foolproof. Many users will not run macros contained in third party documents because of their potential for malicious action.<br />
<br />
How and to whom are you distributing this document? If you are allowing users to download it, it would be better if you created a web page in which the user was obliged to agree the terms before access to the download was provided.<br />

            <p>Hi Rofas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could create a pivot table by selecting column A and B and click "Insert" and then click "Pivot Table" (or use shortcut alt+D+P+F)</p>
<p>Add Employee Name to the row label and drag "Work Date" to the values area. Then right click the values area and click "value field settings" and click "Min" in the "Summarize Values By" tab and change the Number format to date.</p>
<p>You can drag "Work Date" one more time to the values section and repeat the previous steps but this time selecting "Max"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And you should have a nice summary of the start and end dates by employee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Vijay</p>

            Unfortunately not. Voicemail is a network function, not a phone function (ie. the message is stored on the operator's systems, not in your phone).<br />
<br />
What usually happens with voicemail is that the phone first registers an unanswered call, and
<i>that</i> is something that you can have reminders for with 3rd-party software. Run a google search for a piece of software called "S60 Best Reminder". You can set it to keep nagging you until you acknowkledge the missed call or until you read your unread
 messages etc.

<p>2 options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1 - Browse to the location on your phone and then download directly to your phone. It will auto install on completion of download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2 - Download to your pc and then use pcsuite to install to phone.&nbsp;</p>

            Option 3: Send it to your phone via bluetooth. It'll be in your inbox and opening the "message" will launch the installation process.<br />
<br />
Option 4: Copy it to your memory card via drag'n'drop or copy/paste with the phone connected to the PC in mass storage mode, then disconnect the phone, navigate to the location where you deposited the .sis file and open it from within the file manager.

<p>1) Images below.</p>
<p>2) Of course that will work but we have 100's of power point presentations that are being affected - that is not the ideal solution.&nbsp; We are wondering why the update to High Sierra OS has screwed up all of our presentations.</p>

<p>Hi Sandy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the problem, we still need to confirm some information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you tried rebooting your Mac?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Does this problem happen to every PowerPoint presentations which contain images?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I believe this is an issue concerning PPT's connected to a dropbox in High Sierra iOS - I was just hoping this post would find someone else experiencing the same issues.

<p>Hi Sandy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your reply, I supposed that the problematic files are in the dropbox, so we'd like to confirm that do the files in your local drive also have the problem.</p>

<h2>            Create a link to several paragraphs in OneNote</h2>
                    Hi, Everyone!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I create a link to paragraph in OneNote the link looks like:</div>
<div>"onenote:///\\HOME\Users\Administrator\Documents\OneNote%20Notebooks\My%20Notebook\test.one#test&amp;section-id={0155B48E-A81A-405F-97D3-E050515489DA}&amp;page-id={3390BA3C-C68E-4677-905E-0F32B0E4DDBB}&amp;object-id={03742E15-22DE-4FEE-A997-F824B4900799}&amp;A"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I create a link to several paragraphs? Can I define several "object-id" values in this link, so when I click this link the several paragraphs will be selected?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            That is not possible. Links are to a single object. That object can be a notebook, a section group, a section, a page or a page object. It cannot be multiple objects.

<h2>            Will Office 365 ever introduce subtasks&#63;</h2>
                    Will Office 365 desktop version&nbsp;ever introduce subtasks?&nbsp; Most people don't need the power of MS Project but rather would like an option in each individual task to have a drop down box to select a subtask project.&nbsp; Cat.'s is just not enough to efficiently
 use i.e.&nbsp;GTD planning model.&nbsp; I think Microsoft would gain a lot more users if they employed this simple feature or introduce even as an add-in and charge a small fee if needed.&nbsp;

            The version of Word currently delivered by Office 365 is Word 2013, so I wouldn't expect you to see much difference. In my installation,
<strong>Find In</strong> and other action buttons in the <strong>Find</strong> dialog are disabled until I enter something in the "Find what" box. Are you saying that, even with some "Find what" text,
<strong>Find In</strong> is still disabled? You do have to click it and select the story you want to search.

            Well, you don't have to do anything to get it you <span style="font-style: italic">
recognize</span> UK English other than give it UK English to be recognized :-) If you do Word will recognize it as such. But what you set in Tools&gt; Language is just the default for new documents you create. It doesn't change anything in existing documents...<br />
<br />
The default Language selected by any user in their installation of Word does nothing to change the Language formatting of an existing document. To change the Language you first need select the text to which the formatting change is to be applied. ten select
 the Language it is to be marked as. Alternatively, edit the Style applied to the text to specify the preferred Language. Language is a formatting attribute in Word just like Bold, Italic, font color, etc. The difference is that it isn't as openly visible.
 It's applied to the text based on the default Language selected by the creator of the document &amp; carried forward by the Styles used in the document.<br />

<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. I apologize for the delayed reply, though. I understand that you don't want to lose the contacts from your Microsoft account when you facilitate an import process from their end.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, can you give us a little background on how exactly the import process will be performed. As far as I know, you need to
<strong>Export</strong> your contacts from the People page to a <strong>.csv</strong> file to have it imported into another email provider. This process should not delete your contacts your People page and on our database.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To export your contacts, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your&nbsp;<a href="http://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People</a> page</li><li>On the red orange toolbar on top of the page, click the dropdown option for <strong>
Manage</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Export</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the provider that you are transferring your contacts with is a partner of <a href="http://www.trueswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TrueSwitch</a>, you can also use that tool to facilitate the transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have clarifications, you can always post back for assistance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Conditional If logic in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> batmanfan06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional If logic in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I would like to calculate a conditional statement, in hours and minutes, based on the value of another field. Here is what I have so far as a picture example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90ab789b-3312-4d37-9bd9-84b07f8c910f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90ab789b-3312-4d37-9bd9-84b07f8c910f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the Hours/Day - Breaks and Lunch box to subtract from the start and end time based on rules. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the total Time per Day is between 0 and 3:59 then no change</p>
<p>If the total time per day is between 4:00 and 5:59 then subtract 0:15</p>
<p>If the total time per day is between 6:00 and 7:59 then subtract 0:45</p>
<p>If the total time per day is between 8:00 and 11:59 then subtract 1:00</p>
<p>If the total time per day is 12:00 or more, subtract 1:15</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer needs to populate for Hours per Day - Breaks and Lunch</p>
<p>
</p><p>So using the example, at&nbsp;3:00 for total time per day&nbsp;there is no change</p>
<p>At 5:00, it should subtract 0:15 to give me 4:45</p>
<p>At 7:00, it should subtract 0:45 to give me 6:15</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone be able to help me write this code? I have tried several and cannot get it to work. My thought is that it will include IF logic but I am unsure if I need other logic or what this formula would look like. Anyone with expertise in writing logic
 I would greatly appreciate your help</p>

<p>Note that Excel stores date/time as an integer (number of days) and fraction (hours within that day) so your time conversions are as follows. While you can use these values directly in your formula, it is probably easier to just create a helper range. Put
 your time values in Z1:Z8 shown as what is in column A in my screenshot. Note that you will have to add the leading zero on the first two for Excel to realize you are entering a time.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/571fdfa2-b796-47ed-8ea6-01f21ada6885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/571fdfa2-b796-47ed-8ea6-01f21ada6885" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it becomes easier to write your IF statement in B5 (aircode: check the number of parens)</p>
<p>=IF((B3-B2)&lt;Z5,(B3-B2),IF((B3-B2)&lt;Z6,(B3-B2)-Z1,IF((B3-B2)&lt;Z7,(B3-B2)-Z2,IF((B3-B2)&lt;Z8,(B3-B2)-Z3,<br />
IF((B3-B2)&gt;=Z6,(B3-B2)-Z4)))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you didn't want to use a helper column, just replace the Z references with the numbers shown in column B of the screenshot:</p>
<p>=IF((B3-B2)&lt;.16667,(B3-B2),IF((B3-B2)&lt;.25 etc</p>
<p>

<h3> howdyhedberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will i be able to update from windows 10 preview to a 32 gb version&#40;tablet&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running windows 10 on my Toshiba encore with 32 gb.<br />
However i only have 2 GB left and by that I cant use OneDrive.<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is, will there be a chance to update to a compromised (nettbook?)&nbsp;version of windows 10 preview?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read that I don't have to go back to windows 8.1 when the final version is out so it would be great if I could update to the compromised version later.<br />
<br />
Thank you great guru tech ppl!</p>

            <p>No, you won't be able to do an upgrade. Windows 10 build upgrades require a minimum of 16 GBs free disk space alone if you are installing from DVD or USB media. Build to build upgrades can sometimes push that requirement up to 25 GBs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option is to do a custom clean install of the next build when it becomes available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft was recommending users running compressed installations of Windows 8.1 wait until such configurations are officially supported. Right now, it is not officially supported in build 9926. So, I suggest you prepare to do a fresh install of the next
 build.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 Frames</h2>
                    <p>I use frames to contain tables with their captions in many of my documents.&nbsp; I've just upgraded to Word&nbsp;O365 for business&nbsp;from 2007, and now have trouble centering some of my tables within the frames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually set the width of a frame to the column width, then have the caption left justified and the table center justified. There are a couple of tables (new tables in a template where most tables were set up in W2007) that refuse to move to the horizontal
 center of the frame.&nbsp; As far as I can tell the frame and table settings are correct, but the tables refuse to budge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas?</p>

            You can prevent the table from breaking across a page by setting the attribute for the row of the outer table so that it will not break across a page.

<p>I'm starting to think they broke frames, which will be very sad for me.&nbsp; Thank you for trying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the big issues with using frames as I do has been that they are broken by style changes.&nbsp; I have had to be very careful to turn auto update for styles off.&nbsp; In docs with 50 or so frames, having them all break when you are under deadline is a terrible
 thing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent Microsoft a frowny face from the file menu that refernces this discussion, it will be interesting to see if it gets read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for trying!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>One of the advantages of Frames, IMO, is that they can be part of a paragraph Style. They are built into paragraph formatting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>General advice is to keep autoupdate of styles from the template switched off. I consider it to be a development tool, not for daily use in documents.</p>

                    I am new on&nbsp;Microsoft Office&nbsp;Starter 2010, and find it hard to refer to the&nbsp;Help displays, preferring the printed page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone recommend the titles of good manuals or handbooks which I can buy at a bookstore or find in a public library?&nbsp; Particularly

<h2>            Office 365 for Mac crashes in High Sierra 10.13.6</h2>
                    <p>I have installed office365 version 16.24 in my Mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I print any documents from Excel, Word, and Power point, it automatically shows error message and shut down the software. I am using a printer connected with wifi. So, is there someone else who experiences the same issue and how can it be solved?&nbsp;<br />

<p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the test purpose, I’ll suggest you create a new user account on your mac to check if you can take printouts from
 Office documents without any issue. Sometimes, a user's specific information may be corrupted, therefore, you are not able to use Office apps to take prints, new user account will help us check if this is the case.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please check the following article to know how to create a new user account on mac:

<p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try the following suggestions, check if there’s any improvement:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Update wifi printer firmware-</span><span>update the software on the printer, not the
 software on your Mac or iOS device.</span></li><li><span>Update Office to the latest version i.e.
</span><em><span>16.25 (Build 19051201).
</span></em>You can manually update Office apps, click <strong><span>Help</span></strong> &gt;
<strong><span>Check for Updates</span></strong> from any of the Office 365 app to get the latest build.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>After applying above updates, try taking the printout, see if it still crashes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, send any document to us so we can test on our end. You can send the document in private message. Please click

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested on my end with the document you provided in private message and I was able to print without any error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned, your colleagues can print successfully from their macs, it just you who is facing trouble when printing. In this case let’s compare the environment to identify the root cause. With any colleague of yours who can print, please compare
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Please compare the Office for mac version on your colleague’s mac with yours.</li><li>Check if your OS version is same as your colleague.</li><li>Check if you have an updated printer driver installed (Since you mentioned in PM that you do not have authority to check or update printer firmware, I’ll suggest to contact the IT.)
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>One of these three could be the reason behind this problem. Once we narrow it down, we may find the cause.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>

    <title>Creating links to paragraphs, pages or sections of a notebook shared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating links to paragraphs, pages or sections of a notebook shared on Skydrive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently shared my OneNote notebooks to Skydrive and have found some odd behaviour when I create a link to a paragraph, page or section in a Skydrive-shared notebook. This is how I'm creating the link:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the paragraph, page or section I want to create the link to, right-click and select 'Copy Link to &lt;whatever&gt;</li><li>Locate and select the text I want to become the link </li><li>Hit Ctrl + K and paste the link from the clipboard, click 'OK' </li></ol>
<p>The URL of the link's path has the format https://cid-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.office.live.com/...</p>
<p>The problem is that when I click the link, I would <em>expect</em> that the OneNote desktop client app would just jump to the linked paragraph, page or section, but the OneNote<em>web app</em> opens in my browser and slowly loads the notebook!</p>
<p>Is this the expected behaviour?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>/Neil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            This is a known issue in OneNote 2010 with SkyDrive notebooks. The workaround is to NOT use the Hyperlink dialog (Ctrl + K) but instead just paste the link directly on the page. This will create a link with the page's title then you can right click and
 choose Edit Link to edit the text. This will correctly link to the page and clicking on the link will take you to the page within OneNote instead of opening the browser.<br />

<h2>            This action is not supported while an older version of outlook is running</h2>
                    <p>I am an early adopter and have paid for the new Office 365/office 2013. <br />
<br />
The problem is my company is still on an exchange 2003 server, which is not supported by Office 2013. Why MSFT isn't backwards compatible for 10 years is beyond me. My company will not upgrade to 2007 till next year.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't do certain things now that I have upgraded to the new Office 2013 that I could under Outlook 2010, such as right click on a picture and email it. I need this capability.
<br />
<br />
I can't delete Office Outlook 2013, as it is a bundle in the directory. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

They supported the last two versions... maybe if they didn't come out with a new 'VERSION' and just provided timely updates, then we wouldn't have this problem.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sort of flippant answer is the reason Apple is gaining marketshare and destroying MSFT.
