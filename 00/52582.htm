            Well I have fixed it myself...
<div>I have been reading my @ss off all over the place out of sheer frustration...</div>
<div>Turns out that the service "<span>SSDP Discovery" was disabled for some unidentified reason.</span></div>
<div><span>turned it on and 'voila' there were my network devices.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I am really surprised that none of the support engineers were able to diagnose this...</span></div>

    <title>Windows 8 Pro Hyper-V host disk usage at 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jspartacus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Pro Hyper-V host disk usage at 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped. I have a Windows 8 Pro Hyper-V host running a Windows 7 Pro VM. When I start the VM, the disk usage on the disk that it is installed on goes to 100% (on the host). All disk,&nbsp;RAM, &amp; CPU usage looks normal on the host. The only symptom on the
 host is extreme latency when I click things (!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, the host is running Windows 8 Pro. It has three physical disks--one SSD that the OS installed on, and two RAID arrays totaling 18TB each. It has one physical processor, 6 cores w/hyper-threading. 32GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VM is the only VM, and I've allocated 16GB of RAM w/dynamic RAM enabled. I've allocated 8 cores to it. The OS is installed on a 500GB virtual disk. I had hooked up a second 4TB (GPT) virtual disk, but it is currently disconnected. I was thinking that
 maybe it was the problem, but the disk usage is still maxed out at the present time. The only other thing I tried, admittedly as a long-shot, was to change the paging location to the other empty&nbsp;disk (on the host). That hasn't had an effect, either, and&nbsp;I'll
 likely put it back when I can.&nbsp;As I type this, the VM is rebooting after&nbsp;having installed the&nbsp;Hyper-V integration&nbsp;services and a Windows&nbsp;Update (including SP1). This&nbsp;will likely take a while...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any&nbsp;thoughts are appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you an idea, the error code 80070057 may appear due to several reasons. It can be due to some required services that are not running or system file corruption. To help you troubleshoot and successfully install the update, we'd like to ask for additional
 information. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What build and version of Windows 8.1 are you using?</li><li>Have you completely uninstalled the third-party antivirus on your PC? You may check with the manufacturer if they have a tool that they can provide you so we can isolate the issue.</li><li>Have you tried checking if the status of Windows Update in <strong>Services </strong>
app is running?&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf291f30-c7a7-488f-8967-505a8d3b3ef0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having the same issue since this update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows will auto-install this quality rollup in the background, then I will get the prompt to Update &amp; Restart or Update &amp; Shut Down. I Update &amp; Restart.</li><li>On the light blue screen, the system applies some changes up to about 11% or so, then restarts.</li><li>After the restart, the light blue screen continues and gets to 29% (every time), then says "We couldn't complete the updates, undoing changes."</li><li>It restarts again (and this may happen a couple times, I don't recall), and then I can log in as usual. This whole process takes a lot of time and it happens every time I need to restart or turn on the computer.</li></ul>
<p>What I have done to date to try and resolve this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have scoured the event viewer looking for errors but found none that could be related to this issue. I even cleaned up some of the other errors, so now there are only warnings and one error for the Source "DistributedCOM" which
 says "The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID {... long string of characters and numbers... }.</li><li>Tried to install the update over wired connection instead of wireless (did not work).</li><li>I installed all of Window's optional updates except the quality rollup previews.</li><li>I ran the "Fix problems with Windows Update" tool (as an Administrator). No matter how many times I run it, it finds and fixes the same errors:
<ul>
<li>Potential Windows Update Database error detected 0x80070490</li><li>Windows Update components must be repaired</li></ul>
</li><li>Both of the above errors are listed as "Fixed," yet the appear every time I run the troubleshooter and get "fixed" again.</li><li>After the "fix," I manually download and install the Quality Rollup again and have the same issue. I have tried disabling my anti-virus (BitDefender) as well, and this does not succeed either.</li></ul>
<p>Machine Specs:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 8.1</li><li>Intel Core i7-3630QM</li><li>640bit OS, x64-based processor</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 670MX</li></ul>
<p>Let me know if you need anymore information. Please assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>So I have nba league pass. Obviously xbox one does not have NBA or NHL apps since Sony has the exclusive rights.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So my question is... Can the web browser on the xbox one pull up league pass on nba.com website and just watch it via that on my xbox one? I havent dived to far into smartglass yet but can I load the league pass app on my S4 or my ipad while using smartglass

<p>Considering that there are millions of people like myself that pay $300/year for NFL Sunday Ticket, then no they are not going to just let people have access to it for free. &nbsp;The only way you get that free is if you are a new DirecTV customer and then you
 have to pay the going rate after the first year if you wish to keep it.</p>

<p>Gametime and NHL apps are exclusive to &nbsp;ps4 this year... no idea about the future they say. &nbsp;Which is ridiculous because the xbox is the entertainment system and they are stealing my league pass from me.. I paid 199.99 for nba league pass on tablet, pc and
 xbox but now theres not gametime app for xbox one so i have to watch on my freaking laptop... might just connect my laptop to my tv but still the xbox app was so convenient.

<h3> samanthaport  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 stuck on &#34;Preparing Automatic Repair&#34; black screen</h2>
                    <p>I have searched and found another topic about this here, but the answer given by Microsoft did not help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot boot my computer to desktop. Whenever I try to restart it (which I have to do manually with the power button), the farthest I get is the HP logo on a black screen with the message "Preparing Automatic Repair." I literally left it running overnight
 while I slept and it never changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other topic I read on this problem said to use a Windows boot disk created by downloading an ISO and either burning it to a DVD or USB stick. However because I am unable to boot to the desktop, I literally cannot create a boot disk. How can I get to
 the boot menu so I can load up Safe Mode or something else? There has to be a way to force it to show up.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Samantha
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply Dave!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it seems I am unable to do this twice in a row, as it goes back and forth between a regular black screen with the spinning dots, and the "Preparing Automatic Repair" screen. What can I do to get around this?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Samantha
<br />
<br />When the 'Preparing Automatic Repair' fails, do you not get a blue screen with 2 buttons, one of which is 'Advanced Options'?

<br />
<br />If you cannot get into the Recovery Environment as mentioned bove, to you have access to another PC?
<br />
<br />If so, use that to create bootable Windows 10 Media, then boot your system from that and rather than installing Windows 10, choose 'Repair this Computer'
<br />
<br />That will get you into the Recovery Environment and allow you to try the options listed above . . .
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<p>No, I do not have access to another PC, that is why I was asking how to force it to boot into the recovery menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there really no other way around this than to create a boot disk?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Samantha
<br />
<br />A legacy option may work on your system, depending on its age . . .
<br />
<br />Boot up your system and repeatedly press F8 on the manufacturers logo screen
<br />
<br />If that does not work, then a boot disk is going to be your only option. . . .

            I managed to borrow a computer and create a USB boot disk. However, despite the fact I set it first in the load order in BIOS, when I start the computer up, it is still going to the HP logo loading screen. What now?&nbsp;

            Hi Samantha
<br />
<br />If you boot back into BIOS, where you changed the boot order, do you see a Secure Boot option?
<br />
<br />If so, turn that off while you are installing Windows, then turn it back on when the installation completes . . .

            I disabled the secure boot option, but it still just brings up the HP logo screen when I try to boot.&nbsp;

<p>Do i need to get a specific Windows 7 home download?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Personal Opinion</h2>
                    
<p>The following is based on what I have currently read.</p>

<p>First of all you are bundling the kinect with the xbox forcing up the price for a console thats going to be hard for people to afford without it and for me I dont intend on using this piece of crap let alone owning it.</p>

<p>Secondly this whole DRM bull**** is taking the ***, I know several people who do not have internet access where they live so they wont be able to play anything.</p>

<p>Thirdly I just saw this today</p>

<p>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/05/26/microsoft-files-complaint-to-acquire-xbox-one-websites</p>

<p>Are you kidding me, you want to get a site someone else registered for free because you were too goddamn lazy to check before you decided to call it that so you are trying to do someone out of the site and get it for free.</p>

<p>You money grubbing rippoff son of a ***, I hope your new console tanks big time and I hope your company fails big time.</p>

<p>Gamers want a gaming console, A GAMING CONSOLE a console that plays games.&nbsp; We want to watch TV we wont waste electricity using the one as a 3rd party program.</p>

<p>You are too arrogant and too cocky and I severely hope you get bitchslapped if you carry on the way you are.</p>

<p>I don't own the kinect now, I don't intend on owning the kinect and forcing it to be in every xbox 360 you shouldn't be charging for it period let alone not making the xbox work if it isn't detected.</p>

<p>Also on a last note if there are 2 consoles in 1 home you are forcing people to buy the game twice when they should be able to just play from the same disc they have paid for.</p>

<p>If everything I have read happens I hope to god it kicks you sooooo hard in the *** your great great great great great great great great grandkids feel it.</p>

<p>Ps, I also spotted this.</p>

<p><b>--MS Finance director told stockholders it could be used to listen to conversations or detect products in a room, and then automatically tailor ads to that individual.</b></p>

<p>Are you kidding me, you want to get a site someone else registered for free because you were too goddamn lazy to check before you decided to call it that so you are trying to do someone out of the site and get it for free."</p>

<p>Yeah, seriously, even Apple, the sue happy company, has the farsight to get all the domain names they think may even be relevant (including typos) before they even announce a product and on top of that, last I heard when they aren't first to the punch, they
 pay the person for it! </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope the judge puts MS in their place. Just cause they didn't have the farsight doesn't mean they should be able to bully the guy into giving them the domain name (and make no mistake, that's what they are hoping to do. THey are a large company with lawyers
 and hoping the guy doesn't have the money or time to lawyer up).</p>

<p>I don't know who the hell designed this forum but the reply function kinda is horrible. For one notice I have to quote you myself cause there is no quote function that I can tell. And I've noticed and try to remember myself that people put "-" 's in between
 paragraphs cause the reply function doesn't seem to acknowledge spaces between paragraphs. Oh, and you can't even edit it if you forget the dashes. Anyways, I still forget sometimes but I'm getting better at remembering that.</p>

<p>Jelly most of us feel the same way... its outrageous. Its gonna take a huge loss for MS to change gears. They should either A. Get out of the console business if its not profitable enough or B. Tailor their product to the wants and needs of its intended
 audience. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Right now they're basically saying "you will have less freedom and no real ownership of games, prices will stay the same or raise..but you'll still buy it because its an xbox."</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Thats the current state.. I'm honestly proud that the gaming community has voiced their outrage rather than playing into some childish console war. I guess the demographics really have changed.

<h2>            These files might be harmful to your computer</h2>
                    I tried a lot of solutions for the above warning but none worked.&nbsp; I had IE9 and didn't get the error.&nbsp; I installed IE11 and got the error.&nbsp; I removed IE11 and reinstalled IE9 and don't get the error.&nbsp; I cannot believe Microsoft sends people on&nbsp;wild goose
 chases trying this and that and always imply that malware, viruses etc. are involved, or that you need to do a system restore.&nbsp; All I wanted to know is how to add my D drive to the intranet security section and since nobody could seems to come up with that
 answer, I reverted to IE9, which won't work with many websites and installed Firefox.&nbsp; I really prefer IE but won't reinstall on IE11 my Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; I can't fathom how all the brilliant minds at Microsoft can't solve this issue....

            My computer runs Windows 7 and has two internal drives, C and D.&nbsp; D runs 2 - 1 TB drives in a RAID configuration.&nbsp; Everything has been running fine for a long time.&nbsp; I decided to upgrade my IE9 to IE11 since many websites require that now.&nbsp; Immediately
 after installing, I started getting the pop-up warnings.&nbsp; I looked for a solution on the web and finding none, uninstalled IE11 and reinstalled IE9.&nbsp; Everything works fine now with no popups when moving or dragging files.&nbsp; I would like to upgrade to IE11 again
 but am not willing to put up with those annoying pop-ups.&nbsp; Since my desktop is actually on my D drive, not my C drive, I believe that is the issue and would like to be able to add the D desktop to my intranet zone.&nbsp; At least, that appears to be what I need
 to do.&nbsp; I do not want to change my desktop to C as I only have the operating system and programs on that drive.

            OK, so after Microsoft ended support for all IE versions except ie11, I reinstalled it and once again get the popup warning when I try to drag files from desktop to the recycle bin.&nbsp; My desktop is on my local D drive.&nbsp; Also, if I select more than 16 files
 and click right to check properties, I get the same warning.&nbsp; Can someone please help?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Let’s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer
 in <strong><span>No Add-ons</span></strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can diagnose that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable
 the add-on. To open <strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong> in
<strong><span>No Add-ons mode</span></strong>, please do the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click the
<strong><span>Tools</span></strong> button, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Manage add-ons</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Under <strong><span>Show</span></strong>, tap or click
<strong><span>All add-ons</span></strong>, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click <strong>
<span>Disable</span></strong>, and then tap or click

<p>When the pictures&nbsp;are uploaded they will be saved as stored on the disk so if they need rotation I will see picture in the wrong (rotation) state&nbsp;and will rotate them manually!</p>

Then it's a BAD design ! </p>
<p>It looks like Windows 8&nbsp;isn't made for developers, websitebuilders, CMS maintenance and so on.

<p>None of the "solutions" work to eliminate what is obviously another attempt my MS to "think" for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of having other solutions, why not have a switch to turn this "feature" off.</p>

    <title>How to disable touchpad delay on a generic driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alistaircheek  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable touchpad delay on a generic driver</h2>
                    Hey there so I got a new tablet with a click in keyboard and touchpad, these all work great appart when it comes to gaming. The issue is that I have no way to disable touchpad delay for some reason the option in the settings isn't available. I checked
 my drivers and it seems that windows is just using default drivers for the keyboard and touch pad ( its a Chinese tablet so guessing there isn't a specific driver for these) so I was wondering if any one knew how to get this touch pad delay disabled since
 its stopping me from playing games which need the use of wasd keys and the touchpad in unison.

 disable

<h2>            Touchscreen not working - Windows 8 - Lenovo Flex 15</h2>
                    <p>I bought my laptop 'Lenovo Flex 15' about a two weeks back. The touch screen was all working fine until yesterday!! It suddenly stopped functioning! I read all possible articles relating to this and tried to fix it but none of it works. Some quote it to
 be a bug relating to the power management in windows 8. Even this did not help me out.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Tried reinstalling windows 8 with a complete cleanup, basically a reset (did not want to try upgrading to windows 8.1 since all those users face the same problem)</p>
<p>2. Device Manager &gt; Human interface devices &gt; USB Input device. In this I disabled the option 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' in the power management tab. Also disabled 'Selective USB suspend' in power settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that there are a lot of users out there facing similar issue with their touch screen laptops running windows 8. We bought a touch screen laptop only looking at the functionality of windows 8 and here it is not letting use the touch screen :/
 Requesting Microsoft to find a quick fix for this at the earliest. Pls!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dnt worry. I got my lappy fixed when I did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Device Manager &gt; Human interface devices &gt; USB Input device. In this I disabled the option 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' in the power management tab. Also disabled 'Selective USB suspend' in power settings.</p>
<p>2. Removed the battery and replaced it back</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already done the first step, do the second step as well. It should do the trick. Do let us know if it works.</p>

    <title>Media Player Not Responding When Ripping... Occurs VERY Frequently - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media Player Not Responding When Ripping... Occurs VERY Frequently</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows Media Player 11 with Vista Home Premium Edition.&nbsp; About every second CD that I try to rip, I get a "Not Responding" error.&nbsp; Actually, this happens whether I am trying to rip to my HD or burn to a CD from WMP.&nbsp; If I close and "look for
 a solution," sometimes I can reopen WMP and rip another CD before I get the "Not Responding" error again, sometimes I can't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a fix that involved deleting the Media Player subdirectory and rebuilding -- didn't work.&nbsp; I have the latest issue of 11.&nbsp; How do I get this to work reliably on my laptop?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Mawgui,</p>
<p>When did it last work fine?</p>
<p>Are you getting any error code?</p>
<p>Try the following steps.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1</span></strong></p>

<p>4. Select Digital and Use error correction on both Playback and Rip portion</p>
<p>5. Click on Apply and then click on Ok.</p>
<p>6. Try to rip music and check.</p>
<p><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p>To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system

<p>3. At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow</p>
<p>When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.</p>

 new desktop my old laptop wich was running perfect has the same problem of starting up in the middle of the night, and sometimes during daytime when i start my pc wich is scary. Can some plz help me fix this or at least the startup problem. Btw i already checked

    <title>Number pad that comes with Sculpt wireless keyboard. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Number pad that comes with Sculpt wireless keyboard.</h2>
                    <p>I just pulled this two-piece keyboard out of the box.&nbsp; Win 10 required a restart.&nbsp; Number pad has never worked.&nbsp; The Ikea-style instruction booklet suggests opening the back, but there is no insulating tape under the battery, and no separate wireless receiver.&nbsp;
 I DID receive two Nano Transceiver certificates, Models 1496 and 1558, with different Registration numbers, but there's no sign of a second transceiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help files don't address this issue and/or relate to Bluetooth devices, which this is not.&nbsp; There do seem to be 308 people with the same issue, and no competent answer.</p>

            Both mice will have a device listed in Device Manager in Control Panel. Rightclick each for its Properties, and set each to the hand you prefer.

<h2>            Blue Screen Error&#58; ATTEMPTED_SWITCH_FROM_DPC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend has been having blue screen errors pop up sporadically, and most of them have the text ATTEMPTED_SWITCH_FROM_DPC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some searches on this and had him update all drivers, as well as the BIOS for his motherboard. I also had him run a full memtest, which found no errors. He was able to get me some crash dump files, which I debugged. I wasn't able to find anything
 that I've seen before in them, though, so I'm hoping someone here can take a look and point us in the direction of a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
