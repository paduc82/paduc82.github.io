<h2>            Bluetooth headset pairing, not detecting headset</h2>
                    <p>I just bought Nokia BH-111 (http://nokia.ly/ACiqj6) bluetooth stereo headset and I can't pair it with my Omnia 7. Works fine with Nokia 5230 phone, so it's not a problem with the headset. The phone does not even detect the headset, it keeps showing "searching"
 and nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is what is says about compatibility:</p>
<p>"All phones, music players and other devices that support Bluetooth v. 2.1 + EDR, Handsfree Profile 1.5 and Headset Profile 1.0"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This microsoft support article ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2449475 ) has this to say:</p>
<p>Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP 1.2)<br />
Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP 1.3)<br />
Hands Free Profile (HFP 1.5)<br />
Headset Profile (HSP 1.1)<br />
Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP 1.1)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So as you can see, WP support EVERY one of those profiles and standards. What's the problem there?</p>

            <p>So the problem is that when WIFI and bluetooth are on at the same time, problems start. Now when i turn WIFI off, I can pair and connect to the headset. But when i turn WIFI back on afterwards, bluetooth stops functioning.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems to be hardware related, I will try and push them for a replacement.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EDIT: failed to mention, even after pairing, the sound is inaudible, choppy, jerky.. It's not usable. wasted money on BH-111.</p>

Excel is not in the habit of unsorting worksheets on its own after being saved in the sorted state.</p>

    <title>Do I need to update from IE8 to IE9 before BEFORE installing IE 10 on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diversifiedwoman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I need to update from IE8 to IE9 before BEFORE installing IE 10 on a Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I never upgraded to IE9 from IE8 due to a compatibility issue with websites we had to use for my&nbsp;current employer. We were instructed at the time not to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So again presently I am only running IE 8 on a Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit computer. It is a DELL computer as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've now been given the go ahead&nbsp;to update to IE9 and even IE10 just as long as we run in&nbsp;compatibility mode&nbsp;IF upgrading to 10.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my computer is now only giving me the option to upgrade to IE&nbsp;10 will it mess things up in doing this because I never upgraded to IE9 BEFORE upgrading to IE10?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise would I be safer just to upgrade to&nbsp;from IE8 (which I have presently) to IE9 and then if all goes smoothly, update to&nbsp;to IE10?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where exactly would I just get the UPDATE link ONLY for IE9 for a Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit computer if I am currently using IE8, if I just decided to go that route?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will it just know to do the update ONLY (since I already have IE8) and not treat it like a brand new install on my computer?&nbsp;Or does one version automatically remove the other regardless. Just don't want to make a mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can skip IE9, but here's all the advice I can offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download IE10 to your Desktop. Do not use Windows or Microsoft Updates.</p>
<p><br />
Internet Explorer 10 download:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages</a></p>
<p><br />
Restart your computer. With no other programs running, disable your anti-virus program and any spyware or spam programs you may have. If you are running a third party firewall, disable it and enable the Windows firewall.</p>
<p><br />
Now install IE10 from the Desktop. When you're done, restart your computer twice and then make sure your disabled programs are running again.

            <p>Thanks so much for your helpful advice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you say don't install it from&nbsp;"Windows Updates" even though it listed there to do so, if I actually check the box? Just curious. My husband just&nbsp;used Windows Updates on his to do this since it presented it as an option but&nbsp;of course he was already
 running IE9. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently run ESET Smart Security as my anti-virus program. <br />
<br />
I see from there I have the&nbsp;option&nbsp;to do the following 3 things. </p>
<p>So should I disable ALL of the below prior to actually installing&nbsp;IE10&nbsp;saved to my Desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Do not filter network traffic (disable firewall)</p>
<p>*Disable real-time file system protection</p>
<p>*Disable anti-virus and anti-spyware protection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I also NOT enable the&nbsp;ALL of the above again until AFTER I have restarted my computer twice and know that&nbsp;IE10 is actually working?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also use Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 for my email client. Will IE10 affect this in any way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, some of the websites I use for work will need to run in&nbsp;compatibility mode in IE10. Is that something I need to select or will it&nbsp;automatically detect it&nbsp;on its own or can I just specify which websites need to run this&nbsp;way and if so how do I do
 this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also make much use of the&nbsp;FAVORITES BAR in IE8 that appears at the top of the browser so&nbsp;would like it to be there in IE10. Is this possible and how would I go about doing&nbsp;that and enabling&nbsp;certain bookmarked&nbsp;websites&nbsp;to appear in that FAVORITES BAR?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly I want to make sure I am doing the IE10 install&nbsp;in the right order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Download IE10 to my computer&nbsp;(but do NOT install it yet)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Then restart my computer</p>
<p>3. Then Disable&nbsp;my Anti-Virus program (let me know if I need to disable all 3 things)</p>
<p>4. Once disabled, proceed to install the IE10 program originally saved to my Desktop.</p>
<p>5. Restart computer. </p>
<p>6. Restart computer a second time.</p>
<p>7. Check to see every&nbsp;if IE10 has installed correctly at that point.</p>
<p>8. If it is working correctly&nbsp;RE-ENABLE&nbsp;my antivirus program, firewall, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not in the correct order can you let me know as well? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also like to&nbsp;if there is anything I should probably uncheck in the install process for IE10 which I may or may not want.&nbsp;Thanks again for your help.&nbsp;Much appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Employee&#39;s email display name appearing as a former employee name.</h2>
                    <p>Problem:<br />
When an employee leaves the company, we create an email alias for the person who will be receiving the former employee's email, and then backup the email and delete their Active Directory and Office 365 account.&nbsp; (The Office 365 account includes Enterprise
 Exchange Online email.)&nbsp; Some people monitor more than one email account, and so they have multiple aliases assigned to their email account.<br />
</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>

<p>
</p><p>In one recent case, the email recipient address to John User appeared as "TO: Joe Dirt &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;".&nbsp; Joe Dirt is a former employee, but is not aliased to John User.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes John User's name changes.&nbsp; Sometimes it will be Sydney Bristow (alias), or Jane Doe (alias), or even Joe Dirt (not alias).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very confusing scenario.&nbsp; Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi JR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know how it shows <strong>from recipient side</strong> (such as Jack Smith) when John User sends him an email with email address "john.user@mycompany.com", the display name and
<strong>From</strong> address in the reading pane is&nbsp;John User &lt;john.user@mycompany.com&gt; or Sydney Bristow &lt;john.user@mycompany.com&gt;? Then when the recipient click
<strong>Reply</strong> button, how it shows in <strong>To</strong> field? You can provide us a screenshot as following capture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d5888e4-dab6-4030-869d-41e5530fadf4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d5888e4-dab6-4030-869d-41e5530fadf4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Then in recipient's&nbsp;<strong>Sent Items</strong> folder, if the display name and email address in
<strong>To</strong> field is&nbsp;John User &lt;john.user@mycompany.com&gt;?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if the recipient add the former employee as a Outlook contact and set it as different display names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>I can't provide a screenshot due to security reasons.&nbsp; However, here is an edited sample directly from an email thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI:&nbsp; John is a long-time employee, and the person experiencing the multiple email issue.&nbsp; Jack is another employee.&nbsp; Sydney is an associate of John's from many years ago, but has never worked for our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll ask Jack to check his sent items folder for messages to John where the name change occurs, and I'll respond with more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this may be a problem in the Global Address book?</p>

<p>I asked Jack about messages he sends to John, and he said when he composes an email the TO line reads "John" as normal.&nbsp; He also couldn't find any messages to John in his Sent folder that said anything other than John - "They're all normal."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue may be happening after the message leaves the sender.&nbsp; Somewhere in the transport process (and we use Microsoft's Exchange Online 365 service) of sending and receiving, the username is changed.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            10532 Network access slows to a stop with only bursts of activity.</h2>
                    <p>10532 Network access slows to a stop with only bursts of activity.&nbsp; Apps and device drivers and other Windows Updates take forever to download and install, due to network slowing to a stop, even though adapter is enabled.&nbsp; Same symptoms with a clean install
 or Reset of 10532 in Hyper-V and on physical device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling and re-enabling network adapter does not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only slow data access happens with occasionally a burst of improved network bandwidth for a short while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 10240 on the same device works normally.</p>

            <p>I think it is a problem with this 10532&nbsp;Insider Preview Build only, which is why I reported it also via the Windows Feedback App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Build has the same symptom in Hyper-V or with a physical install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other Build since 9926 has worked on the same hardware and still works fine, using the same network adapter drivers.</p>

            <p>Based on a few other similar reports this may have to do with something common to Windows Update and Windows Store updates.&nbsp; Other internet browsing does not seem to be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a clean install there are now over 500MB of updates on a new 10532 build.&nbsp; That is when this issue can be noticed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Anything happened to the phone prior to this issue? For the meantime we would suggest performing a<a href="http://www.hardreset.info/devices/blu/blu-win-hd-lte/softreset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> soft reset</a>, in times phone apps doesn't function
 as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>
<p>

            <p>HI Ian!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was amongst the things I tried Ian, besides downgrading back to Windows 8.1 and then back to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The peculiar thing is that with the native camera app in Windows 8.1 ( as per the latest firmware update) this does not happen or if it does happen, happens so very rarely but with Windows 10 it keeps losing focus just about every four seconds or so. I've
 also ruled out dirty lens or other sensors being the cause, so it may be a driver issue with Windows 10, afaik.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reply to my question, did anything happen to the phone prior to the issue? Yes, the phone upgraded from Windows 8.1 Phone to Windows 10 Phone along with all the Windows Store app updates to the latest version.</p>
<p />

            Thanks Ian...In reply to your post requesting that I Install Lumia Camera app, I did a search for that in the Windows Store and Windows Store reports that this App is not compatible with my device. Strange though cause Blu has a higher specced camera than
 some Lumias out there ( 8MP vs. 5MP) and in the past with one of the older builds I remember the default camera app used to append "Pro" in the image shots..so truly strange.

<h2>            Lumia 950 drops cellular connection - reboot only solution</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950 that was purchased in November. &nbsp; Right now the OS build is 10.0.10586.71. &nbsp;The phone has started dropping my cellular connection occasionally - once during a phone call. &nbsp;It happens in the car, sitting still in my house, sitting still
 at work - doesn't seem to be a pattern. &nbsp;The only solution I've found is to reboot the phone. &nbsp;Is there something else I can do?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Wow, I just spent 30 minutes or so chatting with someone from Microsofts technical support about this. &nbsp;I purchased a Professional 360 license to test this for my company (I'm the CEO) before rolling it out to them. &nbsp;Anyway, with my document open - the words
 just disappear. &nbsp;It does this fairly regularly. &nbsp;If I change the zoom aspect (doesn't matter to what, I just have to change it) the words come back. Bottom line, I have found this latest version of Microsoft Office to be extremely buggy. Powerpoint unexpectedly
 crashes, this problem with Word, who knows what is next. &nbsp;Of course the Microsoft persons response was..... talk to your internal IT support. &nbsp;Unbelievable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a 20+ person company with folks distributed around the world. We don't have an internal IT support staff. Everything is cloud based, we use google docs, webex, infusion soft, you name it. &nbsp;Microsoft is about the only non-cloud based app we have left.
 &nbsp;So I tried this version of Office 365 Professional by buying a copy. &nbsp;What a disaster. It should be called Microsoft Solutions - it should be called Microsoft "I Cause Problems". &nbsp;I'm seriously considering dumping every microsoft product and moving to google
 docs or even apples office suite. &nbsp;We dumped windows based PC's about 5 years ago and bought apple products. &nbsp;Our support requirements dropped to almost 0 once we had apple platforms in place. &nbsp;No more wiping PC's once Windows got buggy after two or three
 years use. &nbsp;No more weird OS errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - get the message. &nbsp;You guys are out of step - your software really stinks. &nbsp;Sure, maybe (just maybe) it's okay if you are a major corporation -but I doubt that even that is true. &nbsp;That is why IBM is moving to Apple portables - less support. You
 guys seem to have lost touch with reality. &nbsp;It's about having software that works.. Not some big, IT support driven, monolithic piece of app software that takes a tech genius to install and keep operating. &nbsp;I guess Bill Gates is out of the picture now and
 really doesn't even care about what happens with his company. &nbsp;You guys are losing the battle (or have lost it) in small business. Your going to lose in corporate America based on what I'm seeing with our clients. &nbsp;Too bad. &nbsp;Microsoft used to be a great company.</p>

            <p>This is a user-to-user support forum, so it's unlikely that anyone at Microsoft will see your message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't assume that software is buggy because you experience an issue on one computer. I use Office 2011 on a daily basis with fewer issues than I experience in Office for Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, it sounds like you're experiencing display issues, since changing the zoom ratio makes the text reappear. Macs require periodic maintenance to keep them running well. Have you ever repaired the permissions? Verified your disk? The PowerPoint crash
 also suggests your system may need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're inclined to fix the problem rather than complain about it, here's a trouble-shooting page:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/892428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot Office for Mac</a>&nbsp;It refers to older versions of Office and OS X, but the steps are still valid today. One difference to note is that to open the Library folder in Mavericks
 or Yosemite, you now hold down the Alt key while clicking on Go&gt;Library.</p>

<p>Nokia Mobile Phones were bought by Microsoft and incorporated as ‘Microsoft Mobile’. Actually, it is a bit more complicated because Nokia was re-organized before that takeover. So, not everything of Nokia Mobile Phones went over to Microsoft, like Nokia
 gate5 aka HERE. But you get the picture. The last Smartphone with a Nokia logo was released in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?&amp;idPhone3=6877&amp;idPhone2=6638&amp;idPhone1=6639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">December 2014</a>. As of today, the last

December 2015</a>.</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />It may be that it has come out of sync and what you are seeing is the offline cache of your OneDrive folders.
<br />Have you tried simply opening the OneDrive app and seeing if it asks you to sign in?
<br />
<br />If not, you may want to consider uninstalling and reinstalling it on that device.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />Ryan

                    <p>I would like to merge a msn.com account with a outlook.com account. Is this possible? If not, how long do I have to wait before adding an alias to my outlook.com account for my msn.com email address if I delete my msn.com account or change the primary address
 to something else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We appreciate your time posting in Microsoft Community. We understand that you want
 to know if two accounts can be merged and how long you will wait before you can add the deleted MSN account as an alias to your Outlook.com.
</span><font color="#000000">Plea</font>se be informed we cannot merge old and brand new accounts. Once you delete you msn.com account, you need to wait for 365 days for it to be available and add as an alias&nbsp;to your Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Instead, you can Auto-forward your&nbsp;MSN account to your Outlook account. You’ll have all of your mail in one place, and can reply to it using your MSN account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To auto-forward your email:</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) <font><b>Sign in</b> to your Microsoft account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) <b>Click the cog or gear icon </b><span>then click<b> more mail settings</b></span></font></font></span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Click <b>Save.</b></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Note: Outlook.com account users need to log into the account they choose to auto-forward at least once every 365 days to avoid having the system remove the mailbox for inactivity.</span>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. Please forward this feedback unto the appropriate department for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you providing a solution for my request and it appears I have no choice based on outlook.com's current policies but to forward my mail from one account to another. Unfortunately I find it sad that outlook.com does not allow accounts to be merged
 or for accounts to be closed and then their address added to another account as an alias. Not only does this policy not serve outlook.com's customers in the best manner, it also leads to additional storage and resources that your system requires in order to
 store and route mail. It would seem prudent to me for outlook.com to change its policy regarding this matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I was locked out of my Hotmail account and had to set up another account. How do I merge the to accounts? I have lost all my contact info some very important emails. I would really like to be able to at least get my information changed to my new account.
 Thanks for your help! Vicky

<h2>            Windows Insider build 18885 doesn&#39;t recognize my keyboard and mouse.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm a Windows Insider for Fast Ring of windows updates. My issue seems to be after I do update to build 18885 or later, my keyboard and mouse no longer work at the login screen. The previous build seems to work fine. I don't think it's a
 hardware issue, seems to only have problems in Windows, so I suspect the OS isn't fully recognizing the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard and mouse work fine in the MSI motherboard BIOS, using F10 to get in. As soon as Windows begins to boot at the splash screen with the white spinning dots, the CAPS, SCROLL Lock, NUM lock lights on the keyboard go out, and the mouse lights
 also go out. If i unplug and replug them at any point after that, the lights will come on, but the PC still doesn't recognize them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not certain if I'm at build 18885 or a later build since i can't log in.</p>
<p>Plugging into another USB 2.0 or 3.0 port doesn't work.<br />
Plugging in rear or front USB ports doesn't work.</p>
<p>There is no touchscreen input because it's a desktop.</p>
<p>Rebooting doesn't help.</p>
<p>The keyboard and mouse were tested and work fine on my Microsoft Surface Pro 6.</p>
<p>No remote desktop software is currently installed for me to remote into it.</p>
<p>I have tried an older Microsoft brand ergonomic wireless keyboard and mouse that connected via PS/2 and USB 2.0 wireless transceiver dongle.</p>
<p>I also tried connecting an older Dell wired keyboard from a Optiplex 755 model PC. Also tried a Lenovo Laser USB wired mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Custom Mid tower PC specs:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home edition 64 Bit</p>
<p>MSI motherboard (will update model # when i get home)</p>
<p>Intel i7 processor</p>
<p>Rosewill Cherry MX USB wired mechanical keyboard (will update model # when i get home)</p>
<p>Thor USB wired gaming laser mouse (will update model # when i get home)</p>
<p>Samsung SSD boot drive Windows 10 is on, is less than one year old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a bootable USB recovery Win10 disk but was not able to get into Safe mode or any Advanced recovery options.&nbsp; It allowed me to get into the limited recovery and reset options. The keyboard and mouse DO work in this recovery setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In April when I updated, I was not able to perform a system restore to a previous time , it didn't give a specific reason that I can remember. It failed for the other system restore point that it found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an option to restore a saved Windows Image, but the one it found did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time, there wasn't much for Microsoft phone support to help with since they had no way of remoting into it and i had no way of interacting with it to navigate. They took note of the model # i provided and planned on forwarding it to the Win
 10 developers, but after a few weeks, i'm back to square one.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure what combination of things I tried to get it working, but after a random reboot one day, the keyboard and mouse worked again! Once I logged in, I promptly created a System restore point. I also selected to pause all windows updates
 as long as possible, until Win 10 began the latest build install after I shutdown my PC this week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next things I plan on trying:</p>
<p>load the boot up Windows recovery disk and see what options it gives me to restore to a previous date.</p>
<p>Once I get the MSI motherboard model #, I will post it here and try looking for any new firmware updates.</p>
<p>I'm curious if a modern Microsoft brand keyboard and mouse would work with the latest build.<br />

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not even sure where to start on this situation. You state the mouse and keyboard work on another device and also your bios. Have to agree with you it is not hardware related. To be quite honest, never seen this one before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we are not even sure what build you are on, my first inclination would be something has got corrupted within windows itself. You mention you have a bootable flash card of windows 10. Can you get into a Command Prompt with it. If so, I would try running
 these commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>cleanmgr /sageset &lt;-- select all items<br />
cleanmgr /sagerun &lt;-- this deletes all that was selected with /sageset above</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this cannot get you back on track, might just be time for a total clean custom install, deleting all partitions and let windows create new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention you are on Fast Ring, would suggest doing a search for UUP dump, and let it create an ISO for you which would be build 18895 as of today. You would have to make a bootable flash using a program such as Rufus with this ISO. Your other option would
 be using Media Creation tool to get the latest Release build as it can make a bootable flash for you if you don't already have this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if you would require this but this is a good guide for doing clean installs:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hopefully some other Insiders can come up with other options for you. Would be great if you had an image backup that you could resort to. Something to think about down the road. I use Acronis True Image but others have reported success using&nbsp;Macrium Reflect.</p>

</p><p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm not mistaken, selecting all items includes deletion of the Windows.old folder which would make it impossible to go back to the previous version. I wouldn't recommended..., just saying. Cheers!</p>

    <title>Messaging App Sync setting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Messaging App Sync setting</h2>
                    <p>If one has the sync setting turned on in the messaging app, does this act like a backup so one could reset phone and then messages would be restored via this app?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once you turned on the text message backup, it will automatically back up your SMS and MMS messages to the cloud. For more details, you may visit this link:

<p>Ahh, excellent :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that if I open the Messaging App on my Windows 10 PC ( v1607) the messages appear but the most recent is 20th January. On my Windows 10 tablet (v1607) the messages are more recent but still a few days behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is the sync controlled on the phone? Is there any way I can "force" it to sync? Or is it&nbsp;the app on the PC that's not sync'd yet? Can I force the app on the PC or tablet to sync?</p>

    <title>Storing a Excel shortcut on a OneNote 2016 page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storing a Excel shortcut on a OneNote 2016 page</h2>
                    <p>I was quite surprised when, in trying to be totally organized, I opened a new page to contain all of my notes for a 2018 budget file and on that page attached a shortcut pointing to onedrive where I had stored the Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, when clicking on the shortcut, OneNote opened Excel and then opened the file but renamed it from 2018 budget to 2018 budget1. After spending several minutes updating the file, I realized that it was not the original file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, within OneDrive I grabbed the URL link and inserted that in the OneNote page as a link. Again, I was quite surprised but somewhat dumbfounded, that when clicking on this link OneNote would open Excel online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why isn't there an ability for the user to define that with these links, OneNote should open the exact shortcut and not rename the file and if it is a shared URL, to open first the Excel application on the desktop before attempting to go to Excel online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The embedded logic of how OneNote handles a shortcut bewildering.</p>

            <p>Hi Klaus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot tell you with certainty whether&nbsp;your or your friends account is hacked. However, you may delete you friend as contact from
<a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com/</a> and then add him again with the correct email address.
</p>
<p>You may also take necessary steps if you suspect that your account has been hacked. Refer the article in the link below.</p>
<p><strong>My account has been hacked</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/hacked-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/hacked-account</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your account has been migrated to&nbsp;<strong>Outlook Mail </strong>(new interface), then&nbsp;the steps mentioned might vary in the section:
<strong>Reset your account settings</strong>. Therefore, I would recommend you to&nbsp;login to
<a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com/</a> through the web browser. click on the
<strong>Gear </strong>icon and then select&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>. Expand <strong>
Mail</strong> and check for all the sections&nbsp;under Mail. If you find anything suspicious, kindly remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have reset&nbsp;the account and added&nbsp;the contact again. Try sending the email&nbsp;again and check if you still face the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            <p>Dear Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to reply, but it unfortunately didn't answer my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In described above I wrote from a Hotmail/Outlook.com account <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
AND</span> a Yahoo account <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AND</span> an account via own one.com domain; all via their respective web interfaces, all with same auto-reply, so I don't expect my account(s) to be hacked. That would not be logical.</p>
<p>Receiving email address did receive the emails so address used is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit more information on the situation, source of email returned below (the real sender and receiver addresses are removed). Please bear with me this is from my one.com domain since that was the only place I could get access to source of email, but as stated
 same occurred when sending from my hotmail/outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Klaus</p>

<p>Hi Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to "Could you try using a different computer and check if you still&nbsp;face the same issue?" that would not show or prove anything. It could have been a random time-bound occurrence. Bet next counter question would be "Have you tried to restart the
 computer" ;-D</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very kind of you to try to help, but your first answer and now your counter questions are off the board. I am looking for an likely answer that will be based on the description above, so maybe just let the question hang until somebody that might have
 an idea answers it. Thank a lot.</p>
<p>

<h3> damars  say:</h3>
<h2>            BORDER FOR ADJACENT CELLS  WILL NOT MOVE WHEN DRAGGING  </h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to adjust a cell height in a table in Word 2007, and I cannot do so either by mousing over the line, clicking and dragging it up, or by grabbing the handle in the left margin to do so. The line will move up as I drag it, but then will not drop
 where I want it to. <br />
<br />
When mousing over the handle, it indicates that its function is to 'Adjust Row Height'....not cell height.</p>

<p>Hi Rawson Constantia (Pty) Ltd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common causes of OSPPREARM.EXE problems are corrupt or missing files, and virus or malware infection. We may need to do further investigation to identify the cause of the issue and to provide the appropriate resolution. Please provide the following info:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Were there changes made on the PC prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Open an Office Application such as word, click file &gt; Account, capture a screenshot about The Product Information and share with us.</p>
<p>3. Capture a screenshot when the error message appears again, and share with us.</p>
<p>4. Are you running a third party antivirus software? Close the third party antivirus and try again, check if the error message appears again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you can go to this thread to get some suggestion:</p>

                    <p>Using Outlook 2016 64-bit Windows computer program, I have the ‘Junk E-mail Options’ settings at: Safe Lists Only This is the most restrictive option. Any message that isn't from someone on your Safe Senders List or isn't to a mailing list on your Safe Recipients
 List, is classified as junk. Junk mail that I've already blocked still ends up in my 'Inbox'. International Blocked Top-Level Domain List items like .nl or .jp for example, still show in my 'Inbox'. My settings are as tight as they can be, but the junk mail
 filter only works about 10% of the time. Please read my concerns and answer them with specifics so my issues can be solved. Please don't hand me canned responses. I need true assistance by someone with experience. I have ALL the latest Office &amp; Windows updates
 installed. I've even reinstalled Office.<span>&nbsp; </span>You take my subscription money for the privilege of using the program.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In return, I expect a fully functional platform.<span>&nbsp; </span>Remember, the Junk E-mail filter *only* works 10% of the time.</p>
