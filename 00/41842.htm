                    <p>We had an outage problem in our area and everything was cut off.&nbsp; When it came back on my desktop icons were gone .&nbsp; There are&nbsp; some&nbsp; things&nbsp; that are on right side where icons use to be.&nbsp; But not in same order and some are gone also. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get them back in their original setting.&nbsp; I appreciate any help from anyone.</p>

            Hi Terri.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is it possible it started into a Temporary account because yours was corrupted by the outage?  We see this a lot here and it explains why your icons were missing.  Do you recognize anything else from your account there?  
<br />
<br />If not check at C:\Users for your old account to immediately back up your files from there if needed.  
<br />
<br />Then follow these steps to try to recover the account:  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it will start into your account.  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and Sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>.  
<br />To do this you may need to access the Command Prompt from Repair Mode or the booted media:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />From the Built-in Admin account you can try to repair the old account using one of these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-y...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-w...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can try to create a new Local Admininstrator Account to see how it works:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-local-account-in-windows-10/95097c32-40c4-48c0-8f3b-3bcb67afaf7c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>.   
<br />
<br />Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run.  If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old account when ready. in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other Users.  Hide the Built-in Admin account per tutorial.  
<br />
<br />If all else fails then you can try a Reset from the Repair Mode:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            HI, garden54
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running.
<br />1.	Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC.
<br />2.	In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />1.	Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages:
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details.
<br />o	Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually.
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems.
<br />
<br />Please see this great 3rd party link for a complete step-by-step guide

<h3> burn0050  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; App install, permissions issues after linking to Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 Pro, and everything seemed great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, Windows 10 suggested I link my computer to my Microsoft account, and I continue to have problems, even after switching back to a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started with permission denied issues. I couldn't access my documents, and applications refused to run. I had to go in and try blanket permission changes to the users and program files folders. That at least got me back to a usable state and I could see
 my files. But many of the apps I already had installed, such as iTunes and other Apple software cannot upgrade. I get generic permission errors that are of no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to upgrade Quicken (which has its own terrible issues that have nothing to do with Microsoft), it wouldn't let me; once again a permission denied error. I had to uninstall it. Once I installed the new version, it had problems, so I decided to
 revert back. Well, when I tried to uninstall it, the uninstaller crashes with no error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This upgrade has been a disaster for me. I am a computer programmer, have been a network administrator, got my first PC in 1982, and I'm the person people ask for computer help. I can't fix these issues and it's extremely frustrating. I have Googled and
 tried every suggestion to no avail. I'm thinking of wiping my computer and installing Windows 7 again (which makes me shudder at the thought of reinstalling EVERYTHING and spending weeks getting everything back the way I like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the only one that has had these issues (based on the volume of Google results).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this is happening, and how to fix it? I thought if I just updated permissions on all the folders, the problems would go away, but that's not the case.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 and AOL.__</h2>
                    I have been using AOL for some years. I installed Windows 7 professional 10 days ago and have been unable to access AOL through the Desktop icon. AOL gets stuck when looking for my password. I can access AOL through I<em>nterent Explorer - using the same
 username and password - but it is not the same and have lost all my Favourites. I have tried AOL 9.0 VR and AOL 9.5 and have tried them both with Windows XP compatability.<br />
I have spoken at length to both the AOL and Windows experts - and they blame each other.<br />
I am now stuck and do not know what action to take next.<br />

<p>Hi askedd,</p>
<p>As AOL 9.5 is compatible with Windows 7, I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall AOL 9.5 from the link mentioned below and check if you come across the same problem.<br />
<a href="http://daol.aol.com/software/95/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://daol.aol.com/software/95/</a></p>
<p>AOL 9.0 VR is for the older versions of operating system like Windows XP</p>
<p>For more information, you may visit the link mentioned below.<br />
<a href="http://daol.aol.com/software/90vr/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://daol.aol.com/software/90vr/faq</a></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to get in touch with the link mentioned below for the best support.<br />

<p>Hi there! It looks like you are trying to share the game. Based on the error "The person who bought this needs to sign in", that means that the person trying to launch the game doesn't have the license. To share the license, please make sure that the profile
 that purchased the game is set to home xbox to the console where you want to share. For example, you purchase the game on Account A and console A. Account B wants to play the game on console B. Account A should be set as home xbox on console B. I hope this
 make sense.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 creator&#39;s update has bricked my Toshiba laptop</h2>
                    Installed creator's update on my Toshiba portege R935 that has been running Win 10 for the last two years without any problems. When I did the final reboot the computer would not start and gave a "missing boot configuration file" error message. After trying
 many different solutions both from MS and others I finally gave up and decided to do a clean install. I downloaded the media creation tool and put the media on a clean USB drive. I have tried installing numerous times with two different hard drives and the
 same thing happens each time. The installation process gets to the "Finishing Up" stage and then I get a message that the boot record cannot be updated and the installation fails. I have cleaned both hard drives with diskpart and followed the instructions
 for partitioning for a clean boot to the letter. My laptop has been rendered useless as a result of this update. This is a total disaster. If anyone has a solution I'd like to hear it.

<p>I reply to myself</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this in Toshiba forum&nbsp;https://forum.toshiba.eu/showthread.php?96911-Portege-Z10T-A-blue-screen-with-BCD-info-after-Win10-Updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>and I remember that i had this problem at the beginning, so I just went to the bios setup I loaded the default configuration and fix the bcd with the command&nbsp;<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>and voila! the windows started from my previous attempts of &nbsp;installation of W10!</p>
<p>Hope and don't have to repeat this in every update...</p>

    <title>key stroke question - typing too fast - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peaceoutpookie  say:</h3>
<h2>            key stroke question - typing too fast</h2>
                    when I type too fast, or certain keystrokes in sequence, my cursor flips back to the middle of the previous text, or high lights all my text, or flips up to the "address line" in internet explorer. What can I do to fix this?

<p><span><span>Hi PeaceOutPokie,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Quick question, would you happen to have a laptop with a touchpad? This usually happens when you have a touchpad and your hand brushes up the
 touchpad when you’re typing. Happens to me all the time. What I do (personally), is I would lower the sensitivity of my touchpad or I would just completely disable it and use a wireless mouse.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that’s the case with you, if not please post back and let us know.
</span></span></p>

            Hello PeaceOutPookie,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your reply back!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry you are still having an issue with this.&nbsp; I would suggest to perform a System Restore to a point in time when this wasn't an issue.&nbsp; Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore
 points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs
 and updates that you installed are removed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<p><strong><span>Important Notice</span></strong><strong><span>:
</span></strong><em><span>That System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files
 on your computer. Thus, any recently installed programs, updates, or changes to configuration will be lost if you use System Restore. However, make note that System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot
 help you restore a deleted file.</span></em></p>

<h2>            Skype For Business - Can&#39;t connect to exchange, please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>On both my IOS devices (iPad Air and iPhone 6), I'm having trouble connecting to the Exchange server when I try to browse my meetings. I can't see ANY meetings at all and when it tries to refresh and furnish the Skype calendar, it brings up the below error
 'We can't connect to Exchange. Please try again later'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the S4B meetings in my laptop calendar and the IOS calendar..just not within S4B calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use our company login credentials but...it just won't bring up the calendar. Seems to be once it went from Lynn to S4B?? &nbsp;I'm shown as available/online and can even send messsages but...no calendar!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT have said to leave the HTTP proxy blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, the SIP address and UPN may not match. Please check with your admin which is the SIP address and which is UPN. Then, please log out from Skype for Business and sign in again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you sign in Skype for Business, fill in SIP address (it should be
a*e@n*p.com.au) in the sign in address. Then click Advanced options, fill UPN (it should be
a*e@n*z.com) in the User Name.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does your organization have any on-premises server deployed, like on-premises Exchange server or Lync server? If yes, please provide the detailed information about the on-premises servers.</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur to any other users in your organization?</span></li></ol>

<p>Tips for trying again:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If the error code begins with the letter “E,” try searching on the first part of the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Example For “E305 00000000 80000001,” search for “E305.”</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If the error code is 24 digits long, try searching on the last 8 digits.</p>

<div>Remove all the external devices and then check if it helps.</div>

<h2>            &#34;Add a device&#34; does not list my Xbox 360</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to connect my Windows 8 PC to my new Xbox 360. The problem is that when I click "Add a device" in my PC settings to connect my Xbox, it never shows up.</p>
<p>I did turn on sharing in my network right clicking on my network &gt; Turn sharing on or off &gt; "Yes, turn on sharing and connect to devices", but I still can't find my Xbox in my devices when I search for it. Any suggestion?</p>

            Hi Osama EnNasr,
<div><br />
It looks like you have problems in connecting your Xbox 360 to your computer and we will be glad to assist you with this.
<div>However I would like you to answer&nbsp;a question before that.<br />
1. Do you have any anti virus installed on your system?.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here I would suggest you to turn off your Windows firewall and try connecting it to your computer.<br />
a. Go to start screen and type firewall.<br />
b. On the right hand side of the screen select Settings option.<br />
c. Select windows firewall<br />
d. Select turn on or off windows firewall and then turn it off.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also go through the below mentioned steps and check if it works.<br />
• If you are using a wired connection, make sure that the Ethernet cable is plugged into the Ethernet port on the Extender, and then verify that the Ethernet connector on the other end is plugged into the Ethernet port on your router, hub, or switch.<br />
• Verify that the Media Center Extender is plugged in and turned on.<br />
• If the Media Center Extender is connected to the network using a wireless connection, make sure the Media Center Extender is within range of the wireless access point or router with as few obstructions as possible between the Media Center Extender and the
 access point..<br />
• If the Media Center Extender is connected to the network using a wireless connection and your wireless network uses a security key, verify that you have the correct network security key for the type of wireless network security method that your network uses.
<div>Hope it helps. For further queries you are always welcome.</div>

            <p>Mishra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the steps above and I still was not able to detect my Xbox 360. To clarify, I do have an anti virus system (Avast!). I attempted turning it off, and turning the windows firewall off, but I still was no able to detect my Xbox 360. I installed Windows
 Media Center, hoping I can "add an extender", but I was unable to do that either (I followed the steps on my Xbox when I go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Computers&gt;Windows Media Center&gt;Setup).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Xbox and my computer are both connected to my wireless network, and I am sure they both are able to access the information on it (since they both can connect to the internet through it). Any other ideas?</p>

<p>I would like you to uninstall avast and then reboot the computer and then re do it.</p>
<p>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Telling MS customers to turn off the Windows Firewall is a really bad idea. At very least, this should have included a warning about the dangers of doing this, or stating that this is only a temporary measure and that you should turn the firewall back on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are doing a disservice to MS customers by putting their systems at risk like this.

    <title>SteamCMD not fully downloading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darlinbre  say:</h3>
<h2>            SteamCMD not fully downloading</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to download SteamCMD and it won't fully download. I had downloaded it before and it worked, but now everytime I try, it takes me straight to Windows Explorer and where it was prior but I don't get all of the files in it. I have deleted
 it, cleaned caches etc. I put in a ticked at Steam and they replied, said they don't offer support, to come here to Microsoft- so here I am!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to get a clean, full version of SteamCMD? Thank you for any help!</p>

</p><p>* No, I have not.</p>
<p>* I have deleted all prior attempts at creating a Conan Server- removed all SteamCMD's I have tried, deleted everything from recycle bin and files, except from the server which I have running from another game that does work.</p>
<p>* Win10 ver.1803 OSBuild 17134.112</p>
<p>* PCMatic (I have checked inside this to see if something is blocked, it isn't.)</p>
<p>*Windows Chrome</p>
<p>* I don't use any other browsers, so no I have not. I can try using the installed one that came with Win10 and see.</p>
<p>* Yes, I download other things and they all work fine. It is just SteamCMD that doesn't work. It worked fine when I made a server for ARK, for some reason, it just doesn't want to download all information when I try to download it for Conan now. It just
 immediately opens up windows explorer to my downloads folder and shows it at 55%. When I try to utilize it for the server, all the files I need aren't there.</p>

            Also- my Ark server is still working, still updates and when I first downloaded SteamCMD for that, I directed PCMatic to allow that through- we still get on that server without issue or problems.

<p>Hi, RamezNawaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To acquire a Vista CD, go to the computer manufacturer's website. Check you computer downloads for Software. If it is still available you can order a CD. If you do not see it listed, contact Sony by phone and request a CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>1.If you go to Start &gt; Type Recovery do you see an option to Recover to Factory Defaults?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried rebooting the computer &gt; Press/Hold F11 or F12 key as soon as you see the manufacturer's logo screen? This may boot you into the Recovery environment if there is one on the system.</p>

<p>1. Vista came on a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I know of no Computer Manufacturer that still sells Vista Recovery media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your&nbsp;Sony Vaio&nbsp;there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your devicer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00070113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00070113</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This article enables you to restore the system partition of a VAIO to&nbsp;factory state.
<strong>It is applicable to VAIO computers preinstalled with Windows Vista</strong>, unless the&nbsp;recovery partition has been removed.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access VAIO Recovery Center in two ways: </p>
<ol>
<li>Within Windows:
<ol>
<li>Close all open programs.&nbsp;</li><li>Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span> button and then click <span style="font-weight: bold">
All Programs</span>.&nbsp;</li><li>In the All Programs menu, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">VAIO Recovery Center</span>.</li></ol>
</li><li>If Windows does not start:
<ol>
<li>Start or Restart your VAIO.</li><li>Press the <strong>F10</strong> key several times while the VAIO logo is displayed</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>___________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System.</p>
<p>___________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also&nbsp;borrow and use a&nbsp;Microsoft Vista DVD (Retail or OEM System Builders License)&nbsp;, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer /
 Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is installed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker, which has the Product Key on it,&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To access Boot Menu:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you use Phone&nbsp;Activation&nbsp;don't follow the <em>Auto Prompts</em> but instead hold on for a real person to assist you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You have to go through them, but lately a lot of posters have been referred back to here by them when using phone activation.</p>

Thanks for responding, but that only sets up the recurrence frequency. It does not flag the event as a birthday. So, it does not display using the color selection for Birthdays in the options.

            <p>The birthday calendar is read-only on your phone. To enter data into the birthday calendar, your have to do it from your online Outlook calendar. Go to "live.com" and enter your Microsoft ID and password. Click on "Outlook" and select "Calendar". On top
 of the Calendar window, click on the small down-arrow next to the word "New". On the drop-down menu select "Birthday" and you can enter data into Birthday calendar which will appear on your phone.</p>
<p>You can also create other types of sub-calendars if you desire. Of note, there many other set-up options for Outlook on the Phone that you can only access online at live.com.</p>

            Thanks for the info. However, I am using Windows 8 on my laptop. Does this answer apply to that app, as well? All the videos show an option to tag an event as a birthday from the calendar app that does not show up when I enter an appointment.

<p><br />
Yes it applies to Win 8 laptop.&nbsp; I believe that the Birthday calendar&nbsp;is read-only on the Windows 8 laptop.&nbsp; From your laptop, you cannot add to Birthday calendar.&nbsp; You can create an annually recurring appointment as a birthdate but it doesn't appear in Birthday
 calendar.&nbsp; Also, when adding a contact to people list from laptop&nbsp;there is no option to enter birthdate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go to the online Outlook calendar, as mentioned before, you can enter&nbsp;birthdate data into Birthday Calendar and it will appear on both online and laptop versions as a Birthday calendar entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the online contact list ONLY, you can enter a birthdate.&nbsp; I thought that this would then appear on the Birthday Calendar, but the birthdate doesn't appear in the online calendar, laptop calendar, or laptop contact (People list).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the only way&nbsp;I've found to access/add to&nbsp;the Birthday calendar is from the online calendar at live.com.</p>

<h2>            Sharing specific folders&#47;files, with specific WiFi devices &#40;android phone, Kindle Fire&#41;, and specific permissions over home WiFi network, without third party software&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 on my home PC.&nbsp; I have a Netgear Ethernet/WiFi router, a Kindle Fire 7 HDX, a Samsung Galaxy S4, and various console gaming systems including XBOX ONE.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I (relatively) securely share specific folders to specific devices over my home WiFi network?&nbsp; I want guests to be able to use my Internet connection with a guest password and maybe "read" specific folders, but not all shared folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be willing to use the Netgear Genie App software as a third-party sharing software, but it doesn't seem to control the&nbsp;visibility of&nbsp;specific&nbsp;folders to which devices.</p>

            <p>A .jpg and .jpeg are the same file format.&nbsp; The only reason there are two different suffixes is because when they first came out some programs producing these files used the .jpg and others used .jpeg.</p>
<p>Paint uses the .jpg when it saves a JPEG file.</p>

            That is a very weird error code.

<p>What did you upgrade from originally, was it Widows 7 or Windows 8. If it was Windows 8 (pre-installed by the manufacturer) then the key will be in the bios.</p>
<p>Open a PowerShell (Admin) and enter or copy/paste&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Modern Japanese Games Suck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supersnausages  say:</h3>
<h2>            Modern Japanese Games Suck</h2>
                    
<p>So says the developer of <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/40061/GDC-Japanese-dev-mocked-your-games-suck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fez</a>, Phil Fish.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>What do you guys think? On the one hand, there's Final Fantasy which has more or less degenerated into a ton of insipid spin-offs and fighting games. The last truly daring FF release was FFXII in 2006. The JRPG genre in general seems to have just come to
 a standstill. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNauq6_9iP0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">And then you have crap like this</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/kNauq6_9iP0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/kNauq6_9iP0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>. Capcom's RE series is stuck in a never-ending loop of latching onto popular Western game conventions several years too late. Just look at the new Racoon
 City game, or even RE6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can't talk about modern games without acknowledging the huge debt they owe to Japanese game development. Where would the third person shooter be without RE4? More recently, there's been amazing titles like Bayonetta, Dark Souls and
 the newly revitalised Street Fighter series. Child of Eden is incredible as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2 greatest games on the 360, "Oblivion" and "Bayonetta" are products of West and East respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you've got the 2 greediest publishers, EA and Capcom are products of West and East respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'd have to say it's 2 a piece.</p>

<p>My point was that RE6 is continuing down the road set by RE4 and 5. Whereas 4 ended up being an incredibly influential game, 5 was extremely derivative (but great fun online). 6 looks like its putting an even bigger emphasis on action. It's become more and
 more like a western title. It's symptomatic of a general trend across a lot of Capcom titles. Raooon City, DR2 and DmC are all titles that have been/are outsourced to western developers.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Conversely, a game like Demons Souls or Dark Souls is a game like no other. Same with Child of Eden. Both extremely innovative japanese titles. So there's evidence to suggest that creativity hasn't totally left japanese game development.</p>

<p>[QUOTE]</p>
<p>"Back in the day Japanese games were used to winning and were used to success. We celebrated all sorts of victories. However at some point these winners became losers. Not accepting that fact has led to the tragic state of Japanese games today."</p>
<p>Inafune suggested that the Japanese games industry's early run of success went to its head and resulted in a toxic epidemic of complacency and creative bankruptcy.</p>
<p>"It's almost as if we're living in the Edo period dressed in kimonos with hair up in top nuts. But nobody around us in Japan seems to think it's strange or weird.</p>
<p>"When I look at Japan from the outside I feel we're behind the times. There's a limit to how much business you can generate with just those memories.</p>
<p>"I feel like we rarely see new creations from Japan. We stick to our memories and up-res a game or ship out an HD version. I feel like that's the upper limit that we're showing to our users today and that's not what they want."</p>
<p>The solution? Inafune called on his countrymen to knuckle down, get their hands dirty and breathe new life into rusty old brands.</p>
<p>"Japanese leaders today must think about rebuilding the brands rather than just sustaining them," he said.</p>
<p>"They need to do so now. It will be too late when our brands hold no equity and no power. Time is running out and we should have realised this when I made that bold statement a few years ago."</p>
<p>He insisted he was doing his bit with new start-up Comcept, which is currently developing 3DS RPG&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-10-05-mega-man-creator-announces-3ds-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">King of Pirates</a>&nbsp;alongside some social titles. He also hinted
 that the studio is working on a Vita game.</p>
<p>"A year ago I chose the hard route. I could have stayed at Capcom and taken the easy route and I'm sure it would have been fairly easy, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>"But I realised that's not what I wanted. I said goodbye to 900 staff, left the building and formed a new company with a very small group of people - just 20. I know it was the right thing to do. I'm confident. I'm working freely and enjoying doing what
 I do."</p>
<p>He concluded his talk with a promise to "introduce a new hero from Japan".</p>
<p>"And when I do we will do battle again."</p>
<p>The Japanese industry has had a rough ride at this year's GDC, with Fez developer Phil Fish blurting out that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-03-07-fez-creator-phil-fish-declares-modern-japanese-games-just-suck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">all of its recent efforts
