    <title>Windows 10 Home edition windows update nightmare, what to do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home edition windows update nightmare, what to do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't mind automatic updates of Windows 10, and would prefer it. But this has been a real annoyance ever since I upgraded to Windows 10. The main problem is that the update fails each and every time. So, after shutting down my PC, sometimes right in my
 face while I am working, and taking over a half hour to attempt to do the update, it always comes back with a message that the update failed and I should try again. The reason given is that some component is incompatible. But there is no information, and apparently
 no way, to find out which component is responsible for the failure. I then need to reboot and Windows (thankfully) restores itself to the previous version and I can continue using my PC until the next time Windows Update decides to force-try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many things. I have attempted to update the machine using advice from the internet, and after a lot of work, this succeeded in updating to the last (17XX) version. This took a lot of effort, performing a "clean boot" by shutting down everything
 except for Windows services, and restarting them afterwards. But I don't want to do this all the time. I have tried setting my network to metered, I have made a command file that should stop and disable the Windows Update service (so I can work in peace) but
 I notice now, that this is no longer possible for me to do (all fields in Services for Windows Update are disabled for me, even as Administrator). I no longer have the possibility to just put my PC in sleep mode overnight, because Windows Update will wake
 it up to upgrade, which will fail, and then my PC is active and on all night using electricity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So some questions, perhaps someone has some advice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If anyone from Microsoft happens to read this: please please please fix this. I don't ask for making the updates optional, but I do expect that, upon failure, the update software presents me with a report or log to explain which component is blocking
 the update, so that I can fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Does anyone have a solution to this misery? Any way to figure out what component is failing in the update each time? Any way to get Windows Update in the Home&nbsp; version to let me absolutely decide when an update should be attempted (in view of perhaps
 recent changes that seem to disallowing me to stop the Windows Update service).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            Hi,<br />I may have a solution for you. This happened to me aroidn the release of the original creators update. When Windows 10 performs and update it seems to use files from the stored disk image rather than the "live" files. I suppose it's likely because they could be modified during the installation and break something. So my Windows 10 was fine but there's was an issue with the image. <br /><br />If you go to the site for downloading the media creation tool, there is an option for "Update Now". This download sthe update assistant and a fresh set of files to update. Instead of reusing anything like Windows Update would. After that mine updated successfully. And has done ever since.<br /><br />This is from my own experience and is an edge case but your issue sounds similar enough that I would recommend trying it.<br />I hope that helps.

<p>A good idea but it did not work. Instead of it taking only about 40 minutes to fail, it took well over 1½ hours, but the result and the error message was the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should fix this, they should not be allowed to force updates on us if they cannot produce an error or failure message that is detailed enough to allow us to fix whatever is causing the update to fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So back to my original request, who can tell me how to stop the updates from happening? I am tired of having my PC restart or want to restart while I am in the middle of something. And it is a waste of time anyway, because the update will fail anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I just ran the Troubleshooter for Windows Update, and am amazed that one of the found problems that needs solving is that there are pending updates that need to be installed. Doh! But anyway, skipping that and continuing, it reports, as always, that there
 is a "Potential Update Windows Database Error" detected. I get this all the time. And I have followed instructions to sort this out in a command window, but that has never helped either.

<p>I just tried the clean boot option and it failed as well. I followed the instructions for a clean boot, disabling all non-windows startup programs, and I again tried to update from the online update as before. Again it failed, same message.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something strange has started happening today... I'm still getting Notification toasts pop-up, but once the toast has gone the notification disappears from the Action Center. So if you miss the pop-up you won't know that there's been any events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you manage to open the Action Center while the toast is visible you can see the message in the Action Center, but as soon as you close it the notification is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, is it only me?</p>

I've just found a workaround for this found here: http://superuser.com/questions/960117/add-outlook-2013-mail-to-windows-10-action-center-and-lock-screen. Turning off banners the alerts now stay in the Action Center, however I no longer get toasts.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'm guessing this is a bug, although it's only started recently so maybe an Office update.</p>

            Kiran, can you estimate how long each step might take? I started running this and after about an hour the first step was still on a counter that said it was at 20% and doesn't appear to have moved). If it will take a few hours to run that's fine, I just
 want to make sure it's actually doing something.

            I have had issues with the <strong>Action Center </strong>not working all that happen&nbsp;was it went out of tablet mode &nbsp;and did try some of the fixes suggested in this forum with no success yesterday I was experiencing problems with the computer's performance
 I suspected a virus and ran a scan nothing came back . I went into the <strong>Task Manager
</strong>and disabled the startup programs the were listed as <strong>HIGH</strong> impact and the
<strong>Action Center </strong>started working again might work for others with the issue

<h2>            an internal system error occurred dxerror.log and directx.log</h2>
                    <p>So i've got a new PC and started downloading games that i've had on my old rig 1 by 1. I have both Civilization 5 and 6.<br />
Civilization 6 works fine and uses DirectX12, Civilization 5 doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I have pretty much tried every single solution that I could find online, trying to install DirectX simply prompts the above error message. I've reinstalled my graphics driver, tried installing DirectX after uninstalling my antivirus. I edited the version in
 the registry. I've scanned my system for corrupt files. Nothing seems to work.</p>

<h2>            Realtek RTL8168&#47;8111 Family PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet NIC &#40;NDIS 6.20&#41; Code 1</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
I have windows 7 32 bit, and i was having minor problems with my network adapter, but it still worked until I tried to update the drivers, now, neither of my on board network ports will work.I downloaded the drivers from Gigabyte and they will not install correctly.
 The network ports are Realtek. I went to realtek's site and downloaded their drivers and they still won't work. I have uninstalled/reinstalled/restarted a bunch of times. In device manager, it says "This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1). The parameter
 is incorrect." The other message I get from device manager on the other network port is "This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)" I have searched for Code 31 for a while and can't find
 anything specific to my problem.</p>
<p>I've downloaded every driver I can. I don't think it's a hardware problem because it worked fine until I tried updating my drivers because I was having a different problem</p>
<p>My other problem was that I was connected to the internet and network fine, but the notification on the bottom right showed the No Connection icon. but when I hovered over the icon it said I had access to the network and internet. I've tried everything I
 can to fix this problem short of re-installing windows 7 and I can't because my disk is scratched up</p>
<p>I have read a lot of places that the drivers that you get from windows update can mess up the adapter, but I don't have that installed.</p>

            Also, can you check that the following registry key exists:<br />
<br />
<em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce </em><br />
<br />
If the above registry key does not exist create it.<br />
<br />
This key, which should exist by default, may have been deleted by a user or program and is necessary for the proper detection of hardware using an .inf file.

            I just unpaird my mouse to see the exact steps to repair it.  
<br />
<br />First turn off your mouse.
<br />
<br />Then select the Start button, then select Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices. 
<br />
<br />Make sure Bluetooth is turned on, then select Add Bluetooth or other device &gt; Bluetooth.  
<br />
<br />When it is searching for the mouse, press and hold the power button on the mouse, until a green light flashes on the part of the mouse closest to your wrist, basically the area where the top of the mouse meets the bottom.  The mouse should then show up in the list of devices to choose to pair on your screen.  Select it and complete the on-screen process.

    <title>Installing NVIDIA Drivers hangs on Black Screen after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emileighclifford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing NVIDIA Drivers hangs on Black Screen after Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation of Windows version 1709 has removed the NVIDIA Graphics Card Driver version 377.48 from my PCs. When I try to reinstall the driver, it hangs on a black screen and requires a hard reboot. Once I have performed the hard reboot, I am then able
 to successfully install the same NVIDIA Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way of installing the driver without requiring the hard reboot? I have tried restarting the PC before installation, and running a clean installation but to no avail. These PCs are also remote to my location, so a hard reboot is not always possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Emileigh.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can install drivers like that easier  in Safe Mode, where you can also usually troubleshoot it easier:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />You can roll back Fall Creators Update Version 1709 to the older version until it matures:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />
<br />Then hide the Update using the Hide Update Tool so it doesn't try to force itself:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to try to reform it first go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.   You said you tried a Clean Install but was it as complete as the one in this link, and if it failed did you correctly boot the media as illustrated in the steps above?
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks Greg!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have full functionality after rolling back to a previous version of Windows, but the option isn't available on all of our PCs (we are seeing this issue on around 30 remote servers). Could you please advise if there is another way of doing this?</p>

            Hi again Emileigh -
<br />
<br />This is where having a System Image backup comes in because you can apply it in 20 minutes to go back to the last best working configuration.  I recommend using free Macrium which is automated and the choice of experts:  <a href="https://reflect.macrium.com/webtutorial/How_to_create_a_disk_image.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://reflect.macrium.com/webtutorial/How_to_...</a>
<br />
<br />Windows imaging is being phased out and inflexible as it requires restoring to the exact same offset and fusses with new hard drives.
<br />
<br />Otherwise you'll need to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />If you need older version media it is available here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />You might try one Clean install with the new media as it is what worked for me after the Upgrade fritzed my clean installed PC.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            how to roll back a driver update in windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Today MS released an update for windows 10 (aug 5-6).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That update has messed up my touch interface,&nbsp; so that my touch screen is now more of a liability than an asset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question is how does one remove the updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already "uninstalled" the udate but it has left the new drivers intact , before giving up on windows 10 and going back to windows 8.1,&nbsp; I want to try to fix the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so how can I roll back my machine a couple of days.... if that is even possible in win10&nbsp; I believe it may be the display driver that is causing the issue.</p>

            <p>What if the driver doesn't stay rolled back? Every few days, I have the rolled back driver for my Bluetooth adapter rolled forward by Windows Update. This is only since updating from 10240 (RTM) to build 10586. Any way to block this driver from being added
 by WU? See attached screen capture of the driver below. Curious to me that the BTHUSB.SYS file, which is stamped 10.0.10586 remains on the system after rollback. Guessing there may be security issues involved?</p>

            <p>I ran into this issue with the latest updates; my system froze 3 times in about 2 hours.&nbsp; The 1 Aug NVIDIA drivers were to blame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where there is no "roll back" - I clicked "uninstall" and then waited for the magic to happen; when finished; I let windows search for compatible drivers (tapped F5), and it replaced the absent driver with the old driver; job almost done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent Microsoft from screwing up my machine again, I downloaded &amp; installed the latest NVidia drivers and the machine is once again stable.&nbsp; (These should have a signature that is higher than the Windows Update ones, and thus shouldn't be downgraded).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is generally good, but Microsoft's arrogant assumption that all "updates" are "improvements" is a serious flaw.</p>

            <p>Actually, I figured this out with the help of a Microsoft store tech guy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Device Manager, just 'disable' the updated display adapter--it stays disabled--the Win10 auto updates don't auto update the Nvidia driver which in fact doesn't work on my machine.&nbsp; Instead it defaults to the Win standard driver, which does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, this solved my problem, thank goodness.</p>

    <title>Rare Replay Xbox 360 Spiele verschwunden&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Rare Replay Xbox 360 Spiele verschwunden&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo, ich habe Rare Replay gekauft und irgendwie kann ich die 360er Spiele alle nicht mehr downloaden!</p>
<p>Hab das Spiel das erste Mal eingelegt und dann hat es mal gepatcht. Danach hat es direkt alle Xbox 360 Games in die Download Warteschlange geschmissen. (Bano Kazzoie usw)</p>
<p>Da ich eine ziemlich schlechte Leitung habe, habe ich die alle direkt abgebrochen.</p>
<p>Nun will ich aber diese Spiele runterladen..... Nur sind sie weg! &nbsp;Im Feld "Bereit zum Installieren" ist keines der Spiele da! Und wenn ich in Rare Replay direkt das Spiel auswähle. steht dort auch nur "Bitte schauen sie auf Bereit zum Installieren". Doch
 da ist nix!</p>
<p>Ok 2 Sachen sind schon da Banjo Kazzoie und Banjo Tooie. Aber nur weil ich die 2 Games damals auf der 360 gekauft habe. Und scheinbar mag Rare Replay die auch nicht. Ich hab mal zum testen Banjo Kazzoie installiert und wenn ich nun in Rare Replay Banjo Kazzoie
 auswähle, dann sagt er das es nicht installiert ist.... Obwohl es installiert ist.</p>
<p>Was soll ich nun machen?</p>

<p>Ja ich habe die Disc Version.</p>
<p>Und ja bei mir ist es so, dass alle 360 Games direkt installiert werden müssen.</p>
<p>Die erscheinen nämlich nicht im Feld "Bereit zum Installieren".</p>
<p>Liegt wohl daran, weil die Spiele ja an die Disc gebunden sind und man sie nicht ohne Spielen darf.</p>

<h2>            NBA League Pass Doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Work With XBox One</h2>
                    
<p>So is there anyone out there that is getting their NBA Game Time app to work with the League Pass on XBox One?&nbsp; Mine immediately goes to blue screen with NBA logo after the commercials (funny how the commercials work with no issues eh?).&nbsp; I've confirmed
 a friend of mine having the same problem in Utah (I'm in Hawaii), and my Xbox 360 app works fine...</p>

<p>I don't know how exactly, but IT IS FIXED !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I remembered that lately I have enabled Virtualization.</p>
<p>So, I've disabled windows features: Hyper-V, Virtual Machine Platform.</p>
<p>Windows Hypervisor Platform.</p>
<p>Rebooted.</p>
<p>Device is Working ! No driver error code 39 !</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is that related, I have no idea...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: re-enabling the features doesn't recreate the issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help!</p>

<p>when I created my XBox account, I did a mistake when I entered my birthdate. On my microsoft account it is correct already, but the XBox app keeps saying that my account is an child account. I hope it is possible to solve this issue</p>

            It's not possible to change the age of an Xbox account. If you just recently created the account, you could just make a new one and start over. Otherwise, you would have to wait until the age of the account reaches 18.

    <title>CBS.log file filling up SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kn3xis  say:</h3>
<h2>            CBS.log file filling up SSD</h2>
                    This has been an ongoing issue for about a week now. Started getting alerts that my SSD was full, which was weird because I had not made any new installs to that drive. Did some sifting and found a log file that seemed to have gotten out of hand. I tried
 several things to get rid of it, including disabling Windows Update, and using disk clean up. I could not delete this file. I decided to wipe the drive and do a fresh install of windows, because something was clearly wrong. It has been 2 days on this new fresh
 install of windows and the same thing has happened. The same file has grown to be over 200GB. After some more research it looks like there is a recent windows update that keeps failing on my system, I cannot seem to get the KB# right now, because the Windows
 Update is just showing an error due to my full SSD.<br />
<br />
Any permanent solutions? I can't have this thing constantly filling up my drive, only to have my wipe and reinstall windows.

<p>There is no error. There was a cumulative update that came out about a week ago, that update sits at 99% and never completes the install. If I restart my computer it sits on the "Getting Windows Ready" and never finishes, I left it for a whole night. After
 hard booting windows came back up with a failed update. Decided to not try the update again because I was reading online this latest update does not install for everyone. Next day my SSD is full because of this CBS.log file. In order to delete the file I had
 to turn off the Windows Update service.<br />
</p>
<p>I have already ran the troubleshooter for windows update, it did not fix this issue. I cannot just let this bug keep writing to my SSD, since it will kill my drive, and I doubt I will get reimbursed for the loss of a drive.<br />
<br />
I had the KB of the update that was causing it but lost it in the wipe of the OS the last time.<br />
<br />
*edit* The Update error I mentioned is 0x80070422, which may be related to me disabling the windows update service, now that I think about it.</p>

            I checked his post. It points to disabling BITS as the issue. I have the identical problem but BITS is enabled (and has always been enabled). Is there anything else you can think of to try?

    <title>Windows 10 accent colour doesn&#39;t change automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raissafedora  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 accent colour doesn&#39;t change automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to ask, why my colour accent doesn't change as the background changes?</p>
<p>I have my settings turned on already.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d046461f-9f4a-4733-adbf-f0118da4a293" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It <em>does </em>change actually, when I turned the setting off and on again. But when the background changes, the accent doesn't change. Is it a bug? Do you have any workaround to make it automatically changes?</p>
<p>in windows 8.1 it changes according to the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<strong><span>Steven,</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>How are you trying to update the drivers from Nvidia’s website?
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would like to confirm what exactly happens when you try to update the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Uninstall and reinstall the drivers
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type
 the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Device Manager, locate display adapter then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Driver tab, and then click uninstall Driver and follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><strong><span> Download Nvidia
 drivers form the link below, save it on the desktop and install it with elevated privileges</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index5.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index5.aspx?lang=en-us</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>(Ensure that you select the right product series and
</span></strong><strong><span>operating system platform</span></strong><strong><span>)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Right click on the drivers package download on the desktop and select “run as administrator” and follow the instructions to
 complete the installation.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may want to check with Nvidia for any known issues
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nvidia.com/page/support.html</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Find
<span>Error details in windows update history and let us know </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Update, and then, in the list of results, click Windows Update.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click View update history.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Starting from the most recent dates, find an update for Windows that has failed to install, and then double-click the update to view more information.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updates that have failed to install will display Failed under the Status column.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Windows Update dialog box, find Error details and review the error code for the failed update. If the description doesn't contain error “80246002”,
 click Close.</span></p>

    <title>Comcast Router Set Up for the XBOX ONE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reapersdeathdog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comcast Router Set Up for the XBOX ONE</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I am using only the Comcast router and the <span>Vendor is</span><span>&nbsp;Cisco</span><span>&nbsp;and the
<span>Model is</span><span>&nbsp;DPC3941T. You might be able to try this with there other routers.</span></span></p>
<span>Model is</span><span>&nbsp;DPC3941T. You might be able to try this with there other routers.</span></span></p>

<p>First thing you need is to have the newer router from Comcast if not try this anyway. From you PC you want to type 10.0.0.1 in you internet search engine.</p>
<p>The screen that shows up will ask you to sign in. Username&nbsp;should be admin all lower case. Password should be password all lowercase&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>Next you want to find is your XBOX ONE IP address.&nbsp;Make sure when doing this have your XBOX on.&nbsp;Once you have&nbsp;done that&nbsp;find where it says Connected Devices. Once you know your XBOX IP address find it on that page then hit the edit
 button. Click where it says Reserved IP then save it.</p>
<p>Next step click&nbsp;on&nbsp;Advanced&nbsp;then Port Forwarding. Once you have done that you will want&nbsp;Enable Port Forwarding. Then click on ADD SERVICE.</p>
<p>Once you do that this should show up. What I type in you should do the same.</p>
<p>Common Service: FTP AIM HTTP PPTP Other</p>
<div>Service Name: &nbsp;= XBOX LIVE</div>
<div>Service Type: TCP/UDP</div>
<div>Server IP Address: . . .&nbsp;&lt;---- Put in your XBOX IP Address here</div>
<div>Server IPv6 Address:: : : : : : : &nbsp;&lt;---- Leave Blank</div>
<div>Start Port: 3074</div>
<div>End Port: 3074</div>

<div>Then hit Save.</div>

<div>Also you might need to set your Firewall to Low&nbsp;Security.</div>

<div>I play online games everyday and&nbsp;my NAT Type is always Open. I always have great internet. If you having issues you should have Comcast come out to check your internet and let them know what kind of issues you are having. Hope this helps and Happy Gaming.</div>

<p>Hey man, I have the same gateway and have been running into the NAT issue as well. In my case I have two xbox ones in my home and have read how the xbone's seem to only accept the 3074 port, making UPnP cause NAT issues with multiple xbones. Is there any
 way to have two xbones on the network with the gateway, and have both of their NATs open?</p>

<p>I doubt you will ever get it right with 2 Xboxes , its hard enough with just one...these gateways are not xbox friendly at all , especially when you have multiple consoles...you will need a modem only and a gaming router that does UPNP well ...(netgear works
 very well at this ) </p>

            <p>Hey Reggie VagBush3!</p>
<p>Because this thread is a bit old please create a new thread detailing your issue. Connection issues with this particular router is rather common and we generally recommend reaching out to ISP for alternate hardware. Definitely create a new thread and let us know what's going on though :)</p>

<h2>            esata HDD initialization&#58; &#34;The system cannot find the file specified&#34;</h2>
                    Hello, i'm trying to connect an external HDD via eSATA to my notebook. It shows up uninitialized, but when i try to initialize it i get the message "The system cannot find the file specified" under the tab "Virtual Disk Manager".<br />

<br />
Disk 1 is the external drive. Any tips on how i could initialize it?<br />
<br />
Also, the notebook came with an application called intel matrix storage, and it detects the external drive OK, even hotswap works.

            Hi Mesmer88,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
From the screenshot you’ve provided, underneath the name Disk 1 it says Unknown, the size of the disk, and
<em>Not Initialized</em> . Right click in this area and you should get a pop-up window. Click
<strong>Initialize Disk</strong> and it should only take a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
Once your new hard drive is initialized, you will still have to format the drive before you can use it.<br />
<br />
To format, right-click in the column to the right of the Disk 1 label and then click
<strong>New Simple Volume</strong> in the menu that pops up. From here, you can allocate how much of the drive you want for a new volume, what drive letter you want to call it, give it a name, and finally format the hard disk.<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details on creating and formatting:<br />

</strong><br />
<br />
Formatting the hard drive may take a while, depending on the size.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<p>I just got a new comp with windows 8 :-P&nbsp; its sooo different.&nbsp; I like the solitaire collection but I prefer to play it on my desk top in the small window config.&nbsp; Any way to move it to my desktop or does it have to be a full screen app.&nbsp; I don't like it,
 my monitor is too big.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has removed those games from Windows 8 by design. But these can be downloaded and installed from here:&nbsp;

http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/33814-Microsoft-Games-for-Windows-8</a>.&nbsp; They install flawlessly and run the same as on Win 7. Hope this helps and if you have any other issues or questions post and we will be glad to help
 you solve them</p>
