                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>How do I fix it when my computer is not showing any restore point, instead it says there are currently no restore points available and it will not let me create a restore point in my XP professional. I have defragged, cleaned the disk &nbsp;without success.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help someone can give me.<br />

            If your System Restore is showing you an empty calendar and no Restore Points are available, there is not much you can do about that at the moment - if it used to work, something happened to it.&nbsp; If it used to work, what do you think happened to it?<br />
<br />
Why don't you tell us about your system, what the problem is with it, why you think System Restore will help you (System Restore is not Stewie's time machine) and fix those things and then figure out what is wrong with your System Restore and fix that?<br />
<br />
Sadly the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.
<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

 happened to it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span>I donâ€™t know. Last Thursday I noticed it was no longer letting me restore to a prior date and that was no longer even setting up restore points. I tried setting one up but that did not take effect. So ii was once again back with no restore
 points. Prior to this, a day earlier, I had installed several ebook readers, Atlantis, Calibre, FBReader and Microsoft reader in an attempt to get the formatting correct for an eBook submission to Smashword.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Microsoft Windows XP professional</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Version 2002</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:</p>

<p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Now that you mention that, this may have been the case because we had a power failure here last week. It is on a surge protector. I have used my original XP CD to repair it but said I had a newer version on the computer than what was on the disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The internal drive does not seem to be working even though the troubleshooting says it is, I bought an external and that works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I have the CD that came with the package when I bought it from Microsoft and that is the one that tells me when I use it that I have a newer version on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I want to see restoration points in previous months; right now, I am not even seeing a restoration point in this month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>At least three or four restore points for this month and previous months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I am not certain.</p>

            If you do not see restoration points for previous dates, I would consider them lost.<br />
<br />
If you have been tinkering with System Restore to try to get it to work, you could have inadvertently wiped out all your old RPs - for example, if you disable and reenable SR on a volume, all the current RPs get wiped out.&nbsp; Using some of the third party tools
 you mention and even the built in XP maintenance tools can wipe out all your RPs, but they will usually leave you with your last one as a safety precaution.<br />
<br />
Are you able to manually create a new RP and have it show up in the calendar for today, reboot your system and immediately see if you can restore your system to the RP you just made previously?&nbsp; I would try to get a simple test like that working first to be
 sure your SR mechanism is not afflicted.<br />
<br />
If none of that works, describe what happens as best you can (something besides "it didn't work").<br />
<br />
If that does not work, you may have to reinstall System Restore (not XP - just the SR part) and I have instructions for that but if you do that, it will also wipe out all your old RPs and leave you with one new RP with the installation is complete.&nbsp; Sometimes
 SR is just so afflicted, that is the best way to get things going again.&nbsp; If SR is of no use to you now, reinstalling it and sacrificing any old RPs is sometimes the best way to get it working again (but it sounds like they are missing anyway).<br />

</span></span>I just tried that and there was no restore point established after the reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When I set attempt to set a restore point in system tools under create a restore point, I click the next and title it today january 12 2013, then click on create it says a new restore point created. Additionally, when I click on the close or home
 button, nothing happens, the screen does not change. so I closed it with the X on the top right hand side of the restore point created screen.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I went to http://windowsxp.mvps.org/repairsr.htm and found the directions to reinstall the restore point. I did find the folder when I clicked on SR.INF a pop up appeared asking for the file â€˜sr.sysâ€™&nbsp; on Windows XP Professsional Service Pack 3
 CD is needed-I donâ€™[t know what that is. If it is my original disc that came with the XP then when I use this it says my computer is running a more recent version and it seems as though this will not work.
</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The next thing the pop up asks is to Type the path where the file is located, and then click ok. In the browse box it says C:\WINDOWS\INF\i386 whatever that may be.</p>

            Ramesh has good and helpful instructions but sometimes to get them to "work" you need to have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same SP as your installed SP and most people don't, so&nbsp; when I write instructions, I pretend I don't have one
 either, then they will work for just about anybody.<br />
<br />
When you create a new RP, you don't have to reboot for it to show up in the calendar.<br />
<br />
Your SR calendar is not completely blank just showing an empty white screen with System Restore in the title bar is it?&nbsp; If so, that is a different problem.<br />
<br />
Give this a whirl:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes System Restore is so afflicted and none of your Restore Points will work or you don't trust any of them it is sometimes best to just start all over and reinstall System Restore.<br />
<br />
When you reinstall System Restore, all of your current Restore Points will be removed and you must restart your computer when the installation is complete.&nbsp; After the restart, one new Restore Point will automatically be created as a new System Checkpoint in
 your SR<br />
calendar.<br />
<br />
If your system had a malicious software infection, it could be that some of the files in your old Restore Points are also infected so wiping out the old ones and starting fresh is often a good idea so you don't wonder if the old Restore Points are infected
 or not.<br />
<br />
Assuming your XP is installed on the C drive of your machine:<br />
<br />
As you go through the reinstallation of SR, the reinstallation will ask you for some files as you go along and ask for your XP installation CD.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (most people don't) , you can change the path of where the installer looks for files one at a time as they are needed.&nbsp; More on that later.<br />
<br />
Browse to c:\windows\inf and right click the following file:<br />
<br />
sr.inf<br />
<br />
Choose Install<br />
<br />
If you cannot see c:\windows\inf folder or the sr.inf file therein, configure your system to show hidden files and to show file extensions.<br />
<br />
In Windows Explorer, click Tools, Folder Options, View and enable "Show hidden files and folders" and uncheck "Hide file extensions for known file types" then you should be able to see the c:\windows\inf\sr.inf file.&nbsp; You can undo these adjustments later if
 it is your desire.<br />
<br />
The installation may ask for files from the c:\windows\inf\386 folder.&nbsp; That would be your genuine bootable XP installation CD if you have one and the Service Pack installed on your system needs to be the same as the CD you are going to use.<br />
<br />
You do not absolutely need a CD to do the reinstall SR since the files must already be on your system some place if SR was ever working before.<br />
<br />
If you are asked for a file and you can't find it where I suggest in my example below (it works on my system), you will have to search your hard disk and find where the files are on your system.<br />
<br />
If asked for a file and you don't know where it is, leave the installation waiting and click Start, Search and search for the requested file and find it on your system.&nbsp; If SR ever worked before, the file is already on your system somewhere.<br />
<br />
When Search finds the requested file, switch back to the installation and enter the path to where you found the requested file and click OK.&nbsp; The installation may ask for several files along the way, but you can find them all.<br />
<br />
If you still can't find the files, let us know what the file is you need and some nice person can upload it to their SkyDrive and you can download it.<br />
<br />
Here is how my system works when I reinstall SR when I pretend I do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD:<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
sr.sys<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srclient.dll<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
filelist.xml<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\restore (or c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386)<br />
<br />
If asked for:<br />
<br />
xrstrui.exe<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\restore<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srframe.mmf<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\dllcache (or c:\windows\system32\restore)<br />
<br />
When the installation completes, you will get a message that you need to restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and look at your SR calendar.&nbsp; You should have one new System Checkpoint in your calendar.<br />
<br />
Now is a good time to test your System Restore process from end to end.<br />
<br />
The day you think you need System Restore is not the day to find out it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and with nothing running (no browser, no Outlook, etc. - just the basics), manually create a new Restore Point, reboot your system and see if you are able to successfully restore your system to the Restore Point you just made.<br />

You do not absolutely need a CD to do the reinstall SR since the files must already be on your system some place if SR was ever working before.<br />
<br />
If you are asked for a file and you can't find it where I suggest in my example below (it works on my system), you will have to search your hard disk and find where the files are on your system.<br />
<br />
If asked for a file and you don't know where it is, leave the installation waiting and click Start, Search and search for the requested file and find it on your system.&nbsp; If SR ever worked before, the file is already on your system somewhere.<br />
<br />
When Search finds the requested file, switch back to the installation and enter the path to where you found the requested file and click OK.&nbsp; The installation may ask for several files along the way, but you can find them all.<br />
<br />
If you still can't find the files, let us know what the file is you need and some nice person can upload it to their SkyDrive and you can download it.<br />
<br />
Here is how my system works when I reinstall SR when I pretend I do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD:<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
sr.sys<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srclient.dll<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
filelist.xml<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\restore (or c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386)<br />
<br />
If asked for:<br />
<br />
xrstrui.exe<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\restore<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srframe.mmf<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\dllcache (or c:\windows\system32\restore)<br />
<br />
When the installation completes, you will get a message that you need to restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and look at your SR calendar.&nbsp; You should have one new System Checkpoint in your calendar.<br />
<br />
Now is a good time to test your System Restore process from end to end.<br />
<br />
The day you think you need System Restore is not the day to find out it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and with nothing running (no browser, no Outlook, etc. - just the basics), manually create a new Restore Point, reboot your system and see if you are able to successfully restore your system to the Restore Point you just made.<br />

<h2>            I have an issue with Autoruns on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Autorun problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone can help. I have Windows 7 Home 64bit.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I bought Bitdefender antivirus a couple of months ago. It identified "Media autorun" as a vulnerability and recommended switching it off, which I allowed it to do. I then got fed up as it stopped all DVDs and USB sticks from automatically popping
 up. But... lo and behold! there is no way in Bitdefender to reverse this. I emailed them and got numerous useless replies, which didn't work. The even told me to download and run this file:<br />
</p>
<pre><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/200584d1330364432-autoplay-enable-disable-enable_autoplay.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/attachments/tutorials/200584d1330364432-autoplay-enable-disable-enable_autoplay.reg</a><br />But nothing changed. I finally found a solution, surfing the internet. There were strings in my registry called something like nomediaautorun or similar, and I deleted them. Now USB sticks and DVDs pop up with a choice of options again.<br /><br />However, the automatic content of the DVDs does not load! In other words, if I put a game DVD in the computer, I don't get the automatic screen with the "install" etc options... I'm really fed up. I've looked around everywhere and can't find a solution. Can anyone help please???<br /><br />Thanks.<br /></pre>

<p>As the issue still persists after performing all the troubleshooting steps, it could be due to the corrup system files. To recover or replace these files, let's perform repair installation of Windows 7 which won't affect your personal files and settings.

            <p>&nbsp;If the mic is too close to the speakers, this will happen.&nbsp; It's called feedback.&nbsp; Sound coming out of the speaker goes into the mic and it goes round and round causing the howl.&nbsp; You just have to keep them far enough apart so it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<br />
<br />Do you know which app crashed on your PC?
<br />
<br />If possible can you take a screenshot or photo of that error dialog and post that here . .. 
<br />
<br />Does this happen when your system boots up or at some random time?

</p><p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; Don't know which program is causing it.&nbsp; I'm actually concerned it may be a spybot or other virus.</p>

<p>Thanks, Mike.&nbsp; I've come to the same conclusion.&nbsp; At least it is not spyware.&nbsp; It also started happening after a recent upgrade of SM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My subscription is about over for System Mechanic and at that time, so will my relationship be.&nbsp; I really don't like that they target my anti-virus (TrendMicro) as a security threat (and also a competitor to some of their products).&nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, they list
 trendmicro.com as an unsafe site.&nbsp; It is very unprofessional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Blinking desktop icons on Windows 7 Pro x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mtcsltd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blinking desktop icons on Windows 7 Pro x64</h2>
                    
<p>Last week the icons on my desktop started blinking when I logon to my account, after cold booting. The icons blink to a white colour then go back to normal every two seconds.</p>
<p>If I logoff and back on the problem clears, but always returns after a cold boot. I don't have a clue as to why this has started. The most recent program I installed was Office Communicator 2007 R2 which I have to use for wortk, and I believe there were
 some system updates from Microsoft.</p>
<p>The CPU runs at about 25% busy when the blinking is happening. If I press the Start key, the menu appears briefly and then disappears so it's very difficlut to quickly choose an option. I think there's something upsetting the explore.exe process.</p>
<p>I use Avira AntiVir Premium V9 and a licensed version of Malwarebytes, and neither report any virus or malware infections.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I remember something that happened last week which I think was related. I have 2 Nvidia graphics cards linked using SLI that support a large monitor. The motherboard on my PC using an Nvidia 680 chipset, and I've been having problems with the gigabit ethernet,
 where it can't detect an ethernet connection even though the LAN adapter is enabled. That problem relates to 'receive side scaling', which is still not fixed. Anyhow, that's getting off topic. When I had a problem with the ethernet adapter, I removed it&nbsp;through
 device manager and re-detected it. During that process, the explorer shell froze and then recovered but in a basic low-res mode with a black screen. I switched resolution back to the normal setting and switched to the theme I had been using before (Surreal
 Territory). Booting up the following day, I started getting the blinking icons.</p>
<p>Last night I switched to the default Windows 7 Aero them and shut down. This morning, I booted to safe mode, logged on, then re-booted up normally. I don't get any blinking desktop icons.</p>
<p>Maybe it's too soon to be sure, but I think it's possible the theme got corrupted. I have deleted the Surreal Territory theme. At some point I'll download it again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Stuck in Automatic Repair &#40;amdsbs.sys corrupt&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basic PC Specs:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Windows 8 64-bit</b></li><li><b>8GB of RAM</b></li><li><b>SSD OS Drive RAID 0 (80GBx2)</b></li><li><b>AMD Phenom II X6 1090T BE (OC to 3.8Ghz)</b></li><li><b>2x MSI Radeon HD 6970 Lightning</b></li><li><b>MSI 990FXA - GD80 (Motherboard)</b></li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Over the past two days my FrankenPC (read: custom built) has been getting stuck in the Automatic Repair Loop. I took some time to read what other's have posted in the forums and none of them are related to my situation. First a little background on the
 issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem was first discovered after returning from a trip on Sunday May19th. The computer had been left on, with the Desktop app launched. There are some programs I have that run automatically in the background and they range from 3rd-party backup software
 (CrashPlan) to Anti-Virus (Webroot). The first time this has occurred, and I was able to use System Restore. A Windows Update had occurred (by the way I think this is where the issue lies) and I restored to before that point. Unfortunately this time, I only
 have the option of restoring to the latest backup which is yesterday at 2:00AM. As a side note: this is weird considering my backups are scheduled to run everyday at 6:00AM. But after doing some research I discovered that the timestamps are in GMT-8:00, my
 computer is set properly to my timezone which is EDT. I'm assuming Windows always maintains GMT-8:00 for logging? This evening around 7:30PM EDT, I had sent the computer for a reboot and then laid down for a nap.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Early this morning (May 22nd @ 1:30AM) EDT I arrived at my computer again to find it in the same state. After trying Automatic Repair again, it came back to same couldn't repair screen. Instead of restoring, I went and looked at the SrtTrail.txt file that
 is located on the Windows System Disk under <b>\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</b>. I used the Command Prompt tool available, in which simple functions like notepad open up quite nicely to review the log and found this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Root cause found:</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Boot critical file G:\Windows\System32\drivers\amdsbs.sys is corrupt</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>If I can determine what was updated in the last Windows Update this might point to the issue at hand. This log is appended, so I do see the entry from when it occurred last time (May 20th). The only other thing that seems out of place for me, is that the
 Windows Systen Disk is on G:\ which I'm assuming is normal? I know C:\ is the default, which my working install matches. Perhaps this is the way the system drive is represented in this blue recovery mode?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My next steps involve simply trying to replace the <i>amdsbs.sys</i>&nbsp;file with a fresh copy. I should be able to access my backup drive and copy it over. If not, then I will do another restore, and investigate whether the Windows Update is updating that
 file or not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I will report back my findings.</div>
                </div>

            Update 1:
<div><br />
<div>I detached my Backup Drive from my computer and attempted to recover the file (<i>amdsbs.sys</i>); that was a failure. But I was able to recover the file through CrashPlan. I used my notebook to boot into Windows 7 (It's a MacBook Pro in case you are curious),
 then downloaded the file from my restore archive on CrashPlan. I replaced the file on the System Drive. Restarted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Instead of the saying the file is corrupted in the SrtTrail.txt, it instead said it tried several times to discover the reason for the error, but was unable to determine it. These means two things. First the most obvious; system restore, like Obi Wan,
 might be my only hope. Second by replacing that file, I've correctly pinpointed the issue. As for a resolution, I'm still far from it...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm going to call it quits for now and return to it this evening. I'd rather attempt to restore it manually to fully understand the issue. The problem with my Windows Backup is that it lags behind changes for the day. And of course, I made changes that
 I'd like to persist. There are some other options like refreshing the PC, but I fear the options and settings portion might be too tedious to redo to my preferences.</div>

            Update 2:
<div><br />
<div>After restoring using the system image, I encountered the same issue. From what I can gather, the Windows Update is causing the issue. In that cause, I think I might submit a ticket to support to have them investigate. I cannot move forward and I will
 definitely be restoring until I find a good place that will work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will then disable Windows Update, and update all drivers manually. After which I will do the Windows Update and see if the machine will restart and boot properly.What is most frustrating about this, is I've narrowed it down to a system process. The workaround
 is not as easy as, uninstall software or something even more trivial.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What's the proper method for getting in touch with Microsoft for support for this type of issue?</div>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have exactly the same issue. After a Windows update, the PC will not boot - and cannot recover.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Investigating the SrtTrail.txt led me to your post.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you know which Update is causing it? My list is about 15 updates long - but none of them standout as the culprit.&nbsp;</div>

            Same problem here. Like you, I was away on a trip, and came back on May 24th to find my computer inoperable. After a lot of investigation, I've got back to about the same stage as you - amdsbs.sys is supposedly corrupt, and replacing it still leaves Windows
 8 attempting and failing to perform an automatic repair.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately my only restore point, for some reason, appears to be from 20th May, and therefore after restoring Windows immediately attempts to configure updates during bootup, which throws the system back into a non-booting state.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Will be interested to hear any further progress you make.</div>

Same here; I finally managed to get back into Windows, but trying to install KB2836988 results in the same error. I'm pretty sure that's the culprit.
<div><br />
<div>Incidentally, to get back into Windows, I had to boot to a command prompt, then run the following command (E:\ being my Windows SSD, as listed by diskpart "list volume":&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><b>dism.exe /image:E:\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions</b></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>After rebooting, Windows then detects a failed update, and reverts.</div>

            Hello Everyone,
<div><br />
<div>I haven't been able to test until this morning in which I ran into the issue again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To catch-up, I haven't actually narrowed down which one it is, which I think is the best thing to do for now. Same issue, restarted after updates and then was exhibiting the same issue. I do have a couple of concerns:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>How does one submit issues like this to Microsoft for feedback. Other OS companies actually review their community support forums, and then have moderators escalate legit issues.</li><li>In the event this is only isolated to our configurations, is there any risk to not installing this update.</li></ol>
<div>As for SSD model and configuration, I am using RAID 0 on two Toshiba SSDs. I do have a Crucial M4, but it's not the primary drive... Still I don't believe we should rule that out, but I presume Windows not starting is only related to the %WinDir% disk
 (Toshiba for me). By the way this is not a Toshiba System, I got the disks off eBay off someone who believed they weren't working...lol.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm going to exclude KB2836988. Let's see what happens.</div>

            Surely enough, I excluded that update (KB2836988) from Windows Update and had no issues. I'm going to create a restore point, and then hide that update for now. I will need to submit something to Microsoft, but once again, need to know what the process
 is.

 I don't care. I just want them gone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I'm in XP mode and try to access a networked pc by going to 'my computer' and typing&nbsp;in the address bar something like '\\advmfs01\software', but I get an error that it cannot connect.</p>
<p>Additionally, I tried using the cmd.exe window to ping a company server, like 10.121.1.22.&nbsp; I cannot ping it.</p>
<p>I can access/ping these under Windows 7.&nbsp; What gives?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Set the XP-Mode to use the Host computer Network card (No NAT or any other mode).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/XP-Mode-NIC.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/XP-Mode-NIC.jpg</a></p>
<p>With such configuration, the XP-Mode gets its IP from the Router and behaves like an independent Network computer.</p>
<p>Once it is working, (can use the Internet) you have to configure the network Sharing between the two computers.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>

<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>

<p>You are correct about the "house" icon and the icons you are showing in you description are NOT present on mine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I need to turn a switch "on" in order to see what you are showing?</p>

                    What's the original size on these files? On my PC there're 0 KB both and not hidden. I click on pproperties and the hidden box is in grey (Can't click on) just only Read-Only appears.<br />
<br />
1. How to hide them in C:\ ?<br />
2. Is it normal which 0 KB for their size?<br />
3. Why it appears on my C:\ even though that never appears before?<br />

But RogueKiller detected! it's clean and safe now<br />

<p>

<h2>            So many problems in one day</h2>
                    <p>This morning when I wake up my computer, the sound and wifi panels did not appear when I click on taskbar button. So I restarted Windows and I have to wait for "configuring update do not turn off the computer" for 5 minutes. When it starts up I have to wait
 for the black screen and windows goes "Restarting" again. Then it shows "undoing changes" because update failed.. I have to wait for another start up and black screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And after a few hours of working, Windows starts to lag (like framerate lag) so I restarted it again, then it repeated the cycle: Restarting-&gt;"configuring update"-&gt;boot-&gt;black screen-&gt;"restarting"-&gt;boot-&gt;black screen-&gt;"undoing changes" and it's been 15 minutes
 until I can work again</p>

            <p>Something in your system is preventing updates from being installed correctly. &nbsp;You have to work out what that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Possibilities:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- You are using a non-Microsoft Anti-Virus/Security software that is preventing the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- You need to check with your PC/Laptop manufacturer's support site that you have installed any BIOS/Driver/Software updates that are only available direct from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, more detailed information would be needed about the problems and your hardware and software setup.</p>

            <p>Try, as suggested by Erdeslawe, to deactivate your antivirus before installing the updates... It CAN help. A bit OT: I can tell you that it some times can give problems to update Windows Defender - I couldn't do it before I deactivated it!! HA-HA!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restart, REMEMBER to activate the antivirus again!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when doing some ting on your computer, it's allways a good habit to save the things befor leaving it..... When I writes in a document or editing pictures, I from time to time click on Save, so I don't lose anything, if now S*** happens.</p>

            <p>Turning off antivirus doesn't work. Running sfc/scannow detects no violations. And Windows Update Troubleshooter cannot fix this. It shows this message "Windows Update components must be repaired" as "Fixed" problem every time I run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean I have to install and undo the updates every time I restart the computer? What options do I have left?<br />
<br />
UPDATE:</p>
<p>Downloading the update (KB3097617) and installing manually doesn't work. Using "<em>Dism&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</em>" doesn't work. All this restart and waiting for black screen is really getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>
I searched for this problem and it seems I am the only one seeing this problem. This is not funny.</p>

                    <p>I am a windows 10 user from India . I have upgraded to windows 10 home a week back . I have&nbsp; been unable to use Microsoft app store . Because whenever I try to enter its&nbsp;says that
<strong>"&nbsp;</strong><strong> we have&nbsp;encountered an error . Please try signing in later "</strong> . I have heard that Microsoft had produced an new&nbsp;patch for clearing this problem . My windows is update as of<strong> 8/27/15
</strong>. Still I cant enter&nbsp;windows 10&nbsp;store .Doesn't the patch installs in&nbsp; computers in India at the same time as it does in US ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an <strong>outlook account </strong>as main account . Should I sign in using some
<strong>live account </strong>to activate WIN 10 app&nbsp;store ?</p>

            <p>Hi Yvette,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue sceen errors can occur if a serious problem causes <span>Windows&nbsp;XP</span> to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "<span>Windows</span> has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>These errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues, and it can be difficult to troubleshoot the problem. The following tools and methods can often help get
<span>Windows</span> up and running again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Stop error message usually occurs during installation when there was an attempt in kernel mode to touch pageable memory at too high a process internal request level (IRQL). Typically, this error occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address.
 Other possible causes of this error include an incompatible device driver, a general hardware problem, or incompatible software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following link and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You receive a "Stop error code 0x0000000A (IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL)" error message in Windows XP.

    <title>Libraries in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveeeeeeeeeeee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Libraries in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wandering if anyone could explain this to make it really easy and simple to understrand. After all these years I still get confused by Libraries in Windows. I remember in Windows 7 you had the libraries function and then my music or my documents. The
 way I always saw it, isnâ€™t this making everything repetitive while adding more stuff-do I find it in the libraries or the my documents/files/music/video/pictures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in Windows 10 I can find everything under Library but still a bit confusing. They are in locations such as â€œPicturesâ€. But elsewhere I can also find the same thing with the same name. They look alike when comparing them. So am I just finding library
 locations in different locations in places other than Library? It becomes this, either it is two different folders which I would think is about the stupidest thing in the world because they have the same name and same look-nothing to differentiate them other
 than where you find them-stupid because it is confusing and clutters up the side panel with the tree hierarchy. Why would anyone want to start duplicating and place it in other places other than under the Library window? Or they are not the same-but we are
 sure going to call them the same thing, give them the same name as what is in the Library. So does this mean when looking at Pictures outside the library in a pictures folder created for me by Microsoft or is this a library folder with no way of knowing this
 since it is not under the Library folder but located elsewhere? If I delete that folder outside of the library-am I just deleting another way to look at it or am I deleting a folder with the contents found there in? If they are different, than why does Microsoft
 not name them differently? Also, just like in the past, we are given â€œMy documentsâ€ you could access. But in Windows 10 you are not able top access it but it is still there. What are the purpose of these folders, why donâ€™t I have access to them?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It just seems like Microsoft makes things more confusing while making it harder to find what you need by putting extra folders with the same names as Libraries. Yes, I understand that Windows Library allows you to find your files across multiple domainsâ€¦but
 they do not tell you what these other folders now and that is where all the confusion comes in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure someone might tell me doing things this is way is less confusing and more efficient. I say, there is a big difference between intent and delivery. They are not always the same for all people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for answering my questions.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> confusing, because Microsoft rather abruptly changed its mind about libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft heavily promoted libraries as an innovative feature when they were introduced with Windows 7. By Windows 8.1, Microsoft was instead promoting SkyDrive (as it was then called) as the place to store personal files. Previously, SkyDrive was just another
 storage location that could be included in a library, but now it was superseding libraries altogether. A default install of Windows 8.1 omitted libraries from Windows Explorer (whose name was changed to File Explorer in Windows 10) and you had to edit the
 registry to make them appear again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Microsoft wants everyone to store all their personal drives in OneDrive (which is the replacement name for SkyDrive) and libraries are but a memory. Libraries still exist in Windows 10, but only to maintain backwards compatibility with applications
 that are hard-coded to save files to libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can draw what lessons you like from this, but here is what I decided: When Microsoft puts their own spin on a commonly used technology, I'm going to stick with the commonly used technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never used libraries, sticking instead with the same folder system that everyone else uses. I also never used Homegroups, WiFi Protected Setup (WPS,) or the XPS format for documents, all of which are either dead and gone or all but.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It helps that I know I am not the only one who gets frustrated with Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never tried getting setup with Onedrive after seeing so many times Microsoft comes out with something new in a new version of Windows and then stop supporting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I loved Windows Media Player and then comes out with Groove which seemed like every other song (that I already owned) would see an advertisement for their streaming media which I had to reply to...and now does not have a streaming service. Then when you
 complain, Microsoft comes out with the, "What did you expect for free software" as if because they chose not to charge for Windows 10-that obligates me to having an interrupting experience-taken hostage by their software. Went and looked for something else,
 will be doing the same with a file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
