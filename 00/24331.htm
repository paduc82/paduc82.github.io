<p>
</p><p>I think the 95% that you are getting may be more significant than just the "Error" 5 that this user is complaining about but you may get some diagnostic ideas from the thread</p>

<p>
</p><p>Otherwise the abort itself is most likely a sign of interference.&nbsp; The usual suggestion for that cause is to be sure that all interferers are at least disabled but preferably uninstalled and if necessary have all vestiges removed.</p>

<p>Hi Robert... thanks for the prompt response. I have read through the suggested thread and recognise many of the problems listed by the contributors. I assume that your reference to interferers means other programs? If so, what programs, how do I determine
 which one is interfering @ the 95th % of my update process?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have attached my WindowsUpdate.log from yesterday's failed attempt to install the offered Windows 10 Insider Preview 17741.1000 (rs5_release) -Error 0x80070005. Like the others, I have no real idea about what it all means... can you please have a look
 through the log file and give me some pointer toward which interfering program requires some terminatin - the dog-on varmit. 👿<br />

<p>Hi Robert... I think that you are right in suggesting a more independent &amp; direct approach to securing the latest update. I downloaded the recently released 17713 iso from MS and did a reset using that but I don't care to wait until the next iso release.
 I think I'm going to retry the&nbsp;UUP to ISO conversion tool&nbsp; again as featured in an Windows 10 Forum&nbsp;<span>article.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the input... now where's that link&nbsp;</span></p>

Turns out that my problem with the 17735, 17738 and 17741 updates not installing on my tablet was due to a problem with system drivers.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
The previous three or four Insider updates had not installed the correct Atom Z3745 system drivers for my tablet. Things like sound, battery management and power, screen, touch, and orientation don't work after the update. To get them to work I had to manually
 install the Intel system drivers. The installer is an old Windows 8.1 one but the drivers seem to work fine. After the 17731(?) update I used a more recent installer; same processor but newer model of tablet. The drivers seemed to work fine, except that the
 update's wouldn't complete.</p>

After going back to the older drivers that were specific to my tablet model the 17741 update installed.</p>

<p>Hello David... interesting experience. I have tried the graphics driver route as I've suspected that it causes long delay on boot-up but windows always states that I already have the best driver available installed? My graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD 7900

<p>

</p><p>That's a sign that you are using WU to do the picking for the update.&nbsp; Instead you can use the Browse my computer... Let me pick... method and try other drivers that WU thinks have been superseded (or pick something else that you have downloaded and expanded

<h3> saltydog1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 Personal Folders Backup Command Missing from File Menu</h2>
                    
<p>Running Windows Vista Ultimate, Office 2007, Outlook 2007 and IE 7.</p>
<p>I have Installed, Uninstalled, ReStarted, Cleaned, and ReInstalled the Outlook Personal Folders Backup Add-In several times.&nbsp; The installation identified there was an existing copy installed and I selected to remove/uninstall and the installation identified
 install completed successfully.&nbsp; I have also Uninstalled several times utilizing the Control Panel\Programs and Features uninstall and ReStarted and Cleaned, and installed.&nbsp; Still to no avail, the "Backup" Command or option does not appear within the Outlook
 2007 File Menu, other Menus, or in the COMM Add-Ins or Disabled Applications Add-Ins.&nbsp; I have utilized previously on this computer, but believe it disappeared when I installed IE 7 or some Office Fix or Outlook Update and had to Reinstall Outlook at that time.&nbsp;
 Please advise with detail and provide fix.&nbsp; I must have BackUp :-)</p>

<p>Gary,</p>
<p>I am working with Safari or Firefox. &nbsp; So i dont' know how to take screenshots.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that I entered Shared Mailboxes and created the alias emails. &nbsp;When I go to manage alias emails, it asks me to login for Office365 which I do. &nbsp;I then get directed to a page that says "send results" and lists my address. &nbsp;I press send,
 it asks me if I want to "leave the page" and I hit to accept. &nbsp;It then goes to results page and the "wheel" just keeps spinning around.</p>
<p>On my shared email addresses, I have an<strong>[Delete by Moderator].</strong>com and a couple others, but I can't seem to do anything with them but check the boxes beside them on the "users and groups" page.</p>

<p>hi todd,</p>
<p>thanks for the information. however, some terms you used in your description might not be related to office 365. as screenshots can help us better understand the situation, if possible, can you send them to us? you could ask your office365 admin about how
 to take screenshots.</p>
<p>after you get the screenshots, please click<strong> use rich formatting </strong>
&gt;<strong> insert\ edit media to upload screenshots</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Tasks in Outlook 2016 for Mac disappear</h2>
                    <p>Task will disappear from Outlook 2016 on my Mac. I have tried re-syncing the accounting, re-installing office, running a MS tool called "Outlook Search Repair" but none seem to be a permanent fix. I found out that going to Folder Properties &gt; Empty Cache
 will bring the task back, but they disappear again. If I log into webmail the task appear just fine.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that you are facing issues with Microsoft Edge. Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use other browsers to browse, does edge launch automatically without clicking on a link?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Let’s reset Microsoft Edge and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
Resetting the Microsoft edge will remove your bookmarks and History.<br />
<br />
Follow the instruction provided below and check. <br />
a. Navigate to the following location: </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>b. Delete everything in this folder.&nbsp; <br />
c. Now, type Windows Powershell in search box. <br />
d. Right click on Windows Powershell and select Run as administrator. <br />
e. Copy and paste the following command. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" –Verbose}<br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: The Reset Edge Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Edge Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note
 these sites before you use the Reset Edge Settings feature. Resetting Edge isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may reset edge and get back with the results.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I add a second Office 365 subscription product key to extend my current subscription&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new Office 365 year long subscription with a new product key along with a new Surface.&nbsp; The sales people said that I should simple enter the product key and it would "extend" my existing subscription for 1 year beyond my current subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I don't see how to do it an concerned about "reinstalling" the product again.&nbsp;&nbsp; What should I do?</p>

            I have not tested this myself, but others have reported that simply entering the 2nd 365 Home Premium product key in their account extended the subscription. What they actually wanted was additional device installations. They were not happy.<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, just enter your product key and the system will automatically extend your Office 365 subscription by another year. I just followed these steps and it worked perfectly for me... Actually, my subscription was extended by a year and 19 days.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So feel free to redeem your new product key 10 days before expiration. You'll definitely have (at least) 375 days left after you've completed the redemption.</p>

</p>
<p>Now, just enter your product key and the system will automatically extend your Office 365 subscription by another year. I just followed these steps and it worked perfectly for me... Actually, my subscription was extended by a year and 19 days.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't work for me. &nbsp;At the bottom of the "My Account" page, it says that my subscription expires on May 5 and that Automatic Renewal is Off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link I then follow says "Renew with an Office product key". &nbsp;Next page, I enter my new key and then a page requesting country (AU selected already) and language (I chose English - the only option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click Continue, I get an error:</p>
<p>"The Microsoft account already has an Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>To set up a new subscription, please sign out and then use a different Microsoft account.</p>
<p>To use this Microsoft account, you need first to turn off auto-renewal on your active subscription. &nbsp;Go to My Account to manage your subscription"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This, of course, just leads me back where I started and I go round the loop again. :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I do want to use my existing account and auto-renewal is already Off, how do I get beyond this error page?</p>

<h3> th303  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom shape styles&#63;</h2>
                    I write software manuals, and annotate a lot of screen shots with lines, arrows, and labels. To do this, I place the screenshot in a drawing canvas. Then I click a line or arrow or text box in Insert Shapes, insert it in the canvas, and modify the shape
 with right-click + Format Shape… using lots of mouse clicks. I'd like to save my various style formats so I can re-use them without having to make all those clicks each time. Is there a way I can put my custom styles into the Shape Styles panel. Or can I record
 them as macros? Or something? <br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

            I'll second Graham's recommendation of SnagIt. Since you use this sort of feature regularly, you should find SnagIt's very reasonable price entirely justified, and I suspect that after just a few days using the free trial you'll find it worth purchasing.

<h2>            Has anyone had a scam that froze their computer until you called a help line. Then have them delete windows 10 from your computer&#63;</h2>
                    while surfing the internet computer froze up with a a dialog box and audio warnings that I was entering a suspicious site. The computer would then not exit the warnings. with a comment that shutting down the computer would damage computer. When number
 was called they said the firewall was inadequate and needed to purchase Realtime network protection. When this was refused they were able to delete files and remove windows 10.

<p>It's a common scam that you could have ended with the Task Manager. Now you must consider everything on your computer has been compromised. Passwords, PIN numbers, financial account information. A clean install of Windows is the best option and what I would
 do myself. See the following and decide if you want to tempt fate not knowing what they may have installed on your computer.

            Depending on the browser, you can first try pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL to bring up the task manager and kill browser tasks. That doesn't work in all cases and when it doesn't, shutting down the computer and rebooting is the way to go

<h2>            Can&#39;t mark comment done - word 2013</h2>
                    Hi Guys, <br />
Just getting used to word 2013, and discovered the ability to mark comments done rather than deleting.&nbsp; This looks very useful.&nbsp; However when right clicking on the comment the option to 'mark comment done' is greyed out - already has a checkmark by it, and
 I cannot mark it as done.<br />
<br />
Any ideas as to why the option is greyed out, stopping me selecting it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            One more thing to be aware of: When you use Save As in a *.doc and tell it to save as a *.docx or *.docm, there's a check box in the Save As dialog for "Maintain compatibility with previous versions of Word". To enable "Mark comment done" and other Word
 2013 new features in that document, you must be sure that box is not checked.<br />
<br />
The other way to do this is to click File &gt; Convert and then save.<br />

            'Mark comment done' is a new feature introduced in Word 2013. The option only works with Word document format means docx. If you are using a .doc file extension I would suggest you to save the file to a docx (Word document) format to use this feature.<br />

<h2>            User level Security, Encode or Encrypt</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 and Access 2007. We have a 2000&nbsp;DB&nbsp;that we are trying to convert to 2007 but, we can't get past security, I added myself as an admin to the mdw DB. I tried to set up permission in the database but I get "To change permissions for this
 object, you must have administer permission for it". I put a copy in my personal drive and made myself owner and full control. I tried to convert it&nbsp;or save as a 2007 file but I get "You are trying to convert an encoded database. Decode the DB, and try again.
 So I try to decode and get "You can't decode a database that you didn't create or don't own. See the owner of the database or your workgroup administrator. The only problem with that is the owner no longer works for the company. I was going to try to import
 everything into a new DB but I don't have permission for that either. I thought maybe I could just click on the queries and rebuild them in another DB but I don't have read design permission. I also tried to create a new mdw file with no luck. I have tried
 everything I can think of. My question is, Is there a way to get around security? I really don't want to start from scratch.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            You need to REMOVE all permissions from the 2000 DB BEFORE trying to convert.&nbsp; So that means going in as an admin and then running the security tools and deleting all user groups and restoring back to just the generic admin user in the admins group and
 no special permissions applied.&nbsp; Then you should be able to IMPORT everything from the file into a new accdb file.&nbsp; I would NOT use the SAVE AS feature.&nbsp; Importing may mean having to go back and set some options but it is the cleanest method to get it to the
 new format and without issues which do occur if you do the conversion.

<p>Thanks. It&nbsp;is helpful to know that isn't a problem with my computer. I do have two step verification but I still have the problem.&nbsp; Any idea when Microsoft will do an update that fixes this problem.&nbsp; Is it a month away or more like a year away.&nbsp; Best guess
 is fine.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>When you phone in, you can try the automated process. Sometimes it will work.&nbsp; Otherwise, call back and wait (a long time) until you are offered the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain that old computer died, you are transferring the license
 to a new device.&nbsp; That is part you license term rights. </p>

<strong><span>Activation Phone Support - phone activate</span></strong>
<p>If you have an activation specific error, ie things like “invalid” or “blocked” product key, you specifically have to contact the “phone activation” support reps.&nbsp; Apparently “normal” support has no way of transferring you to them …
 &lt;sigh&gt; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process you need to follow is rather round about:</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start normal activation, </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>select phone activation option, </p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>this will display appropriate phone number for your geographic location.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Phone them</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>do <strong>NOT</strong> reply to initial prompts</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>wait, a long time, until you are offered the option of talking to a “service” rep</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>explain problem to them</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>ask to be transferred to a supervisor when front line support can’t help you

            The contacts search in Nokia E90 is based on first and last name only.<br />
<br />
You may want to consider installing "Nokia search". It's an application that will search your phone contents, including your contacts.<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Since you bought ur phone new and it might be in shop stock for a while. and the new Firmware for this E90 available now.<br />
<br />
i have updated my e90 and it works perfect now and starts very quickly with old firmware i had to wait little more.<br />
<br />
<br />
note:before you update ur FW back up ur phone list sms or files.

            Whoops! I'm still using the old firmware. :( Thanks for the reminder, downloader!<br />
<br />
Edit: Just as an aside, I've been searching for existing contacts based on "company" info by creating a text message and typing the company's name in the "To" field. It used to bring up the contacts linked to the company. :)<br />
<br />
I prefer Nokia Search though.<br />
<br />
Does the new firmware now give an option to search for companies in Contacts?<br />

            Yes it does!<br />
<br />
For example . company name is japan.ltd<br />
<br />
type in search ltd or jap it can find . if the other contact has ltd included it would show them as well. it doesnt matter if the contact name starts with Jap or anything it would show all contacts which has Ltd or jap or any of these word included but if you
 specify more ur search i am sure u can find it quick like by typing japan :P

<h2>            Publisher - stuck in edit mode for charts&#47;graphs</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting stuck when editing a chart/graph in Publisher 2016. When I double-click on the chart, it changes to edit mode, which is great. However, no matter where I click, I can't get out of the edit mode. I can't right click anywhere, I can't interact
 with anything besides the chart, and there's no "close edit mode" buttons that I can see.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I end up closing the document, accepted the saved changes, and opening it again, which gets really tedious. I've tried all kinds of search terms to see if someone else has had this problem, but I can't find a solution. How do I get out of chart edit mode?!</p>

    <title>Sequential row numbering on grouped results in access 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haxquiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sequential row numbering on grouped results in access 2003</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello&nbsp;Guru's,</span></p>
<p><span>I have a table with double rows in it. (it does have a specific ID, but that is besides the point.)<br />
For example:</span></p>
<p><span>Table example:<br />
field 1: Project_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field2: Person_id<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 631<br />
34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6<br />
<br />
My problem is this,<br />
There are 5 doubles (maximum) per project_id, and i need to get a single row for further processing.<br />
But i also need all person_id's per project_id.<br />
So i need to get this as a result for project_id 22:<br />
<br />
Project_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Person2:&nbsp;&nbsp; Person3:&nbsp;&nbsp; Person 4:&nbsp; Person5:<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 631&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (blank)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (blank)<br />
34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(blank)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (blank)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (blank)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(blank)<br />
<br />
i thougt a sequential number would fix my problem, by creating this as a (temp) table:<br />
<br />
field 1: Project_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field2: Person_id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Created field3: Seq.<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 631&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br />
34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
<br />
Based on the project_id in combination with the seq value, I can extract all the persons in 5 different query’s.<br />
Query1 = select where seq=1, <br />
query2= select where seq=2 etc.<br />
Unfortunately, i can only seem to find a solution for sequential numbering in a report, but i need it in a table for further processing.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me in the right direction?<br />
Many thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>Perfect!<br />
the solution!!!!<br />
<br />
I dont have a clue how and why*, but it works like a charm!<br />
(I will study it later on, hopefully i can use it on other project in a later stage..)</p>
<p>Thanks Roger!!!!! <br />
Your a life saver!</p>

<br />
If you want to look into it further, there are a couple of samples on my website (<a href="http://www.rogersaccesslibrary.com/forum/topic309.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NumberedQuery.mdb</a> and<a href="http://www.rogersaccesslibrary.com/forum/topic279.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RunningSumInQuery.mdb</a>)
 which demonstrate the sequencing part (with a thorough explanation).&nbsp; I just used the Crosstab Wizard to create the original crosstab.&nbsp; To merge them, I simply replaced Table1 in the Crosstab query&nbsp;FROM clause with the entire SQL of the original, sequencing
 query, aliased it as T, and use T everywhere I'd used Table1 in the first crosstab.

<p>Let me sneak up on it in stages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, you can create a query which will create a sequential number by group (this process REQUIRES a unique ID):</p>
<p>SELECT Project_ID, Person_ID, "Person_" &amp; DCount("Person_ID","Table1"," Project_ID = " &amp; [Project_ID] &amp; " And ID &lt;=" &amp; [ID]) AS Person_Num<br />
FROM Table1;</p>
<p><br />
Project_ID&nbsp;Person_ID&nbsp;Person_Num<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person_1<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person_2<br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 631&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Person_3<br />
34&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person_1<br />
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person_1<br />
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Person_2</p>
<p>Next, you can use that query (call it Query1) in a crosstab query to get the results you want:</p>
<p>TRANSFORM First(Query1.[Person_ID]) AS FirstOfPerson_ID<br />
SELECT Query1.[Project_ID], First(Query1.[Person_ID]) AS [Total Of Person_ID]<br />
FROM Query1<br />
GROUP BY Query1.[Project_ID]<br />

<p>Now, these two queries can be combined into one:</p>
<p>TRANSFORM First(T.[Person_ID]) AS FirstOfPerson_ID<br />
SELECT T.[Project_ID]<br />

FROM Table1) as T<br />
GROUP BY T.[Project_ID]<br />
PIVOT T.[Person_Num];</p>
<p>*Of course you'll need to replace your table name for "Table1" and your actual ID field for "ID"</p>

<h2>            Text is distorted when converting from ppt to PDF on mac</h2>
                    I'm using PowerPoint 15.17 for Mac, and converting from the slides to a PDF makes the text oddly spaced. I have used the File &gt; Export option, as well as Print &gt; Save as PDF, and still get the same results. Is there a setting I can change to keep that
 from happening?
