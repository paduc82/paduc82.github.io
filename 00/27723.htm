<h2>            Cannot set up a hotmail.co.uk address o a Blackberry Curve</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up a hotmail.co.uk e-mail address on a Blackberry Curve, but keep getting a message which says the address and password cannot be verified. I have already set up a hotmail.com address successfully on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I select "Other" from the list of e-mail addresses when I start enteriung the details?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what should I enter under "Email server"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Bitlocker to go not recognising password or recovery key as correct</h2>
                    <p>I have Toshiba 1TB external hard drive which I recently encrypted with Bitlocker to go. All was fine the first time but then when I went to unlock it for the second time it would not accept my password which I was sure was correct so I then tried the recovery
 key which must be correct as the key id matches the one in my recovery file but every time I enter this it says it is for the wrong disc I have tried this a number of times and each time with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help as this drive contains very important irreplaceable files such as pictures,videos etc.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are unable to download .vsd files. I will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Do you get the error at system startup or every time you open Internet Explorer?</li></ul>
<p>The issue might arise due to corrupted Internet Explorer system files. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter and check if it helps. It checks for common issues, such as whether you have enough space on your computer's hard disk to store temporary Internet files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter by clicking the <span>
<strong>Start</strong></span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, and then clicking
<span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span>. In the search box, type <span><em>troubleshooter</em></span>, and then click
<span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span>. Click <span><strong>View all</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>Internet Explorer Performance</strong></span>.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Boot the system in clean mode and eliminate the faulty service causing the issue.</p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Start Internet Explorer in administrative mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>a) Right click on the Internet Explorer icon.</p>
<p>b) Click on <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if the issue persists and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Using Multiple Email Addresses With Outlook.com Custom Domains - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Multiple Email Addresses With Outlook.com Custom Domains</h2>
                    <p>As you know, it's possible to use your own domain name instead of 
name@outlook[.]com for your Microsoft email account, by setting up your domain name in Windows Live Admin Centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst looking into this, it appears that one of the downfalls is that Outlook.com doesn't allow you to use a catch-all email address, which would allow all emails addressed to your domain (anything before the @ symbol) to be automatically sent to a single
 inbox.&nbsp; It seems that Microsoft are aware of this limitation, but don't appear to be very keen on allowing catch-all email addresses, therefore I looked into the alternative of setting up multiple email addresses for incoming email instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, looking around the scattered info on the internet, it appears that you can't set-up email aliases if you're using a custom domain.&nbsp; The only thing you can do is use a '+' identifier (such as
name+facebook@mydomain[.]com), but that isn't really a good solution, as your main email address is still visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other option seems to be to setup a mail account for each individual email address and then set them to forward the email to your main account, however this also doesn't appear to be a good solution, as it requires you to sign into each account
 at least once a year to prevent the accounts from being suspended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is there a way for someone to&nbsp;use their own custom domain with Outlook.com and allow&nbsp;multiple incoming email addresses to be delivered to one mailbox (say for example, thirty different email addresses being directed to the main inbox)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>It's like the Mary Celeste in here.&nbsp; Well, still haven't found a decent solution for multiple email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Aliases:</strong><br />
I tried to set up aliases for each email address.&nbsp; The first problem you encounter is because your MX records now direct all the email for your domain to the Outlook.com mail servers, when you go to setup an alias it will ask you to verify the alias by responding
 to the email it sends to that email address.&nbsp; But you can't verify the alias because there's no way to receive the verify email, as the email address doesn't yet exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I done was to re-direct the email for my domain back to my original (non-Microsoft) mailbox so that I could receive the verify emails and therefore verify the aliases.&nbsp; However, it was a waste of time anyway because although you've now set up an
 alias in Outlook.com and verified it, Outlook.com still won't allow you to receive email for that alias (all you get is a 550 mail delivery error if you try sending email to that address).&nbsp; Yeah, stupid I know!&nbsp; And it's not really any good for sending emails
 from either, because all it does is send the email with a 'sent on behalf of...' message on it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Mailboxes:</strong><br />
So, next thing I thought I'd try was to set up a seperate mailbox for each email address, then just forward the email to my main account.&nbsp; Well, not only it is a lot of messing around setting up whole new Microsoft accounts for each individual email address,
 it turns out it's not very practical anyway.&nbsp; You see, Microsoft don't allow you to turn off the SPAM filter, and the filter is applied before it forwards emails.&nbsp; Therefore, if Microsoft deem an email to be spam (even though quite often it's a false positive
 and not spam at all), the email will get put in to the junk email folder instead of forwarding it to the forwarded email address.&nbsp; So, it's inevitable that you will end up missing emails due to them ending up in the junk email folder of your non-main mailbox,
 instead of being forwarded to your main mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And obviously (as mentioned above), you also have to make sure you sign into each mailbox every 270-365 days to make sure the mailbox doesn't get removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Alias Identifiers (using a 'plus' symbol):</strong><br />
I tried using a '+' identifier (such as name+facebook@mydomain[.]com).&nbsp; The problem is a lot of companies don't recognise it as a valid symbol in an email address and therefore show an error saying that it's not a valid email address.&nbsp; If you look at the following
 screenshot, Microsoft themselves don't even recognise it as a valid email address.&nbsp; You really couldn't make it up!</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d59adf87f-656c-4f8e-826f-2e3318a378e3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>So, I've got to the point now where I'm considering just ditching the idea altogether and just re-direct my domain back to my original (non-Microsoft) mailbox.&nbsp; I'm still running a local account in Windows 8 rather than a Microsoft account anyway, so it's
 not such a problem as it's only email.</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding. Here's what I found out regarding the 2 networks:</p>
<p>Uni - basic network<br />
Fishing club - Enterprise network</p>
<p>All Enterprise networks are associated with Office 365 while the free/basic ones are not. This is the reason you see the Office 365 screen when you switch. You need to go through the Office 365 sign in process for the Yammer sign in to be successful.</p>
<p>In terms of switching from 1 network to another, you need to consider&nbsp;the cached&nbsp;information. These are the temporary files saved in every browser. If you wish to seamlessly switch, I recommend using a separate browser.
</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The Future updates are not major one's.First gen devices will get minor updates which will be a part of or the fp1 as a whole.It is quite possible that these devices will also get a tweaked down version of the major &nbsp;however</p>

    <title>Unable to Rename Folder in Outlook for Mac 2016 unless &#34;Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timakudo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Rename Folder in Outlook for Mac 2016 unless &#34;Working Offline&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook 2016 for Mac with a personal gmail and Google Apps accounts setup for email access (no other services). I have some On My Mac folders (not syncing, this is how I like it), and when I add a new folder, I'm unable to edit the name. All that
 happens when I either double-click the name of the folder or right click &gt; rename is that it highlights the "Untitled" as if it's ready to edit... and then it immediately reverts back to not editing the name. It's as if it's thinking that I'm clicking away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting the machine and Outlook itself. I don't want to remove accounts and re-add as it's a pain. Outlook and the Mac are 100% up to date as of today. If I change Outlook to Working Offline, then it allows me to edit it without a hassle. The
 annoying thing is that these are On My Mac folders, not IMAP or on a server, so I can't see how this is related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with working out how to resolve this permanently is appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have already tried a few steps without any resolution, I would suggest you to un-install Office for Mac 2016 completely. Once un-installed make sure to restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Re-install Office for Mac again, setup your email account and check if it works and you are able to rename folders in Outlook for Mac 2016</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Take a backup of important Office information before re-installing Office for Mac 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the above step helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you. </span>

    <title>Problem exporting calendars to csv from Outlook 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark &#40;live.com&#35;firstdibz&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem exporting calendars to csv from Outlook 365</h2>
                    <p>The problem is the converter would get about 90% through and would give me an error message that the translator could not complete.</p>
<p>I searched and searched and could not find any solution to the problem on the net even though others have been experiencing the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to reinstall a few times and running the repair utility a few times i think i finally found the source of the problem.</p>
<p>After trying a few date ranges and getting some to work the problem seems to be that the outlook 365 csv translator seems to have a problem converting recurring dates that start or finish outside of the specified date range</p>
<p>I got the date ranges of (5/1/18 to 5/1/18) and (2/1/18 to 8/1/18) to work but not my original date range of (4/18/18 to 7/1/18)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now that I've gotten the two previous date ranges to work, i can no longer duplicate the problem that i originally had.</p>
<p>So it seems as if trying different date ranges that work has somehow reset the translator so that it is now working properly.</p>
<p>Either that or it was a combination of running the repair utility, reinstalling and trying different date ranges that fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post back here if the problem reoccurs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Account temporarily blocked - violation of terms of service</h2>
                    <p>My account was temporarily blocked about a week ago.&nbsp;<br />
I then found out it is because I "violated the terms of service" except I have not done anything differently to my email in the last 10+ years of having it. So unless someone hacked my account, I did not violate the terms as I have re-read them several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was referred here for help to unblock my account. How do I do this?</p>

 why I keep trying these forums and other online channels. At least then other people will also see these issues and be warned that data is not safe with Microsoft.

            <p>Hi Anusha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer recently upgraded to <strong>Windows 10 </strong>and as you know it has the new
<strong>Edge </strong>browser. When I use the "<strong>Bing</strong>" search engine/page (https://www.bing.com/) in the upper right corner there is a "<strong>Preferences</strong>" cog/button where&nbsp;you can select "<strong>Settings</strong>". Under "<strong>Settings</strong>"
 you can set under "<strong>Results</strong>" to "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>do not </strong>have this issue with Bing (https://www.bing.com/) on
<strong>Microsoft's Internet Explorer </strong>on the <strong>same machine </strong>
with the newly installed <strong>Windows 10 OS</strong>. I can display 50 search results on the Bing page in&nbsp;Internet Explorer.&nbsp;I only have this issue when using Bing on Microsoft's new Edge web browser. And on both Internet Explorer and Edge, I don't have
 an issue with a similar setting on the Google search engine/page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note I am logged into my Microsoft Account on the Bing search engine/page when attempting to change this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brent</p>

</p><p>Smittychat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I tinkered with this some more and discovered that on the first page of results Bing only displays 10 results and suggestions. If I click to move to the second page of results I get 50 results (or what ever number of results I have set to display in
 settings). How do I get the first page of results to display more than 10 results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have noticed a glitch in this forum. My original response to Anusha contained more information in the first paragraph but when I posted my response to Anusha it disappeared (or was mysteriously deleted). You can see that the post has a hanging quote
 and no period to end the sentence. I attempted to edit my original post and after hitting submit the additional information I typed disappeared again.&nbsp;So I have attempted to post again the steps I am taking to resolve my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My computer recently upgraded to Windows 10 and as you know it has the new Edge browser.
</li><li>When I use the "Bing" search engine/page (https://www.bing.com/) in the upper right corner there is a "Preferences" cog/button where&nbsp;you can select "Settings".
</li><li>Under "Settings" you can set under "Results" to "</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>I'm still having issues with posting to this forum and having portions of my posts deleted after submitting them. So here is the rest of my post that the forum keeps deleting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Settings you can set under Results to Show this many results on each page and choose 50 on the drop down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then click to save and return to the Bing page and still only receive 10 results on the first pate of results.</p>
<p>

            If Word is correctly installed, there are two things that can go wrong:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Your Normal.dotm template</li><li>Your personal preferences and settings</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>There is no way to bypass one or the other with Shift, so you need to do this manually. It involves some detective work. You can try the following steps in sequence, or do them separately or in reverse. The idea is to identify which is corrupt: your Normal
 template, your preferences or both.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>1) Bypass the Normal template</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Quit Word</li><li>Go to the Finder</li><li>Select <em>Go &gt; Go to Folder</em></li><li>In the field, type this: <strong>~/library</strong>&nbsp;(don't forget the twiddle ~)</li><li>Locate this folder: Application Support/Microsoft/Office/User Templates</li><li>Drag file <em>Normal.dotm</em>&nbsp;to the Desktop (in case something goes awfully wrong, you can place it back)</li><li>Start Word and test</li></ul>
<div>If Word works OK, you are done. If not, the fault should be your preferences, although there is a chance that both parties are involved. So, even though at this point you could restore your Normal template to its natural folder, better leave it on the

<p>In my case, XL, Word &amp; PPT all crash upon opening even w/PLIST files and Normal.dot pulled out; I found a similar post regarding corrupt fonts, opened Font Book and see if any fonts are disabled or have strange characters preceding them, ie: #fontname ...
 check and remove those fonts. You may be able to run your Office apps now. Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac suddenly not opening.</h2>
                    <p><span>Have been running outlook for Mac on a brand new computer since I opened it 2 months ago. Been working OK (mainly the issues with attachments periodically not working and the email unable to send) but have found work around
 for everything. Suddenly as of this afternoon Outlook will no longer open resulting in rainbow wheel and force shut down only to try again and have 0 success.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Restarting computer</span></p>
<p><span>Starting from the finder - instead of dock&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>While the solution to create a new profile certainly allows you to use Outlook again, it basically starts you from scratch. You have to set up your account all over again, PLUS you lose all of your On My Computer and Smart folders! I often warn people that
 if they move anything (from the server) to On My Computer, to back it up often (export). But in this scenario, why must we create a new profile? Why isn't this bug fixed by now (a year later)? Does anyone have any other solution? Disk Repair with El Capitan
 (assuming First Aid ran repair, since it has a totally different look in El Capitan) did not work in this case.

</p><p>I was able to find this (from http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macoutlook/restore-outlook-2016-mac-from-a-time-machine/bd3a8115-2752-4fe5-bbc7-298dd30e829e) to copy my Time Machine backup to profiles:</p>

<h2>            Ms. Visio just showing white screen on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgrading my OS from windows 8.1 to windows 10 and I do a clean install.
</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with Ms. Visio before on windows 8.1 and when I try to install Ms. Visio 2013 on windows 10,
</p>
<p>it install properly but when I open the app it just showed a white screen (See the picture below). I thought it because Ms. Visio 2013 maybe not compatible for windows 10 and then I tried to install Ms. Visio 2016 and it have a same problem. Another Office
 app like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint doesn't have this problem. Please help me.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your reply.</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>I log into each account using the password that I set up for the previous user (trip Leader)</p>
<p>These are just normal *** Email address is removed for privacy *** accounts that I set up a few years ago. They just happen to be sequential for ease of administering them.</p>
<p>The sequence of prompts when I attempt to change the passwords is as follows:</p>
<p>I go to settings.... select change password.... it asks to enter the email address that I used when creating the account, so they system can send me a code to use, to go further and change the password.</p>
<p>I have no problem with doing this, I understand and appreciate the security aspects of this, however, after changing 15 account passwords (tbssb1 thru
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***), when I entered my email address, I began getting a message that stated I had reached my limit of code requests for this week.</p>
<p>This is the part I'm having trouble with.</p>
<p>My process at this time of year, is to into each account and retrieve and archive files placed in the Sky Drives and remove old emails from the Outlook and do a general cleanup/reset of the whole account, so that the new user has a "clean" account to work
 from.</p>
<p>Normally, my first step is to go in and give all accounts the same generic password. This locks out any of the previous users from accessing anything while I reset and it makes it easier on me, in that I don't have to keep looking up 25+ different passwords.</p>
<p>The next step is to go through and clean up each account and reset the password again with the one that will be given to the new users for the coming year.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So as you can see, by having a limit on the number of codes I can request, will greatly hamper my ability to accomplish all of this with a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>I'm open to suggestions on how to either raise the limit of code requests that can be made in any given week and/or "work arounds' that I can employ to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> avectochristian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quickly add OneDrive Licenses</h2>
                    <p>I am deploying OneDrive for business to our business, previously we have had the SharePoint and Office online licenses disabled for all users. We have around 10 users with them manually enabled during a testing period and I now need to activate these licenses
 for the rest of the organization (200) users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to select all and amended the licenses but the button to assign remains greyed out. How can I quickly give these licenses out without doing it one by one?

    <title>Installing custom Office 365 components for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orkunerardag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing custom Office 365 components for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am subscribed to Office 365 and would like to install Office 2016 on my Mac. However, instead of full package, I would like to use only Excel, Word and Powerpoint. I have seen some deployment packages for Windows, and some methodologies for admins in organizations,
 which wouldn't work for me. Last resource I found had individual Office 2016 installation packages for Mac, like Excel, Powerpoint, etc. Shall I go ahead and install these packages together with Microsoft Autoupdate package? Would I be able to activate the
 Office installation with my 365 credentials?</p>
<p>

<p>Thx, so there are no workarounds on this? It is Office 365 Personal Edition, similar to Home I guess.</p>
<p>I see many threads around Office 365 subscriptions, getting 2016 version installation files and deploying in a custom way. I guess I would need to try these individual packages and see what happens. I really don't need Outlook, One Drive and components related
 to them.</p>

<p>It is possible to purchase perpetual licenses for individual products, but the price IMHO is too high - almost the same as the complete suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some features require each other's applications. For example, flag for followup in Word, Excel and PowerPoint requires Outlook. It's best to keep all components at the same update level, otherwise you're likely to get crashes.</p>

<h2>            EA to MPSA agreement</h2>
                    
<p>We recently moved to a new MPSA agreement and are trying to cancel the EA. Both subscriptions are E3 and when we look in the admin portal there doesn't appear to be any interaction required to move to the new agreement. Will we have to do anything to cancel
 the old EA or should it simply go away. Right now I appear to have double the number of licenses available.</p>

<p><span>Hello Noel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your post in Microsoft Community. Regarding your description about “Outlook 2016 Spell Check sometimes not working”, spell check is not
 dependent on email format HTML or RTF, we recommend you to check the below settings to verify Outlook 2016 Spell Check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Here is the steps to set Outlook to check spelling for you every time:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open your Outlook -&gt; Click File -&gt; Options -&gt; Mail-&gt; check the Always check spelling before sending box.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Screenshot for reference: </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d1815b8-9955-4cf3-b28b-8fc7754d200d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d1815b8-9955-4cf3-b28b-8fc7754d200d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Now when you click <strong>Send</strong>, Outlook checks spelling automatically. If there are no spelling mistakes, it sends the message right away. If you change your mind and want to edit the message some more, click
<strong>Cancel</strong> to stop the spell check, and then click <strong>No</strong>.)</p>
<p><span>You may refer this article for check spelling before sending a message:

 of your Outlook version?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">

<p>
</p><p>I am using Enlish UK (not US) which is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its very random, an email that the user will reply to just will not spell check but she will reply to another one and does it. She can then reply again to the initial message and it does spell check.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its outlook 2016 (latest version - 365). Have done a full repair and new profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just added English US (was suggested in another post although not sure how would make the difference) Enlish UK is the main language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its very random and only happens sometimes (but frequently enough to be noticed)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so i have done the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Rebuilt PC Profile</p>
<p>2. Uninstalled Office 365 (removed all traces of it)</p>
<p>3. Deleted Mail profile and renamed outlook folder in Appdata</p>
<p>4. Reinstalled Office 365</p>
<p>5. Added US as a language (As well as the default UK)</p>
<p>6. Ran sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this then happens smetimes, new email, spelling is enabled and checked in settings. Didnt automatically pick up the spelling error and when F7 to manually check says all is ok even though there is an error.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello Noel, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for reply, in signature section auto spelling check will not work, because that section is for signature only, so we would like to suggest you to check if the spelling check issue persist in email area or signature area?</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>To do so: right click on the wrong spelling (which was not automatically checked ) and check its options, if your wrong spelling is in the signature area, short signature tab will be open.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and regards,</span></p>

            You need to opt out of trial on your own. If you don't opt out, you will be charged and trial will become real MS Office. 
<br />
<br />1. Sign in to the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services</a> page with the Microsoft account associated with your Office 365 subscription
<br />
<br />2. Look for the Cancel link or Expires on date.
<br />
<br />If you see a Cancel link under the subscription name, select Cancel. You might be given the choice to get a refund for unused time. If you choose to get a refund, the subscription will go into View Only or reduced functionality mode immediately. Otherwise, you'll have access to your subscription until it expires.
<br />
<br />If you don't see an option to Cancel, you might have turned off automatic renewal and won't receive additional charges. You don't need to cancel. Your subscription will end on the Expires on date.
<br />
<br />If you don't see an option to Cancel, and you see Paid with and None, your subscription will end on the Expires on date. There's no need to cancel because you won't receive additional charges.
<br />
<br />You may receive a refund if you:
<br />
<br />Bought a yearly subscription within the last 30 days, OR.
<br />
<br />Bought a monthly subscription, and cancel within 30 days of your last renewal date.
