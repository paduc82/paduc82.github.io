<h2>            Can&#39;t print Windows 10 after new driver, hours on the phone, etc.</h2>
                    <p>Brand new Dell XPS computer with Windows 10. Been working on getting the printer up and running for over 2 hours with Brother support. It's a Brother&nbsp;MFC8810DW. We've reinstalled the driver (after removing it, unplugging cables, clearing print queue, clearing
 spooler, re-downloading it). Finally, Windows 10 recognizes the device, but I still can't print to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I print a Word doc, it sits in the queue. I decided to restart the computer, then it printed. I tried to print another Word doc and it's just sitting in the queue. When I attempt to print email, nothing&nbsp;goes into the queue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a computer for work and not being able to print is not acceptable to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Can&nbsp;I go back to Windows 7?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help. I had already tried all of these&nbsp;things while on the phone for hours&nbsp;with Brother, Dell and Costco Concierge Service and before I posted to this site. I even went out and bought a brand new printer from HP. I was told that HP spent
 a lot of money to make sure their printers work with Windows 10. I still couldn't get anything to print. The test print worked just fine. Nothing else did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending 3 days, I finally solved my problem. I returned everything, bought a Windows 7 computer and it all works beautifully. Please don't get rid of Windows 7.

            I have tried to download things such as a phone bill but when I go to downloads it&nbsp;will still not open, The message that comes up is class not registered and all it lets me do is click on the ok part of the message. My husband was able to download an amazon
 voucher he bought, is it because the computer is registered in his name? sorry i'm not really very up on the technical side as i'm sure you can tell!!!

            It could be problem with the program which tried to open the voucher, try right click on downloaded file and in Open with see what options are there, you might select Microsoft Edge or Adobe Reader and see whether it works.

    <title>Mouse not working with Windows 8.1 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidlustig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse not working with Windows 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>2 nights ago I updated from Windows 8 to 8.1 on my HP Phoenix Desktop.&nbsp; I found that my Bluetooth mouse was not working.&nbsp; I initially changed the batteries but that was not the problem.&nbsp; I did notice that when I moved the mouse or the scrollwheel, that the
 Bluetooth light on the USB adapter would light up indicating a connection being made, but any mouse movement just caused the cursor to drift off the screen to the bottom right until it would disappear.
</p>
<p>Device manager says the mouse is working properly. I tried uninstalling it, restarting Windows a few times.&nbsp; No better.</p>
<p>I got onto chat with HP support and they were no help, basically saying wait for a few weeks and hopefully a patch or new driver would be available to fix the problem.&nbsp; In the meantime the support person suggested just getting a wired mouse.</p>
<p>So I went out and bought a wired mouse and it turns out that does not work either!&nbsp; The behavior of the wired mouse is that if the cursor is visible on the screen, as soon as I move the mouse, the pointer simply disappears. So there is something happening
 when I move the mouse to indicate a connection to the computer, but it is totally non-functional.</p>
<p>I have tried various USB ports on both the front and rear of my computer as well.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have seen some similar posts regarding Bluetooth devices not working but this mouse issue seems to be more than just a Bluetooth issue since the wired mouse fails as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only functional pointing device on my computer right now is my Wacom Intuos 4 small tablet.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>any help appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>No solution here, just a word of warning: it may be USB port driver. You can look on HP site and see if they offer USB driver for your system. On my system I lost all USB ports after update. I have to reinstall Windows now. I strongly suggest- while your
 computer is up, back up everything, and may be even consider reverse to Win. 8. I attempted "Restore from last known well configuration"- it failed. I can not reverse my. I need to install driver for USB which is easy- uninstall in device manager and let Windows
 to install new one, but I would not mass with anything. Just saying- it may get worse. My computer worked fine for 24 hours and after I restarted- lost USB- all of them. Make sure you know your computer's name, username and password. I would also disable password
 log in. You may have to log in remotely IF your driver fails. It appears unstable.
</p>

<p>Here is my thread on Tom's about all the struggle- I will be updating it. <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1846503/computer-boot-windows-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Whichever mouse I plug in, doesn't work. Luckily, I have a Wacom tablet installed, so I can navigate. This is, as usual, being recognised as 4 mice. But the other mice I tried to use don't even appear on the device manager, though they are connected.&nbsp;
<div>So after all, Windows 8 has been working after going through a black screen nightmare, now I finally got the update to install after completing some repair procedures that windows couldn't complete by itself, and now I'm stuck with the next HUGE problem!
 and this site is a nightmare on a mobile device.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Installing the mouse fix didn't help a bit. Obviously, this forum doesn't either, so I'm curious what my next steps will have to encompass.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You're not alone. I (stupidly) updated to Win 8.1 - primarily to get rid of the MS nag screens that kept popping up. Now my MS Bluetooth 5000 mouse won't work. Using an HP Envy Laptop, fortunately it has a touch screen.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Gee - my Bluetooth mouse was just working hunky-dory until the Microsoft 8.1 update, therefore I do NOT think this is an "HP driver issue".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention: Windoze 8.1 update DELETES ALL of your restore files (very clever) and disables flash video DL software - which I paid for (thanks again Microsoft).
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not happy with MS.</p>
<p><br />

            as of December 15th still no fix for this issue?!!! this is ridiculous. I am having the same problem. Mouse does not work at all. I Bought a new one thinking my old mouse went bad or something, but that was not the case. I installed new drivers, tried
 different usb ports. All other devices including my wacom tablet work just fine. I want to be able to do some PC gaming and I can't. The mouse seems to snap to the windows button at the bottom left corner of my screen when I try to use it, buttons do not work
 either.<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!!!<br />

            Well...I have been having the same problem ever since I updated to Windows 8.1. I have been using a wireless mouse, but recently fixed the problem. Go to Search and type in "BIOS" then click enter. You will see something that says "Advanced Startup Options."
 Click on that. You will then see three options. Click on RESTART NOW under Advanced. And just go from there. But when you are restarting you have to log into your Microsoft account and eventually 2-3 options will appear that say "TroubleShoot" I would click
 that. Then I was able to use my mouse again! I am so happy that I can use it again!

            <p>Day before yesterday, windows updated itself to 8.1 update and now my Microsoft Wireless Laser 8000 Bluetooth mouse has ceased to function. The mouse flashed red and green when I try to reset the Bluetooth connectivity suggesting that its trying to find
 the receiver in my PC but no connectivity. I have turned the mouse and PC on and off restarted, changed batteries. No dice. Luckily I also use a Logitech trackpad that works through a unifying Dongle and have been OK.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how fix this Bluetooth problem would be welcome. I love Microsoft and their software, they should stay out the hardware business though.</p>

            <p>I, too, am having problems with my usb mouse. &nbsp;My external hard drive works wonderfully, but after I upgraded my usb mouse works sporadically... Very frustrating. &nbsp;I even went out and purchased a new mouse. &nbsp;It doesn't surprise me at all the Microsoft hasn't
 addressed this issue. &nbsp;Doesn't surprise me at all :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the device, but it still doesn't work... Wish Microsoft would fix these issues -- it appears each 'update' creates even more problems. &nbsp;</p>

            It's either says: Your drivers are O.K. or Installs the drivers<br />
The problem is: nothing changes - I keep loosing all the sound, so problem remains.<br />
I know I got W10 for free - but COME ON GUYS!<br />
Fixing drivers manually also keep me safe for max two days

<h2>            0x8020000f error on Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenevo Z500 laptop, There was no problem until build 14332 installed, right after installation windows update gives the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Upgrade to Windows 10 Insider Preview, version xxx, 14xxx - Error 0x8020000f</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Maybe It's good to tell that after this, When I tried to install Visual studio 2015 update 2, the installation ran into problem in a way that I couldn't run/modify/repair or even uninstall it. Even worse! I messed up with WSL (Bash
 on Ubuntu on Windows), So I deleted the lxss folder and disabled it &amp; enabled it again, but when I ran "bash", I faced with an error message with&nbsp;<span>0x8020000f&nbsp;</span>code.<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I already searched a lot and tried every solution I've found but no success. Now the problem is really a pain in the neck because this build expired 12 hours ago &amp; Now Win restarts suddenly every few hours.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Maybe the only solution is to reinstalling windows or resetting it, But actually I cant. The most important reason which avoid me of reinstall is that I have a password encrypted external HDD with auto unlock on this PC, Actually
 I forgot the password.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Now I'm unable to use my laptop because it restarts.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Thanks in advance<br />

<h2>            Immediately after &#34;Feaatures&#34; update, cannot access my Network Attached Storage Device &#40;NAS&#41; or Anything Else on My Home Network</h2>
                    <p>Really getting tired of this stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes before the update started automatically, I had access to my home network which included three computers, a printer, and a personal cloud (NAS) I use as a file server.&nbsp; It's as if I'm taking my car into a mechanic
 and it has all four tires on it, but when I go to pick it up it only has three and the mechanic says, "Musta been like that when you brought it in."&nbsp; Damn, since I replaced Win 7 with 10, I am spending more time trying to get things to work correctly than
 I am actually using the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after the update finished I went to my network entry point in File (PKA Windows) Explorer. There were no links available to the two other computers, the printer, or the NAS.&nbsp; I restored my system to via an restore point two days ago. The restore
 was successful, but whatever got changed by the update that caused the problem was not rolled back cause I still can't access my network. Tried troubleshooting - no luck. Tried some community suggestions, no luck. This problem was caused by the update. When
 I saw the update happening, I waited to use the computer because I wanted to do something on it, so as soon as I signed back in, I went to File Explorer to access my home network. Nothing happened in between the update and the sign in and navigation to File
 Explorer.&nbsp; Microsoft 10 screws something up every single time they put out an update, and I'm tired of it.&nbsp; I would like them to fix this issue expeditiously.</p>

<p>Hello Clyde,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us. Windows 10 may have encountered a network configuration issue that caused this. For us to help you with this concern, we suggest that you perform these steps to reset your network:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step #1</strong>: Windows 10 has a capability to setup a new network connection that makes your device connected online. There are two types of connection, static and dynamic. For best results, we recommend establishing an automatic IP address configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, you will need to enable the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to your computer. This protocol automatically assigns IP addresses that are unique from the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you need to make sure that you are not using a static IP address. Manual setting of IP address causes conflicts throughout the network.Visit this article: Establish Dynamic IP or DHCP:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15089/windows-change-tcp-ip-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Change TCP/IP settings</strong></a> to know how to enable or establish this type of connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step #2:</strong> Perform an Internet connection reset via Command Prompt. To reset your Internet connection, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> to open the Run window.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>cmd</strong>, then press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>On the Command Prompt window, type the following commands, then press <strong>
Enter </strong>after typing each commands below:<br />
<strong>netsh int ip reset resettcpip.txt </strong><br />
<strong>netsh winhttp reset proxy</strong><br />
<strong>netsh int ip reset</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /release</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /renew</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong><br />
<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong><br />
</li><li>Restart your PC to complete the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step #3:</strong> We also suggest that you restart both your "Network Attached Storage Device (NAS)" and computer. Wait for 15-30 seconds then turn it on again. Visit this link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Fix network connection issues in Windows 10</strong></a> for more troubleshooting alternatives for your Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step #4</strong>: Ping Microsoft server then tell us the result through a screenshot.<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the run window.<br />
2. Type <strong>cmd</strong>, then press Enter.<br />
3. On the Command Prompt window, type <strong>ping </strong><strong>www.microsoft.com</strong>, then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
• If you receive 4 replies, your connection with the site is working properly. <br />
• If you got a request time out, your Internet connection has issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step #5: </strong>Disable all other anti-virus programs and enable Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us with the results.</p>

<p><span>After considerable research I was able to find out what the problem is, as well as a work-around that solved the problem for me.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Apparently, many the interface between hardware and Win 10 requires something called SMB 1.0/CISF File Sharing Support. Unfortunately, that “feature” (requirement) has been deemed a security risk by Microsoft,
 consequently, updates to Windows 10, such a as the recent Features Update, delete the setting for that “feature”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I found a work-around, but if Microsoft is correct concerning the security risk, I can only hope it’s small. In the meantime, I have contacted the company that produced my NAS and asked them when they plan
 to upgrade the device with a patch to protect data stored therein. Here’s the work-around that put my NAS links back into File Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(32, 99, 62, 1)"><span>THE WORK-AROUND:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
IN THE WIN 10 SEARCH BOX NEXT TO THE START MENU WINDOWS ICON (BOTTOM LEFT OF SCREEN IN TASKBAR) TYPE:
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">WINDOWS FEATURES </span></strong></li><li>
WHEN THE WINDOWS FEATURES DIALOG POPS UP, SCROLL DOWN TO <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">SMB 1.0/CISF File Sharing Support</span></strong></li><li>
<strong>SELECT, THAT IS CHECK, ALL BOXES UNDER SMB 1</strong></li><li>
SELECT <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">OK</span></strong></li><li>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">SHUTDOWN</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">YOUR COMPUTER</span></strong></li><li>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">TURN IT BACK ON</span></strong></li><li>
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">AND NAVIGATE TO YOUR </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">NETWORK</span></strong></li><li>
 SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>PLEASE NOTE: I’M GUESSING YOU’LL HAVE TO DO THIS PROCEDURE EVERY TIME THERE’S AN UPDATE TO WINDOWS 10, AND IN THE NEXT WINDOWS RELEASE (11 OR WHATEVER) SMB 1.0
 MAY NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE, SO IF THIS WORKED FOR YOU, CONTACT YOUR HARDWARE’S MANUFACTURER AND FIND OUT IF THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS COMPATIBLE WITH SMB 2.0 AND HIGHER.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            Texas Instruments 64-bit SD&#47;MMC Card Reader on Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit not reading SD cards </h2>
                    
<p>Hi-</p>
<p>Texas Instruments 64-bit SD/MMC Card Reader on Win 7 Ultimate 64-bit not reading SD cards previously used on 32-bit Win 7. Won't reformat even</p>
<p>I was running Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit and my TI SD/MMC card-reader was working fine; I upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and managed to get hold of the correct 64-bit TI driver for the SD/MMC slot, but now my SD cards won't be read by it. It says it
 needs to reformat them, fair enough, but then fails to do so, bringing up the error that Windows was unable to complete the formatting. I've tried all kinds of ways... quick format, proper format, different formats etc. No go. Do I have to start over and just
 buy a new SD card?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick spec:</p>
<p>Sony Vaio VGN-NR280E</p>
<p>Intel ICH8/Mobile Intel Express 965 Chipset Family</p>
<p>4GB DDRII 667</p>
<p>200GB Fast SATA HDD</p>
<p>Core 2 Duo 1.7 GHz T5450</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you check for its functionality on a different computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Using the card with mobile will not affect its compatibility. We recommend you to check if it works fine on a different computer. If it fails to work, then you'll have to replace it or buy a new one.</div>

<p>ptolomy...I sure had to jump thru some hoops just to make a reply. I had to join and everything, even thou I did not want to. Any way.There are just sooo many people that seem to have this problem. Just do a google search and you will see a plethora of other
 people with this issue. Any way. I notice that the moderator keeps trying to put the blame squarely on the SD manufacturer. In reality I am having the same difficulty. The card worked until I upgraded to Windows 7 with 64 bit dual core. There are questions
 about it being the sliding "off and on" switch on the side of the SD or perhaps tapeing off the notch on the other side of the card. Apparently the camera/phone require it to be one way and the PC requires it to be another way. At least that is what they are
 trying to get you to believe. another theory, at least to me is that the newer system cannot read the lower capacity card. So a&nbsp;4 GB card might just do the trick.&nbsp; But like I said, I am having the same problem at this point. I do not want to buy anything else.
 I already have enough money invested in the junky new dual core PC and windows 7 system. I m going to try getting a card reader that plugs in the usb. It might work and it might not. Probably will just be more good money thrown away. Kind of makes me want
 to move to Mac.</p>

<p>No, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the card. I've tried two- the Kingston one and a Sandisk one - both 2GB SD- that work fine on other PCs. And worked fine on Win 7 x86. I will try uninstalling the TI x64 driver and reinstalling it, but if that doesn't
 do it (and I really doubt it will), then this is a bigger issue than we had thought, hmm? Another x64 problem.</p>
<p>@DR Dingus: I just today bought a MacBook Pro! Funny you should mention that... I still run Win 7 x64 thru Bootcamp though. Got no SD card slot anyway, so I'll be buying an external reader like you. But Whoever I sell me Sony VAIO to's gonna want a functional
 SD slot. If I don't write back soon it means the reinstallation&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;do the trick. I may try an SDHC... but don't need one. Be a good experiment though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ptolomy. I didn't buy the card reader after all. I remembered that my wife has a notebook that we almost never use. However it runs Windows XP. So I stuck my SD card in the slot and it read it right away. I downloaded the SD card to an external HD. Then
 connected the external HD to my Desktop. Now I have it.</p>
<p>Here is something to try. Ask around, I am sure that at least one of your friends is using a SDHC card and&nbsp;I will bet that your system will read it so borrow it for a test. Basically they should be the same type of card but the regular SD holds less information.
 Kind of like swapping out your DVD Burner/Player for the newest one. Put the drivers in and it runs great. But try and put the old player back in and the system suddenly won't work. So just because the PC won't read the older SD cards doesn't mean that it
 doesn't work. I just means that you (and I) were hornswaggled (is that one word or two) when we bought the newer better system and PC. Of course Microsoft will never take any blame here, and they will continue to try and steer you into believing that it must
 be your SD card since it couldn't possibly be their fault. Like I said in the beginning. Do a Google search and see how many other people are having the same problem. Could it just be one gigantic coincidence?</p>
<p>Let me know if you try a borrowed SDHC card and if&nbsp;it works where the SD card did not. After all this is so far only a theory.</p>

<p>I put&nbsp;the SD card into a notebook with win-XP not win7.&nbsp; Then I dL the info off of the card to the notebook which read the card. Plugged an external HD to the notebook (USB)&nbsp;then dl the info to the external HD. Then last but not least I connected (USB) my
 desktop PC with win 7 and 64bit dual core to the external HD. At this point I dl the infor to the main PC.</p>
<p>At no point did I get the SD card to read in the win7 with 64bit. I believe that if I had the more advanced SDHC then it could have read it. In the same aspect. the older systems may not work on the SDHC cards. Don't know on this one since I haven't invested
 in a SDHC card, at least not yet.</p>
<p>So you se it worked in a notebook with winxp not win7 with 64bit.</p>

            I had this issue with a SDHC card on XP x64, and now with Win 7 x64. <br />
Vista x86 had no problems with my card.<br />
It seems there is no support for them by any Windows x64 based system through a card reader.<br />
The only way I have ever found to get a SDHC card to be read is to leave it in the camera or what ever it goes in. Then plug that into the computer with a usb cable.<br />
Sad that I can run 8 Gbs of ram, 3 terabyte sata drives, a BD-Rom, 2-23" High def monitors, surround sound and more.<br />
But I'm still unable to read a stupid little SDHC card with out going through a $90 digital video camera.<br />

<h2>            Small crackling of my xbox slim</h2>
                    
<pre>Hello<br /><br />I just installed my xbox slim 250 GB and I do not know if it is defective or if the problem is me :)<br /><br />In fact, I play in a room quiet and close enough to my console.<br /><br />I noticed that when I neared my ear very close, I mean that the console is a slight sizzle/crackling. Hard disk, card grahique one fan ...<br /><br />Is it worth a return service? I did not want to return it, wasting my time to be told that there is nothing to fix ...<br /><br />If you move closer to the ear of your console, you also hear this little sizzle?<br />It is quiet but it is there ...<br /><br /><br />thank you</pre>

<p>It's a steady crackling?</p>
<p>You can hear some crackling noise when the console is heat, it's normal.</p>

<p>That is normal since consoles do generate a little bit of heat. If it is very hot then you must have played for a long time or left it on by mistake. So keep your console off for about a couple hours and it should cool off. Plus, I &nbsp;think you can't &nbsp;get
 any system error or problems if your console is hot.</p>

<p>Thank you for the answers!</p>
<p>I know that consoles now produce more heat and should therefore cool where fan noise.</p>
<p>But my problem is the little sizzle when I approach the console ...</p>
<p>It is discreet but present</p>
<p>But this is not permanent</p>
<p>Also, the DVD player, I know he made ​​a lot of noise, but besides that, I hear little noises as if the dvd is touching the dvd tray.</p>
<p>Or is it when the playhead position must change.</p>
<p>I dont talk about level of sound , I know that a console can make a lot of noise but with your xbox slim the sound is always clear? Not little weird and strange noises of all kinds sometimes?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi. If you are hearing "slight sizzle/crackling" you should unplug it and call support A.S.A.P.. It could have internal damage and be a possible fire hazard. 1-800-4MY-XBOX is the support number (In the United States at least.)</p>
<p>[quote]Is it worth a return service?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes. Sizzling and crackling is not normal for anything electronic; unless you are cooking bacon on a electronic griddle. ;-)</p>
<p>Give support a call and see what they have to say at least.</p>
<p>&gt;</p>

<p>Ok I will keep looking up answers about the small crackling and it is normal for the DVD player since the disc spins while it is in there. Also, the console reads the disc so that is why it may make a noise.</p>

            <div>Hi Scott ,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to the Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Have you installed all the pending updates and driver updates on your system?&nbsp;<br />
2. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?&nbsp;<br />
3. Have you made any changes to your system, prior to this issue?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the&nbsp;PC to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let’s try to follow these methods below, to resolve the issue: </div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Please follow these steps below to resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check, if the issue occurs. If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode, I suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check, if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to refer the article and check, if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode).</strong></div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode, perform a clean boot and check. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows. </strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If the above method doesn’t fix the issue perform Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
&nbsp;
<div>
<p><strong>Disable third party antivirus software:</strong><br />
<br />
Disable third party antivirus software temporarily and check if it helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<div>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>

<h2>            XBOX 360 S apresentando luz vermelha ao iniciar</h2>
                    
<p>Senhores boa noite,</p>

<p>Comprei um XBOX 360 S 260Gb (seminovo) e vinha funcionando bem, até que *** quando fui ligar, ele começa iniciando o XBOX e de repente a luz vermelha aparece no botão de START e simplesmente desativa o XBOX. Na yv não aparece nenhuma mensagem. Pensei ser
 algo de super aquecimento, deixei mais ou menos 1 hora desconectado (desconectei tudo) e quando ligo, ele inicia normalmente, ativa tudo do XBOX, mas de repente a luz vermelha aparece novamente e para tudo, sem mensagem nenhuma na TV. O que me dizem? Alguém
 tem uma idéia do que possa ser?</p>

<p>Cara, esse tipo de coisa parece que tem acontecido com frequência com algumas pessoas. Vou dar uma dica que eu não garanto que vai resolver, mas se for o mesmo que aconteceu comigo uma vez, resolve. As vezes essa luz vermelha (se for no centro do botão power)
 é erro de hardware. Tente fazer limpeza de cache no seu HD pelo menos umas 3 vezes seguidas depois tente ligar de novo. Se caso não ajudar, tente tirar o HD enquanto seu 360 está desligado, conecte de novo e depois ligue-o novamente. No meu caso, foi erro
 de hardware e só a limpeza de cache resolveu e já tem mais de um ano e nunca mais voltou. Se nenhuma dessas duas opções resolver seu problema eu não sei como ajudar. Mas tente o que eu falei. Abs.</p>

<p>CrisDgs7, &nbsp;obrigado pela resposta.</p>
<p>A luz vermelha é exatamente a do centro do botão POWER. Vou fazer o que disseste.</p>
<p>Quanto aos demais que me disseram pra procurar quem me vendeu, é complicado fazer isso porque ele também não é expert em XBOX pra me dar uma solução, mas obrigado mesmo assim.</p>

<p>BedsideRapier19 A limpeza de cache é quando o Xbox está ligado rsrsrs. Não me lembro de cór exatamente, mas é em Configurações do console - Armazenamento - Selecione o HD e aperte o Y, depois escolha limpeza de cache.

<h2>            Alienware 17r3 Laptop has errors so I can&#39;t troubleshoot, or update&#47;use Java. &#40;0x80070005&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Hello, I was on my Alienware 17r3 Laptop today and everything was normal 2 days ago, but when I logged on today I noticed I wasn't able to open discord or a few games. I have tried fixing this problem for several hours looking at other online forums with the
 problem to no avail. I have a few programs that I tried to use for troubleshooting:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
One that I attempted was called "MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta" had an error,&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/98d007cd0d3044747dac1250482b7102</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I had another troubleshooting program with an error,&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/5575a3db27812fff7b5eaea9b4a80c27</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
and the Java Error when I tried installing it, (already had on the system but when I tried updating it it wouldn't work, and things with Java I can't open. Problem started just today):&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/56b2f146b5717f3b58c3e956c2e70c6a</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
When I tried a suggestion that said to use cmd and do: "sfc /scannow" It said, "<span>You must be an administrator running
 a console session in order to&nbsp;</span><span>use the sfc utility."</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>I am on the administrator account right now. I always use the admin account, I have no other accounts on this laptop.
<span>I am on the administrator account right now. I always use the admin account, I have no other accounts on this laptop.
 This is a problem that just started today, I didn't meddle with anything to my knowledge unless I might have accidentally changed something by randomly pushing stuff? (I didn't see anything change.)</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I went to windows defender and tried to perform a "Fresh Start" (under device performance &amp; health) but it said there was a problem and didn't work.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I checked my pathfiles and they all say C:\WINDOWS\TEMP for administrator and normal users, for temp and tmp (I changed the administrators to that, and it didn't do anything).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If you have know what my problem is please let me know, I have tried for several hours. I have very little to no computing knowledge at all, so for instructions please give me baby steps. I would really appreciate your help and will respond with whether or
 not the changes have worked or that I have done your steps and what happens. Thank you so much and I hope we can fix this.</p>

<div>Hello, thank you so very much for your reply and time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am currently running Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.590)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did your following steps and here is what happened. CMD found that there was no component store corruption detected on the first line. On the second and third lines, it took a while and said that the specified buffer contains ill-informed data: https://gyazo.com/92700e946d215a86e804f5dfa7e1b863
 I made a dropbox link for the DISM log file if you need it, I made a mistake when running the CMDs the first time and redid it, I am not sure if it will show the mistakes (I kinda spammed the 2nd command after I was confused why it wasn't working) so I hope
 it isn't too much of a hassle: https://www.dropbox.com/s/83uhvkzjvga6g32/dism.log?dl=0</div>
<div>When I did the the sfc/scannow it said: "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation." After it reached Verification 60% complete.</div>
<div>I restarted my laptop and typed in the chkdsk /r /f line, the output was: "The type of the file system is NTFS.</div>
<div>Cannot lock current drive.</div>
<div>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another</div>
<div>process.&nbsp; Would you like to schedule this volume to be</div>
<div>checked the next time the system restarts?" I typed "Y" restarting laptop again.</div>
<div>I finished the Driver Repair but it never fixed any of the problems. All of the installations failed and I couldn't use java still. I want to hold off on the repair upgrade unless that is the last option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let me know if you have any suggestions, thanks!</div>
<div>I will do the repair upgrade if that is what I should do next.</div>

<p>I tried the Repair Upgrade using the link you sent me and tried to download both the "Windows 10 October 2018 Update" which was on the top page, and the Windows 10 Installation Media as I wasn't sure which one was the iso. When I opened the Windows 10 October
 2018 Update one and tried to download it, I got an error code:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://gyazo.com/b64b1e88008d6b43b8d37961157b4ed3</p>
<p>When I tried the Installation Media, the setup said "Making sure you're ready to Install" and while I was waiting the setup closed out. I tried doing the Installation Media again and it closed out on its own at the same part. I checked the show hidden icons
 thing and I didn't see it there either. I am unsure where to proceed and after restarting the computer nothing has changed. The problems still occur. Please let me know what to do, thank you! (I need to get this problem fixed by the 15th if at all possible,
 I will try to reply as fast as possible but I am okay with deleting everything I have, I just need this fixed asap).</p>

<p>When I double clicked the ISO it opened the ISO viewer (Power2Go CyberLink ISO Viewer) after doing all that stuff and I double clicked the setup this popped up, https://gyazo.com/c43ed93ba1bbdc9c488e9288e6b558df</p>
<p>I tried mounting it as a virtual drive and was able to successfully open it. however when I tried to install the setup it gets stuck on "Making sure you're ready to install" and the tab closes out. What should I do?</p>

            After the setup I see the same files in a new DVD drive and CD drive. I tried installing the setup on both of them using file explorer and it still would freeze and immediately the dialog would close out. I know the ISO file is right because I did the
 tutorial online in which you went through Media Creation Tool as you said, and after that didn't work I also looked at another tutorial where someone used developer tools to make the page download the windows iso specifically. That didn't help either. Still
 stuck on the same freezing/immediately closing problem only on that page.

<p>Now, my surface book 2 is the attached status(view mode). But the icon is display detacted mode. The battery icon just display one battery status and always plugs in but I didn't plug in the cable. SO the problem is I can not detached the monitor .</p>

<p>Go to search and type services.</p>
<p>Open the services app.</p>
<p>Look for Surface DTX Service.</p>
<p>Click on restart.</p>

<h2>            Are registry cleaners useful or are they that bad in Vista&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The thought&nbsp;of having anything useless stuck in registry&nbsp;makes me uncomfy. I feel I MUST unburden....like "spring cleaning" annual rite&nbsp; Hence, the consideration of occassional reg cleaner as part of maintenance...together with more regularly done sfc /scannow,
 diskcheck for errors, disk and reg defrags and daily temp files deletion.<br />
<br />
The web is rife with logs from many forums, authored by&nbsp;highly decorated&nbsp;geeks, strongly against reg cleaner usage, including and especially our own MSN Live One Care Scanner(is it really that bad?).<br />
<br />
OK..., what's your take on&nbsp;registry cleaners?</p>

            never use them! Windows doesn't load the whole registry any longer (starting with XP), so the registry can be 100MB or 1GB, it doesn't matter, the PC will have the same speed.<br />

<h2>            Surface UEFI loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had face problems from the 1 month of purchase, even got the laptop replaced after humongous efforts. Now exactly 1 month over the warranty period, the surface doesn't get out of the UEFI loop. Tried all possible solutions, it reboots and again shows the
 same UEFI boot screen. It has been a pain since then to reach for support services. Looking forward for a solution. Least to expect a local support partner for Surface in Mumbai (India).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a crap system and would strongly recommend not to buy this product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Amit,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate your response. We know how important it is for you to use the Surface. We would like to know more about the issue, by answering these following questions:<br />
<br />
• Can you tell us when the issue started?<br />
• Were there any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
• Can you see if there's an icon that appears in the top right corner of the UEFI settings?<br />
<br />
To solve this issue, we suggest that you force the device to shut down and restart. To do this, press and hold down the power button until your Surface restarts and you see the Windows logo screen (this will take about 20 seconds), then release the power button.<br />
<em>*Performing a Forced Shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets the hardware and clears all the cache and memory for your hardware.*</em><br />
<br />
In case that the device is on <em><strong>"Preparing Automatic Repair"</strong></em> phase after the force shutdown/restart, kindly wait for it. Then on
<em><strong>"Automatic Repair"</strong></em> screen, click or press <strong>'Advance options'</strong> button. On the next screen, select
<strong>'Troubleshoot'</strong> &gt; <strong>Advance options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> &gt; click
<strong>Restart</strong>. After the restart, <strong>Startup Settings</strong> will appear again then select
<strong>5</strong> to boot into <strong>"Safe Mode with Networking"</strong> (or press
<strong>F5</strong>).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once in Safe Mode, use the <strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. You can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>to get started. If the SFC tool did not detect any differences, we recommend that you perform a clean boot as well. Check the link
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to know more. Since the Surface is in
<strong>"Safe Mode with Networking"</strong>, you might as well update it.<br />
<br />
If you see a <em><strong>"Choose an option"</strong></em> screen, select <strong>
'Troubleshoot'</strong> &gt; <strong>Advance options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> &gt; click
<strong>Restart</strong>. After the restart, <strong>Startup Settings</strong> will appear again then select
<strong>5</strong> to boot into <strong>"Safe Mode with Networking"</strong> (or press
<strong>F5</strong>). In Safe Mode, scan the device using the SFC then perform a clean boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep us updated on the outcome.</p>

            Skype does not support receiving of SMS. You can send one, however you cannot receive one on Skype. In addition to that, the main purpose of a Skype Number is to receive incoming calls from mobile and/or landline numbers. For more information, please refer to these FAQ's:

<br />    What are the different types of Skype subscriptions and pay-as-you-go options?

                    The Error message I keep getting&nbsp;ID is, &nbsp;I think, the reason why &nbsp;I also get the warning that D/Drive (an SDHD Card 32Gig needs to be scanned for errors.

            Thanks for getting back to me. Yes, I had to do a Restore as, the computer was "messed up" and, it seemed to be the logical thing to do, taking back to the Windows 10 first time I upgraded (from Windows 8(.1)? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for Downloading
 anything, only the regular Windows Updates. &nbsp;How did I get this far? &nbsp;When the SDHD card was &nbsp;scanned, the dialogue box asked if I wanted to view the Events, even tho' it said it had found no errors. &nbsp;So, I clicked the box, and was taken to the Event Viewer.
 There I saw the 2 "things" that appeared as a result of the scan. If my memory serves me well,&nbsp;one event was " Event &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kernel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PnP &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 400 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Task &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;None. The same for the one below except&nbsp;for it being &nbsp;"430".

            <p>Hello Guru, thank for for your response. As per may original message I have run check disk. No errors have been found. I say "have been" found because I have to run check disk on the D drive each time i reboot my machine. Once checkdisk is completed I then
 have access to the drive.</p>
<p>

<strong><span>Reboot </span></strong><span>the system and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
