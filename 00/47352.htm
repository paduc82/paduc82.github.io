            <p>Not sure if you found an answer to your question.&nbsp; I just picked up a Surface Book yesterday and have started surfing the web looking for a car adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Book power connector is compatible with the Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; There are numerous adapters available for the Pro 3.&nbsp; Mostly it look like sellers haven't updated their descriptions to include the newer Pro 4 and Book.&nbsp; However I did
 find one seller who did include Pro 3, Pro 4, and Book in his description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pro 3 doesn't need a big of a power supply as the Book.&nbsp; I haven't looked up the specs on the Pro 4 to know whether its power needs are more like the Pro 3 or the Book.&nbsp; When it comes to a power adapter, what this really means is a Pro 3 adapter "might"
 not supply enough power to, for example, both run the Book and charge its battery at the same time.&nbsp; Plus charging the batter even with the Book off&nbsp;might take a little longer.&nbsp; On the other hand, car adapters are MUCH simpler than AC wall power supplies and
 are MUCH more likely to not care about the supplying the extra power -- although it's no guarantee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've been doing is looking at Pro 3 car adapters, then reading customers comments to see if anyone has used it with the Book.&nbsp; I found one adapter where a custom was talking about having success using it with the Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have this adapter in my shopping at Amazon, but I haven't actually ordered it yet:</p>

            <p>What about just getting an inverter for the car, then using your wall AC power brick with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I would trust a car charger for the Surface Book. You'll get "cleaner" power to the Surface Book using your power brick (because it has a built in capacitor).&nbsp; Car chargers tend to have spike's and fluctuations from the car alternator which
 can damage a laptop/tablet.</p>

            I used to do that 10 years ago with power hungry notebooks.&nbsp; It's not necessary in this day and age.&nbsp; I have a car adapter for my Pro 2 that's worked fine.&nbsp; People have been using these adapters with their Pro 3's just fine, and there are now comments
 from people who have used them with their Pro 4 just fine.&nbsp; I just leave the car adapter cable in the storage compartment in the center console of my vehicle since that's 95% of the time where I need it.&nbsp; If I'm traveling without my vehicle (flying then renting),
 then I just bring it along.

            I live in a 100% solar home with 12 and 24VDC available everywhere. So some kind of DC charger is my main power source for computers.
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Says:<br />
Surface Book 1706&nbsp; power adapter&nbsp; (100-240V@1.6A; 15V@4A, 5V@1A, 72.52WH, 0.14WH)<br />
I suspect the 5V rating is for the built-in USB jack, which I don't need. <br />
<br />
Looks like all the car chargers available on the web supply 12V, and the highest capacity I've seen is 48W instead of 60W. Since this is my main charger, I don't want a wimpy one! The AC charger at 60W already takes hours to fill the batteries. And I have the
 i7 with the graphics chip... &nbsp;<br />
<br />
http://www.mikegyver.com/blog/index.php?id=7710481069432222713# sells separate "fin" cables that I could put my special DC plug on...&nbsp; Depending on the system charge state I'd get 12.5V to 14.5V with as much current as my fuse allows. Or I could get a 15V DC-DC
 converter and have a solid, cleaner 15V at any time of day or night. <br />
<br />
But the cables are not cheap - apparently they are cutting them off of official Microsoft AC adapters. (They say the Asian clones are junk.)<br />
<br />
Since Microsoft clearly says 15V, why does everyone seem to sell only 12V chargers? Were the early non-fin connector Surface models 12V only? There is a lot of obviously shaky opinion out there...&nbsp; I'm guessing they were, but it looks like the new fin connectors
 can all handle 15V. And I just saw one guy say he's using a 19V charger - maybe my existing 19V Lind would work...&nbsp; But that is not something I want to try without knowing what input circuitry is inside the Surface Book!
<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen a 15V, 60W DC charger anywhere? <br />
<br />
As for an inverter in the car, I do have one, and it has never been a problem. (At least since the first one, that erupted in smoke, was replaced...) But if you're worried about "nasty" power, the little cheap ones make far nastier power than a DC car charger
 supplies. Hopefully your AC-to-DC adapter can filter the noise out. Some $100 models claim "pure sine wave", but I'd guess at least $200 to get clean, solid, accurate sine wave AC in the car. Of course then you can use your real 15V 60W charger!

            <p>While waiting for a properly aesthetic solution, I've tried one of the eBay cables. Seems to be working, at the moment...&nbsp; But I have a question, and some clues to share.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting the official AC charger triggers no sound or screen action. <br />
Clicking the Battery tray icon with batteries full shows constant "100% and fully charged" for both batteries.
<br />
Disconnecting the charger shows "Battery 1: 100% and in use", "Battery 2: 100% and fully charged".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question - is this normal for 12V chargers:</p>
<p>Connecting the DC cable sometimes plays the "New hardware" (?) sound, and sometimes changes the Battery 1 message to "Not available" for a few seconds.
<br />
Clicking the Battery tray icon with batteries full shows "100% and in use" alternating every one to five seconds with "100% and fully charged", for both batteries. Timing is independent and variable for each message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm suspecting that providing only 12V instead of 15V is keeping the system right on the edge between thinking the input power is sufficient and thinking it might need to use some battery power...&nbsp; Does anyone else see this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now that I can measure it, my Surface i7 with graphics chip seems to idle at about 650 mA (at ~12.4VDC input). Moderate CPU activity (~30%) spikes current to ~1600 mA.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Connector Pinout:<br />
<br />
Viewed with fin protruding toward you, cable extending toward the bottom of the page.
<br />
<br />
Original factory charger is Microsoft Surface Book 1706&nbsp; power adapter&nbsp; (100-240V@1.6A; 15V@4A, 5V@1A, 72.52WH, 0.14WH)<br />
<br />
Aftermarket cable is Dumvoin CTW094, commonly available on eBay, with a 2.1 x 5.5 mm "center+" concentric DC plug on the other end. Seems decently molded and fits nicely in the Surface Book. It includes an LED, which is always on when DC is available, even
 if it is not plugged into the computer. The LED lights up a diffuse strip of the outer edge of the plug, as opposed to the original tiny dot on the front and back.
<br />
<br />
Original measurements are voltage relative to the USB -/neutral pin on the charger. (Fluke 87 ohms scale found no connection between USB -/neutral and any fin contact.) Recorded values are from the DC Volt scale with the charger powered. "5-10V" values were
 recorded (100ms min/max) as minimum 4.5V, maximum 10.2V, with a constant rapid pulsation. The single "-0.03V" reading was solidly repeatable and not present on the opposite mirror image pin. All other pins were below 10 mV.
<br />
<br />
Aftermarket measurements are Ohms scale connectivity between fin contacts and the center socket or outer sleeve of the 2.1 x 5.5 mm DC plug.

<p>How has your experience been since December 2015 with the 12v cable.</p>
<p>Is your Surface still working?</p>

            <p>cristee48,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My direct wire to 12V cable is still working fine. Because mine is a Surface Book and would rather have 15V, it remains stuck in the disgusting battery state where taskbar previews close themselves almost instantly. With 15V it eventually gets to a stable
 full charge, and the previews last long enough to be useful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your eBay charger would be pretty wimpy for a Surface Book, both the 12V and the 2.85A are below spec. But it would probably keep you running for a few hours. And it only costs a bit more than my raw cable...&nbsp;

            Seems the "Anniversary Update" has made my Surface Book i7 much less happy with 12V power input. Since the update I often find it has decided external power is not available, and is running down its batteries even with the cord connected. Unplugging the
 cable and re-connecting it restores charging, for awhile. It also more often shows the headline "Not charging" while one of the batteries in the same popup window claims to be charging.<br />
<br />
<br />
They also did not fix the taskbar previews closing themselves almost instantly. And they took away the indication of Wi-Fi signal strength from the tray icon. Not progress...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, looks like posting here via Firefox is broken again. Disgusting.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Try this:</p>
<p>Remove the hard drive</p>
<p>With the hard drive removed boot the computer and enter BIOS</p>
<p>Find your Sata Operation setting and ensure it is set to ATA</p>
<p>Put your boot order back the way it was, save and shutdown.</p>
<p>Reinstall the hard drive and boot, at the BIOS screen spam F12 until the boot select screen shows up.</p>
<p>Select the CD-Drive and continue with the install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<div>Surface has Windows 8.1</div>
<div>PC has Windows 10 </div>
<div>Both have latest updates.</div>
<div>It was after the last large 10 update that the trouble started.
<div>At first the units couldn’t see each other. I used the troubleshooting tools, updated a driver, and now&nbsp;sometimes the see each other. Even when they see each other I’m told they can’t access because they don’t have permission. But
 they do!</div>
<div>Thank you for your response. I am disabled and rely heavily on my Surface link to the PC. I use it for everything.

<h2>            Windows 10 Focus Still broken aka bring forward</h2>
                    <p>After the creator's update I'm having problems bringing windows back into focus or the foreground to use them. Whether I'm opening or refocusing from the taskbar or when the current window is smaller and I can see/click the window in the background it will
 not come to the front. If I resize a window small to observe the behavior, for example writing this question, I click Adobe Reader or Excel on my taskbar and I can see it open behind this browser window. Clicking on the edge or any visible part does not bring
 that window into focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use that window I would have to minimize this browser window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this questions asked many times and often the advisor seems confused. I've tried everything except reinstalling windows 10 which I am not very happy to do.&nbsp; This is so incredibly unproductive, both the continual minimizing and resizing of windows
 AND trying to find a fix for it. It didn't do that before the Creator's update.</p>
<p>

            Hi Kelley.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if these help:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/bring-misplaced-off-screen-windows-back-to-your-desktop-keyboard-trick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/bring-m...</a>

<br />
<br />  System Restore likely wouldn't apply since it started with the Fall Creators Update Version 1709, correct?  At least having that information is important though, because if nothing else works you can probably go back to the older version to get it functioning correctly again, wait for the buggy Fall Creators Update Version 1709 to mature.  
<br />
<br />But first go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If there is any systemic problem this will  find and fix it, also optimizing your system in the process.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can roll back Fall Creators Version 1709 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it's too late to roll back there is older version media here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a> so if necessary you can Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I tried all these and after uninstalling the current display adapter and restarting the focus problem seems to have been corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem is using 2 monitors, the #1 monitor is displaying everything smaller than the #2 monitor. If I drag the window to the #2 about halfway there it displays normal size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't work like this. Will look at the next suggestions from Greg.</p>

<br />Press Windows key + i
<br />Open Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates

<p>Yes I've checked for driver updates and they are all updated. I've done that several times because the Creators update also screwed up the sound card.</p>
<p>

<h2>            xbox one s바닥에 고무패킹을 잃어버렸는데 따로 구입할 수 있는 방법 없습니까&#63;</h2>
                    <p>진짜 마이크로소프트와 연락하기 힘드네요.</p>
<p>한국에서는 서비스센터전화번호를 찾기도힘들어 전화하면 해결할 수 없다라는 말밖에 없고,</p>
<p>다른곳으로 전화하면 영어아니면 대응을 안해주네요. 한국에서 사업을 하는데 왜 한국어를 사용하면 안되고 이런식으로 써비스하는거죠?</p>
<p>그리고 진짜 막말로 막나가네요 진짜.</p>
<p>서론이 길었고 본론을 말하자면 xbox one s바닥에 고무패킹하나를 잃어버렸는데 씨디를넣고 오랜시간 게임을하다보면 이 없는부분이 진동에의해 바닥을 때리면서 소리가 크게나 망가질까봐 지금 사용못하고 있습니다. 이 패킹하나 그냥 달라는것도 아니고 사겠다는데 이부분만은 줄수도 없고 팔지도 않으니 하부를 번체 교환받아야한다고만하고 안된다고만하네요. 하드웨어에 문제가 있는것도아닌데 돈쓰라고만하는 마이크로소프트 정상적인건가요?</p>
<p>정말 해결책이없나요? 아니면 한국이라서 이런식으로 경영하는건가요?</p>
<p>매우 불쾌하고 기분나쁘네요. 그냥 원하는건하나예요. 고무패킹 살수있게해줘요. 망가지지도않은 본체 수리하라고하지말고</p>
<p>3시간동안 직접 연락할곳을 찻을수가없어 커뮤니티에 글을 올려야한다게 존나 어이없고 웃긴일이네요.</p>
<p>참 대단합니다.</p>

<h2>            split&#47;second</h2>
                    <p>Hey I'm not sure if this is a problem for more people but I tried to download split/second which is free with games with gold this February (1- 15th) but I noticed that when I try to download it either on my xbox one or xbox 360 it says it's not free. On PC it says it's free but nothing happens when you click on the download button.</p>

<h2>            Mortal Kombat Legacy</h2>
                    
<p>For those of you that don't know, there's a web series churning out episodes weekly on the beginning of Mortal Kombat. Basically, it's a fan-made take on it. Personally, I love it, and would love to see a movie by these people.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'll be updating this thread weekly</span> with each episode, when possible. I just want to spread the word and show the work these people are putting into this. I find it very entertaining.</p>

<p>Hopefully with this series and the success of the new game we'll see a new movie. As long as they push it more for mature audiences like the game is supposed to be, I'll cough up some cash to go see it.

<p>I think I like how the series takes aspects from multiple films/genres. Every episode takes a different approach, from the action movie openers, to the kill bill like episodes of 4 and 5, the realism in 3, and the dark suspense of this new Raiden episode.
 Kind of makes it more interesting each week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have many mixed opinions, I'll wait till the series is over.</p>

<p>Raiden's episode is my favorite but I didn't think episode 4 was bad. Again I think Cage's episode was so lame. He didn't even look interesting or believable. Can't wait for next week though.</p>

<h2>            Unable to test sounds in sound scheme settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 recently, and i can customize just about everything, however i cannot customize the sounds. I went to change the sound schemes and chose a .wav, but when i clicked "test", nothing happened. so i went to the default theme, clicked
 "test", still doesn't play. I went to browse and i found that the sounds in the windows default, are the ones from windows 8 before, but the notification it plays now, whenever i disconnect or connect a usb,a different sound plays instead of the one select
 in the default scheme.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>

                    I am installing windows 7 64 bit on to my newly built system. The motherboard is Intel dx79sr. When I first run it and select the laguage then click install, a box pops up and tells me"A required CD/DVD is missing." so I click browse then openthe driver
 that is "Intel(R) C6000 Series Chipset SATA RAID Controller" and click next. After waiting a near 10 seconds a new box pops up and says "No new devices could be found. Make sure the driver files are correct and located on the driver installation media." How
 do I fix this problem so i can install Windows 7? Thanks ahead of time.

            <p>&nbsp;The driver for the DVD/CD drive is different from the Intel(R) C6000 Series Chipset SATA RAID Controller.&nbsp; What brand DVD/CD drive do you have, and is it SATA?&nbsp; I use LG SATA drives that I buy for around $20 and haven't had any problems.&nbsp; So you could get
 one of the LG drives (I'm sure there're other brands that're just as good).&nbsp; Two alternatives are (1) Invest $30 in an external DVD drive that you can plug into a USB port, or (2) make a bootable flash drive with the Windows install files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Then you should be able to ignore the message until you get the full Windows 7 up and running with an Internet connection.&nbsp; At that point you should be able to download the driver for the DVD/CD ROM drive that you need.</p>

            I am also having the same problem. I have a DX79SR motherboard. I had considered that it might be asking for the CD/DVD driver and since my old computer is running I downloaded the driver and attempted to use it, nothing. After careful reading and asking
 a few questions from Intel I have decided what it actually wants is the driver for the Rapid Storage Technology. Apparently there are two ways to do it and I am going to try them tommorow morning. I will report back with the results and maybe it will work.
 You can go to Intel's site and read about it. It offers the drivers as a zip file which you open then copy to your thumbdrive. They don't make it sooo clear which driver and how to apply them but I planned for a couple of hours to figure it out. LOL!

<h3> bonecheck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Killing the Hellkite Dragon</h2>
                    
<p><span>Firstly you will need 16 Strength and 10 Dexterity, the short bow (bought from merchant in Undead</span></p>
<p><span>Burg) and around 35-45 arrows to obtain the Drake sword and kill this beast. Once you have made</span></p>
<p><span>it to the half way stairs on the Upper Section of&nbsp; the Undead Burg bridge head down and knock the</span></p>
<p><span>stairs down to the bonfire shortcut. Then head to the underside of the bridge and shoot the dragons</span></p>
<p><span><span>tail until you get the drake sword</span>. You should now have the Sword and you bow equipped. Now head</span></p>
<p><span>back up the stairs to the bridge BUT DO NOT STEP ONTO THE MAIN BRIDGE PATH just stay at the</span></p>
<p><span>top of the stairs whip out your bow and shoot the dragon in the face. As he jumps down onto the bridge</span></p>
<p><span>infront of you equip your newly acquired Drake sword (one handed) and hit him once in the face again</span></p>
<p><span>with the strong attack dealing roughly 180-195HP. Now make a swift exit down to the bottom of the stairs</span></p>
<p><span>(so that if he breaths fire it wont hit you, rolling down also helps). After he finished stropping around like a</span></p>
<p><span>little beech for a while he will fly back up to his perch and you can now rinse and repeat this method (relatively</span></p>
<p><span>quickly) so he has no time to heal until your 10,000 souls better off!</span></p>

<p>Or, you can go under the bridge where he is, past the rats and up the tower with the Black Knight, kill him and you can see the dragon, take aim and fire an arrow, if it htis the dragon it will drop through the bridge and die, one arrow, 10k souls!</p>

<h3> andrew_creighton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 SP1 Infinite Reboot Loop After Windows Update - 0 Bytes RegBack</h2>
                    <p>When I boot windows it says "Configuring windows for updates" or something similar to that. It then completes what it does, says "shutting down", boots to the same "configuring windows for updates" shuts down and repeats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently ran DBAN to wipe the os on a friend's laptop. I then installed and activated Win 7 Pro. The windows updater would hang, so I followed someone's advice from stackechange and downloaded&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB3138612-x64.msu and&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB947821-v34-x64.msu.
 I ran both while offline,&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB3138612-x64.msu first and then&nbsp;Windows6.1-KB947821-v34-x64.msu. The automatic updater still would hang but updates began to download. After rebooting the aforementioned problem began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to follow <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/139576-startup-repair-infinite-loop-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these steps</a> to repair the problem but RegBack says that it has 0 bytes and the steps didn't tell how to deal with that problem but specified that the steps would no longer help if RegBack had 0 bytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need the windows updates? Can I install them manually? If I install them manually will it fix the problem after another fresh install?<br />
<br />
Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Issue was solved when I didn't delete the reserved files partition during the fresh install</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The possible cause why you are getting the error message is that&nbsp; there is a c<span>orruption in your Windows Live Calendar folder in Windows Live&nbsp;Mail. To resolve the issue, please r<span>ename your Calendar folder using the steps below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Close Mail and any other Windows Live programs</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Click Start (then Run for Windows XP), paste the following path and press Enter</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>%Localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars</span></b></p>
</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Rename the folder of the account you use to sign in to Windows Live Mail to sync your calendar (ex. rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Restart your computer for changes to take effect.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Launch Mail again.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above troubleshooting step resolve the issue, it could be a contacts cache issue where Mail can't pull cache.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps outlined on the links below on how to clear contacts cache:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has the location of my home address incorrect</h2>
                    Every mapping app, Map app in windows 10, Bing Maps, Google maps, Map Quest, all show the location of my residence anywhere from 1000 feet up to a mile away from it is actually located. also, all theses apps name the streets incorrectly. This issue really
 becomes a problem when someone is attempting to come to your residence using any of these mapping apps, they find themselves basically lost.

            Please report the issue on the Bing Maps website so it can be corrected for Windows Maps and Bing Maps. You'll have to report it to other mapping providers for them to fix it there.

<p>
</p><p>When trying to print an email using the "actions" button in top right of the email, the print box is so low down on the screen that you cannot click on the print button. It will not drag upwards. There is no page button on the screen to resize print or zoom.
 Altogether a backwards step.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Is this a <b>network printer or a local printer</b>?<br />
2) Is it connected to the <b>USB</b>?<br />
3) What <b>exactly happens</b> when you <b>connect</b> the printer?<br />
4) Do you get any error message or error code?<br />
5) Have you <b>made any changes</b> to your computer recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Listed below&nbsp;are a few things that you can try before proceeding further-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Try to <b>connect it to a different computer</b>. Check if that works.<br />
