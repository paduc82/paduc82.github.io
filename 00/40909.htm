<p>This occurs often when playing video games. I've looked around and saw that people had this problem occurring with other applications such as Google Chrome. For me, at the moment, this has only been happening with video games. I have updated my graphics
 drivers in addition to reinstalling it, along with a few other suggestions that I tried when searching for a solution online. As it seems, I could not find a suggestion that worked. Can someone help?</p>

            It is not game specific. It has occurred in Dark Souls, Terraria, and less frequently in League of Legends. I do not use Microsoft Edge at all. Something I noticed is that it only occurs when I have a monitor plugged in with a HDMI (I usually have two
 monitors for my setup, my laptop and an external monitor, using the Extend Screens option). When I played with only my laptop screen and no HDMI connecting to the other monitor, the issue did not occur.

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try playing the games in Microsoft Edge and check the functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest you to try uninstalling the graphics card driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select device manager.</p>
<p>2. Expand display adapter.</p>
<p>3. Right click on the driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>4. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forum<br />
about any known issues. Also check with the maker of the headset.<br />

    <title>Diablo 3 Achievement Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amplive 7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Diablo 3 Achievement Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday I got three achievements for my account: &nbsp;Butchered!, The Last of the Horadrim, and The Comfort of Strangers. &nbsp;When I logged on this morning I no longer was credited for getting these achievements, but I still had the in-game challenges completed
 for beating the bosses and quests. &nbsp;I went back through the game and re-completed the pre-requisites for the achievements but wasn't awarded them once I finished. &nbsp;I tried doing a full power cycle, and deleting and re-downloading my profile but neither worked.
 &nbsp;The first time I contacted Xbox I was told the problem was on blizzard's end, but then blizzard told me it was Xbox who was responsible. &nbsp;The only solution I can think of is to beat the bosses on Hardcore and see if that grants me the achievement, but I don't
 really want to do that.</p>

<p>If they aren't unlocked, then you'll need to make a completely new save to attempt them again. Once the challenge is complete, you can't complete it again. Achievements need the challenge to complete in order to pop the achievement.</p>

<p>I just beat the Butchered! achievement on Hardcore for the first time, and got the new challenge and sigil for beating the boss on that difficulty. &nbsp;This didn't give me the achievement either though. &nbsp;Shouldn't it have though, because even if I played hardcore
 mode as my very first character it would award the achievement the first time I beat the boss. &nbsp;I just don't want to delete my game save, becasuse I have so much progress with it</p>

<p>Beating it on Hardcore unlocks a different challenge, so that won't work.</p>
<p>PerpetualKings; I've heard of no issues with this achievement aside from people downloading a gamesave with it already unlocked and they don't know why the achievement isn't working (I'm not accusing you). Also, please make your own thread and explain the
 issue fully.</p>

<p>Hi George. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll give you everything possible to repair the store and Windows Update: </p>
<p>
</p><p>STORE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if the fixes here help: <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a><br />
<br />
Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />
Try resetting the Store cache: <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a><br />
<br />
If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset. After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />
If that fails then reinstall Store. Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br />
<code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATES:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors.&nbsp; Try running that first.<br />
<br />
2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:<br />
<br />
Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key.
<br />
<br />
net stop wuauserv <br />
net stop cryptSvc <br />
net stop bits <br />
net stop msiserver <br />
Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old <br />
Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old <br />
net start wuauserv <br />
net start cryptSvc <br />
net start bits <br />
net start msiserver <br />
<br />
Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then<br />
<br />
3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:&nbsp; http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207<br />
<br />
A running log of Update History with known issues is here: <br />
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history<br />
<br />
4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:&nbsp; https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly. <br />
<br />
If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest
 version. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a><br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            There is only one Store.  I handle these cases by the tens of thousands, more than anyone else on the internet, so I would know if there's another.
<br />
<br />If you don't have Apps category in Settings, then re-register the Settings apps from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />If you need to use the Command Prompt in WIndows because it's obvious you have a corrupted install, then use the Repair Mode accessible by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>

            Hi George
<br />
<br />Because your PC is running version 1511 (build 10586.1176) the Microsoft Store will be named the Windows Store, they renamed that App after that version, they are one and the same thing . . .
<br />
<br />To download any of the modern apps/games you would need to update your version of Windows 10, which is 2 years out of date and no longer supported by Microsoft
<br />
<br />You say you cannot update your version of Windows - is that due to some error or is your hardware not supported on the recent versions of Windows 10?

    <title>How to print multiple PDFs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troyjasper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to print multiple PDFs</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 I can't print multiple PDFs in a folder at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can select multiple Word documents in a folder, right-click them, and select Print. The first four options that appear when right-clicked are Open, Edit, New, and Print. These are separated by other options on the right-click menu by a line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right-click multiple selected PDFs, I can't print. The first option is Open, which is separated from the next option on the right-click menu by a line. I have to open the PDFs individually if I want to print them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These results are with 4 Word documents alone&nbsp;selected, and then with 4 PDFs alone selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to open them individually. I don't want to convert them into other file formats. I want Windows 10 to work.</p>

            <p>Are you trying to print them together (DOCs + PDFs) combined or just PDF files?</p>
<p>Are you using the same PDF reader that you had on your Windows 7 or 8 system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To work around this limitation, you can print each file type separately.&nbsp; For example, to print the PDF files in a folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type&nbsp;<strong>*.PDF</strong>&nbsp;in the<strong>&nbsp;Search</strong>&nbsp;box at the upper right.</li><li>For 1-15 files, press<strong>&nbsp;CTRL+A</strong>&nbsp;to select all of them.</li><li>For 16 or more files, select 15 of them (click the first,&nbsp;<strong>SHIFT</strong>&nbsp;+click the last).</li><li>Right-click any file and click<strong>&nbsp;Print</strong>&nbsp;.</li><li>Repeat steps 3-4 as required.</li></ol>

<p>It's not often I need to use this feature, but after trying it with the .docx files to see what happens, I realized it just quickly opens Microsoft Word, prints, and closes Word. Microsoft's Reader application is a more barebones approach to .pdf files,
 so it doesn't have the features of Adobe Acrobat. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing and setting Acrobat to the default .pdf application, the print option came up in the right click menu and it does largely the same thing (quickly opening Acrobat, printing from default printer with default print settings, and closing).</p>

<p>Had the same problem but noticed that Windows 10 gives you the option to download the Adobe Reader Touch app, and if you are using this program to open your pdf files it doesn't seem like it will give you the option to print multiple pdfs at&nbsp;once. You need
 to download the Adobe Acrobat Reader DC program online&nbsp;and remove the Adobe Reader Touch app so that when you are trying to print multiple pdfs your computer will recognize the DC program instead.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me so I hope it works for you too!</p>

<h2>            windows vista issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi, My computer is a Dell XPS 420 running windows home Premium with service pack 2 and i am having a few issues with it.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Im getting windows updating issue saying: <strong>Updates were not configured correctly. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer.
</strong></p>
<p>This happens when it trys to download : <strong>Update for Windows Driver Framework version 1.11 for Windows Vista (KB2761494)</strong> and
<strong>Update for Windows Vista (KB2748349).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> I keep getting errors: </p>
<p>A) when i try to print something - <strong>Font capture acrord32.exe - bad image C:\Windows\system32\msftedit.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or
 contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support.</strong></p>
<p>B) <strong>Options:</strong> <strong>acrord32.exe - bad image C:\Windows\system32\msftedit.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact
 your system administrator or the software vendor for support.</strong><br />
C) <strong>acromissingcompwclass acrord32.exe bad image</strong> <strong>C:\Windows\system32\msftedit.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your
 system administrator or the software vendor for support.</strong></p>
<p>D) <strong>acrord32.exe - bad image C:\Windows\system32\msftedit.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software
 vendor for support.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>I can no longer update itunes to the newer version as it says:
<strong>Errors occurred during install before iTunes could be configered.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Computer no longer recognises my tomtom so i can't update it.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;I purchused pareto logic to solve the msftedit issue which the search engine told me it would but it didn't and&nbsp;pareto logic now won't update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run McAfee and i have downloaded AVG and Malwarebytes to confirm i have no viruses.</p>
<p>I have tryed alot of the things people have recommended on forums to other people with similar issues but nothing works.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Adobe Reader but it changed nothing.</p>
<p>Computer now seems to go slower or pages seem to freeze and not respond.</p>
<p>I feel like all of the issues are linked in some kind of way. Maybe updating way?</p>
<p>Please if anyone knows whats going on with my computer please reply. Its driving me nuts!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Photos app not working</h2>
                    I keep receiving this message after I try to open the "Photos" app. The photos open fine in other apps but when I use this one it reads "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the
 item"

<p>I have redownloaded several trial version of XBLA games that have been delisted.</p>
<p><span><strong>_</strong></span></p>
<p>I was wondering if I could download the full version from the trials that I have so I can play the full versions and unlock Achievements.</p>
<p><span><strong>_</strong></span></p>
<p>Can I download the full versions from the trials versions I have even though the games have been delisted?</p>

<p>No. If you haven't downloaded the game before, you can't get it once it's delisted.</p>
<p>If you have previously purchased a game that has been delisted, go into your download history and attempt to redownload it from there. If you still can't, then it has been removed from the system completely.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I don't believe you can, it might let you spend the points to make the trial version of the game a full version but I don't believe it will let you actually download the little file that converts it into the full game as the content was removed from the marketplace.</p>

<h2>            Everyone in my party can hear my game sound</h2>
                    <p>So to start with I had a turtle Beach stealth 420x headset and it was great. Eventually they stopped working and I got a pair of Astro a10s and this is were the problems started. With this headset everyone I would talk to told me they could hear all my game sound through the party and I couldn't do anything to fix it and I assumed it was just something with the Astros so I got a new headset, Logitech g933, and I've only been using them for about 6 hours now and I'm being told the same thing.i have absolutely no idea what could be causing this problem and could use any advise you guys can give.</p>

<h2>            Transferred Files will not open</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop and when I tried copying my files from my old machine onto this one through external hard drives and SD cards, the files will not open.
<br />
<br />
.JPG files launch the photos program with the error "We can't open this file". <br />
.MP3 or .WAV files launch Windows Media Player with the error message "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file."
<br />
.PSD files launch Adobe Photoshop with the message "Could not complete your request because it is not a valid Photoshop document".<br />
Please note that if I plug these devices into other computers, everything still transfers and works fine, it's just on my new one that nothing will open if transferred. Files downloaded from the internet open with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer help?</p>

            Are you trying to open the files directly from the external drive or SD card?

If so, try copying them to the local drive in a folder then try opening them from there.

Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.
 1. Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin).
 2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
sfc /scannow

            This is strange. Would you be willing to try performing a repair upgrade? Sounds like something is corrupt with your file associations.

            <p>Maybe the Network Adapter is just plain old faulty?&nbsp; Nothing lasts forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is the Laptop covered by any type of Warranty, if so then this seems to be what you should be pursuing rather than struggling with substandard workmanship?</p>

</p><p>If you want to solve it at your own expense then purchasing&nbsp;a new Network Card (Wireless) may be all that is available to you.</p>

<h2>            No Bluetooth on computer after Windows Update and NO restore point - 5TH TIME IN A YEAR</h2>
                    <p>This is the&nbsp;<strong>fifth time in a year </strong>that I have had this problem. It is ALWAYS after a Windows update and is 100% a Windows problem.&nbsp;<strong>Windows also repeatedly turns off my system restore protection at some point without my knowledge.</strong>
 I have repeatedly turned it on for both of my hard drives and yet every time I need to explore USING a restore point, there is NEVER a restore point to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the exact same problem as described here:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/bluetooth-disappears-after-update/6854003e-64fe-4031-85a9-189758874b9d</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bluetooth will work just fine and I will come back to my computer after it has downloaded and installed an update without my knowledge and suddenly it doesn't work. It isn't my devices.&nbsp;<strong>It's like Bluetooth doesn't exist.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The switch to turn bluetooth OFF and ON is not even available here.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot connect my mouse, keyboard, or speaker via bluetooth, all of which I need for my workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried many, many troubleshooting steps every time this has happened.&nbsp;<strong>I always have to wait it out each time.</strong> Anywhere from a couple days to over a week before SUDDENLY it works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is completely unacceptable.</strong> I want a solution yesterday please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

            Hi Lauren.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Having System restore repeatedly turn off is symptomatic of System problems or corruption.  MVP's have advocated for System Restore after it was turned off in Version Updates and are not aware of Updates doing the same thing or it would be more widespread reported.  
<br />
<br />Run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />See troubleshooting steps here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do my best to follow the steps you've suggested. Scanning these, many I have already tried the previous four times with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I understand that a&nbsp;clean install of Windows would <strong>uninstall all of my existing programs?</strong> This is always a huge pain in the ass. It takes about two days to get a new machine set up with all of the programs and utilities I use daily for
 my business, and it is completely stupid to do for this recurring annoyance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other question is this—how long do you reasonably expect a computer to run before y'all say, "Oh, factory reset it"? This computer is barely a year old and it's had this issue FIVE TIMES. It is completely Windows' fault and not the fault of the three
 different companies who make the equipment I use everyday and their drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lauren</p>

            Hi Lauren.  
<br />
<br />The problem may be the factory install itself, which no tech enthusiasts will run in the first place because of how the bloatware throttles and causes issues with WIndows.  So as a Clean Install specialist I'm always going to advocate for that if there's any question the install is not pristine, since especially in Windows 10 with it's heavy updating the quality of the install means everything.  
<br />
<br />The Clean install is an investment in taking the time to do the best possible install, better than any amount of money could buy, that should endure for years and give the best possible performance.  It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will know what works best and have applied it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />But you can wait to do either of those until you try the other troubleshooting steps including the checklist which should tell you exactly the quality of your install and improve it.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your assistance. I have done absolutely all of the troubleshooting steps you have provided short of a clean install.
<strong>None of them work.</strong> Needless to say, this recurring issue is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said, this problem occurs repeatedly&nbsp;<strong>and always after a Windows update.</strong> I simply don't have two days presently to do a clean install,
<strong>which I believe uninstalls ALL of my software and utilities, yes?</strong> You didn't answer this question previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I will have to use some of my wired tools for the time being and plan a clean install at a future time. Probably the bluetooth with spontaneously resolve itself in 2-7 days as it has done the last four times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I frankly find it **** that your typical customer purchasing a new laptop is supposed to mistrust the install from the moment the PC is booted up for the first time out-of-the-box. Mine has been running this install since I purchased it last year. What
 are we supposed to do, immediately strip it and do a clean install with the links you've offered? Why would we do this or know that we should? A new piece of equipment should work as promised when you purchase it.</p>

<h2>            Wireless device is not recognized by the computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: wireless connection</p>
<p>Hi,<br />
I upgraded to windows 8.1 from 8 pro yesterday. Since then my wireless device is not recognized by the computer. I have to say that I have an old dell inspiron 6000 (which I bought in 2005) - but it was working fine with windows 8 pro.<br />
<br />
I have tried the 'troubleshooting', made sure that the driver was the latest - but the wireless device is not recognized by the computer, however the bluetooth is working alright.<br />
<br />
Any advice please.<br />
Thanks. <br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Viv, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things which you can try to resolve this issue are:</p>
<p><strong>a: </strong>Make sure your PC can share files and devices on a network</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Make sure network devices are turned on</p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Running the Network Troubleshooter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform steps from the link mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I tried it again, I already had tried those steps but it had not worked - so still the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the 'Flight Mode' in the PC setting -&nbsp;EVEN when the flight mode is off -&nbsp;it&nbsp;states&nbsp;'We couldn't find wireless devices on this PC'.</p>
<p>I remember in Windows 8 there was a WIFI - On/Off sliding button which I can't see.</p>
<p>I think there has been a file missing or something (I am not a computer expert) - which is preventing the Wifi Device to be recognised by the computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My wifi adapter is intel (R) PRO/wireless 2200BG.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please advise</p>
<p>Viv</p>

<p>I have learned since that my wireless adapter is not compatible with 8.1</p>
<p>Interestingly it is not compatible with 8, however it was doing a fine job on my windows 8.</p>

            You need to give more information.&nbsp; At the very least, say what make and model of computer you are using and&nbsp;which build of Windows&nbsp;10 you are on. You can find the build number by typing winver in the search box then clicking on winver in the results list.

<h2>            Pls Help&#33; Uninstalling Intel wireless&#47;Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>Pls help! Am trying to upgrade to Windows 8 but upgrade assistant says i should uninstall "Intel proset wireless/Bluetooth" for compartibility reasons. I used 'Microsoft Fix IT' to uninstall it. I tried the upgrade, and it say "uninstall Intel Wireless/Bluetooth
 manually".</p>
<p>&nbsp;The problem now is that i checked the Add/Remove Programs, to uninstall it but can't find it. It's no longer among my installed programs.
</p>
<p>Pls, can someone help me? i don't know where to find it so as to uninstall it. I use ASUS A55VD-SX050V, Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia Geforce 610, Windows 7.</p>
<p>OR IS THERE A WAY I CAN UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8 WITHOUT HAVING TO PASS THROUGH THIS STRESS SINCE I CAN'T FIND IT TO UNINSTALL.</p>

            <p>I was able to achieve this by </p>
<p>1 . Use the FixIt tool from Microsoft and uninstall the program.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Reboot</p>
<p>3. go to c:\program files\intel\</p>
<p>4. delete the Bluetooth folder.</p>
<p>If you cannot delete the Bluetooth folder in step 4, then see which file is open and kill that file from task manager.</p>
<p>This allowed me to carry on with the Windows 8 upgrade, which was stopped by this intel driver software.</p>
<p>Hope this helps </p>

            Hi Tom.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />) See fixes here for 100% disk usage:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />FIX : Windows 10 100 Percent Disk Usage Problem
<br />
<br />1. Press  W8K + R and type devmgmt.msc in the Run, hit Enter key to open Device Manager snap-in.
<br />
<br />2. In the Device Manager window, expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers and right click on Standard SATA AHCI Controller, select Properties.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3. In the property sheet, switch to Driver tab and click Driver Details.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />4. If the Driver File Details window shows storahci.sys driver listed there, it means you’re running inbox driver and hence it is possible to disable MSI mode. Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />5. Back on the property sheet, switch to Details tab. Against Property, select Device instance path from drop-down and note down the Value mentioned there.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Registry Disclaimer: The further steps will involve registry manipulation. Making mistakes while manipulating registry could affect your system adversely. So be careful while editing registry entries and create a System Restore point first.
<br />
<br />6. Press W8K + R and put regedit in Run dialog box to open Registry Editor (if you’re not familiar with Registry Editor, then click here). Click OK.
<br />
<br />7. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\&lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt;\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties
<br />
<br />*Substitute &lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt; we got in step 5.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />8. In the right pane of MessageSignaledInterruptProperties key, look for the registry DWORD (REG_DWORD) named MSISupported which should be corresponding to Value 1 as its Data. Double click on the DWORD to modify its value:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />9. Finally, set the Value data as 0 and click OK. Close Registry Editor and reboot. After restarting your machine, the 100% disk usage problem should disappear.

            HI Tom.  Your trying to update the SATA controller driver?   Check the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for you exact PC model, HP Serial or Dell Service tag on sticker on PC.  
<br />
<br />It may be an element of the chipset to update all drivers starting with BIOS and Chipset, Sound, Video (Display), USB, Network, etc - any that have newer drivers posted for download on the downloads page.  
<br />
<br />If you need any help as I said I will help you until it's resolved.  We need to complete all steps skipping none, as we often find later that the skipped step was the fix.
