<h2>            How do I save a picture from a Word document into a jpg file or any type of picture file&#63;</h2>
                    I've saved some webpages into Word documents (I highlight the page &amp; then copy and paste it into the Word document (this also includes any images, I don't do the images separately)). I hope you understand what I'm describing. I'd like to know how to save
 a image that's in a Word document as an actual picture file (e.g., a jpg file)? I hope you understand what I'm trying to do. Please tell me there's a way to do this. Thanks.<br />

            <p>In future, if you want a Web graphic saved as a picture file, you would be better advised to right-click the image on the Web page and choose
<strong>Save picture as...</strong> That will allow you to save the graphic in its native format under a filename (and in a location) of your choice, from which you can then insert it into any Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those pictures that have already been pasted into a document, you can find several alternative methods at

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had Word 2010 or 2013, you would be able to use this method, which unfortunately is not available in Word 2007.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the picture (<strong>Ctrl+C</strong>).</li><li>On the <strong>Home</strong> tab, in the <strong>Clipboard</strong> group, click the arrow beneath
<strong>Paste</strong> and choose <strong>Paste Special...</strong></li><li>In the <strong>Paste Special</strong> dialog, choose one of the Picture formats and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the pasted picture and choose <strong>Save as Picture...</strong></li></ol>

            Just to ask: if I save it as a webpage, what will happen to the "html" (the webpage version of the original document) &amp; "files" document (the one has the images from the original document) (the one that's created when I save the original document as a
 webpage) if I were to edit the original document?<br />

            The Web page will not change if you edit the original document. The only reason for creating the Web page is to get the images split out as separate graphic files.

            <p>So, the pics in the "files" document &amp; the "webpage" version of the original document won't disappear? The reason I'm doing all this is because when I was using Word on a Windows 8 computer, I had created new copies of the original documents so I could edit
 them on Windows 8 (the original documents would appear as "Read Only" &amp; I couldn't edit them) &amp; some of the images in the new copies would disappear &amp; I would have to go back to the webpage I got them from &amp; paste them back in the document. I hope you understand
 what I'm asking &amp; you understand the problem I'm describing with the images disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the pics in the "files" document are actually jpg files of the images (as if I've saved a picture from a webpage as a jpg file), correct? I hope you understand what I'm asking.</p>

            <p>When you paste a picture from a Web page, you're really pasting a link to the image file that is linked from that Web page. If you immediately unlink it in your document (<strong>Ctrl+Shift+F9</strong>), then it will be embedded, and it won't disappear.
 But you are still much safer with image files stored on your own hard drive that can be reused as needed, which is why I advise using
<strong>Save Picture As</strong> from the website instead of just copying and pasting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a Web page from your existing document is just a method of extracting pasted images into image files that are saved on your hard drive. As long as you keep the saved HTML file, with the supporting folder, if any, the images will be saved. But it
 would, again, be smarter to resave those image files in your Pictures folder under another name. Then you can delete the entire folder that Word created when you saved the document as a Web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you can go back to the original Web page for the pictures, then much the best procedure at this point is not to copy/paste the picture (even if you immediately unlink it) but instead right-click and use
<strong>Save Picture As</strong> to save the picture on your hard drive. Then use
<strong>Insert | Illustrations | Picture</strong> to insert the picture into your document.</p>

            <p>Well, like I said in the beginning post, I didn't paste the images separately, I highlighted the web page &amp; then copied and pasted it to a Word document.
</p>
<p>Also, some of the web pages are from Livejournal &amp; I had pasted some userpics in the documents &amp; some of the accounts that had the userpics are deleted &amp; purged, so they're gone. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in my post before yours, did you understand the stuff &amp; was trying to explain/ describe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the images disappearing thing I was describing only seemed to happen in the 2nd copy of the documents (the one's I edited when using Windows 8).</p>

                    <p><span>My condition:</span></p>
<p><span>One Gateway SX2851 desktop&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Win 10 Home free upgrade (from Win 7)</span></p>

One Lenovo laptop<br />
Win 10 Home free upgrade (from Win 7)<br />
1511 10586.63</span></p>
<p><span>Norton antivirus</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have three different wireless routers set up in different parts of the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have finally accomplished getting a home group set up (after fighting the problem of a ghost home group remaining from Win 7)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have internet connection through all 3 routers on both computers, the computers both show up in file explorer under network when both are connected to the
 same routers on each router.</span></p>
<p><span>On two of the routers I have full sharing between both computers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the third router I have no connection between the two computers either way. Although as stated above both show up in file explorer under network. When I
 try to open something on the other computer I get: Windows cannot access\\(other computer). After running diagnostics I get the "Windows sockets registry entries required for network connectivity are missing" issue&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have reset the router and even deleted the router connection on both computers. Rebooted the computers and re-establish the connection through the router.
 I have left home group on both computers and set it up again several times. I have tried windows diagnostics more times than I can count over the last five days.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This seems to have started with the last Win 10 updates. I have looked through several other similar threads but not found a solution yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can accomplish what I need to on one of the other routers, but of course the one I use most Is the one that is not working. I need a fix please.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I spent the day investigating differences in the settings on the wireless routers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I found was the "no problems" wireless router was set internally to a static IP address on the network, while the "problems" router was set to Automatic
 DHCP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I changed it to a static address on my network the router required me to set a static DNS address also in order to be able to save the settings. I set
 the DNS address to the same one as on the main U-verse modem/router. (I got the number from the U-Verse modem/router).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After I powered down the modem, routers, and computers and turned everything back on, I had full sharing on the "problem router" with everything else still
 working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The direct problem was solved by changing a setting on the router and not something directly changeable in Windows, However the issue did not start until the
 latest updates. The router and windows allowed sharing with the router set internally to Automatic DHCP prior to that last update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps others and allows the Microsoft programmers to determine the why of this issue.</span></p>

                    Running W7/Office 2010.&nbsp; Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; Exchange 2007.&nbsp; Have users when sending attachments in Outlook the files becomes corrupt and the receiver can not open the file - Word/Excel or PDF.&nbsp; when going to the sent folder, original sender cannot open the
 attachment either.&nbsp; No error message just "the operations failed".&nbsp; These same users when trying to send or forward a message receive the same error message.&nbsp; This is random.&nbsp; If you write the e-mail in word, then copy paste to the e-mail, send right away.&nbsp;
 It will go.&nbsp; If you wait to long, you will get the operation failed message.&nbsp; Have changed to send in Rich text, this has helped some, but then they have problems sending and receiving for news letters.&nbsp; Everything is in HTML at this time.&nbsp; Have reimaged and
 delete Outlook profile with no luck.

<p>Hi Cindy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test, it’s not feasible to create a new content library in the problematic class notebook.</p>
<p>Regarding your requirement, we suggest you vote to our <a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/362784-education/suggestions/17647501-move-or-copy-from-content-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UserVoice</a> which is the best way to influence our products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a workaround, we suggest you create a new class notebook and copy the content and paste them into the new class notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Cherry</p>

<h2>            N82 Problems &#40;like N95 WLAN problem&#41; - no gateway &#47; no server found - GPS</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I just bought the N82 yesterday and everything works perfect except for the WLAN problem, I experienced the exact same problem. First I cant connect to my home wifi because of "no gateway" error and then I did what the solution in the N95 forum suggested that
 Nokias are sensitive to the DHCP IP obtaining problem and so I it worked just fine as long as the my fixed IP did do not crash with anybody else in the house...Now the problem is, what happens when I go to internet cafe? I can't see their range of IP, DNS,
 Gateway, etc. etc. so I can't set it manually so I'm completely out of luck....but then with these hot spots I find myself a new error..."Internet: no server found" - this one I still can't find a fix for in this forum....anybody care to share?<br />
<br />
By the way, the satellite signal reception on this phone is amazing....I have a Garmin Nuvi and this little phone works just like it except that one is a 3m precision and N82 is at 10-15m but I really don't mind....The map? Man, Nokia did a wonderful job of
 the map of Thailand....if they can do a map of Bangkok this good then I'm sure anywhere else would be crystal....The navigation add on capability (the pricy one) is necessary tho, w/o that its worthless I can't navigate but since I got a 3 day trial I did
 it and yeah, I'm gonna buy it.....esp. with those downloadable POI off the net I'm definitely gonna buy it....How long battery last I'm not sure cuz it only took me 30 minutes to get home yesterday and it only drained 2-3 from the total 7 (I was on GPS all
 day and GPRS too).....<br />
<br />
If no one mention the "smell of N82 Music Edition" I think I'll live with this phone for a long long time....<br />
<br />
Oh, and why I bought this phone? I was happy with my N73 ME until the new firmware update that ruined my A2DP profile and the camera (esp at night) so.....I'll never upgrade again cuz there is no roll back.....insanity.

            I also own n82 here , my n82 is now resting in the box waiting to bring down to singapore service centre to service :(<br />
<br />
waiting for them to call me when the parts come to sg nokia service centre after I visit the service centre.<br />
<br />
I feel very sad , got a feeling the n82 parts will come to sg nokia service centre next yr.<br />
<br />
but I do check my local telecom is actually selling this phone.consider official launch I believe orelse the telecoms in sg will no sell and I feel nokia should have the spare parts for n82 by rite?<br />
<br />
but I do check the wlan.is working with my router.<br />
<br />
I using mac filter in my router side , key in my n82 mac address and that time I suft no problem<br />
<br />
battery wise yup , I do noticed IT DON;T LAST very long compare to my old e65.Most due to n82 function , the xenon flash , GPS can drain the battery ...<br />
<br />
<br />
:( now I just hope singapore nokia centre have the n82 spare parts soon .and get my n82 fix!<br />
<br />
<br />
even they don;t know when it coming , depend on nokia HQ!<br />
<br />
I DO HOPE NOKIA HQ sent the sparts parts of n82 to sg soon!<br />
<br />
soon many will own n82 and is kindly sad if spare parts haven;t come and it will delay the service and put nokia name in blacklist.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
So what was broken that you needed to fix the N82? How long does your N82 battery last? Mine would last 1.5 days on full use...(GPS, EDGE, voice call, camera)....Nokia Care Center is not that sophisticated, this forum helps a lot better dealing with the softwares
 but it seems u have a hardware problem...don't they change a new phone for u if u bought it within 7 days? Here they do tho.

            I tired but they don;t they keep mention to me no stocks come yet.<br />
and I heard singapore nokia service centre long time ago they changed their policy , don;t do one to one exchanged.<br />
Repair and repair ....go again and again to service centre until cannot get it fix THEY than do one to one exchanged I heard .<br />
but my side local official telecom , singtel , m1 and starhub is already selling n82.<br />
<br />
this is funny , the phone is already selling in local telecom yet<br />
back in their service centre , don;t have sparts parts or phone in their servicing centre.<br />
<br />
and next sg nokia service centre here long time ago don;t do one to one exchanged of handset even u just brought the phone.<br />
<br />
so choice , I already went and they promise to changed the parts but must wait Nokia HQ sent the n82 spare parts to sg service centre.that why they cannot confirm when and reserve the parts for me.<br />
when it come they will call me down to get it fix and must wait again ..<br />
to get it fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
:( kinda sad here christmas is coming and I cannot enjoy my new phone.

What product code does your N82 have?<br />
<br />
Where did you get it from European, Asian or from the USA.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to buy one but want to make sure I get a European one so that I have a valid warantee.<br />

Many thanks

<br />
Now that's a problem...the product code is inside the phone and I have to take out the cover to see it right? I can't find a silicone cover yet so I'm using the clear case and opening it would mean buying a new case (I have no idea why they do that but its
 only 2 USD so I don't expect too much) and (eventho its only 2 USD) they're still hard to find cuz N82 just came out like last week...I'm sorry...I'll try to look on the box (if there is one but i doubt it).....So far not thinking about N82 music edition<br />

<div>I am having the exact same issue. &nbsp;I followed the instructions to add the MX record on my registrar's site (GoDaddy) for my domain Petersonconsulting.ca on January 7th. &nbsp;I still get the message 'awaiting DNS configuration". &nbsp;If I press refresh, it goes

            <p>Hi TautvydasBernotas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to assist you in finding the MX records of your custom domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the MX record/server of&nbsp;a domain can be found after the domain&nbsp;was selected on the&nbsp;sign in page of Windows Live Admin Center which is&nbsp;<a href="http://domains.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://domains.live.com</a>&nbsp;using the account that had registered
 it. If you were still unable to see them, we&nbsp;would like to know the steps that you had performed when you accidentally removed your domain from hosting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you visit the article that was provided by my colleague, Karla Camille O., if you have successfully located your MX records so that you can reconfigure them properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions or clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Yes, this is the problem, I had written about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it also jumps back after sign-in, so I can't find my MX records. If I would find them, I could easily change them on my hosting and resume using this email.</p>
<p>

    <title>Duplicate external links in Microsoft Project 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Duplicate external links in Microsoft Project 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have two separate Project files with links between them.&nbsp; The issue is that there are duplicate links of the same exact task.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project File1</p>
<p>Task&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Task Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Predecessor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External Link</p>

            Tim,
<div>I don't see an actual question in your post but I'll tell what is wrong with "this picture". My guess is you have been saving copies of either or both files and that has created duplicate links. That is a form of corruption and you are in trouble.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Files in linked structures (i.e. master/subproject, external preds/successors, resource pool/sharer) should never be renamed, moved or saved off as copies. Further, operating such structures over a network is asking for trouble. Any of the above will sooner
 or later result in file corruption.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What to do at this point? First you need to break all external links between files, then clean the files, and finally re-establish the inter-project links. To properly break inter-project links you need to break the links, and then save both the source
 and destination files using Save As to the same name. Once all the links are broken, save all files in XML format. Then re-open in Project and re-establish the links as needed. Finally do NOT do any of the things I mentioned in paragraph two.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does that answer the question you didn't ask?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Sorry I wasn't clearer.&nbsp; I mentioned the issue which I am having.&nbsp; The question is why is it happening which you answered.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what the difference is between external links and inter-project links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another point which I didn't&nbsp; mention is that the File2 in my example able is embedded in File1 as a subproject.&nbsp; We do store these on a network drive.&nbsp; Due to latency issues, people typically copy them down to their hard drive, modify and then move back
 up to the original network drive.&nbsp; From your response, it sounds like this is going to get us in trouble.&nbsp; Is the best approach to keep the files in the same directory location (hard drive or network) and never move or copy them?</p>

            Tim,
<div>Yes, you did say there was an issue but I didn't specifically see a question. Regardless, I interpolated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For purposes of your post external and inter-project links are one in the same. Technically, external links could also be paste links from another application like Excel. The correct term is really, "external predecessors/successors".</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yep, all that downloading to local, editing, and uploading to the server is killing you. It's not "going" to get you into trouble, you're already there. The fact that one file is a subproject in the other isn't all that relevant although it does add a
 second level of linking structure, and the more levels of link structure, the greater the chance for corruption.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, your best approach is to keep all files in a single folder, on a stable server if you must. And I repeat, NEVER move, copy, rename or save off any of the files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>John</div>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the answer, but you're wrong.</p>
<p>The video is just about "Using the Microsoft Band with Windows 10 Background&nbsp;Events" - he really uses the "Blip RemoteUI" just for remote display.</p>

I am on a Microsoft Exchange Server and it is enabled for pushing mails. I want to stop mails being pushed and would rather have them pulled by me every hour</div>

            Outlook for Mac does not allow you to alter its schedule for connecting to Exchange. It will check the Exchange server every minute.
<div><br />
<div>You can select <b>Outlook</b> menu --&gt; <i>Work Offline</i> to disable sending and receiving while you compose messages. Enable it whenever you're ready to send and receive messages.</div>

<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2002 doesn&#39;t save email password while running Windows 7</h2>
                    Just bought a new computer with Windows 7.&nbsp; After installing Microsoft Office XP (with Outlook 2002) I started using Outlook and each time I try and send/receive mail I am prompted to reenter my password for the email account even though I have the box
 checked to save the password.&nbsp; I went through the following procedures as previously posted in Article 290684: Create New Outlook Profile, Run Outlook in Safe Mode, and backup and change registry keys in Storage System Provider file.&nbsp; It continues to prompt
 for password each time.<br />
<br />
Any additional help would be appreciated.

            I'm sorry, but Outlook 2002 isn't compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; It uses a method of saving passwords that isn't available in Windows 7, and there's no solution to this problem.&nbsp; :-(

            I've been having the same problem for the last 2 days. &nbsp;I can get my emails through outlook.com but that is not my preference. &nbsp;I prefer using office outlook and have been for years in versions 2007, 2010 and now 2013. &nbsp;This is very frustrating.

            Yes, I am also experiencing this for the past two or so days. I have been searching online and there are a few people that also have this issue recently. It is more related to accounts that use EAS to connect to hotmail/outlook mail (as most Outlook clients
 would do by default).<br />
I tried removing and re-adding the account to make sure it is set up correctly in Outlook. It was sporadic yesterday afternoon and last evening it was almost impossible to connect.<br />
<br />
It does seem to be server side, and hopefully it is being worked on although I have not personally seen anybody confirm this from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Also, I just reported a problem to this site: <a href="https://status.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://status.live.com/</a><br />
They are not showing problems so they might not be aware, so reporting the issue there may help.<br />

<p>Hi Ethan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have covered the URL on your screenshot for protecting your privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, from the URL, we have found that your organization has deployed SSO (Single Sign-On)/ AD FS for the domain "cotoso.com" (here contoso.com is just an example). Under the current situation, I suggest you try the following methods to give it a shot:</p>
<p>1. Make sure all the Office 365 services have been closed (ie, Exchange online/ OWA, SharePoint online, etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Clear the cookies of your browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Enter into the Private mode of the browser you are using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, you may try changing another browser (IE, Firefox or Chrome) if you haven't done this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please clarify the following information for moving forward:</p>
<p>1. When referring to "sign out", do you mean you clicked "sign out" or the web signed out automatically?</p>
<p>2. What Office 365 service for signed out, OWA or Office 365 Portal, etc? Show me the link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If other users in your organization works fine, does the issue persist if you use his/her machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<h2>            Row Source with 129 list items and the Row Source type I put &#34;Value List&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am new in Access 2013 and I create a Row Source with 129 list items and the Row Source type I put "Value List". However, the system is presenting a lot of issues and I am not sure if this change could impact the performance of the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked about Access Specifications it is clear that we cannot use more than 255 characters in a field, is that the case for the Row Source list of items. When I checked the number of characters I have 751.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answers will be really appreciate.&nbsp;</p>

            The total length of the value list can't exceed 255 characters.&nbsp; And even a list only 255 characters long would be cumbersome to maintain.&nbsp; It would be better to put the list of items into a table, with one item per record, and use the "Table/Query" Row
 Source Type.

<p>Hi Dirk, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your replied. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The total length of the value list is 751 characters which is a total of 129 items.&nbsp;&nbsp;These values are in four separate forms in a combo box with a name that is used as variable in the VB code to update an end back table. When I created the table I added
 the name of the combo box as the field&nbsp;of the new table, so&nbsp;The name and the control source are the same for the combox box. However, now I am getting

<p>
</p><p>You can't assign a value to this object</p>

<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>You may be talking about two separate tables:&nbsp; the combo box's rowsource table, and the table to which each form is bound.&nbsp; Please clarify which is which.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>When the error is raised, do you have the option to debug?&nbsp; What code do you see when you debug?&nbsp; What line of code is highlighted as raising the error?</span></span></li></ul>

<p>Value Lists should ONLY be used with a small static list of items. A combo with a list of 129 items is NOT suitable for a value list. You need to create a table with your list then use that table as the Rowsource of the combo. Create the table, delete the
 current combobox control from your form(s) and recreate them using the combobox wizard.</p>

<li>What do you mean by "<span>These values are in four separate forms in a combo box with a name that is used as variable in the VB code to update an end back table"?</span></li><li><span>There are four forms which the combo box is called with the same name and they have the same values in Row Source: "_"; "a"; "b";....etc.,<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Did you create a table for to hold the combo box's list items? Yes. I just created and now it works if I leave the Control Course field in blank and I select the table and Table/Query as the Row source type<br />
</span><span><br />
</span></li><li><span>Do you mean that there are four separate forms, each of which has an identical combo box with these items in its list? That is correct.
<br />
</span><span><br />
</span></li><li><span>In exactly what way is the name of the combo box "used as a variable by VB code to update a back end table"? As and integer value<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>When you say, "<span>When I created the table I added the name of the combo box as the field&nbsp;of the new table", are you talking about the combo box's rowsource table?&nbsp; What are the names of the table and field? I called the table tlkp_Group_task,
 and filed grTache<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>You may be talking about two separate tables:&nbsp; the combo box's rowsource table, and the table to which each form is bound.&nbsp; Please clarify which is which.&nbsp; That is correct, right now there is not a table for the combo box only the big 129 items
 in the row source that are taking to update the table to which each form is bound, which is the end back table.
<br />
<br />

</span></li><li><span><span>As I mention I noticed that if I only want to use the values of the combo box from a list in a table I just have to get the table and do not use the control source and everything works well without problem. Is that correct.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>1. I created a table</span></span></li><li><span><span>2. I selected the table in the Rowsource</span></span></li><li><span><span>3.

            Hmm.&nbsp; If everything is now working the way you want, then we need not pursue this any farther.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure, though, that things are not set up the best way.&nbsp; It seems very odd that you would be using the form's Load event to set the values of bound
 controls on the form, unless the form can only very display a single record.&nbsp; Please make sure that you are getting the results you want in all cases.&nbsp; If so, that's fine.&nbsp; If not, let us know and we can dig deeper.

            How long have you have the account? This is not unusual for new accounts and for older accounts if you are traveling. 
<br />
<br />Did you add a phone number to the account?  Use two-factor authentication?

<h2>            &#34;You don&#39;t seem to be connected to the internet&#34; keeps popping up - but I think I am</h2>
                    <p>Message "You don't seem to be connected to the internet" keeps popping up in a little window in the middle of the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am connected to the internet, the lights on the modem are flashing away and I can use my browser and email with no delays or hangs, so why does this message keep popping up?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message doesn't seem to serve any purpose and is very annoying, can it be disabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Home Insider Preview Evaluation copy Build 14936.rs_prerelease.160923-1700</p>
