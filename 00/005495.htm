<p>That is the way that merging to email works.</p>
<p>You will either need a separate record in the data source for each person to whom the emails are to be sent, or use a "roll-your-own" VBA based substitute for mail merge to achieve what you are after.</p>

I am having the same issue, merging with data from Excel and I can't have a separate line as each line relates to an invoice number.
<br />
<br />
I initially had my two email addresses separated by a comma. The pop-up message from Word (2007) says:<br />
<br />
<i>"Microsoft Office Outlook does not recognize "email@domain,email2@domain".<br />
<br />
If you have used a comma to separate addresses; click Cancel, replace the commas with semicolons, and then click Send again."</i><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8f88cb5-33d6-40d5-ac19-2ba96bd6db53" /><br />
<br />
But changing to email@domain;email2@domain doesn't work - probably for the reason you gave above - but why then does this pop-up tell you otherwise?<br />

            If you save your CSV file as an Excel worksheet, you could use <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/ManyToOne.htm</a> &nbsp; which will allow you to use multiple addresses in a field separated by semi-colons and will also send them as BCC if you wish. Use the one to one option and merge to a message or to e-mail as Word or PDF attachment.
 The latter will also allow you to have a personalised covering message body.<br />

    <title>CSV File Field &#40;Cell&#41; Limitations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgensch  say:</h3>
<h2>            CSV File Field &#40;Cell&#41; Limitations</h2>
                    I save values from an Excel file to a CSV file for the sake of uploading to accounting software.&nbsp; There is one value in one of the fields in the CSV file of which when copied from Excel to the CSV file, the full value copies in just fine, but upon saving
 the CSV file, closing the CSV file, and then reopening the CSV file, one of the digits is cut off.&nbsp; The full value I want saved to the CSV file is 112978078.33.&nbsp; After saving, closing, and reopening, the value that shows up is 112978078.3 (the last 3 in .33
 is cut off making it a value of .30 instead of .33).&nbsp; I have two questions with this situation - First, are there any field (cell) limitations with CSV files?&nbsp; Second, is there something I can do to force the CSV file to accept the full value of 112978078.33
 upon saving the file besides trying to format the number (for uploads to be successful with this particular accounting software, I cannot format the value to anything other than the defaulted General)?

See a more complete explanation at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/db9436d5-3329-4afd-8b28-f21ffc89867e?threadId=0ba6fe3a-4bc6-4d98-a7f5-4183d6b5f1f0">

<br />
In a nutshell....&nbsp; When you open the CSV file, the cells are formatted as General.&nbsp; That format displays up to 11 characters -- in this case, 10 digits.&nbsp; When you save to a CSV file, Excel writes the numbers as they are displayed.<br />
<br />
The remedy:&nbsp; after you open the CSV file, change the cell formats accordingly.&nbsp; In this case, you might want Number with 2 decimal places.<br />
<br />
Better still:&nbsp; do not use CSV files to save Excel data if you intend to open them in Excel later.&nbsp; By definition, CSV files lose all formatting information.&nbsp; Instead, you should save to Excel to retain formatting information.<br />
<br />
(Saving to XML might also work if you need to "transfer" Excel data to another application.&nbsp; Of course, the other application must support XML input.&nbsp; But I have not experience with XML files.)<br />

<br />
Correct.&nbsp; If you look at the initial CSV file using Notepad, you will see that 112978078.33 is actually in the file.&nbsp; And that is actually what Excel inputs the first time; you can confirm by looking at the value in the Formula Bar.<br />
<br />
The value only appears as 112978078.3 because of Excel's display rules for the General format; namely, Excel will display only up to 11 characters, which might be further restricted due to column width.<br />
<br />
When you save to a CSV file, Excel writes what is displayed, not the actual value.&nbsp; So if you look the resulting CSV file using Notepad, you will see that 112978078.3 is truly in the file after re-saving.<br />
<br />
As noted previously, the only work-arounds are:&nbsp; (1) change the cell (column) format after opening or importing a CSV file; or (2) save to an Excel file, not a CSV file, after opening the CSV file the first time.<br />

            Thanks, Joeu.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the particular accounting software I work with is finnicky and won't accept uploads from CSV files if&nbsp;a field format is changed to Number - it will only accept data in General format.&nbsp; The software also won't accept uploads
 from just plain Excel files - file sources have to be CSV.&nbsp; I am in hopes, however, that the XML format you mention might be an acceptable format for the software.&nbsp; CSV has been our only option for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; I'm going to have our IT folks
 look into whether they can do something with the software to allow for accepting uploads from XML.&nbsp; If our software ends up being limited to strictly CSV though, I may just have to do a few things manually in the software after upload to ensure values end
 up being entered appropriately.&nbsp; Kind of a hope for the best, prepare for the worst situation (worst isn't really that bad though - just a nuisance).&nbsp; Regardless of the ultimate outcome, thanks to

<br />
Sorry, but I know for a fact that is incorrect.&nbsp; As I noted, a CSV file contains no formatting information.&nbsp; So the accounting software cannot know that the field had been formatted as Number.<br />
<br />
Formatting as Number with 2 decimal places ensures that numbers saved in a CSV file are in the correct format.&nbsp; I am quite certain that any account software accepts, if not even expects, numbers with 2 decimal places.<br />
<br />
<br />
[EDIT-2] And of course, I was only speaking of the cells (fields) that you are having trouble with; you used an example of numbers with 2 decimal places.&nbsp; And you might use Currency or Accounting instead of Number, if you need a currency symbol.&nbsp; (That was
 not apparent in your example.)&nbsp; Finally, you might use Percentage and Date where appropriate.&nbsp; But Excel sets those formats automagically if they are input an appropriate form.<br />

<br />
Caveat lector:&nbsp; I reiterate that I have no experience save to an XML file.&nbsp; I only assume that it will preserve the precision of the data regardless of how it appears.&nbsp; It should be simple enough for you to confirm.<br />
<br />
In any case, I understand that other applications might require CSV files.&nbsp; I was only saying that you should not save and reopen CSV files
<br />
Since you only mention uploading to accounting software, perhaps the "right" solution is for you to save the file twice, once as CSV for the accounting software, and again as an Excel file for your use.<br />
<br />
In either case, it is prudent for you to ensure that cells have the correct format.&nbsp; Relying on the General format is "sloppy" even if you are just using Excel, especially in an accounting workbook.<br />

<h2>            Cannot click the &#34;More Controls&#34; button when embedding a video.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Powerpoint 2007 on Windows XP and I can't seem to add a Youtube video to my presentation.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get as far as adding the Developer ribbon and then I can't go any farther. Everything in the control box (except 'View Code') under the Developer tag is gray and cannot be clicked. I'm really frustrated after playing around with it for several hours
 and I still am unable to click it. What could have caused this? What can I change so I can continue trying to embed a video?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks!</div>
                </div>

            Sounds like VBA is not installed. Hold down ALT and press f11. If nothing happens it's a fair bet you need to install VBA.<br />
<br />
Go to Windows &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features<br />
<br />
Select Office 2007 and "Change"<br />
<br />
Select Add / Remove Features and in the Shared Features section see if there is a red X next to Visual Basic for Applications. If so choose Run from my PC from the drop down and CONTINUE&nbsp; Wait for it to complete. You may need the original disc.<br />

<h2>            Collaborating on a Visio Diagram with others using Sharepoint 2013 and Data Linked Shapes</h2>
                    <p>We have been using the real time collaborating feature of Visio 2013 with Sharepoint 2013 to allow multiple users to work on the same Visio drawing in real time.&nbsp; If someone else makes a change to the drawing I am working on I am notified that updates are
 available and I can choose to show the updates.&nbsp; It all has been working really well until we recently tried linking an access database to the shapes.&nbsp; Now when another user tries to open the drawing they are warned that the drawing is currently in use and
 locked for editing.&nbsp; Is there any way to collaborate on a drawing that has shapes linke to data in an Access database?&nbsp; I even tried exporting the database to a Sharepoint List but we still have the same result.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>

<p>Press the Alt key that will bring up your Menu Bar with File Edit tools etc.... Once you see that toolbar right click anywhere on that toolbar and put a check mark next to the toolbars you want&nbsp; IE to display all the time. Hope that helps some.</p>

            Are the on-site users not caching the shared mailbox and the off-site user is caching it? That is the usual cause for different counts. The off-site users could turn off caching for shared folders, but it can make outlook feel slow as outlook needs to contact the server every time  the user opens the folder. 
<br />
<br />To clear the cached folder, right click on it and choose Proeprties, then click Clear offline items. Switch folders and if it hasn't resynced when you switch back, click the Update folder button on the send and receive tab.

<h2>            Install of Latest version 10112 hangs at 18&#37;</h2>
                    I've tried 3 or 4 times to install the latest version 10112 from 10074 and from Windows Update and ISO, all freeze at 18% completed process (62% files copied). This is on a dual boot system with Win7 on original partition and Win10 the the second. Haven't
 had any problems on any of the previous builds just the latest. Anyone with thoughts on why it hangs on install? Thanks in advance...

    <title>What do you really think about the hardware of your MS Lumia Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivicanesic  say:</h3>
<h2>            What do you really think about the hardware of your MS Lumia Phone</h2>
                    <p>Greetings community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several years ago I purchased Nokia Lumia 920, and I was pretty content with it. I could read all those mails with Words and Excels attached. Phone was working nicely, in spite that it was being&nbsp;accidentally dropped down many times. Seeing all that, my boss
 decided he wanted one too. During those years of using, Windows Phone became the phone of choice for him, it was giving him the functionality he needed - it was not the matter of preference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One month ago my boss decided to buy us all new phones. One day he came from our communication provider, and brought bag full of MS Lumia 950, one for each of us. So I took my new phone, and I wasn't happy with the feeling it gives when you touch it. That
 cheep plastic is something I wasn't able to forgive. I mean I would never come into the store, take something like that in my hand, get that tactile feeling,&nbsp;and then buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the ultimate saying about MS Lumia 950 was from my colleague. She said "This is the flagship?!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boss said he wasn't very happy either, but that was the best they had. They actually had only one "better" model, in fact almost same when it comes to functionality, but too big to be comforting, so my boss took this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders and went to buy additional plastic cover, and cover for screen, just in case it slips from my hand. I simply didn't believe it would survive. With touch of nostalgia I remembered that when I was to buy previous Nokia phone, I had
 seen on Youtube some guy testing its durability, stabbing it with knife and doing similar things. And I remembered face of my boss and how he decided to have one Windows phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean&nbsp;MS Lumia is&nbsp;not bad as a phone, and I'm sure that software will improve in time. Camera is fine, for those who use it. Screen is very good too. Phone works generally, and I didn't have any major issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for the hardware? Come on people, what in it could be called hardware? What's hard about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Nokia came in box that was twice smaller in volume than this one, still it came with headphones. I tried my old headphones with new phone and it doesn't work. I mean it's not that there's no sound from headphones, it's that when I plug in the headphones
 I still have sound from the speaker. Shouldn't the speaker be mechanically disconnected when you plug in the headphones? Isn't it the hardware problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to hear from all of you, and especially from those who owned some Nokia product, am I snob or I really have the reason? Do you people think that Microsoft should do the software, and let Nokia do the hardware? Do you think that packing flagship
 model without headphones at least, or more accurate without really good headphones, is a move from someone who does not know how to sell hardware. I mean, it's flagship for crying out loudly, and it came even without microfiber rug for wiping the screen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be OK to pack under&nbsp;$200 phone in plastic case and without headphones, but not the flagship.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think about hardware, people? What message should we send to Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Suggestion 1: Accessing List View and Notifications</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>From&nbsp;start screen on&nbsp;Windows Phone&nbsp;it makes sense to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Swipe left to access List View&nbsp;when holding phone vertically&nbsp;and swipe up to access List view&nbsp;when holding phone horizontally.</li><li>Swipe right from start screen (holding the phone vertically or horizontally) to access Notifications vs. swiping from top to bottom (unifying the windows experience from PC to Phone)</li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Suggestion 2: Add horizontal mode to Windows Phone</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Suggestion 3: 3rd tile screen option</span></p>
<ol>
<li>I would like to see bigger (at least double or triple of the)&nbsp;margin space between the most lateral tiles and edge of the screen to feature more of the background/personalization</li></ol>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've travelling from Australia to California in the next few weeks and am wondering if my Nokia 6300 will work over there on the Virgin network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Is there a Virgin network in the US? It doesn't seem to be listed here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever the case, your phone is a triband phone which will have the 900, 1800 and 1900 GSM frequencies. The US uses 850 and 1900, so your phone will work wherever it can get reception from a network that uses 1900, you'd have to check with your home network
 what its roaming partners in the US are and what frequencies they use.</p>

<h2>            How to Open OneNote Notebook backup&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you tell me how to open a OneNote <b>Notebook </b>from a backup. I can ind out how to open sections from the back up but not a whole Notebook. There doesn't seem to be files for Notebooks?<br />
<br />
I right clicked on a Notebook in OneNote and clicked 'Close'. I then tried to restore the Notebook from a backup but can only find sections and when I open them they open into the current Notebook.<br />
<br />
Hope you can help.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

            You have to restore each section at a time.&nbsp; A better idea is the Page Version feature in the History tab.&nbsp; This way you have multiple versions to select from and you can just tell the page to restore by clicking the yellow bar at the top.

            <p>Thanks hosch250 and CastroJenny,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is I sync my OneNote Notebooks to the wrong Skydrive account and it's an absolute nightmare trying to sync them to the right place now. Nobody at Microsoft has suggested anything that works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I was trying to do was delete the synced copies and restore the Notebooks from the backup but of course it's not as easy as that because Notebooks aren't files, only sections are. So I'm not quite sure what to do now :( When I open a section from
 the backup it doesn't open in the Notebook it originates from, it just opens as a section in any Notebook.</p>

            Create a new notebook at the new SkyDrive account.&nbsp; Right-click each section of the old notebook and select the Move or Copy (CTRL-ALT-M) link.&nbsp; Move each section, you needn't do each page - they move with the sections, to the new notebook.&nbsp; It will create
 a new section, and you will just need to wait for them to upload to the server.&nbsp; You can then delete your old notebooks, or just not use them and close them in your computer, from your old account.&nbsp; I had to do this fairly recently myself.

            You'd move the calendar &amp; contacts to the outlook.com calendar and contacts folder (or copy... or just move the ones you need to share.) 
<br />
<br />For the calendar, use a list view, select all and move or copy. (drag or use the move to folder command).

<h2>            nokia c6-01&#58; how to store SMS messages on MMC&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! Is it possible to make nokia c6-01 to store messages on memory card (mmc) instead of internal memory? How? I failed to find such configuration option that previosly existed on nokia 6600 and 5800XM... Search in forum and google reveals nothing, but probably
 I miss something evident. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>At the moment that option isn't present on S^3 devices like the C6-01 and it's unknown if it will be added in the future. So unfortunately messages can only be stored on the phones memory.<br />
<br />
Fortunately storing messages on the phone is a safer more reliable method. Also the C6-01 has tons of space and even with 1000's of messages very little of it is used. Messages can be exported to a PC if you do need the space plus it's unwise to keep several
 1000's of messages on any phone as it can slow down the messaging software.</p>

<p>Is there any way to ask developers for this feature? The problem is that I have about 2500 messages at the moment (that I'm going to sync from my previous phone (6-year history)) and it looks like if I do this all phone memory will be filled. Could you suggest
 anything, please? I don't want to loose messages becase I've bought newer (supposed to be better) phone...</p>

<p>That many messages won't fill the memory, it will barely touch it as text messages use up very little space. You'll only lose a few megabytes unless you've got a lot of MMS messages. It's fine for you to go ahead and transfer them.<br />
<br />
There is no direct way for end users to contact the developers, nokia care do pass feedback on and you can contact them via the "contact us" link near the top of the page. It's more likely that the developers purposely removed this feature due to the problems
 caused with past models when using phones in mass storage mode.<br />
<br />
Do you actually need six years worth of messages on your phone though? Having lots of messages may not take up much space but it can effect the performance of the phone's messaging software (2500 shoudn't effect the performance of that model). Would it not
 be better to store old messages on a PC instead (using nokia's ovi suite software)? &nbsp;That way if you lose your phone you don't lose six years of messages with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide the following information for our analysis:</p>
<p>1.Try exporting the affected list in the IE browser.</p>
<p>2.Check if the issue happens on all the lists or only this one when using Excel 2016.</p>
<p>3.Which app did you use to create this list, custom list, task list and so son?</p>
<p>4.Make sure you are using the latest version of Excel 2016. You can open Excel -&gt; File-&gt; Account-&gt; Update Options -&gt; update now to do that. Meanwhile, please share a screenshot of the page including
 Product Information as well as the Office version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sky </p>

            <p>Hi Charles, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had tried it in Office 2016, and it was ok on my side. The only difference is I'm using Office ProPlus 2016, while you are using Home and Business 2016. Anyway, it should make no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my steps: go to the list in SharePoint Online using IE -&gt; on the list ribbon-&gt; click Export to Excel -&gt;It will launch the Excel Application and then the list is exported to Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you can export it to Excel 2013 without problem, the issue should lie in Office 2016 client not SharePoint Online. Does this issue happen on 3 PCs which you mentioned? In addition, we suggest
 you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall Office</a> and reinstall it to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How can I set my time zone to update with websites to display PDT&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am in Vancouver, BC using PDT(Pacific Daylight Time). When I look at "My Quibids", all auction ended are in CDT(Central Daylight Time).&nbsp; My reply from Quibids was: The information you are wanting to display is controlled by your browser that you are using.
 If you are using Google Chrome then there is a work wrench icon right under the red X, that takes you to your options where you can set your timezone to update with websites to display in yours. If you are using any other browser I do not know where you would
 find the setting to change but the customer support for that browser would know exactly how to make that change to your browser, if it supports that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do, anyone?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Date and Time&gt;Change timezone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, usually websites use UTC (Universal time) and calculate that from your timezone preference selected from your profile.</p>
<p>Check your profile on quibids to see if they have a Timezone setting.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Timezone setting in Chrome, so it looks like the quibids support were talking through their hat like Adam Smith.</p>

            Hello HR, UK,<br />
<br />
I visited the yell.com site and I noted they state it only works on certain phones.&nbsp; You didn't mention what kind of phone you have, but you can check
<a href="http://www.yellmobile.com/supported_phones.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> to see if yours is compatible.<br />
<br />
Once you've done that would you please post back and let us know if that resolved your issue?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The only other thing specific to yell.com that you might check is how they transmit the maps; sometimes data plans won't transmit&nbsp;if device is&nbsp;"roaming" to prevent large bills from accumulating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If the above do not resolve the issue&nbsp;please provide the following when you post&nbsp;back&nbsp;so we can assist you further:<br />
<br />
<p><span>Make, Model, Manufacturer of Phone<br />
Cell phone service provider's name<br />
Version of Windows Mobile you are using<br />
<br />
Also, are you up to date with all drivers, updates, etc. for your phone ?<br />
<br />
If you have already tried soft or hard booting your device please advise which and steps you followed when doing so.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have posted back we can work on your solution.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thanks!!</span></p>
