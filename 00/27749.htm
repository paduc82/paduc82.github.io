<h2>            What&#39;s up with the start menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft has long years...decades, probably...of experience coding functional start menus for Windows.&nbsp; What has happened to all of that expertise inside Windows 10?&nbsp; I doubt anyone coding Windows 10 at present is simply incapable of creating something
 as robust as many Windows start menus of the past have been, so I'm wondering what the problem is...?&nbsp; The amount of time it's taking to cobble together a decently functional start menu for Win10 is remarkable considering the third parties that have already
 done it.&nbsp; I'm wondering when the Microsoft start menu for Win10 will be finished.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, certainly plausible...;)&nbsp; I don't know...this is something that's been seriously lagging for *years* now, as it was originally promised in what-would-have-been Win 8.2...a very long time ago in a galaxy far away...these guys ought to be able to program
 a robust start menu in their sleep...just boggles the mind how they're dragging their feet on this.&nbsp; I'm not really sorry they cancelled 8.2 and decided to go to Win10 because in the process they opted to make Win10 a free upgrade for us Win7/8 people...which
 I think is a terrific move.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I haven't yet heard Gabe opine on what it is that's so challenging about the start menu in Win10...if they've forgotten how to do it they can simply fire up Win7 and take a look...but I doubt that has anything to do with it.&nbsp; It's time now for them to
 start work on the start menu, making it robust and usable.&nbsp; With the start menu of old I could access and/or run every program on my machine right from the desktop--didn't have to open another screen and side&amp;vertically-scroll additional pages to do that.&nbsp;
 For the computers with real human-fingered keyboards that the great mass of us still choose to use, along with pointing devices an order of magnitude more precise than a greasy fingertip will ever be, a robust start menu cannot be beaten as a major GUI component,
 imo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because a GUI element has a long history doesn't mean it should be abandoned for something new and less useful--look at the "wheel" for instance...been with us since antiquity for ground transportation and nobody has come up with a suitable substitute
 since...;)</p>

            <p>Microsoft feigns ignorance at what users want, even though it's patently obvious to everyone except Microsoft. &nbsp;This entire windows insider program was stated as a way for us to influence the direction of windows, and their marketing materials continue the
 masquerade, but in reality all of the designs we are seeing were planned in advance, and our input was never incorporated. &nbsp;Case in point - the first two builds of Windows 10 for insiders had a somewhat functional start menu - not as full-featured as windows
 7, but not as useless as the one introduced with 9926 that continues until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first we heard the excuse that they're rebuilding the start menu in XAML, and then just crickets, meanwhile the current start menu is still useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's agenda isn't hidden. &nbsp;It's called Mobile First, Cloud First. &nbsp;The Windows 10 start menu is a copy of the Windows 8 Mobile Phone "all apps" and "tiles" views married together.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So now the desktop users, and tablet users, are being dragged kicking and screaming into the Windows Phone UI, because after all, Mobile First, Cloud First, and Microsoft knows best, but can't figure out what users want.</p>

            <p>Hey JWaltC and Hwrx, either of you guys been around long enough to remember the "New Coke" fiasco from a few decades back?&nbsp; This whole Metro/Modern tack that Microsoft has taken makes me think of that every time I use it.&nbsp; That didn't end well for Coca-Cola
 at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard Donald Keough the former President and CEO of Coca-Cola commenting on that a few years back.&nbsp; He said almost no one thought the "New Coke" was going to be a good thing but some in the company got this idea about it, it started rolling, got a life
 of its own and they didn't seem to be able to stop the thing before it actually hit the market.&nbsp;Even then they wasted tons of time and money trying to push it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;He had to go live on national TV and admit they had messed up a good thing really badly and apologized to all the consumers all over the world who were switching to Pepsi and Dr. Pepper and anything else rather than drink the "New Coke".&nbsp; Think it took
 someone of Keough's capabilities to&nbsp; finally do that and wonder if anyone at Microsoft has the wherewithal to do the same at some point.&nbsp; Any large corporation can mess up but only the good ones admit to it and try to make amends.&nbsp; That is why Coca-Cola is
 still around after 123 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not saying that Windows 10 and some of its concepts are all bad but just that Microsoft doesn't need to go and mess up a good thing that people like, know how to use and have a "taste" for.</p>

            <p>Yes I remember the new coke, which was intended to stop people from switching to pepsi. &nbsp;Instead, it alienated coke drinkers and drove them away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is doing the same thing. &nbsp;In order to stop defections to other platforms, Microsoft is trying to imitate the competition, which alienates their established 1.5 billion user base, that are using predominantly Windows XP and Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is being touted as the "mea culpa" for Windows 8 and the return to the desktop to unify both the established desktop user base and make a transition to Microsoft mobile platform seamless. &nbsp;Instead it's too little too late for the desktop user,
 and abandoning their former fanboy surface tablet lovers in favor of the vanishingly small number of windows phone users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, banks and other institutions are actively pulling their apps out of the Windows store because it's more trouble than it's worth, to support a platform that serves a ghost town. &nbsp;Out of desperation, Microsoft wants to shove the second-hand store
 that is the Windows app store, into the faces of all the Windows 7 and Windows 8 users, somehow thinking that it will make them like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: &nbsp;Most windows 8 users do not use metro apps. &nbsp;They use windows 8 solely for its ability to run Win32 applications, which Microsoft is undermining.</p>

            <p>I had surmised by following your posts that you might have a few years on you.&nbsp; I certainly do and perhaps that is why the change of Windows bothers me.&nbsp; I can certainly understand the economics and principles that MS is trying to take advantage of but they
 have certainly bitten off a huge piece to chew.&nbsp; Most certainly anything mobile is the future so it makes some sense to try and gear production to that market.&nbsp; But so hard to do that without alienating another market.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are certainly at a turning point--like switching from leaded to unleaded gasoline or from analog to digital broadcasting--in each event the old had to go for the new to take its place.&nbsp; Would like to think there were advantages with the newer technologies.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One OS for all appliances is certainly a dream scene but it is awfully hard to get it right in the real world.&nbsp; I didn't use W8/8.1 but followed its development.&nbsp; Seems the big deal was why MS couldn't ask during setup which appliance you were using and
 let the user install the proper interface for the job.&nbsp; Seems they are just making one interface and trying to get it to work on each appliance.&nbsp; Perhaps we ask for too much and the time isn't yet here.&nbsp; We are only seeing the beginning of the unified OS and
 it will get better in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main complaint is that W10 just hurts&nbsp;my eyes after a while.&nbsp; It is so stark and sharp and edgy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not much shading or fade-outs in the programs,&nbsp;primary bold colors.&nbsp; When I go back to W7 it is like going back to a comfortable chair.&nbsp; Everything is a
 bit more muted and pleasant on the eye.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some user choice would be a really nice thing but with the unified OS as it stands now there isn't a lot of option for it.&nbsp; Am hoping it will all improve before the&nbsp;final release.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm alarmed for Microsoft, but at this point, there's not much left to do than sit back and see what happens. &nbsp;They weren't listening, and nothing anyone says now will change that. &nbsp;There isn't enough time, and there isn't the leadership in the organization
 to make the "wisdom of solomon" decisions that will lead them through this. &nbsp;They have a ton of money, but this is still a pivotal time for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what's happening inside of Microsoft, but if they're not seized by a sense of urgency to fix Windows 10, it will be a train wreck if it's released for distribution in June. &nbsp;Windows is a part of our infrastructure, it's not just a luxury good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If coca cola nosedived because they had to stick to their guns with new coke, for internal political reasons, then it's not an issue of national concern. &nbsp;On the other hand, if Microsoft's new operating system is not accepted in homes, businesses, and government,
 the consequences won't be restricted to the stock market. &nbsp;Windows 7's end of life is in 5 years, which is not much time. &nbsp;At this point, mission critical computing should look for a post-microsoft plan B.</p>

<p>You mean that other kernel that's open source, auditable, and free? Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Right, that other kernel that powers something like 97% of the top 500 supercomputers, but can't get decent desktop marketshare, meanwhile Windows has less than 1%, actually, 1 out of 500 or 0.2%</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Linux only had a couple distributions, instead of a couple hundred it might become easier to adopt for the desktop. &nbsp;Desktop maintenance requires a rather broad cadre of people familiar with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that within a year of Windows 10's release, they will either produce a business oriented version of Windows 10 that isn't obsessed with trending clickbait, social media, appz and gamez, or give Windows 7 a new lease on life.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need a query that will count the number of occurences of more than one item in a field.&nbsp; In the example I want the query to return the number of times each letter appears in the Letters field.&nbsp; I'm able to produce a query that will return the results of
 each one done independently, but want it to return the results of all individually, possibly like such:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letter_A&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; Letter_B&nbsp; 2, Letter_C&nbsp; 1</p>

            <blockquote>I was hoping you could take me one step further with this?&nbsp; I was able to apply the same concept with Lunches, but now I need to get a daily total (sum) of receipts (payments received) by MealType.</blockquote>
<br />
It’s much the same but this time you multiply the value by the return value of the IIf function:<br />
<br />
SELECT OrderDate, <br />
SUM(PaymentReceived *IIF(MealID = 1,1,0)) AS [Free Breakfast],<br />
SUM(PaymentReceived *IIF(MealID = 2,1,0)) AS [Reduced Breakfast],<br />
SUM(PaymentReceived *IIF(MealID = 3,1,0)) AS [Full Price Breakfast]<br />
FROM Orders INNER JOIN [Order Details] ON Orders.OrderID = [Order Details].OrderID<br />
GROUP BY OrderDate;<br />

            You don't need a crosstab query for this.&nbsp; As you are counting only three fixed categories of meals you can use simple conditional aggregation:<br />
<br />
SELECT OrderDate, <br />
SUM(IIF(MealID = 1,1,0)) AS [Free Breakfast],<br />
SUM(IIF(MealID = 2,1,0)) AS [Reduced Breakfast],<br />
SUM(IIF(MealID = 3,1,0)) AS [Full Price Breakfast]<br />
FROM Orders INNER JOIN [Order Details] ON Orders.OrderID = [Order Details].OrderID<br />
GROUP BY OrderDate;<br />
<br />
Each computed column sums the return value of an expression which returns 1 or 0.&nbsp; Summing the ones is therefore the same as counting the instances of rows which meet the criterion.&nbsp; Note that you do not need to include the table which contains the text meal
 type values as the meal types are returned as column headings here not data.<br />

<h2>            Separate same emails for 2 accounts on same laptop</h2>
                    I had 2 accounts on my laptop, 1 for myself &amp; 1 for my wife. We both used the same email address. Both accounts received the same emails but we were able to keep separate emails relevant to each other in our own accounts. How was this done?

<p>Morning Ron</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the short description but I only had 250 characters to describe the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Outlook installed on my laptop but my email account was via my Sky account which operates using Yahoo mail. I have had a look at my EMail account in Outlook and it states the Tyoe is IMAP/SMTP. (Not sure if you need to know this.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I tried to describe briefly before, on my laptop, both my wife &amp; I had separate accounts which we would log into using separate account names &amp; passwords. My account was also set up as the administrator. The laptop operated with Windows 10. Although we
 had separate accounts we both used the same email address. On each account, we would both receive the same emails but I could
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>create folders in my Outlook account relevant to my requirements and these would not appear in my wife's Outlook account.</li><li>delete emails in my account which were not relevant to myself and these would then remain within my wife's account.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>The same was vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had issues with my laptop which had to have a new hard drive installed. I recreated the two accounts on the fixed laptop for myself &amp; my wife and reinstalled Microsoft Office.</p>
<p><span>My data was retrieved from the old system so I imported the old .pst file from each old account into Outlook on each new account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We both still receive the same emails but if I try to create folders &amp;/or delete emails in my Outlook account, the same action takes place in my wife's Outlook account. Do you know what could have changed and how to separate these actions again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help is greatly appreciated.</p>
        </p>

<p>IMAP will sync any changes between an Outlook account and the email server.</p>
<p>You need to setup the your email and your wife's email account using pop3.&nbsp; This only downloads emails from the server.</p>
<p>The IMAP setup accounts have to be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is for one person to get a new email account.</p>
<p>The new account will have separate email and OneDrive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've migrated from Lotus Notes and find the only thing I miss is the ability to force Outlook to file my emails into a specific folder. I found the below code which helps a lot, however I am missing an 'are you sure' prompt to prevent typos being sent..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, I want this code but for the cancel button to not return 'false' and instead just revert to the unsent message. Please could someone aid a VBA beginner?</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint object vertical lock horizontal not</h2>
                    <p>In PowerPoint, I draw a shape. For discussion say a rectangle. After drawing the rectangle I want to change its dimensions. I select the little box to the left or right in the middle of the sides to change width. No problem. I select the corners to change
 width and height at the same time. No problem. I select the little box in the middle of the top or bottom to change height. It always snaps back to the original shape.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go back to the corners to change height. I can go to the menu and type in some measurement to change height. But it fails if I try to use the mouse to drag the shape using the little box in the middle of the top or bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can rotate the rectangle. Now I can change height, but not width. So the problem rotates with the object.</p>

</p><p>Your maths is not correct, in the original question the negative applies to the 5, but in your version of the 'addition' and 'subtraction' line the negative applies to the 6 as well, giving you the swing of 12 in your answers.</p>

    <title>Excess white space between chart columns &#40;weekly plot&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bailey_wm_f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excess white space between chart columns &#40;weekly plot&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Excel 2010 to create a stacked column chart of a weekly data series. There will be 52 columns in the chart, each of which will display 4 stacked series for that week's data. When I finish the chart, the columns are pencil thin with a huge amount
 of white space between them. I have changed the gap width and overlap to every conceivable combination to no avail.
</p>
<p>It now occurs to me that since the X-axis is formatted to show "days" and only one out of every 7 days has data associated with it, that the white space is actually being reserved by Excel for the other six days of data. Unfortunately, there is no "Weeks"
 option for an X-axis time scale; only "Days", "Months" and "Years". How can I get Excel to correctly format the data series to display 52 weeks with appropriate-width stacked columns?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            Try renaming each of the week as Week 1, Week 2.... Week 52 and then under Chart Tool (you will get this on the ribbon when you select the chart) --&gt;Layout (Tab)--&gt; Axes --&gt; Primary Horizontal Axis --&gt;More Primary Horizontal Axis Function ---&gt;Format Axis
 --&gt; Number, select <strong>General</strong> instead of Date.&nbsp; This should reformat the label to your desired choice.

<p>Hi PJasmin,</p>
<p>The typical solution to this kind of problem is to turn off Gatekeeper long enough to run the installer (System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General &gt; Allow apps downloaded from &gt; Anywhere)</p>
<p>If it’s convenient, could you try re-downloading it or changing a different network environment to see if there’s any improvement?</p>
<p>After referring to the information above, and if this issue persists, try using the link below to download and install it:<br />

    <title>Corrupt OST file stops outllok from opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt OST file stops outllok from opening</h2>
                    <p>I was halfway through installing a new email account when my PC locked up.&nbsp; Now I cannot open Outlook, it stays at the splash screen.&nbsp; I can delete the OST file at fault but outlook just tries to recreate it and still won't start.</p>
<p><br />
Outlook will not start in safe mode unless I add new accounts, but I can't stay in safe mode forever!!!</p>
<p>There should be an easy way to delete OST files and start again but this doesn't seem possible.</p>
<p>Windows 10, Office 365, Outlook 2016</p>

<p>hi lee,</p>
<p>most account types other than pop3 use an offline outlook data file (.ost). when the connection to the mail server is interrupted, you still can read and compose messages as it is a cache file in your computer. after you delete the file, it can be re-created
 by itself. however, the fact that outlook client still cannot be opened is abnormal. to better understand the situation, i’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;regarding the title “<em>corrupt ost file stops outllok from opening</em>”, do you mean you have got an error message saying&nbsp;the ost file has corrupted even it has been deleted? if so, please provide the screenshot of the error message. to upload screenshots,
 please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and then select the <strong>insert/edit media</strong> button.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/107a228e-956d-423b-8f17-631a772bd1fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/107a228e-956d-423b-8f17-631a772bd1fe" /></a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;how did you delete the ost file?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;about “<em>outlook will not start in safe mode unless i add new accounts</em>”, can you provide the screenshots about how you add new accounts to open the outlook account?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;have you tried creating a new profile to fix the issue? you can refer to the article by clicking the link below to create a new profile:<br />

<p>5.&nbsp;what kind of account is configured on the outlook client, the office 365 exchange online account or any other account?</p>
<p>thanks,<br />
gary</p>

<h2>            Typing and Handwriting on the Same Lined Document</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Word Experts of the World,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to create a lined word document for both typing (on a laptop) and handwriting (when opened in word for android on my Note8).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The lines should:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Be static - not move whatsoever when text or handwriting/drawing is added or removed</li><li>Be a fixed distance from one another.</li><li>Be aligned with the bottom of each line of typed text</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>What I've tried so far to no avail:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Drawing lines and sending them to the back.
<ul>
<li>These kept moving when typing.</li></ul>
</li><li>Creating a table
<ul>
<li>When typing, the text at the end of each line would wrap and automatically resize the row.
<ul>
<li>Finding a way to automatically wrap text into the next cell in the column would be a great way to fix this!</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Making an image of loose leaf the background for the page
<ul>
<li>The typing would never line up exactly
<ul>
<li>Finding the exact image size and locking in the paragraph line spacing to match the dimensions would fix this perhaps</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Thanks In Advance,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Hi Suzanne,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not solve for the problem, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this article is great for form fields that have one line only, it does not address form fields that have multiple lines that wrap and still maintain the "underline" effect without having to format-as-you-go.</p>

            Drawing lines are the best way to go for this situation. Provided you set their position exactly and match the spacing to your paragraph spacing, they will work.

    <title>Inserting pictures into a restricted document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobgalivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting pictures into a restricted document</h2>
                    I am trying to create a form in which page 1 is restricted to filling in form fields, while page 2 has a fixed width table that the user can drag/drop pictures into.<br />
<br />
If I insert a section break at the end of page 1, and restrict the document to filling forms, selecting ONLY section 1, you cannot insert a picture into the table, even though it's supposedly not restricted.
<br />
<br />
Unrestricted the document, you can insert fine.<br />
<br />
I even tried creating a simple two page document. Section 1 protected, section 2 not, and you cannot insert a picture into the supposed unrestricted page. Very frustrating<br />

http://www.gmayor.com/photo_gallery_template.html</a> which was designed with this task in mind - it should be possible to graft your form on to the gallery, or create the form and gallery separately and combine them as a PDF or at print time.<br />
<br />
Greg Maxey, with whom I frequently collaborate, has developed an add-in from my template, which features a similar set of functions (and one of two other things). I have only just received his latest updates, but you can see his take on things at

I personally wanted this application to be in the form of a document template, so the add-in version will be hosted on his site rather than mine.<br />

<h2>            outlook email addresses not formatted correctly</h2>
                    <p>I am not using the beta version of Outlook and I have Chrome.</p>
<p>I entered a list of new contacts and tried to bcc them on an email and got the message they were not formatted correctly when I typed their name in the bcc line.</p>
<p>So instead of typing their name in the bcc line I typed their email address which then switched to their name and I was able to send the email. But this was all very time consuming. Why did this happen?</p>

<br />
Security Essentials does not have a firewall built in.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You will need to use the Windows XP&nbsp;firewall, which is more than adequate.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Try this combination before loading another firewall, test drive it for a bit, and I think you'll be pleased.<br />

    <title>pagination in Word 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> conejobob  say:</h3>
<h2>            pagination in Word 10</h2>
                    <p>I am a published writer who is trying to submit a manuscript.&nbsp; However, when I save the document, the pagination is not saved. When I reload the document I'll find that the pagination has not been kept as previously set. I will find that a later chapter
 begins with page 1. This may, in fact, happen in several chapters: I will find that the box where I had previous checked that the pagination is to continue from the previous section is no longer checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an ongoing problem. I asked about this once before but was given a complicated collection of program commands to add to the manuscript. It seems that the program should work as the instructions indicate. I am using Office 10 on a Windows 7
 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Doug. Thank you very much for your help. I loaded Word 10 in safe mode as you suggested. I found only 1 place in the manuscript where the direction to continue numbering from the previous section was not checked, which is an improvement on previous numbering
 problems which usually happened in 4 or 5 places. I rechecked the "continue numbering" box at that 1 place in the manuscript, checked that the numbering continued as it was supposed to all the way to the end (485 pp) and then saved the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, when I reopened the document (in safe mode) the"continue numbering from previous section" box that I had just checked was again unchecked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rats! Any more suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, Robert</p>

            <p><span>Not sure how long your document is, but if the pagination is not working, it may be worthwhile to remove all page numbers, and start with new pagination. &nbsp;Because you have several section breaks, start at the beginning of the
 document and “Edit Footer.” Some sections may have footers linked, so you may have to unlink them. Take your time and go through the entire document and remove the page numbers. Once all footers are removed, start over. With section breaks numbering may be
 a tedious process. Take your time and go through using the page numbering and footer menus. Make sure you have show/hide button on so you can see page breaks and sections breaks. Also the link below may help you.

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code you present will most likely do the trick if Robert is familiar with troubleshooting with code, etc., however, as stated in his post:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span><em>I asked about this once before but was given a complicated collection of program commands to add to the manuscript."</em></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I felt that starting clean with page numbers may eliminate&nbsp;lots of trial and error. I have experienced problems with pagination and sometimes starting over is the best choice.</span></span></p>

<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some time, @ least back during 7, I had pretty much quit using the Start menu. Had Quick Launch &amp; some ways to easily access things that rendered frequent Start menu use unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Win8.1 has none.&nbsp; And, whilst NOT using its Start screen nor any 3rd Party start things... absolutely, no problem.<br />
<br />
Anyway, many wanted a Start menu.&nbsp; Along comes Win10 and a Start menu.&nbsp; Of course, many then, say it's not good enough.&nbsp; Now, there is one that was wanted but, now, IT gets criticised.&nbsp; But, aside from the fact that one can put whatever one wants on it and
 it offer an All Programs (Applications) list one can scroll...<br />
<br />
There is this:<br />
<br />
An Applications window; instead of hitting Start menu &amp; scrolling through a list.<br />
The Desktop Toolbar.&nbsp; All (default &amp; assigned)&nbsp;desktop items, and expanding, drill-down, paths. (And no icons, actually,&nbsp;showing on the Desktop)<br />
Jumplists, pinning and Quick Access are in the mix, too, of course. OR can be... oft more than one route w/ Windows.<br />
And IF Taskbar Search is not used, Start menu opens for Search via Win key or hitting Win logo.&nbsp; Other than that the SO NECESSARY Start menu is only seen VERY rarely.<br />
<br />
Basically, prefer an Applications window &amp; Desktop Toolbar to (any) Start menu that allegedly is SO imperative to have or that must be improved.<br />
<br />
A funny thing happened on the way to the Start menu... it didn't get used.<br />

<p>I know you have been trying to sell this idea over several threads for months now. So far no takers. Just because you don't want it, does mean we can't have it.</p>
<p>Btw, did I respond to the right message?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't think you did.&nbsp; There was nothing about my not wanting anything or anything about others who can't have something or anything.<br />

Best way I can answer you is to say it is referring to<br />
<br />
Rt Clk on the Taskbar &gt; Toolbars &amp;&nbsp;click on&nbsp;<strong>Desktop</strong><br />
<br />
This shows it in use:<br />

<h2>            ZOHO Mail account not working in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have zoho mail accounts in our company. We can configure them with iPhone, Android, Thunderbird for PC and Outlook for Mac...</p>
<p>But when we try to configure them (POP/SMTP) in Outlook 2010 for PC it does not work... saying server is not responding... which is nonsense as it works in any other client mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats wrong and what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Do what has been recommended about two hundred times already in this community - accept the fact that the motherboard has developed a fault, take it to your nearest authorised repair center for evaluation, and when they tell you the cost of a new motherboard
 replacement buy yourself a new phone, because it will probably be cheaper.<br />
