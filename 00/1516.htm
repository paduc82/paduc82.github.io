<h2>            N810 and Wayfinder GPS</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am trying to upgrade Maps to Wayfinder Navigator, both on my N810 and on my PC, and neither works.&nbsp; Wayfinder's website is horrible, each time I try to buy something it returns me to the main shop page.&nbsp; I want to upgrade, but I can't, does anyone
 have any solutions?&nbsp; I've tried contacting Wayfinder through support twice and I haven't received any replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to upgrade through my N810, it says that there is no purchasable software available for my version of Maps (which is completely up to date).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, sorry if I sound desperate, but I am.&nbsp; I actually want to pay for a 12 or 36 month upgrade but CAN'T because of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Ron</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I have contacted Wayfinder and received that answer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
"Unfortunately <font color="#ff0000"><strong><span>we have now ende<span>d</span></span></strong></font> the sale for the Wayfinder Navigator for Internet Tablet-product."</p>

<p>If indeed this is the case that Wayfinder is not supporting the N810 any longer then i fully regret buying the device, since the GPS portion was a major part of the deal for me. If any body has suggestions PLEASE post it here.</p>

<p>It looks as though things have changed again! When I tried to purchase a license I received the message, "There are no purchasable options for your version of Wayfinder Navigator".<br />
<br />
When I tried the Wayfinder support site, they told me, "The product 'Wayfinder Navigator for Internet Tablet' has been discontinued meaning that it is no longer possible to purchase navigation licenses for the application."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there is an alternative?</p>

<p>I made my decision to purchase the Nokia N810 based on the GPS navigation ability provided by Wayfinder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was not an inexpensive device. My money would have been spent much better elsewhere. I understand that things don't always work out the way we hope. That's for me or for Nokia. My criticism of Nokia at this point is how they seem to be treating this
 as a non-issue and that they have no responsibility. They should, in my opinion, be doing everything they can to help the people who bought their device to get useable software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be treating Nokia as a non-issue until they do.</p>

<p>Isn't Wayfinder a third-party product? If they have decided not to support Nokia anymore, what can Nokia do? Really?</p>

<p>Why are you complaining to Nokia anyway, shouldn't you target your complaints to Wayfinder instead?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Isn't Wayfinder a third-party product?</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes and no. The availability of the navigation service on N810 was one of the key features of the device from *Nokia* and was strongly promoted by *<span>Nokia*</span>. Please note that the official specifications of<span> Nokia</span> N810, directly from
<span>Nokia</span> webpage, say:<br />
&nbsp;* Premium services available on purchase including Wayfinder navigation.<br />
(<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-n810/specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.<span>nokia</span>.com/support/product-support/<span>nokia</span>-n810/specifications</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearly, Nokia</span> has committed itself to provide the navigation service as this service was and still is officially specified by
<span>Nokia</span> as the feature of the device. It is absolutely irrelevant whether the service is provided by
<span>Nokia</span> directly or by a different provider, as long as it exists. Clearly, the fact that
<span>Nokia</span> has chosen to provide the service through a different provider does not discharge its obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>If they have decided not to support Nokia anymore, what can Nokia do? Really?</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you sign contract for a service (irrelevant whether to be used by yourself or by your customers) and don't get it what do you do? Really?</p>
<p>There are only two possibilities:</p>
<p>1.The contract between Nokia and Wayfinder did not guarantee the Wayfinder service to N810 customers for at least a reasonable period of time (I could not even use the service while my N810 was less than 1 year old and still in warranty!).</p>
<p>2. The contract did guarantee the service but Nokia did not enforce it and/or no financial compensation from breaking the contract was agreed and/or Nokia did not pass the financial compensation to its N810 customers in form of refund for the missing feature.</p>
<p>In either case, Nokia failed to ensure providing the service it promised to its customers or to compensate its lack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Why are you complaining to Nokia anyway, shouldn't you target your complaints to Wayfinder instead?</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Wayfinder provided all the service I bought from it. Who failed to provide a feature of the device (again, availability of the navigation service IS listed a feature of the device) is the manufacturer. Based on the facts above, Nokia should provide a
 refund of the<br />
missing <span>Nokia</span> N810 device feature or offer a full refund of the device with the device<br />
returned to Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my requests for refund were refused. I do not doubt that my chances to win potential trial are close to zero. However, what I can still do is to warn any Nokia customer: do not trust *any* service of Nokia that is not running directly on your device
 - it is likely that Nokia will shut it down at some point and you end up with a "fully-functional" device, perhaps even still in warranty, but not able to provide you the service you need by any means.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Maemo version of Wayfinder was not open sourced.</p>
<p>The refund is from Wayfinder (Vodafone) for N810 subscriptions that were cancelled.</p>
<p>There is no refund for unavailability of the navigation service on N810 - something to blame Nokia for.</p>

    <title>Svchost.exe HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockttiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Svchost.exe HELP</h2>
                    Help here, okay so I've recently bought a new laptop about 3 days ago. So far the ONLY programs I have installed are Norton Internet Security and a copy of Photoshop Cs5. The other programs were already preinstalled. So mainly I was going to use this high
 graphics laptop for digital art. And I have no saved files yet, only those two softwares installed.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyhow, as I was running Photoshop Cs5 a pop-up from Norton appears warning me about High Preformance alert from Svchost.exe.&nbsp;</div>
<div>And I am not new to Svchost.exe I understand that in some cases this application is essential to Windows. However, this was not the first time this had happened to me. On my previous laptop before it had crashed, Norton notifications about the exact same
 problem started to show up, and I noticed that not only was my laptop getting slower, but it also would not allow me to open Norton and a ton of viruses flooded the system and crashed my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what I am wondering is, how do I know when this host is a virus or not? Could it have been Photoshop Cs5 that had a form of malware along with it, or is it normal for it to appear? I do have to note that my previous laptop had some heavy game, and other
 application installations so that also might have been why it crashed due to the heavy amount if downloads it had. And this warning has only appeared once, and that was yesterday when utilizing Photoshop Cs5.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone can also help by telling me how to remove this file if it is indeed a virus, I would be entirely grateful because I'm sitting here racking my brains off hoping that this new laptop will not carry the same doom to the previous one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please and thanks.</div>

            <p>"high performance" sounds to me more like Norton is observing and reporting that a process is using lots of resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>svchost is a Windows process. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the report is coming from Norton, I suggest that you contact Norton Support for advice.</p>

    <title>Excel Timesheet Calculation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrylstrohan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Timesheet Calculation</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a formula for a timesheet I am making. What I am looking for is to figure out the number of hours worked from 0:00 - 08:00. To give a little bit go background. I have a column for start time and end time, (all columns are in number format
 not time). I then have other columns that have calculation to figure out overtime, and 5 other shift differentials. The only why to explain this is to give an example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I was to work from 01:00 to 10:00, I would need a formula for a shift differentials that take place from 00:00 to 08:00, so this would be 6 if we went back to the example. But if I was to work from 02:00 to 04:00 in the morning, that same shift differentials
 would still apply in this situation is would just be 2 instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shift differential is 00:00 - 08:00 anything In this ranges need to be considered; start time only, start and end time only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the following formula to get it to somewhat work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF("Start Time"&lt;8, 8-"Start Time", 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is falls short is if the start time is 02 and the end time is 04 it calculates to 6 .</p>

<p>I don't know how you arrive at 6 if the hours worked between 00:00 and 08:00 were from 01:00 to 10:00</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the start and finish are always on the hour I believe that the formula that you need to calculate the hours worked between 00:00 and 08:00 is</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF("Finish Time" &lt;=8, "Finish Time", 8) - "Start Time"</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The finish time, which I am assuming would be the End Time in my case, will vary. For example. I might work from 1 -8, 2-10, and 01-05 all different days. In all cases the hours working from 01-08, 02-08, and 01-05 need to be counted for and calculated
 correctly. so it they should calculate to 7,6, and 4</p>

<h2>            It is a question from all windows phone lover&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Messenger: It is now popular apps for mobile platform.But interestingly windows phone has this app with limited features.No voice and video call option like Android and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imo: Microsoft Store has a Imo app but surprisingly that app is spam.No true Imo app is present in Store!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viber: A nice viber app has in store but with no video call option like Android and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is that how long windows phone users served by this types of less featured apps?What is the actions from Microsoft to solve this issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above that 3 apps representing the whole scenario of apps for Windows Phone. Windows phone can't succeed untill solve this issues.<br />

<p>
</p><p>
Yes you are right,these apps are third party app.But why they developing their apps with full version for Android or iOS and demo version for Windows Phone??It should be a headache of Microsoft that their platform is immature for apps developers.For this Microsoft
 has to push the apps developers for quality apps that is done by Android or iOS.Also Android or iOS give importance on region /country wise popular apps and push the apps developers for that region /country wise popular apps .Is Microsoft doing this for his
 windows phone users??????</p>

            Android and iOS do not push anyone for anything. It is 100% up to the app developer to decide what app to publish in which app store. Again, you are asking in the wrong place - you should ask the app developers about their plans and intentions.<br />

<p>
</p><p>ok thanks for your reply.Consumers have no headache to ask the apps developers to develop a apps.If then millions of consumer will ask millions of apps from developers.I think so that it is not done by Android or iOS users.It is totally depending on acceptance
 of a platform to apps developer to develop a app.The ultimate solution is that if this apps situation is not change within a short period of time the windows phone will dead forever and we have to switch to Android or iOS.Best of luck Windows Phone!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            Forms created on a PC in Office 365 don&#39;t work in office Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have some forms that my wife created using Office 365 on a PC using Windows 10, When I open them in Office 2016 for Mac, they are no longer forms but all the background information on those forms is active and accessible. I have tried protecting the document
 but to no effect. Interestingly they work on Office 2011 for Mac! I'm using a 2017 Macbook Air running OS 10.14.2. and Office 2016 16.16.6 (190114)</p>
<p>Any suggestions as to how to fix this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>We've tested this based on your description in the same Office 2016 for Mac version as yours as well as the latest version of Office for Windows and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In addition to John's advice, we would like to confirm the following:<br />
1. Does this happen to specific files only? Try creating forms to a new and blank document.<br />
2. Can you try to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2398596/how-to-use-a-clean-startup-to-determine-whether-background-programs-ar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
start your Mac in Safe Mode</a>? See if your forms are working there.</p>
<p>

    <title>Office Lens uses incorrect OneNote destination, I cannot change it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office Lens uses incorrect OneNote destination, I cannot change it</h2>
                    <p>Office Lens has nice features, but this inconvenience is troubling.</p>
<p>Office Lens can send to OneNote. It uses a default location and it offers the user to select a location, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>the default location cannot be changed. On Windows 10 mobile, it will even create the OneNote notebook it thinks is the default.
</li><li>the user can select an alternative location, but this choice is neglected and it will use the default location, so in my case again create the notebook it wants.</li></ul>
<p>(I have seen a similar question from an Android user).</p>
<ul>
<li>I removed and reinstalled Office Lens, but it does not allow settings to be changed in this case either. I only could add a second account. It even does not asks for passwords, so it hooks onto another app. (I use a private (outlook.com) and a company (O365)
 account on the mobile.</li><li>OneNote is built in on Windows 10 mobile, so I cannot remove and reinstall it, in the hope of changing parameters.</li></ul>
<p>Any ideas, hints or other useful stuff will be gratefully accepted</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Encryption and rights Protection</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have created a mail flow rule in exchange admin center, when ever someone enters the word encrypt in the subject line it applies "Office 365 Message Encryption and Rights Protection". When ever I attach an excel file in the email, recipients are having
 problem in accessing it. They are able to view online but unable to edit it. This is what it shows</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1b5f7b0-95dc-44a8-bbeb-11bdfd88ebe9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1b5f7b0-95dc-44a8-bbeb-11bdfd88ebe9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>when they try to download, this is what it shows.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Can anyone let me know why is this showing. I am just trying to send documents secure but the recipient should be able to download and access the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

</p><p>I am not selecting anyone of these, just entering the word encrypt in the subject line and in the mail flow we have created the rule to apply "<span>Office 365 Message Encryption and Rights Protection" when ever we enter
 encrypt in subject line.</span></p>

<h2>            VBA macro running Solver fails to update cells</h2>
                    I am trying to run a VBA macro that makes multiple calls to Solver &nbsp;in Mac 2011 code. &nbsp;The macro works without problem on Windows machines. &nbsp;On the Mac the problem is that the macro runs on prior to receiving the Solver output. &nbsp;Thus, the cells are not
 updated with Solver output. &nbsp;This problem is specific to the Mac. &nbsp;VBA and Solver apparently are not communicating. &nbsp;Any suggestions?V

            I will take this path when our developer support contact man is back from leave. Thanks Jim!
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime I have created a solution using two functions that call Solver and mop up afterwards, but must use a fixed delay to allow solver time to work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wonder if anybody is aware of an event that could call my vba function when the solver app has completed?</div>
<div><br />
<div>That would make it run quite a bit faster.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is the code concept I used as a stimulation to those that follow down this path.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have made all the references directly use cell addresses &nbsp;eg D3 etc.</div>
<div>In practice these are computed from an array of text cells at fixed locations around the button</div>
<div>For this example I also loop from 1 to 20 although actually these are also button defined vars</div>
<br />
<p>D3 holds the data selector/pointer This pulls all the ith data set into the solver area</p>
<p>Q4:R8 are the initial guesses</p>
<p>T4:U8 are the parameters to optimise</p>
<p>AF8 is the evaluated function to minimise</p>
<p>J60:S60 is an vector of results and parameters computed from the solver output</p>
<p>J62:S62 is an array of results and parameters stored after solution found</p>
<p>So J62:S62 will hold results for data selector 1, J63:S63 for data selector 2 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>MySolver is the sub to start the process and is invoked by a button.</p>
<p>It sets up a time event driven second function called SolverCycle</p>
<p>That function also sets up a time event driven call to itself</p>
<br />

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SolverOk SetCell:=”AF8”, MaxMinVal:=2, ByChange:=”T4:U8”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next V </p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope I have not made any stupid mistakes in the simplification process.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now if that Application.OnTime event could be replaces by the equivalent of:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Application.OnFinish "Solver", "SolverCycle" &nbsp; &nbsp; (ie when Solver finishes, run SolverCycle)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>things would run much faster. &nbsp;(This function does not exist - I made it up?)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The 10 seconds used in the timer event MUST be longer than the worst Solver fitting time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone out there</p>
<p><br />
</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I tried using a Do While loop with DoEvents to kill time while Solver did its work, but Solver never starts its work while the routine is still running, so Do While never detects a change in the target cell.</p>

<p>I am having a similar problem. I thought only some messages were delivering locally. In fact I am only getting a copy of some of the messages. When I check my mailbox with OWA I have messages that are not delivering at all and a copy of the messages that
 did deliver are still sitting in the server mailbox.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 710 can&#39;t download apps</h2>
                    Greetings fellas. :)&nbsp;<br />
I wanted some help with my Moms Nokia Lumia 710.&nbsp;<br />
We can't really do the internet stuff on it. That's the problem.&nbsp;<br />
When i try to download an app/game. It would say:<br />
Sorry, you need to do this froum your computer because your account indicates that you are a child. To join Xbox LIVE, go to xbox.com and sign in with your Windows Live ID. To purchase content from Marketplace, sign in at zune.net or using the Zune software
 on your PC.&nbsp;<br />
I tried joining xbox live. So i logged into that account from the internet explorer in the phone. When i went to try an app. The same happened again. I believe this is a major problem so i would like an answer to a fix for this.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks. :)<br />

            Joe, don't bother with user profiles and preferences.
<div><br />
<div>Word V.x is able to add captions through the contextual menu only to pictures placed "In line with text." If the picture is floating (any of the other
<i>Layout&nbsp;</i>options), the "Caption" choice disappears from the contextual menu. You need to select the picture and use the menu choice
<i>Insert &gt; Caption.</i>
<div><br />
<div>There must be a reason for this inconsistency, but only "sloppy" comes to mind.</div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
You cannot download/transfer sub folders from webmail when you've configured the email account s POP3 account.
<br />
<br />
Synchronizing or subscribing to the sub folders only works in IMAP, Outlook Connector (MAPI) or Exchange server email account.<br />
<br />
1) You might have to manually copy/move the emails from subfolder to Inbox folder on the webmail.<br />
2) Create different folders in Outlook and perform Send/Receive emails in Outlook.<br />
3) Wait for the emails to be downloaded in Outlook and move/copy the emails to different subfolder and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            This is all well and good to say go to a Nokia care centre, but they want R200 to do it... Is that fair considering non swap phones get to update for free? Is there really no way for those of us with swap phones, thanks to Nokia breaking the original phone,
 to update for free or in a reasonable amount of time. Four days to do the update for free seems a bit much when it takes an hour at home.

<h2>            Site Permission</h2>
                    
<p>I am SharePoint Site administrator. I already created users group Owner, Team Member and Viewers.</p>

<p>My question is which is the best practice in assigning permission,</p>
<p>1. Should I assign all these 3 groups at Site level and the libraries will inherit the permission. At library level I will remove group not require in that library.</p>
<p>2. Can it be only Owner assigned at Site level and at library level assign the&nbsp;appropriate group.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Numan,</p>
<p>As @Amite and @Panos said, we recommend managing site permissions at the site level and using permission inheritance. It will be much easier to manage and explain permissions when there is a clear hierarchy of permissions and inherited permissions.</p>
<p>Moreover, for sensitive documents, we recommend you create a site or a library specifically, rather than having them scattered in a larger library and protected by unique permissions. For these kinds of files, you can refer to the “<strong>Best Practices:
 Plan for unique permissions</strong>” section in this article:<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Introduction-Control-user-access-with-permissions-ab2d1ab1-07cf-4c69-bdd9-390bfd787b26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Introduction: Control user access with permissions</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about planning your site permission strategy, you can refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Plan-your-permissions-strategy-c6183e49-9287-4689-999e-0d3f817a41a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            synaptics touchpad disabled after wake from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I believe several other people have reported problems with their Synaptics touchpad not working after waking from sleep, but I didn't see an answer or acknowledgement from MSoft about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem on a Sony Vaio laptop...touchpad is non-functional on wake from sleep. Is the answer to wait for updated drivers from Synaptics?</p>

            <p>I presume your response was tongue in cheek, since the default behavior for most laptops is to sleep when the cover is closed, or if running on batteries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior's the same whether you sleep or hibernate, btw. The only way to restore the functionality is to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your response was tongue in cheek, please understand that this is not a minor issue on a device in daily use, and since it seems that beta development has closed and we're reaching RTM, it would be unfortunate if this issue is not fixed before release,
 even if it's a third-party driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen any responses from Microsoft about this specific issue, even though there are multiple threads about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Synaptics has not responded to any inquiries I've made, btw.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Office 2016 error 30016-26 after Windows 10 roll-back</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with my Office 2016 software that is part of my Office 365 subscription.&nbsp; I was forced to roll-back the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, back to the Creator Update level,&nbsp;because of a lot of app problems.&nbsp; I now was advised to apply the
 latest updates for the Office 2016 software, which failed each time with an error 30016-26.&nbsp; I tried to do a quick repair and a full repair.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both repair processes&nbsp;not fix my Office 2016 software.&nbsp; I was still getting the error 30016-26.&nbsp; I did try to re-install
 the Office software from my subscription download site.&nbsp; After the software was successfully installed, the updates were not applied.&nbsp; I still was getting the same error (30016-26.)&nbsp; After checking the web, found a suggestion to turn off the Windows 10 firewall
 and the updates passed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean all is fixed ro do I need to do something else??</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the issue caused by Firewall block Office installation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Control Panel.</li><li>Select System and Security.</li><li>Click Allow an app through Windows Firewall.</li><li>Click Change settings&gt;select allow another app…</li><li>Click browse…&gt;type the path <span>C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun</span></li><li>Select Office C2RClient&gt;click Add.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Hi anneaaron,</strong></p>
<p>You won’t be able to delete Java scripts. You can disable them from Internet Options.</p>
<p><span>a. Open Internet Explorer, click on Tools.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Internet Options, select the Security tab, select Custom Level.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Look for the option ‘Scripting’ and then click on Disable under ‘Scripting of Java Applets’.<br />
<br />
You'll be prompted to install ActiveX Control again if needed in the future; removing them one by one to determine the cause of the problem is a valuable troubleshooting step.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>a. Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Choose Tools from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>c. From the resulting drop-down menu, choose Manage Add-ons, followed by Enable or Disable Add-ons.<br />
d. In the Manage Add-ons window, choose Downloaded ActiveX Controls from the Show: drop-down box.</span></p>
<p><span>The resulting list will show every ActiveX Control that Internet Explorer has installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>e. Select the first ActiveX Control listed, then click the Delete button in the Delete ActiveX area at the bottom of the window, and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>f. If prompted to restart Internet Explorer, do so.
</span></p>
<p><span>g. Close and then reopen Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the backup issue, are you able to burn files using Windows Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>One of the most possible cause of this issue when you have a removable drive which tries to get a drive letter which is already reserved.</span></p>
<p><span>Change the drive letter assignment for the removable drive.</span></p>
<p><span>To change the drive letter assignments in Windows 7, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Log on to the computer as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Insert a disk in the removable drive.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Start, right-click on Computer, and then click Manage.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Disk Management.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Right-click the partition, logical drive, or volume that you want to change, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click the removable drive, click it, click Change, click the drive letter that you want to use, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</span></p>

<p>I have tryed to pair my Dell Mni-Keyboard with my Samsung Focus. No luck yet, tryed several times, fullowing pair instructions from Manufacture, and viseo on you tube for iPhone, thought it would be the same process and it was. but it does not connect. Takes
 about a minute to decide it is not going to pair up. Is there a Hardware Compatibility List for the WP7 Platform?</p>
