<h2>            Outlook reading pane won&#39;t stay put</h2>
                    Every time I open outlook the reading pane is to the right instead of the bottom where I placed it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've jumped through the hoops re saving and applying the view after I've moved the reading pane to the bottom.&nbsp; No joy.&nbsp; Like I said, the next time I
 open Outlook the reading pane is on the right side of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone have a suggestion as to how to get it to say put?

            Hi LongOfTooth, 
<br />Did you try restarting outlook using the /cleanviews switch then change the reading pane position? 
<br />
<br />Closing Outlook. Press Windows key + R to open the Run command, type or paste the following into the Open field then press Enter or click Ok.
<br />
<br />outlook.exe /cleanviews

    <title>Capitalizing I in Word spellcheck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mermaidmusic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Capitalizing I in Word spellcheck</h2>
                    This just started happening and was working fine before. &nbsp;When I type the letter 'i' and then do a spell check, it used to bring up the first option to change it to as "I" (capitalizing it). &nbsp;Now, all of a sudden, that's not even listed as an option anymore,
 the first option is "it". &nbsp;So, I have to go back and change all of them individually. &nbsp;I CANNOT have autocorrect or replace as I type options checked because it would often times autocorrect with the wrong words. &nbsp;Something happened between now and two months
 ago when this started happening. &nbsp;I made no changes to my spelling options and it's been working fine for over a year. &nbsp;Microsoft sent me instructions but none of which can help because I can't have autocorrect and replace this with this options. &nbsp;Why all
 of a sudden would capital "I", which would be the logical choice for being the first option to replace "i", disappear? &nbsp;If anyone can help, I would greatly appreciate it! &nbsp;

            You shouldn't get unwanted&nbsp;corrections with AutoCorrect provided you don't check the box for "Automatically use suggestions from the spelling checker." If you find that you are getting specific unwanted corrections, find those entries in the AutoCorrect
 Options list and delete them.

            Thanks for your reply but I guess I'm not explaining this correctly. &nbsp;When I do spell check and it brings up word options to change your incorrect word to, the capital "I" is no longer an option for little "i". &nbsp;It used to come up as an option in spell
 checker and now it doesn't. &nbsp;Capital "I" is no longer listed at all. &nbsp;I have to go out of spell checker and physically change any little "i"'s to capital "I"'s. &nbsp;The autocorrect option of capitalizing the first letter of each sentence doesn't always work so
 I often will have little "i"'s because I do not shift to capitalize myself so I can go faster as I'm a transcriptionist and I type all day. &nbsp;So, I guess the word or letter is relevant. &nbsp;It would be the same as if I misspell "the" and type "hte" all the time
 and all of a sudden "the" isn't even listed as an option to change "hte" to in the spell checker. &nbsp;I just disappeared for no reason. &nbsp;Again, I can't do the "automatically replace this word with t

            I messed around with it some more and finally got it to work. &nbsp;I still don't know how it was taken off to begin with, but in spell check, I changed the small case i to upper case I and hit "change" and it automatically showed up the next time again. &nbsp;While
 spell checking, I (or a cat) must have hit something on the keyboard at some point without even knowing it to make it change somehow. &nbsp;Got it figured out now...thankfully because it was driving me nuts!

            I understood what you were saying. I was just explaining that it should not be necessary to disable AutoCorrect entirely. In particular, if there are words you habitually misspell, you can easily add them as AutoCorrect entries, saving yourself even more
 time.

            I tried to do that too but it kept telling me that I had to turn on replace text as you type. &nbsp;I have hundreds of medical terms, and when I used to have that on, I noticed that it was pulling up things that it thinks I meant when it was actually something
 else so I obviously had to turn that off because this is my job and I couldn't have those kind of mistakes :-) &nbsp;I'm just glad I got it figured out because it truly was driving me nuts. &nbsp;Often times, the autocorrect of capitalizing the first letter of the sentence
 doesn't always work so it happens a lot. &nbsp;I don't know if it's because I type pretty fast or what. &nbsp;But, it did it on my Word 2003 also. &nbsp;Anyway, glad it's fixed and thanks for your response!

            <p>As I've stated before, AutoCorrect does <strong>not</strong> work this way unless you have "Automatically use suggestions from the spelling checker" enabled. The only replacements it will make are those that are in the AutoCorrect entry list. Any entry that
 is problematic can be removed, and you could add others to facilitate typing those medical terms. See

<h2>            installing office 365 for mac on a second mac</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased Office 365 Home for Mac and have installed it successfully on a Mac Book Pro 13" running OS Mavericks.</p>
<p>I then sent an invitation to my second Mac Book Pro 15" running Mountain Lion, under a different email address. Accepted it. Installed Office. Restarted.</p>
<p>The activation window does not accept any of the following:</p>
<p>1. the email address of my original account plus the original password of that account</p>
<p>2. email address of my original account plus a new app password</p>
<p>3- second email address to which i sent the invite plus any of the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning 2 step verification on and off and repeating the above process but still get the error code 0xd0000022 either way.</p>
<p>I have re-started the computer and then tried all of the above again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without success.</p>
<p>I have followed all of the threads found in the community. Under ' My Account'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I open ' View my Account' under ' Security and Privacy' I can no longer access ' create a new app password'. It's simply not showing up.</p>
<p>Any advice gratefully received.</p>

<h2>            Allowing mixed content in trusted sites only - IE 8</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I want to allow the display of mixed (http and https) content for trusted sites only. Basically I don't want to be prompted about it. If i disable the appropriate option in the trusted sites settings the prompt still comes up although the site is declared&nbsp;as
 a trusted site. If I disable the appropriate option under Internet sites things work as intended.<br />
<br />
I never tried this with previous versions of IE. I got Vista Ultimate and IE 8. Could it be a bug?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hello Fotios,<br />
<br />
The mixed content refers to http and https content.&nbsp; You may have mydomain.com in the trusted sites list but when data is received from a different domain, it is not granted the same status as the originating domain, and you are right, it is a mixed zone issue.&nbsp;
 This is why you need the setting in the two separate security zones.<br />
<br />
The only option I can see is to add the other source domains to your trusted list.&nbsp; That would keep all settings in the same zone.<br />

<p>Whilst in Nokia Store application &gt; Installation preferences - is it currently set to Phone memory or Mass memory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I send .sis to N8 running Symbian Anna by Bluetooth it arrives in E:\Received files and installs wherever I want without issue.</p>

<p>Hi Mchv2.0,</p>
<p>Regarding the issue, currently we need to use some workarounds like "Start In Private browsing" or add the files to the master page gallery and changed the path in the properties or other methods.</p>

<h2>            Summing values from multiple tables into one total table based on several criteria</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a seemingly easy question but not being able to find the answer yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, let's say I have 32 similar tables with different values in them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>now, what I want is - create the 33rd table which will sum all the values from 32 tables based on two criteria - a year and a month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Month</td>
<td>Value 1</td>
<td>Value 2</td>
<td>Year</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jan</td>
<td>$25</td>
<td>$50</td>
<td>2017</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>So, the 33rd table will sum up all the values for "Value 1" column from all 32 tables for each month and year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;I am using sumifs function. it looks something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(Table1[value 1],Table1[Month],"Jan",Table1[Year],"2017")+SUMIFS(Table2[value 1],Table2[Month],"Jan",Table2[Year],"2017")+....</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is a good formula to avoid mistakes but it is tiring to use it for 32 tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to name all the ranges i need - to avoid typing out sumifs function multiple times - but that function does not work with multiple ranges selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any suggestion which makes calculation easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            What about if you were to list the table names in a column, and then build a formula using =INDIRECT to reference the table names in the cells? That way you would only have to write the formula once and copy it down, and then sum the column at the end.
<br />So for example, in A2 put Table1, A3 put Table2, etc down to A33.
<br />Then in B2 put the formula =SUMIFS(INDIRECT(A2&amp;"[Value]"),INDIRECT(A2&amp;"[Month]"),1,INDIRECT(A2&amp;"[Year]"),1)
<br />and copy this down to B33.
<br />Then in B34, add the formula =SUM(B2:B33) to get the total.

<p>Thank you for your time Murray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would work, but I actually simplified examples in my answer.</p>
<p>In reality i have around 8 columns and more than 100 rows for some of the columns for each table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so there is already a lot space occupied in working sheets and i do not want to add to that))</p>
<p>
</p><p>again, thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some reason i think there should be an easier way to do that since this operation seems to be very basic, like something many people need, so excel should have it somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            OK. But there is no need to do this on a working sheet - do it on a completely new sheet (which you could hide if you want). The totals can also go somewhere else - they don't need to be at the bottom of the columns. Extending from the original concept, put '[Value 1]' in B1, [Value 2] in C1 etc to account for the additional columns.
<br />Then the formula in B2 can become something like 
<br />=SUMIFS(INDIRECT("Sheet1!"&amp;A2&amp;B$1),INDIRECT("Sheet1!"&amp;A2&amp;"[Month]"),"Jan",INDIRECT("Sheet1!"A2&amp;"[Year]"),"2017")
<br />Or if you prefer, just put Sheet1!Table1 in A2 etc.
<br />Then copy down and to the right for the additional columns.
<br />
<br />I hear what you say though - it would be nice if you could do something like:
<br />=SUMIFS(Table1:Table32[value1],Table1:Table32[Month],"Jan",Table1:Table32[Year],"2017")

    <title>Some Features Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some Features Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I bought an unlocked Nokia 920 in April because none of the carriers in my country (Barbados) were selling Nokia Lumias at the time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There were some features that never worked and when queried a message came up saying not available in my region (Barbados).<span>&nbsp;
</span>As of September a local carrier (the same one I get my data package from) has now started selling these phones and to my surprise issues that I was told were due to my location, work perfectly on these phones.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My Xbox has never worked but is working on the locally purchased phones, the music icon in Bing never showed on my phone but can be seen on the ones now being sold here, Nokia Store has more menu options than mine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is the difference?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I first noticed these problems (back in April or May), it was suggested by a windows phone support forum on twitter to do a hard reset.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Due to the fact that my phone was still new and there wasn’t much info on it I was told this should take 30-minutes at most.<span>&nbsp;
</span>12-hours later and the gears were still spinning and I was in a panic thinking I had killed my phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I eventually unplugged it and let the battery die and then charged it again and it came back but the problems still exist.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any suggestions what else I can do?</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I know the feeling, I just experienced the same thing&nbsp;a couple of weeks ago&nbsp;and was very frustrated. I let it sit there spinning away for 51/2 hours then finally got to a very high frustration level so I can truly appreciate what you are feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So ultimately this is what I did and after several attempts, it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Turn off the phone, Once the phone is off, Hold the Volume down key then press the power on and keep them pressed until your device vibrates.
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Once the Nokia screen appears&nbsp;</em><em>press the following keys in order:</em></p>
<p><em>Volume Up</em></p>
<p><em>Volume Down</em></p>
<p><em>Power Key</em></p>
<p><em>Volume down. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The phone will turn on automatically (<strong>see note below</strong>), this may take several minutes and it will show two gears that are spinning just wait for it to finish.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong></p>
<p>So what I noticed was that when I went through that process, the Nokia screen that appeared before I pressed the 4 keys in order
<strong>flashed and appeared again</strong> after I pressed the keys in order. The gears showed again, I went downstairs and came back up to check after about 15 minutes and the screen was dark. It was dark because the process completed and was ready to start
 setting up again so it timed out because I was not there. You can wait and watch the gears but go get a drink of juice then come back.</p>

    <title>Using Cortana is a disastor after updating to the production Creators - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using Cortana is a disastor after updating to the production Creators Build &#40;15063.138&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings All -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well - I know 1703 and it's more immediate predecessors&nbsp;have&nbsp;been bumping around in the Insider Program distribution rings for quite a while now, and that's why I find these sorts of&nbsp;bugs rather surprising to encounter on the&nbsp;now production build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken into account that a bad&nbsp;upgrade can happen (in this case, in upgrading from 14393 to 15063,) because&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;upgrades just&nbsp;plain "go sideways"...&nbsp; So onto the observed issues --</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue Part 1</strong> - Cortana, whether intentionally by design or not, now takes over the entire Windows Desktop (I'm not talking about the Lock Screen Cortana, not yet,) with what looks very much like the Cortana Lock-Screen graphic of yore which&nbsp;would
 upon "aural awakening" overlay the Lock/Hello Screen to interact.&nbsp;Note that this only happens upon aural use of Cortana for Desktop, not when interacting with&nbsp;Cortana via the taskbar click interface(s).&nbsp;But then too, not always does this new Desktop Cortana
 aural interface do this full screen thing.&nbsp;No - sometimes the new Windows Desktop Cortana stays corralled within the&nbsp;previously anticipated/expected/normal confines of same Windows start-menu pop-up region of the Desktop just&nbsp;as it has done in all past (and
 too numerous to count)&nbsp;Windows-10 builds.&nbsp;However&nbsp;with build 15063 more often than not Cortana takes over the entire Windows 1703 Desktop and while&nbsp;so doing, over-shadows and renders unusable/inaccessible,&nbsp;whatever Desktop window(s)/App(s) are laying beneath
 until&nbsp;"new Desktop Cortana" is dismissed by clicking&nbsp;her gigantic&nbsp;X dismissal button in&nbsp;her upper-right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue Part 2</strong> - New Cortana Lock-Screen&nbsp;of build 15063 can no longer be aurally awakened - now&nbsp;"Tap and say "what can I do" must first be clicked in order to&nbsp;get new Lock-Screen Cortana's attention.&nbsp; 14393's Lock-Screen Cortana did not require
 this extra and greatly annoying step - that version Lock-Screen Cortana responded directly to aural commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Remedial procedures thus far attempted</strong> - So, as I previously noted, upgrades can and do go wrong...&nbsp; Fortunately (for me) this is not disastrous, since I utilize a very good and issue-free 3rd party's System Image backup utility -&nbsp;to whit,
 I've used to restore the previous (and fully functional) 14393 installation; then allowed the 15063 upgrade to have yet another go at getting things correctly installed - I've done this three times.&nbsp; All three times yielding exactly the same odd/somewhat-dysfunctional
 new Cortana results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to think that 15063 is not&nbsp;truly ready (not yet, anyway,) for prime-time distribution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All thoughts relating to&nbsp;similar (or dissimilar, yet still equally discordant) Cortana 15063 experiences are certainly&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response Ernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Understandable and reasonable suggestions, and both of which I had already done prior to my posting about these&nbsp; very specific issues here in the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps to better emphasize the situation; Firstly: though still a bit early, these particular Cortana issues seem to be the only notable annoyances with 15063 I've thus far come across and because of that I find it doubtful that a SF corruption may be at
 fault - even so (as stated) I did follow the course of due diligence and utilized SFC, receiving a completely clean bill of health. Secondly: please take into account my doing three nearly consecutive 15063 reinstallation/upgrade attempts.&nbsp; Unfortunately all
 of which still resulting in exactly the same odd Cortana behavioral results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted - there can be many other mitigating factors, like not-quite meshing HAL elements such as not-yet-fully compliant 15063 HW drivers (Graphic, Audio, etc. drivers) and the like. But again, all such selections are purely the driver picks that the Windows
 upgrade/installer chose for this host equipment, not me nor other 3rd party providers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again - and Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi twist3rdeva</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bear in mind that map set for use with 3.06Beta is larger than ever and that earlier devices continue to use previous versions

<p>So you're saying that for older models (like my N78) I'm stuck with actual map ? No more updates ? I want to clarify that i'm talking about the map, not the Ovi Maps application.</p>

<p>You must use Windows XP SP3 with Windows Media Player 10 at least. The so called N versions of later windows version must also have the Media pack installed.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender Security Center reports Norton security as both - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steffenlarsen1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Security Center reports Norton security as both inactive and active at the same time</h2>
                    <p>The Windows Defender Security center reports Norton Security as inactive first, and then immediately below it reports it as active. Norton itself is of course active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run windows 10 in danish, so forgive me if the translation of window headers isn't completely like the official english headers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Defender Security Center, under Virus and Threats I see a required action, with an indication that Norton Security is inactive. Then, as I click it, I get an overview of virus and threat-protection, with a notification that I use multiple antivirus
 programs. It lists first Norton Security as inactive, and right under it, it lists Norton Security as active. Norton itself reports protection as updated and active-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously I am not running Norton Security twice, but my thought is that Windows may be discovering a remnant of some previously installed version of Norton Security. Thus my question is this: Where does Windows Defender look for whether Norton Security
 is installed? It can't be under 'Apps and Functions' as I only see Norton Security once there. I look forward to hearing your advice regarding this? It is my hope that this is a common issue where you can provide a 'best practice' answer.</p>

                    trying to access a&nbsp; couple of gaming sites that use java applets (pogo, runescape) and getting a "class not found" error . Does anyone know how to fix this? Java is installed, but when I go to the Java website and run the test, it says it is not installed.
 I have ensured that Java is enabled in my add ons, and I am losing my mind!!!

<p><span>Hi Treefrog3,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. What’s the operating system you’re using?
</span></p>
<p><span>b. What’s the version of Internet Explorer you’re using?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>First, let’s open Internet Explorer (IE) with no add-ons mode and check if the IE continues to freeze or not. To start Internet Explorer
 without add-ons, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Click the Start button, click All Programs, click Accessories, click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If disabling all add-ons solves the problem, you might want to use Add-on Manager to disable all add-ons and then turn on add-ons only as
 you need them. This will allow you to figure out which add-on is causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on tips for solving problems with Internet Explorer:</span></span></p>

            No. Forwarding is only available at the account level. No matter which number is used, the forwarding will adhere to the same setting.

    <title>N73 slow mp3 ringtone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scigi---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N73 slow mp3 ringtone</h2>
                    When I set an MP3 ringtone in my N73 i notice that it starts ringing after two rings. It takes some time for the phone to start playing the mp3. I've tried everything - putting the mp3 into the phone memory, making it really short, etc. and it is still
 slow. Anybody has a solution for that?<br />
<br />
(the original .aac ringtone, like Nokia Tune, rings immediately)

            Try change the format of file from mp3 to aac. The last format produces a more light file. Could be that.

            Tried that. Nothing. Generally changing the theme to the original ME one did some part of the trick, still when the phone is in sleep mode it takes around two rings for the ringtone to sound. Kinda slow, especially regarding the very basic feature of the
 phone - calling.

            Regarding slowness of the phone, it takes ages for the phone to come to life when it's in the sleep mode - about 3 seconds, which is looong. N80 had much faster transition from sleep to life. If next software update could improve performance that would
 be great.<br />

            If u use MP3/AAC ringtone at 320kbps, 44100Hz, Stereo den ur likely to get slow ringtone.<br />
<br />
Try lowering the bitrate to 128Kbps or so on or why not just use aacPlus --&gt; Easy CD-DA Extractor v10.0.6 Professional<br />
<br />
By the way i dont get no slow ringtone i have Music Edition firmware look below on da signature panel :)

            Interesting. I tried even with very small files (like 30 KB) and still if it wasnt the preinstalled tone it was slow. And also the sleep feature. How long does it take for your phone to come back from sleep?
