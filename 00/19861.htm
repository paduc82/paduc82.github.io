<h2>            Simple Outlook&#47;Hotmail calendar sharing with activesync on Android&#58; Not possible &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>Two users having multiple personal email accounts (private IMAP acounts from their ISP) and an Outlook / Hotmail account for calendaring.</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to grant each other access to the calendar of the other, preferable read-only, on their Android phones' built-in calendar app ?</p>
<p>So far the only way I found is to add each other's Outlook/Hotmail account as email account using MS Exchange Activesync, which has the rather drastic side-effect of granting
<strong>full access</strong> to all the other user's folders (read/write for calendar, email, tasks, etc.)!</p>
<p>After a quick search on the Internet, it seems this is an impossible equation (at least wth the device's built-in calendaring app).</p>
<p>Friends with Google accounts are laughing at me as read-only sharing of their calendar seems to be a no-brainer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>suggestions ?</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
For other options on how you can share your calendar through the in-built calendar app for Android phones, it will be best to also post your concern on Google forums. You may also check on Google's support site.<br />
<br />
Feel free to reach out if you have other concerns.

<p>Well I had hoped for a better answer, but I was afraid of this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android/phone manufacturer rely on the MS Exchange ActiveSync functionality and hence will not provide additional support/functionality, while MS delivers the code 'as is' and leave it up to the OEM to provide the end-user experience.</p>
<p>I reckon there isn't much the Android OEM can do about the requested functionality as it appears to be a limitation of the MS Exchange ActiveSync connector and/or Outlook/Hotmail.com account functional design.</p>
<p>So, in this classical example of fingerpointing, nobody will take the ownership of the 'problem' and the user is left in 'self-support' land....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I will have to join the vast majority of non-corporate users and switch to a Google account for calendar sharing :'(</p>

<h2>            Need to prevent one phrase from being typed into a cell in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to prevent the phrase "mini car" (any case) from being entered into a certain column in Excel 2016.</p>
<p>I tried using Data Validation, but am unable to figure it out. I understand a list of words can be made and saved in a dropdown to prevent anything else from being entered, but there are too many "allowed" words and phrases that making a list would be impossible.</p>
<p>Is there a formula that could produce an alert or maybe add color to the cell when the incorrect phrase is entered?</p>

<h2>            Nokia 8800 Firmware</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have just had 4.10 installed on my Nokia 8800 and still it has no fix for the screen burn. Is there any information on when the next firmware is out and whether it will fix the issue?

<br />
i dont think the new firmware you have actually enhances anything apart from making the features work faster.<br />
<br />
mine is 03.94<br />
<br />
We need the same firmware as the 8800 scricco as this possesses the firmware with the scrolling clock

            Just had 4.17 installed on my 8800.<br />
<br />
Can't say if it has installed a scrolling clock as I've also just had an 8800 Sirocco and put my SIM in that!

            The scricco has the scrolling clock {power saver} installed.<br />
<br />
Check the new firmware for the original 8800 by turning on the power saver option and see if it scrolls down the screen.<br />
<br />
Posting your reply would be greatly appreciated.

            Nope!<br />
<br />
The time and date sit resolutely in the middle of the screen of the 8800 even with firmware 4.17 installed.<br />
<br />
And, now I know what to look for, I can see evidence of screen burn in the middle of my display.<br />
<br />
My phone is just over a year old and has been turned on for almost all of that time.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)

            yes and thank you.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what the updated firmware supplied to your handset !<br />
<br />
My guess it allowed the handset to work a little faster !<br />
<br />
Seems the firmware the scricco version holds will or cannot be put onto the original 8800. Well not for now anyway.<br />
<br />
Mine is not showing the burn yet although its only 3 months old. My friends was nearly a yr old and does.<br />
<br />
Nokia have said that if the handset is handed into a Nokia Service centre then if deemed an issue they will replace the screen under warranty, which I will do when this happens.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping for a firmware update with this scrolling option.

            The Sirocco has a sleep mode which saves more battery power by turning off the screen (i.e. nothing displayed) if the phone is not used for a certain time.<br />
<br />
Obviously this had the added advantage of reducing the chance of screen burn.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the updated firmware on the 8800 will reduce power consumption, since this was the reason the phone and batteries went for a service. I thought the batteries were duff because the phone was warning of low battery and to turn itself off during conversations.
 Both batteries were tested and found to be OK.<br />
<br />
I hope this has sorted it because my better half has inherited the 8800.

    <title>x2-02 SMS sending stuck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoltane---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            x2-02 SMS sending stuck</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason SMS sending is stuck on the phone: the related icon is animating at the top of the screen and I can't send another SMS because one is already being sent.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes or so I turned off the device but after the reboot it continued where it left off.</p>
<p>Signal strength is max.</p>

<p>I hope I translated all the names properly, as it's a localized phone. (Maybe my "Drafts" is the real "Outbox"?)<br />
Point is that I went through all the folders in the "Messages" menu and cleaned them out.</p>
<p>For now I fixed it by removing the battery and internal SIM, battery back, boot, turn off again, SIM back and start.</p>
<p>If it happens again then I'll note what I did beforehand.</p>

<p>Good that its sorted for now..</p>
<p>BTW 'Draft' folder will save messages that you have typed but not yet Sent.. (May be you want to add something before sending or want to send it at a later time.)..whereas 'Outbox' will contain those messages which you have sent but are still not actually
 sent due to Network or other issues... So, in your case the message which is STUCK should be in 'Outbox' and not in 'Draft' folder ...</p>

<p>It's back again. :( Whenever I try to send a text it gets moved to the outbox and has the status of being sent.</p>
<p>Removing the battery and SIM cards makes it stop trying but whenever I&nbsp;attempt to send anything it's screwed again.</p>
<p>If I start the phone without giving a valid PIN for the sim in question then shut it down and start up again&nbsp;properly,&nbsp;the infinite sending also stops until next time.</p>

<h2>            Hiding &#34;Default Paragraph Font&#34; and &#34;Normal&#34; Styles&#63;</h2>
                    In Word 2010, is it possible for me to hide the styles "Normal" and "Default Paragraph Font" in the
<b>Styles</b> pane?<br />
<br />
I don't see either of these styles listed in the<b> Formatting Restrictions</b> list.<br />

            It all has to do with the styles hierarchy--what supersedes what. " The <em>
general </em>hierarchy of style types is [from lowest to highest priority]:
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Document Defaults </li><li>Table Styles </li><li>Paragraph Styles | Paragraph Part of Linked Styles </li><li>Numbering Styles </li><li>Character Style | Character Part of Linked Styles </li><li>
<div>Direct Formatting"</div>
</li></ul>
<div>Quoted from <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-word/archive/2008/10/16/behind-the-curtain-styles-order-of-operations.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Order of Operations</a>, a Word Team Blog.</div>
</li></ul>
<p>So, table styles supersede document defaults and paragraph styles supersede table styles.&nbsp; For the&nbsp; special case of the normal paragraph style: When the normal paragraph style is not changed from the default settings, its settings are effectively&nbsp; the document
 defaults, which table styles override.&nbsp; But when normal has different settings from the defaults, its paragraph style settings override the table style.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Insertions, whether by pasting, inserting, or typing, take on the formatting, including the style, in effect at the cursor.&nbsp; Tables are no different.&nbsp; As you found,&nbsp; insertion of a table into a heading 3 paragraph results in all the cells having the heading
 3 style.&nbsp; To get back to the table style settings,&nbsp; select the table and clear it by clicking the Clear Formatting button on the Home tab.<br />
<br />
Using table styles to format table text only works reliably in W2007-13.&nbsp; Because we can't change the system defaults in W2003, normal and the defaults only match if the normal paragraph style settings are TNR 12, no paragraph spacing, and single line spacing,
 and automatic font color.&nbsp; And when they don't match, the table text will be formatted in the normal paragraph style (overriding the table style settings).&nbsp; To avoid this, do not make any font settings in the
<u>table</u> style; use paragraph style to format table text instead. <br />

            It's always a good idea to uninstall on the old PC.&nbsp; However, whether or not you can install and activate on the new PC depends on what license you have.&nbsp; If you have an OEM license or&nbsp;a Product Key Card license, it is not legal to move Office to a different
 PC.&nbsp; If you have a full retail license, then you can if you have not activated it more than the allowed number of activations.

            If you have a retail license that allows you to transfer the installation it also gives you the right to have it installed on 2 machines at the same time. If you don't plan to continue using the old machine, yes it is a good idea to uninstall Office.

<p>Phone calendar syncs with your online calendar at <a href="https://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The default sync is two weeks of past single-instance (non-recurring) events and all future single-instance events. All recurring events that have occurrences within the last two weeks or anytime in the future.</p>

<h2>            Having trouble inserting a pie chart in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I'm having a really difficult time inserting a pie chart in Excel.</p>
<p>I am working on a Mac and the version is 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two columns of data I need to put in and they are not consecutive.</p>
<p>I have tried to--</p>
<p>1. Select my info (A3-A10 and G3-G10) by holding down the command key and selecting the info.</p>
<p>2. Gone to Charts&gt;3-D Pie chart and it goes into my sheet.</p>
<p>3. From here on out, it has the border and the title and the legend but no data and no pie chart itself. Just an empty box with a title and legend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>I can't very well say with any certainty because I have no idea what you have in&nbsp; A3:A10, what you have in G3:G10, what you have in the intervening cells (B3:F10), or exactly what cells you're selecting... There just isn't enough descriptive detail in your
 message. Apparently something is 'wrong' or you'd be getting a 'right' result :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that A3:A10 contains the labels &amp; G3:G10 contains the values to be plotted, my guess is that it may be your selection technique... It sounds like you may be selecting the first range, then holding the Command key while you
<em>click each cell</em> in the second range. If so, each Command+click is interpreted as indicating a separate data series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use the technique properly, you must hold the Command key while you <em>drag</em> to select the entire second range of cells: Select A3:A10 [labels], then hold Command while you drag from G3:G10 [values].<br />

    <title>I need to make a complaint about my Microsoft Lumia 950XL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louise mcgarrett  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to make a complaint about my Microsoft Lumia 950XL</h2>
                    <p>I got this phone as a free handset with the O2 2 year contract from Mobiles.co.uk</p>
<p>The warranty on this phone is valid from January 2016 to January 2018. In December 2016, I had to take the phone to Carphone Warehouse Geek Squad as had issues with the power dropping out on the phone when plenty of battery charge left.</p>
<p>They in turn sent the phone off to the Microsoft Official Repair Centre in Hungary (B2X) and they check the phone and battery and deemed the battery faulty. B2X replaced the battery in January 2017.</p>
<p>The phone was collected used as normal and the same thing happened again in November. I wanted to complain to Microsoft but was directed to B2X the Official Repair Centre. Spoke to an Operative on the live Chat. A&nbsp;return was&nbsp;arranged to send the phone and
 battery back to them in Hungary. It was packed up and sent via DHL on the 21st November. On the 24th the phone was checked and the battery too, they deemed the battery faulty and wouldn't replace as the warranty had expired. Then it was returned via DHL and
 received back on the 28th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not happy that the battery wasn't replaced and I feel Microsoft need to know. The 950XL is supposed to be able to be used as a computer via the docking station. I feel if this can't survive normal use with the battery failing twice within 2 years, how
 can it cope as a computer. All content would be lost if you weren't able to keep backed up. I really feel this phone is not fit for the purpose as described.</p>
<p>I have previous Nokia Lumia phones and my first one is&nbsp;6 years old and on its third owner and there has never been an issue with the battery. Plus the previous one is 4 years old and that still hasn't had any issues with the battery.</p>
<p>I haven't even had this the full two years and I have had issues with the battery. Plus even after a replacement battery was put in it hasn't lasted as long as my previous phones have with their new owners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know where I stand as Mobiles.co.uk have wiped their hands of the situation, as they only give you the customer 30 days for any faults/repairs to be done.</p>
<p>

<p>The standard manufacturer's warranty for the UK (EU) is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(i) Twenty four (24) months for the main device;</span></p>
<p><span>(ii)Twelve (12) months for accessories sold separately or included in the sales pack of the main device excluding batteries, covers, cables and chargers; and</span></p>
<p><span>(iii)Six (6) months for all batteries, covers, cables and chargers,
</span>unless otherwise specified in the Product user guide.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This means that you stand in a position where you need to buy a new battery yourself at your own cost. Based on the warranty terms you were lucky they decided to replace the battery for free the first time around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, the shorter warranty on batteries and accessories is pretty much industry standard.</p>

            I had a same experience on my lumia 950 I think it's not Microsoft fault its main fault its processor which overheat phone and battery that's why battery won't last longer snapdragon 810 and 808 was bad processor and Microsoft have no choice they went
 for it. Even android HTC one m9 flopped coz its overheat too much and battery timing was mediocre m9 had also snapdragon 810 processor. I think you should move to other android phone and install Microsoft launcher with other Microsoft apps on your new phone.

<h2>            outlook for mac sends blank password twice, correct password 3rd time</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for a hosting company and as such spend a lot of time logged into peoples computers remotely setting up emails and looking at the server side logs. I have only ever witnessed this for outlook on macs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed a pattern where outlook on macs will attempt to connect with a blank username and password twice and only on the third attempt send the users login credentials. This issue persists even after rebooting computer and completely removing the
 email accounts and setting the accounts up from scratch. I have observed this on multiple devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time this will not be a problem and users will be totally unaware if anything going wrong as the connection is eventually successful.<br />
</p>
<p>The problem arises when they run into security restrictions, say for instance if there is a limitation of 40 failed password attempts in a row before they are IP blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say a user has 10 email accounts and opens outlook for mac. The mac will then send out 20 failed login attempts (2 for each account) and then 10 successful logins. If they soon after press the "send/receive" button their mail client then sends another 20
 blank username/passwords exceeding the limitation and locking them out of their email accounts for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been at least 3 times where I have had to advise people that this is simply a fault in outlook for mac and I know of no work around other than to stop using outlook and switch to a different mail client (or change the frequency that mail is synchs
 to mitigate the problem but still run the risk)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just curious if this is a known issue or if it is only on some older versions or if it is just a "feature".</p>

            Are you using a subscription version? If so, i recommend reporting it via Help &gt; Contact support. If that option is not available on your build, you'll need to upgrade to an insider build, at least temporarily.

<p>Hello David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. May I know where did you look at the logs? Would you mind upload it and capture a screenshot of the sending password part for further check?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, if the phenomenon always occurs and no error message on customer’s side, it may be a normal behavior. Anyway, you can upload the logs and screenshots for further check. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to
 collect them. Please click on the link below to access your Private Message : <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

            Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<h2>            Lumia 920 suddenly stop connecting to my Wifi network</h2>
                    
<p>I have had my Lumia 920 for over a month and everything was working fine until last sunday, when suddenly the phone was not able to connect to my wifi.</p>
<p>I have tried everything, resenting the router, changing the wifi password, the security type (even with no security at all), but it doesn't matter the phone always that there was not response from the network. All my other devices have no problem to connect
 to the network, and also the Lumia 920 have no problems to connect to other networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me with this issue.</p>

<p>Because of that I'm currently using the US Marketplace even though I'm not allowed to shop there (free apps only).</p>
<p>Would it be possible to use the Marketplace for the UK (with an Austrian credit card)?</p>

<p>Hi there --</p>
<p>here's the official answer from the Zune team.</p>
<p>Your Zune account has a country (go to “account” on zune.net to see which country). This cannot be changed. Your PC settings have to match your Zune account settings – and that will dictate which Marketplace you get. If a user wants the German Marketplace,
 his Zune account and PC settings must say “Germany.” The Live ID country (which may or may not be the same as the Zune country) needs to match the credit card country in order to make purchases.</p>
<p>So, basically, in order to purchase from the Zune Marketplace, all of your settings - Zune account, Live ID, PC, and credit card - need to be from the same country.</p>
<p>We understand people move countries sometimes. Unfortunately, we have licensing restrictions that cause us to, at this time, not allow users to change their Zune country. If you find yourself in the situation where your Live ID has a different country from
 your Zune account, if you can't switch your Live ID to the same country as your Zune account, you'll have to create a new Zune account with the correct country.</p>
<p>The team understands this may be painful for some, and we're thinking about how to improve this process in the future.</p>
<p>--Jessica</p>

    <title>Uninstalling Office 2010 after installing Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tsainta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalling Office 2010 after installing Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I had Office 2010 installed when I installed Office 365 some months ago. &nbsp;Today I tried to uninstall Office 2010, but it didn't go well (but I established a restore point that got me back to the previous configuration).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I had uninstalled Office 2010, I lost all of the short cuts from my Desktop to Office documents. &nbsp;Clicking on them would launch the appropriate program (Excel or Word), but there would be an empty screen below the green header. &nbsp;Likewise if I tried
 to launch a document using File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I launch the program first and select Open Other Documents&gt;Open, the documents open properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that uninstalling Office 2010 uninstalled all of the programs except Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make a clean transition from Office 2010 to Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you have a multiple Office installation, immediately after uninstalling one version of Office you
<strong>MUST</strong> do an Office Repair of the Office installation you wish to use as default going forward.&nbsp; (in your case there is just 2 versions, but I have had up to 4 versions running on my machine at the same time, 2003-2013).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair will reset registry entries that may have been deleted during the 2010 uninstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, uninstall and reinstall your remaining copy of Office to reset it.

<p>Did you remove the program from Remove Programs found under Start/Settings/System?&nbsp; Usually that will remove everything (including the icon for the program).</p>
<p>If it did not, you can navigate to the Programs folder, locate the icon and delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes after you have used your device for a long time, you slowly "eat up" memory and often times doing a hard reset to bring it back the way it was when you first got it is the easiest and most efficient way to get the device running at its best.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you reinstalled office then Try to reinstall "G Suite Sync for Microsoft Outlook" from this link:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gappssync </p>
<p>
</p><p>it worked to me.</p>
