    <title>Cannot rename Library&#58; one very specific personal Library name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bot47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot rename Library&#58; one very specific personal Library name &#40;&#34;Clips&#34;&#41; now gets overridden to &#34;Videos&#34; even if I already have a default Videos library.  </h2>
                    
<p>I used to have Videos renamed to Clips.</p>
<p>I noticed very recently that my Clips Library was renamed back to Videos.</p>
<p>I tried changing it back to Clips, and it would go back to Videos. I first tried to create another library called Clips and it said that one already existed.</p>
<p>THEN I tried deleting all my Libraries and starting over with a restored default set, then creating a new Clips library. Now I had "two" Video libraries. I tried repeating the procedure while restarting my computer.</p>
<p>Now any library named "Clips" will ALWAYS be auto-renamed to "Videos." I CAN rename it to any other name, "Clippy," "Snips" or "Clippings" and it will stay as such, but as soon as I rename it to "Clips," it switches the name to "Videos."</p>
<p>I even tried to use the "Librarian" utility found on the Internet (risky, I know). Same behavior happens within the utility.</p>
<p>I very much regret messing with the original Library names now, and I wish I can start over, just so that I can have a Library called Clips. How can I go back to being allowed to have a Clips library? Perhaps with some Registry diving? What could be causing
 this override behavior (with a memory)? Could I override the override through editing the XML? Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you have an Internet connection, Windows Media Player will automatically connect to the Windows Media online database and will get whatever information is available regarding the CD. If it cannot connect to the internet, tracks will be saved containing
 only Unknown information, and you will not be able to know which one is which. Try creating in new user account.</p>

<p>Hi bot47</p>
<p>I had the same problem but I've figured out a workaround. Basically we're going to open the folder where Windows stores the library files (not the library's files) and trick Windows into adding space at the end of the stubborn library's name:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1.</span></strong>&nbsp; Open the Command Prompt (Type<em>cmd</em> in the Start menu).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2.</span></strong>&nbsp; Paste the following text into the command line (Right click and choose paste):</p>
<p><em>%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Libraries</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3.</span></strong> Type <em>dir</em> to see a list of the libraries you have. Your stubborn "Clips"-library is probably named something like this:</p>
<p><em>Clips.library-ms</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4.</span></strong> Now just type (Or paste):</p>
<p><em>ren "Clips.library-ms" "Clips .library-ms"</em></p>
<p>Remember the quotation marks and don't forget the the space that has been added between the file name and the ".<em>library-ms</em>"!</p>
<p>You may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>            There&#39;s a problem with this drive. Scan the drive now and fix it - Windows10</h2>
                    <br />

<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Hi, I'm running Windows 10 on a brand new Microsoft Surface laptop and when I plug in my Iomega eGo 1.5TB Portable Hard Drive I get the error message "There's a problem with this drive. Scan the drive now and fix it". I have scanned it and "fixed
 it" several times both via the pop-up and via the Properties/Tools of the drive, but ultimately nothing works and the pop-up always comes back.&nbsp; I can see the folders on the HD and can even access some of the files (word, xl and photos mainly) but eventually
 it falls over/hangs... It's not possible to transfer data to or from the drive.&nbsp; There is LOADS of space on the drive and although it's maybe 2 years old it is practically unused so far.&nbsp; I have another (much older, maybe 10 years....) external HD and it works
 just fine. I also uninstalled the USB drive via Device Manager but that hasn't fixed the issue. I have not tried the problematic HD on another device yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why this is happening and what I might do to try to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers for any advice.</p>
<p>

            Hi, SimianPrince
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend checking the Hard Disk 
<br />
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: “chkdsk /f /r X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.       
        </p>

<p>Hi Maritza, thanks for your quick reply and suggestion. Pressing Windows + X opens a nav bar with about 18 options but "Command Prompt" is not one of them?&nbsp; I searched "command prompt" from the search and it opened a dialogue box where I could enter the
 command but it told me "access denied....you have to invoke this utility running in elevated mode and make sure the disk is unlocked"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I'm missing something easy/basic.</p>

            Hi SimianPrince
<br />
<br />Your best option is to copy all the data from that drive onto either your Surface or the other older drive. Then format that drive (right click, choose format, a quick format to NTFS will suffice) then copy the data back onto that drive
<br />
<br />If there is any weakness on that rive, that will expose it, if there is no weakness, that will get rid of that annoying Fix and Scan issue . . .

            Hi Dave, thanks for your suggestion. But like I said in my OP it's difficult/impossible to transfer any data onto the HD or move any of the data off it e.g. onto my laptop or my other HD. When I try it just hangs and says "not responding" and eventually
 I just have to X out of it or try to stop the process via Task Manager. I took a look at your "format" option which I would like to try but only after I get the data off the HD :)&nbsp; Presumably if I format it when the data is still on the HD I run the risk of
 losing it? Any other suggestions? Thanks for your time, much appreciated!&nbsp; Jonas.

<p>Hi Maritza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the links. The first one re RUN CHKDSK gives the same instruction you gave before re "Windows + X", however I don't see the "Command Prompt (Admin)" option in the menu.&nbsp; I do see Windows Power Shell (Admin) as an option and I tried that. It does
 open a command box where I typed&nbsp;<em>chkdsk E: /f /r /x&nbsp;</em>
 and it did seem to run/do something, though I'm not sure what exactly.&nbsp; It gave me a "Stage 1" message back saying "Examining basic file system structure..." and "deleting corrupt attribute record" then "69120 file records processed" then "file verification
 completed" then 8 lines saying "Deleting orphan file record segment 9C2", then 9C3 etc through to 9C9.&nbsp; Which all sounded very promising :) I then safely ejected the HD but when I re-connected it I got the same "there is a problem with this disk" pop-up.&nbsp;
 I can see the files on the HD, some are more problematic/take longer to open than others......and moving them off the HD onto my laptop (as per Dave's suggestion also in this thread) is also proving problematic/impossible.&nbsp; It just hangs, then goes to "Not
 Responding" etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and suggestions.&nbsp; Note I have not yet tried "Method 2. Run EaseUS partition tool to scan and repair errors in Windows 10/8/7."</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>

<p>Hi JoChow123,</p>
<p>According to your description, your Skype for Business server works fine. The root cause might be related to the Lync App.</p>
<p>I have done a test on my side and noticed the Lync 2013 for iOS has upgrade to Skype for Business. The version is 6.0. So I suggest you upgrade it to the latest version to check the result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, To avoid misunderstood your situation, could you upload a screenshot about “i press end the powerpoint and press start viewing again to version the powerpoint .”?</p>
<p>To upload screenshots, select Use rich formatting, and then click insert /Edit</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<h2>            How to activate windows 7 using slp key &#40;downloaded from digital river&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I wanted to reinstall Windows on new hard disk&nbsp;due to error on erstwhile&nbsp;hard disk but recovery discs were not working . I tried recovery method twice and they were erroring out at 26% and 34% resp. Unfortunately installation discs were not provided at the
 time of purchase. So the only option I was left with was to get media and complete fresh installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Right now Phone activation option is not available.(SLUI). Microsoft activation team says key is blocked and asks me contact Sony whereas Sony support team directs me to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Please help me resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Steps :</p>
<p>1. Download 58997 iso from msft digital river (windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit with SP1)&nbsp; 2. Change laptop hard disk (all other settings viz bios, motherboard etc&nbsp;remain same)&nbsp; 3. Comlete installation&nbsp; 4. Enter product key on the bottom of laptop (COA SLP)
 and activate online. Product does not activate with error 0XC004E003. 5. MGAD Report report looks like this.</p>

<h2>            How to restore .bkf files from XP to Windows 7</h2>
                    I completed a full backup of my laptop, running XP, on a WD external drive (.bkf) files a few months back.&nbsp; My computer has since "blue screened" and I have purchased a new one running Windows7, but I cannot restore the backup from the WD external disk
 to the new laptop.&nbsp; What program do I need to download/purchase from the internet to restore and view my backup files on the new laptop?

<h2>            SP2 fails with error 80070490 - other updates work</h2>
                    I'm on Vista 64 Home Premium SP1 and I've been trying to install SP2 for a while now.&nbsp; I've run the checksur many times, I've run the fixit referred to in the one-step install problems thread in agressive mode and I still get the same error.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The update always fails after reboot and it looks like from the log it always gets:<br />

    <title>opening ftp files in the default application instead of a browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynecollens  say:</h3>
<h2>            opening ftp files in the default application instead of a browser</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7 Explorer we could access an ftp server with a saved userid and password. Then, we could open an ftp server file in the default application (e.g. pdf file would open in Adobe Reader) without providing the server password again (it was already
 provided when accessing the server).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 Explorer the ftp server file is automatically opened in the default browser and is asking for the server password again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we only want to view the contents of the file this is an unnecessary step and quite frustrating having to enter the password multiple times to view each file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a configuration setting in Windows 10 that replicates the Windows 7 Explorer capability of opening ftp files in their default application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I found the option to 'set program associations by app' (Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Default Programs\Set Program Associations) but the FTP protocol checkboxes for my browser are locked and cannot be unchecked.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Repair Disk fails to locate system image -- bmrui.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles e. w. ward  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Repair Disk fails to locate system image -- bmrui.exe Application error</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 on a a Dell XPS8700 purchased in November 2013.<br />
<br />
I am attempting to prepare for the installation of Windows 10. In case something <br />
unpredictable goes wrong (like a power failure during installation), my plan was to restore Windows 7 from a system image created during Backup and Restore by using my Windows Repair disk created by the Control Panel app.<br />
<br />
I created the system image and stored it on my external hard drive (USB interface). To test that my fallback plan would work I booted from my Windows Repair disk, planning to see that it could locate the system image but stopping short of actually writing the
 image back onto my internal hard disk.<br />
<br />
However, When the repair program window appears (labelled Re_Image your computer) and I select "Select a system image" I get the error message "bmrui.exe
<br />
Application error -- The instruction at 0xff75b494 references memory at <br />
0x00000000. The memory could not be read."&nbsp; How do I get past this error?&nbsp; I created a second copy of the Windows Repair disk but the same thing happened.<br />
<br />
I went to the on-line Microsoft Answer Desk chat and asked the questions but the <br />
person I was chatting with told me that because my copy of Windows was an OEM <br />
version that Microsoft could not help me -- they only supported retail copies of <br />
Windows.&nbsp; The case number was 1294331186.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

            What you need to do is download the ISO file directly, then save to folder in the Finder.
<br />
<br />If you are running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 or later, Windows 10 1703 or later should be sufficient. 
<br />
<br />All you need to do is download the ISO file:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Press Command key + Space bar
<br />Type: Boot Camp
<br />or Open the Finder &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Boot Camp
<br />
<br />Launch Boot Camp
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Browse
<br />Select the ISO file you just downloaded
<br />
<br />Resize the partition - I recommend about 40 to 50 GBs or more when dual booting with Windows. See the following article for more information about deciding on space:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/install-windows-10-mac-os-x-boot-camp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/install-window...</a>
<br />
<br />Click Install
<br />
<br />Wait while partitions the disk
<br />Downloads Windows Support software
<br />
<br />Your Mac will automatically restart and Boot into Windows 10 setup.
<br />
<br />Remember to choose the partition during setup named BOOTCAMP.
<br />
<br />You should be good to go.

            Hi  sannesley
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 battery
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 battery
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />Also, uninstall all the USB controllers in Device Manager. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers at the bottom
<br />
<br />Right click each entry then click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit then restart 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will then redetect them. 
<br />

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply to this issue and try to help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted two links below to screen captures of my system SKU information as requested.</p>

</p><p>As per your instructions regarding deleting the USB controllers do you want me just to delete the entries labelled, and ending in "<em>Host Controller</em>" or do you want me to delete every single entry. When I only deleted the entires ending in "<em>Host
 Controller</em>" i lost the use of the keyboard and mouse so I had to swithc off the PC by holding in the power button. When I restated the PC the deleted USB contollers re-appeared and still had the exclamation marks beside them as in the screen capture above
 in my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try resetting the BIOS defaults when I get a chance and let you know how that turned out.</p>

<p>I have reset the BIOS by interrupting the start up and resetting the values in the BIOS setup. restarting the PC seems to have had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thjnk that it appears to be a software issue for a number of reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When I plug a 16GB pen drive into one of the three non-working ports it's regonized and opens up exactly like it should normally. It will not be recognized or open on the other 2 front USB ports which don't work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I connect the HDD into a USB port on the back of the PC it works normally, opening up and displaying the files.</p>

            I am not seeing any information regarding the model of your motherboard.
<br />
<br />If its custom built system, do you have the box the motherboard came in? It should provide details about the make and model. 
<br />
<br />Regarding the USB controllers, please delete all of them then restart.

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with Windows 10 updates triggering automatically. I manually updated to the latest Windows 10 Build 1903 this evening as shown below</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2096304-d98f-4b61-8305-252941e6eccf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2096304-d98f-4b61-8305-252941e6eccf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have fixed the issues with the USB Host controllers. All are functioning normally now and recognize&nbsp; the HDD and pen drives when inserted. One issue I would like to ask your advice on is the issue with Windows updater. I've attached a screen
 shot below to show you the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the top in red text it says some settings are managed by your organization. My PC is a private PC at home and to the best of my knowledge not linked to any organization. Also when I check for updates I am hit with the error shown in the screenshot below.
 I am connected to the internet. Can you please advise.&nbsp;</p>

            For issue issue #1
<br />
<br />Try disabling telemetry:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Feedback and diagnostics. 
<br />Set it to basic 
<br />
<br />Click Start 
<br />Type: regedit 
<br />Right click regedit 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following key: 
<br />
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection. 
<br />
<br />Right click and create a DWORD value named AllowTelemetry then set 0
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type gpedit.msc then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Expand Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components
<br />
<br />In the Windows Components dialog, find and right-click on Data Collection and Preview Builds
<br />Then double-click Allow Telemetry in the right pane
<br />Choose Disabled and choose 3-Full from the drop-down menu.
<br />Then click OK to save settings
<br />
<br />Click Apply and ok &gt; reboot computer
<br />
<br />For issue issue #2
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<p>These questions fall pretty well outside the purpose of this group, which is to support folks having problems installing and running programs under Vista.&nbsp; I would suggest perusing the MSDN (Microsoft Developer Networks) forums where the programmers hang
 out.</p>

    <title>Ethernet Constantly Loses Connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wesleyspearman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet Constantly Loses Connection</h2>
                    Sometimes when I connect my ethernet cable, it works fine and I have internet connection for a few hours. Sometimes, for a few minutes. I had one day where my ethernet worked perfectly fine where it didn't lose connection at all, but more recently, it
 doesn't want to stay connected. Pretty much every single time I have run the troubleshooter to find out what the problem was, it comes back with 'default gateway unavailable'. I have tried changing the cables, changing powerline adapters (TP-Link TL-PA411s),
 updating drivers, reinstalling drivers and nothing has worked. Does anyone have a suggestion as to what the problem is and how I can fix it?

<p>Hi Wesley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting the error message default gateway unavailable usually appears when your computer did not receive a default gateway from your Internet Service Provider. You've pretty much updated/reinstalled your network adapter drivers, use different Ethernet cable
 but still, the issue persists which implies that the problem now lies to your modem or router (if you're using one) as it doesn't keep the default gateway. I would suggest that you get in touch with your router support team or Internet Services Provider so
 they can properly guide you in updating the router/modem's firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us should you need further assistance.</p>
<p>

Despite my loss of connection, another computer connected to the same router via ethernet works fine. We are both connected to the router with only 1 powerline adapter connected to the router. Would having another powerline adapter &amp; ethernet cable plugged
 into the router help?

<p>It depends on the setup, Wesley. Since both computers are sharing the same powerline adapter, there's a possibility that one of the PCs may lose internet connection. Getting another powerline and another Ethernet cable for your other
 computer will surely help you get a stable connection. However, there are still other factors that may trigger internet connection issues when using Powerline adapters. I suggest that you get in touch with your router or powerline adapter support team so they
 can properly guide you through the setup. You may no longer need to get another set if everything is properly set up.</p>

    <title>Howto use an older version of msftedit.dll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tps01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Howto use an older version of msftedit.dll</h2>
                    Dear All, I am using a system that prints using the system dll msftedit.dll. The system vendor says that I have to use an older version of the msftedit.dll to get print correct. I believe the vender has a bug in his system as he is not able to use the
 latest msftedit.dll. Anyway, I want to use an older version, 5.41.15.1514 and not 5.41.21.2506 which is on my system. I am on Windows 2003 X64 Server SP2. Anytime I try to replace the current version of msftedit.dll with the older one the older one gets overwritten
 by the new one. I believe Windows File Protection kicks in! How do I make the overwrite not happen? Is it possible to disable Windows File Protection for just this file? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks - TPS01

            I believe that when an application looks for dlls it looks in it's current directory first before looking in the system directory. Try putting the older dll in the same folder as the application and see if that works.

<h2>            WiFi gets dropped randomly and can&#39;t connect back to any network UNLESS laptop is restarted</h2>
                    <p>Issue:<br />
- WiFi gets dropped randomly</p>
<p>- Can't connect back to any network (not just home) but even my phone's tethered network ("Can't connect to this network")</p>
<p>- Every other device (tablet, phone, another laptop) maintains connection so the issue is with this laptop, not the network<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>ASUS X555DA laptop</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Qualcomm Atheros AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- everything up to date (Windows automatic update)</p>
<p>- manually updated wireless network adapter from manufacturer's site</p>
<p>- forgetting network and reconnecting</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens at least 2-3 times a day. I have programs that need to be running at all times and this is seriously affecting my work because I have to restart my laptop every time and wish it doesn't happen again any time soon. Can't use a product if it's unreliable.</p>

            Hi Luna
<br />
<br />What I would try doing to resolve this is to make sure the latest version of Windows 10, version 1809 is installed.
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br /> Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?
<br />Check this List to Determine if Your Computer is Compatible with the Windows 10 1809
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />	perform the following tasks:
<br />	12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10 
<br />	<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-computer-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-comput...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a Drive with Limited Space
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update-on-a/d7cdba8b-c59b-4a23-86e2-6635a7e44489">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thats it, the Windows 10 1809 is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1809 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p><span>So, I got the new Xbox system update sometime last week and I was interested in getting hooked up with Paypal. The Xbox tells you that you need to go to xbox.com/paypal to link your accounts. Only problem is that
 website hasn't been working for me for days! It keeps saying,"<span>T</span><span><span>his content cannot be displayed in a
 frame."&nbsp;</span><span>A</span></span><span>nd it says the website may be experiencing a problem and come back later. Anyone having the same problem or know when this thing will start working??</span></span></p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just set mine up there and it worked fine.</p>

<p>From your screenshot it shows you have opened Skype from within Facebook.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does the problem also occur if you enter directly into Skype through the app icon? If it does still present, what happens if you log out of Facebook then go directly to the Skype app?</p>

            <p>Hello Vanessa,</p>
<p>I use a 3rd party freeware application, Universal Extractor, and don't have such problems on my system. Download it from here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Universal-Extractor/3000-2250_4-75449770.html?tag=mncol;2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Universal-Extractor/3000-2250_4-75449770.html?tag=mncol;2</a>&nbsp; (use the Direct Download Link only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once installed you right-click on the file to be extracted and choose either Extract here or Extract to a subdirectory. Its fast, handles most compression formats, and no security issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            Missing Java Icon in Control Panel</h2>
                    I updated Java software. <br />
Went to Control Panel and found the Java Icon missing. <br />
How do I get it, or how do I clear Java cache without it?<br />

            What happens if you try to launch the Java Control Panel applet manually?<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter (or copy and paste):<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\<b>javacpl.cpl</b><br />
<br />
Click OK.<br />
<br />
Does the Java Control Panel open?&nbsp; If not, what does happen?<br />
<br />
When looking at your Control Panel list of things, right click one of the icons and choose 'Sort by Name' to reorder the Control Panel listing alphabetically.&nbsp; Could be your Java icon is hiding out at the bottom of the list and is just out of sight.<br />
<br />
"Sort by Name' also works in your Start, Programs listing too.<br />
