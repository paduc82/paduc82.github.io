<h2>            Version 1703 Creator Release - Networking Share problems</h2>
                    <p>My home peer to peer networking is very simple.&nbsp; One primary computer which shares two printers; both printers are working fine via HomeGroup.&nbsp; The primary computer also shares a network drive (Drive F), but it is no longer sharing correctly - that is not
 at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a total of three computers, so it is very simple.&nbsp; All three computers are running Win 10 Home version 1703 Creator Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the primary computer can see the network drives, they are physically attached via USB.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary computer can show all three computers on the Network Folder and any thing that is shared from all three of them, and its "File History" system works correctly on this one primary computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two satellite computers cannot see the network shared drives but as I said they can see and use the shared network printers.&nbsp; "File History" no longer works on those two satellite computers, nor can I "copy" files to and from the shared network drives.&nbsp;
 Those two computers do not reflect the other two computers in their network folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:&nbsp; The error generated when trying to execute "File History" is 0x80070569</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other problems that have been created going to 1703 from 1607 I have fixed; but this one issue seems to be the last error and problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what is wrong and how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could be a number of possible reasons why the network sharing function would suddenly act in a way that it was supposed to. One are changed settings that needs to be tweaked, due to the recent update. Nevertheless, kindly provide the following information
 so we could further investigate on this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far? </li><li>Have you tried changing the permissions on the shared drive from the main PC?</li></ul>
<p>Also, please post a screenshot of the error message so we could have a closer look. From there, we'll see which is the best possible troubleshooting step to take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

<p>At this point I have tried the traditional measures to no avail.&nbsp; Troubleshoot for Network, HomeGroup, and Sharing.&nbsp; They all test "No issues detected"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried toggle of a share drive off, on, off, and then on.&nbsp; It did make that so that one share drive were I could be mapped on one of the secondary computers.&nbsp; But not the FileHistory share drive (access denied).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two secondary computers can see each other just fine and the folders and files show up on each one under "network" via File Explorer.&nbsp; Still neither of the two secondary computers have the primary computer showing up under "network" in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next steps I will try is to essentially delete the HomeGroups from all computers, delete the idstore.sst from the \PeerNetworking; and then delete all the remaining files in \PeerNetworking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toggle the primary computer share drives "sharing" on and off a few times, reboot, etc. and ultimately start the whole process over again (major pain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is essentially the same problem when going from Version 1511 to 1607.&nbsp; In that specific case the problem was not fixed until Microsoft came out with version 14393.321 for the 1607.&nbsp; I do not recall if that took a couple of weeks or a couple of months
 before I had peer to peer networking again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the impression this has something to do with authorization or name approval for the secondary computers to gain access to the primary computer share drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened (failure of peer to peer networking) each time there has been a major Win 10 release:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Original Win 10 to Version 1511</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; 1511 to 1607</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; 1607 to 1703</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>In addition to the information above; since I have not yet started any of the steps with the idstore.sst etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on one of the secondary computers attempting to execute FileHistory (backup) which gives the message of "access denied" the message comes up to enter "network credentials" and when I attempt to do that, the message comes up "network credentials are no
 longer valid" - thus FileHistory cannot execute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this provides any information and a quick solution, let me know?&nbsp; Otherwise in the next day or so (time permitting); I will begin with the steps to delete idstore.sst etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I do have an idea what is going on; just do not know how to fix it just yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For What It Is Worth:&nbsp; The primary computer upgraded to 1703 May 11, the next secondary computer on May 13, and the next on May 15.</p>

<p>Thanks for following up. The error message that you provided brought light that could lead us to a possible solution. The next step that you could try first is the check the credential manager in control panel. Feel free to check out
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/bd6febeb-f8b2-4f3b-849d-fcbc5b3f598f/your-file-history-credentials-are-no-longer-valid-reenter-your-credentials?forum=win10itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this thread</a></strong><strong>
</strong>and look for <strong>Teemo Tang's</strong> answer. From here you can find more information about credentials manager and how to change the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for updates.</p>

<p>There are essentially two parts within Teemo Tang's answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Running FileHistory - turn it on.&nbsp; I did this the last few days and this morning too.&nbsp; Same results, the secondary computer knows the \\server\FileHistory is there; but running still produces the same results - credentials no longer valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The second part is under the security tab for the Folder being shared; I noticed that both \FileHistory and \OtherData on the primary computer had "Everyone" removed (gone) on the security tab, so I added it back.&nbsp; That still does not work?&nbsp; Also, both
 secondary computers have both "Everyone" and "Home Users" on their Security Tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft should build in a Peer Networking and HomeGroup "Reset" (much like the Reset Network); that is back to ground zero, so that Peer Networking and HomeGroups can easily be established new again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime is there a clear set of instructions that would accomplish the same thing?</p>

<p>Side Notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware - Computer Virus</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the two links above will get you two computer viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win Defender quick scan will not find them.</p>
<p>Win Defender full scan will find them and allow you to remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if Win Defender could catch them before they enter your computer and alert at that time; it does not!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an additional precaution, I ran Win Defender Offline.&nbsp; Unfortunately it does not provide a report of any kind, positive or negative or that you have even executed Win Defender Offline.&nbsp; It is not recorded in your scan history log?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win Defender Offline did bring back the completely stupid Amazon Assistant, which of course has to be removed again - it order to eliminate the res://aa?????&nbsp; blank web site each time you boot up the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway back to solving the peer networking nightmare, later.</p>

<p>Ok, the HomeGroup on the primary computer has essentially set itself up twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted all files and folders in the \\server......\PeerNetworking folder including the idstore.sst; and yet the HomeGroup is still there under control panel and ask me to join, even though this is the computer-primary that originally set it up, which
 means it should not ask me the question to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to actually remove this unwanted persistent HomeGroup that got duplicated with the Win 10 Creator release?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a Microsoft tech available that knows how to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Skype crashing on Windows 10 - May be related to installing Microsft Teams</h2>
                    <p>Having a problem with Skype for Windows 10 crashing about have a second after it loads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior may be related to installing Microsoft Teams. I was having some trouble with my Office 365 apps not being properly registered. After a support call to resolve that I noticed that the latest version of Microsoft Teams being installed. I first
 noticed the behavior after this - but it could have happened before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the following steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Uninstalled Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Updated Windows 10 to the latest build - 1809</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Tried uninstalling an reinstalling skype - did not fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Completely removed Skype with the Skype Removal Tool I found on these forums and then reinstalled - still does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The non-Windows 10 version of Skype works fine on the machine - so I have some workaround - but would like to get the Windows 10 app working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't think of anything else to do other then totally reinstall Windows which I would rather not do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any other suggestions</p>
<p />

<p><span><span>I suspect that that the issue is caused by the outdated graphics display driver. There is no updates available for the Windows 10 version, but you can try to install the

<p>
</p><p>I tried installing this driver. It would not install. It said my system does not meet the minimum requirements for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reinstalled Microsoft Team - Then reset, uninstalled and reinstalled Skype for Windows 10. Still no luck. Microsoft Team calls work fine - as does Zoom, FB Messenger and other apps. Skype for Windows 10 still crashes 1 second after loading.&nbsp;</p>

            Not sure i understand how you update a piece of software on my computer automatically in the middle of the workday and the software stops working making the day extremely costly. I will figure out how to shutoff auto update but not sure in this case it
 would have helped.&nbsp; Furthermore then i am asked to spend hours with techs to solve the software issue on my computer. Who is paying me to do this? As much of a fan of Microsoft as i am I would ask that you are more careful with your testing and updates. My
 initial reaction was to immediately switch applications. If i did that I would not be back anytime soon.

            Mysteriously started working again.Version - 14.40.70. Not obvious to me that I did anything to make it work - but perhaps a new version was installed.&nbsp;

<h2>            Slow screen response to keyboard typing</h2>
                    when typing in outlook the screen text does not appear as I type, which means I have to keep stopping to wait for it to catch up and then when it does appear on the screen, if there are typo's I&nbsp; have to keep going back to correct.. very frustrating<br />
<br />
thanks, look forward to a resolution to my problem.

            Does the problem only occur when using Outlook? If yes, then try running Outlook in its Safe Mode to see if one of your add-ons is causing the problem.<br />

<span><br />
<br />
If the problem occurs in other programs besides Outlook, please clarify and include information about your computer, what security programs you have installed, and what you've already done to troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

            I found out how to fix it, use ctrl+alt+del to get to the task manager, then use that to start a new process and type in msconfig. then find windows error report and disable it, that will stop the screen flashing. You'll need to do a restart but it will
 be fine

            Hi, I had the same problem with the flashing screen after upgrading (?) to Window 10 from Windows 7. &nbsp;It's hard to call it an upgrade though since it made my computer unusable and I had to revert back to Windows 7. I tried the suggestion you gave and those
 items were already disabled on the list. Nothing worked besides getting rid of it entirely.

            It's funny that I said Window 10 instead of Windows 10 as a typo. That was actually true, I only had one window after the install.

            <p>I had the same problem as the original poster. I used this suggestion, and the screen immediately stopped flashing. Please note, if you are not familiar with the Task Manager, you will have to click on "File" to get a box to allow you to type in "msconfig"
 which will open a drop-down box and you will have to search for the Windows Error Reporting to disable it. (This may take a few minutes, as it can be hard to find.) After you uncheck the box next to this, don't forget to click on "Apply," or nothing will happen.</p>

    <title>WMP 12 Streaming Errors With Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dominiclucarelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP 12 Streaming Errors With Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have upgraded to Windows 10 and, for the most part, I like it very much. But it has almost totally destroyed my ability to stream&nbsp; music using Windows Media Player 12. When running under Windows 7 (which I really do not wish to revert back to),
 WMP 12 would stream EXACTLY as I wanted to my Onkyo TX-NR717 A/V receiver. I have my entire CD collection ripped to the hard drive on my PC in both .wav and .mp3, and the collection is kept in master folders, i.e., "Classical A", Classical B", etc., "Rock
 A", "Rock B", etc., and the artists/composers subfolders are contained within - Beethoven would be in the "Classical B" folder, Beatles would be in the "Rock B" folder and so on - and the album folders are contained within those artist/composer subfolders.
 It makes it very easy to find music when streaming. But now, since I have Windows 10 installed, everything shows up on my TV screen as individual artist folders, which means there are about 30 pages of info to navigate though, which takes forever to find anything.
 Not only that - and this is the most infuriating thing of all - whenever I try to play an album, WMP 12 lists the tracks onscreen in ALPHABETICAL ORDER, not the Track Order that is shown in both WMP 12 on the PC, and also in Windows Explorer. How STUPID is
 that?! For example, if I try to play the "Sgt. Pepper" album by the Beatles, the first track is listed as "A Day in the Life", which is actually the LAST track on that album. What happened to WMP 12 after this upgrade that causes this, and how can I fix it?
 WMP 12 was the only music program that streamed my music collection exactly the way I wanted, and now it is practically unusable.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and a few things:<br />
1.) I tried talking to a Microsoft tech person, and he made the ridiculous suggestion that I make a playlist for evry indidual album. I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have nearly 1000 CDs ripped in 2 different formats, which means I would have to make nearly 2000 playlists. Really,
 Microsoft?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REALLY?!<br />
2.) Do not tell me to use that God-awful Groove Music program. It stinks. It is horrible, and it's useless for people like me that do not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use portable devices.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would really just like it to run the way it did in Windows 7. And, BTW, the Onkyo receiver has nothing to do with the problem. It just streams what WMP 12 sends to it. Any help would be sincerely appreciated, since music streaming with WMP 12 is
 something I do nearly all day long.</div>

            No, it does not help, and I really don’t want to have to disable my anti-virus software and disconnect from the Internet every time I feel like streaming music to my home theater system. Anyway, it never interfered with WMP 12 when Win 7 was running. And
 why in the world would my anti-virus software cause WMP 12 to stream album tracks in alphabetical order?

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, I tried all of that when I first had problems - uninstalling and reinstalling in the Windows Programs and Features, rebuilding the libraries both automatically and manually, etc. I cannot totally uninstall and reinstall WMP 12 because I
 cannot download WMP 12 as an app that I can install, although I do still have the WMP 11&nbsp;installation program&nbsp;saved on my HDD.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a computer genius, but I believe the fault is in the program itself and not in Windows 10 (which, besides my problems with WMP, I like very much; quite frankly, I barely remember Windows 7, and I loved Windows 7). I have the streaming music
 program Foobar 2000, and when I use that to stream music to my home theater (BTW, I don't stream wirelessly - I have a hardline to the router), it streams my folders and files EXACTLY the way WMP 12 used to do: the master folders are displayed, and the artist/album
 subfolders have the tracks arranged in track order, like the CD, and not in alphabetical order, as WMP 12 is now doing. The problem is, I like Foobar, and it runs fine under Win 10, but it doesn't start up in the task bar like WMP at startup, and also I cannot
 get it to stream my album art, which WMP 12 still does flawlessly. I can get along without the automatic startup, but I really enjoy having the album art displayed on my HDTV while I listen to music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I truly think the problem is somewhere in the registry settings of WMP 12, but I do not like to edit the registry without specific instructions on what to do, although I have done a few registry edits before with instructions from Microsoft and other
 reputable computer folks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I've always loved using WMP for my music and video, but now it's just really difficult to use while streaming. I really wish Microsoft would stop trying to abandon this program. With a little work you
 could probably make it the best music program in the world.</p>

            <p>Hi Dominic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>
<p>Have you tried disabling the anti-virus software and checking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work,<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;I would suggest you to try clean boot and check which third party software's are creating this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts
 that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able
 to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior
 if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

It has nothing to do with the virus scanner. I have said this before. It has nothing to do with the Windows OS itself. It has to do with WMP 12. I still believe it is a problem that needs
 to be fixed in the registry. My virus scanner is not going to cause WMP 12 to stream my album tracks in alphabetical order.

I have no problems besides WMP 12. Windows 10 runs great, and all my programs and external devices work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I cannot be the only person with this problem. I have my music arranged on my HDD in a very specific way, and WMP used to stream to my home theater receiver (Onkyo TX-NR717) in the exact order that my music is on the
 HDD, and the way it looks on WMP when I open the program on the PC (i.e., Master Folder - Artist/Composer Folder - Album Folder - Numbered Track List). Now it justs shows all the individual folders, making it take forever to get to one album or track, and
 the album tracks are played in ALPHABETICAL order instead of the correct track order as on the original CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is so hard to understand here?</p>

            I believe it is Windows Media Center that is now incompatible with Windows 10. WMP 12 will still stream music to my receiver, even the album art, but it is an absolute pain in the **** to use now, when it used to be a pleasure.

            I upgraded to Windows 10 on 29th July. I also had problems with WMP. I have approx 2000 WMP playlists. When I upgraded to Windows 10 none of these playlists showed on the player. They are still showing in MyMusic/Playlists. I have asked Microsoft several
 times about this but have not received a satisfactory answer. I am not prepared to recreate all my playlists so have reverted back to Windows 7. I shall stay with Windows 7 for the life of my Desktop PC and rethink what to do when I need a replacement PC.
 Seems to me that these are all simple problems with WMP but Microsoft don'tt seem keen on resolving them. I have a massive music collevtion in mp3 format and I am not concerned with streaming etc I just want to play my music from my hard disc.<br />

 next call and it is not working again.&nbsp; It is very embarrassing that whoever I am calling can see my screen.&nbsp; Please can you advise on this.

<p>Follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

<li>You will need to use the Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;installation media.<br />
<span><strong>Create Windows 10 ISO: </strong></span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></span></li><li>Insert the media&nbsp;and reboot your device.</li><li>Now, from the main window run cmd by pressing and holding Shift + F10 keyboard keys.</li><li>Up next, on the cmd window type “regedit” in order to open Registry Editor.</li><li>Navigate to “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE” folder and from there select “Load Hive”.</li><li>Go to path “C:\Windows\System32\Config” and pick “System”.

            <p>Sorry for the delay but I have been ill. &nbsp;I am a 81year &nbsp;old senior and a lot of the computer terms I do not understand. &nbsp;The problem started when I turned my computer on one morning and chekdisk was running and stalled &nbsp;at 3%. I finally turned it off and
 then everytime I would reboot it chekdisk would return.</p>
<p>I downloaded the media tool like the email stated on my laptop then to a sandisk. &nbsp;Tried a repair but things did not go as planned. &nbsp;Everything stopped and I am now setting in BIOS Setup Utility with it telling me to insert boot media in selected boot device
 and press a key. &nbsp;When I press a key it returns to the previous page. &nbsp;Been researching on how to get out of this. &nbsp;I appreciate everthing Microsoft offers to help us out of these situations. Many thanks to</p>
<p>all for their time. &nbsp;Any advice appreciated!</p>

Update your Audio driver with the latest drivers, whether it be on board or a descrete audio card.<br />

Then, when you try and run the game, right click the shortcut and select troubleshoot compatiblity, run the program in Windows Service Pack 3 mode.<br />
<br />
Let me know how you go.<br />

<h2>            How do I connect windows XP to wifi&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, so I'm trying to connect my grandma's old pc to wifi but I have virtually no experience with XP. I actually don't have any experience with technology that doesn't connect to wifi automatically so all I know hot to do is click on my network and type
 in my password. It seems to be a lot more complicated than that on windows xp though so I need some help figuring out how to get to the list of wifi network options. I have already looked up like a dozen different threads on this and nothing has helped so
 far. Please tell me how to connect XP to wifi!!

            Hello Rhonda, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you!

    <title>Windows Update breaks Windows 8 Start screen Internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickuofm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update breaks Windows 8 Start screen Internet connection</h2>
                    <p>When starting from a newly refreshed state, if I install any Windows Update or driver update, my Windows 8 Start screen apps can no longer connect to the Internet. My desktop connection continues to connect to the Internet just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've traced it to the fact that my active network gets deleted. The newly refreshed state shows a public network in the Network and Sharing Center under "View your active networks." I can then change it to private and create a homegroup, if I want to. After
 any update completes though, this active network gets blown away and it says, "You are currently not connected to any networks."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix this state without refreshing Windows and how do I keep Windows&nbsp;Update from doing this in the future?</p>

<p>It is the internet connection marked as home or work connection. I changed mine to public (Charm &gt; Setting &gt; Connection &gt; right-click active connection &gt; Turn sharing on or off &gt; No, (for network in public place.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The printer driver is most probably damaged or incompatible with Windows 10. You can fix the issue by reinstalling and updating the printer driver. To do so, you may follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />
1. Open Control Panel.<br />
2. View by Small icons. Click Device Manager.<br />
3. In the Device Manager window, locate the printer device that you wish to update the driver. For problematic drivers, you will see a yellow exclamation mark next to the device name.<br />
4. Right-click on the device name and select Update Driver Software.<br />
5. In the pop-up window, you will see two options. It is recommended to select the first option which is to Search automatically for updated driver software. Then follow the instructions to install the drivers. If you have driver files available on your computer,
 you can then select the 2nd option.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your response.<br />

<h2>            WINDOWS UPDATE EXCESSIVE DATA USAGE IS INCONSIDERATE&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use a cellular connection to run my computer and have to pay for my data. Right now I have 5 GB of data a month and if I was to update my computer every time Windows wants to update it, I would run out of data even if I was not going to use my computer
 at all. I turned of automatic updates to control it , but it is very frustrating to do this. I have to take my laptop to the library in town just to do updates. I costs me $6.00 in gas just to go to town and back. I try not to go to town more than 2 times
 a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that Microsoft has no concern about the amount of data it requires to do updates. I chatted with some arrogant support person and he treated me like an idiot and said he was going to send me some trouble shooting that might help me. He never sent
 me anything and I know it is because if he sent the chat transcript, he would be fired when I reported him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now it is requesting an update for .9 GB. The previous update was for 2.16 GB. It happens all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to keep my computer up to date but Microsoft makes it very difficult to do so. There has to be a way to have updates that just change a small potion of a program with out consuming so much data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GET IT TOGETHER MICROSOFT!!!!!</p>

            I too, am concerned about my metered connection data usage, and report that half of my GB total for the month has been Updating Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I get update requests almost every morning and attempt to install them, but often have "failed to install" problems,
 with no idea why this is happening.&nbsp; Why does the "downloading update" bar stop halfway across?&nbsp; I often go make my coffee and come back to see it still in that position.&nbsp; When do I get to use my computer?&nbsp; It seems Microsoft is using it more than I am.&nbsp; Can
 you leave that "downloading" screen and go about your receiving mail, and checking the news on the internet?&nbsp; If I go to the home page is it aborting the update?&nbsp; Sometimes when I go back to the settings page, I get the message "all done" but what is the delay.&nbsp;
 Often it is a half a day later before I can close out the settings window.&nbsp; Why does it take so long to "install".&nbsp; It seems to me that the update mechanics are very glitchy.&nbsp; I can send a 1.5 MB photo in a couple of seconds.&nbsp; Why can't it (Microsoft) download
 and install a 1.5 MB update in the same time frame?&nbsp; What don't I know about the process?&nbsp;

            <p>You might try using the steps I outlined in my blog about restricting excess data use, which will help when you're on a mobile connection.&nbsp; What's great is that you can apply this to your mobile connection only, so that when you come around wifi, it will
 automatically switch from "sip" to "gulp" and grab all the data it needs when the opportunity arises.

            Wow!&nbsp; Thanks Shawn.&nbsp; I went to Control Panel and Systems &amp; Security, and to Windows update, where it picked up my stalled update, and immediately installed the updates with a progress meter.&nbsp; I am going to use that every time, just to expedite the process,
 and make sure they get properly installed.&nbsp; Thank you for a great tip.&nbsp; Much appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>I wouldn't do that <em>every</em> time, because it should be fixed now.&nbsp; That little tool basically resets the entire update subsystem to clean out anything that got stuck.&nbsp; I don't think it would hurt to use it every time, but it would probably result in
 slower performance as the cache and updates have to be loaded again from scratch.</p>

            <p>We also are concerned about this.</p>
<p>I guees we have to install on 'Important' and 'Recommeded' on our PC,&nbsp; but as you say, your data has gone and now you are left with a budget to work off for all the things you wanted your data for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being computer savvy, or up with the jargen sometimes noted on the summaries when one reads about these updates - optional - it is agreeable that to use our own descretion regarding what to download or not instead of automatic updates is a bit frightening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We only have 6GBs of data a month.&nbsp; This is a HP Pavilion 23 and when the technician came to set it up he did not do anything regarding updates.&nbsp; In fact, I had made the comment to the organisation before sending out technician to say that we only have 6GB
 and what sort of data would they be needing to set it up.&nbsp; Was told it will be alright.&nbsp; Well it was'nt because he did not do this part of the deal.</p>
<p>Updates from <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">both</span> Microsoft and HP came rolling in on the 29th and 30th May.&nbsp; Set up computer on 27th May.&nbsp; This took most of our remaining data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is getting to the stage, I feel, that I am asking 'the air'...."Do I really have to go onto Microsoft forums to find out if I need this optional update or not?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window update KB2962409 - optional - I have just installed.&nbsp; What was it really?</p>

Issues that this update fixes</p>
<p>I installed this anyway, despite the fact that data is precious. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PeterARCZN</span> - I think Microsoft is in with the 'coffee' compaines - or if you smoke, the 'cigarette' companies!!&nbsp; I see that 'being hooked', 'not being able to get away from your computer' is classified as a
 mental health 'disorder' or <em>problematic internet use</em> (PIU).</p>

<h2>            ASUS G551JM, Realtek ALC668, Internal Microphone Low sensitivity after upgrading to windows 10 and Microphone boost not working</h2>
                    <p>after upgrading to windows 10, and when using skype I noticed that my sound is not heard, so i tried to change every settings related to microphone sensitivity, and I updated all drivers, and nothing works.
</p>
<p>so I hope Microsoft to solve this.</p>
