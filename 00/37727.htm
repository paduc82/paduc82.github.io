    <title>Windows7 professional product key doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows7 professional product key doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Compaq SR5140AN which originally had Vista; I purchased the family Windows7 Home Premium upgrade, no problems there. I have also purchased the Windows7 Professional anytime upgrade, but it doesn't accept the product code that came with it, yet it
 verifies as genuine.</p>
<p>As I don't need to have the upgrade, I am looking to go back to the Home Premium, at least I know that works. After reading comments on a similar inquiry, how do I do a clean install? The Compaq had the software pre-installed on the original 160gb hard drive,
 which has recently been replace with a 1TB hard drive.</p>
<p>I also found that with Professional, my computer kept freezing and I was advised that the mainboard was a problem and needed to be replaced which it has. I also now have the same problem on my laptop which is now also asking for the product key.</p>
<p>According to item 2b in the terms and conditions, (I don't believe that I have misunderstood it), that as I am licensed to install Windows7 on up to 3 computers, I can also apply the upgrade to those same machines. If this is not the case, I'm happy to remove
 the upgrade, problem is, how do I do it? Alternatively, how do I get a product key that works. I have all the original Windows7 HP upgrade disks and the Windows7 packing and product key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards; Tone</p>

    <title>Windows Frequently Fails to Load the Driver for my WLAN Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Frequently Fails to Load the Driver for my WLAN Adapter &#40;Code 31&#41;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">My USB WLAN adapter [Asus USB-N53] frequently stops working. When this happens, the adapter no longer appears in the Network and Sharing Center and Device Manager reports this error:&nbsp;<strong>This device is not working properly because
 Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)</strong><br />
<br />
Event Viewer shows the following error: <strong>Event ID 1001 - Your computer was not assigned an address from the network (by the DHCP Server) for the Network Card with network address 0x0...The following error occured: 0x79</strong>. However this is really
 meaningless since DHCP can't assign an IP address to a device that Windows has not loaded.<br />
<br />
I already have the most recent version of the manufacturer's driver for my WLAN adapter.<br />
<br />
I have been unable to determine a cause-and-effect pattern for this problem. Sometimes it happens after a restart and other times it seems to happen spontaneously. I have never - yet - experienced this problem with a wired (Ethernet) connection.<br />
<br />
To fix the problem I simply uninstall my adapter in Device Manager and then "scan for hardware changes" which successfully loads my adapter's driver and restores its functionality, although I have to re-enter my network password.<br />
<br />
Why does Windows 8.1 frequently fail to load the driver for my WLAN adapter?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Attention 'Microsoft Support Engineers:'<br />
I have not made any hardware or software changes to my computer.<br />
The problem still occurs when starting Windows in a clean boot environment.<br />
A SFC scan on my computer does not find any corrupt system files.<br />
Restoring to an earlier point in time does not solve the problem.<br />
The problem still exists in a new user account.<br />
My WiFi adapter is securely connected to my computer.<br />
The problem still exists after I restart my router.<br />
The problem still exists when using different USB ports.<br />
My network drivers are not corrupt.<br />
My network settings are correct.<br />
The Network and Internet Connection troubleshooters have no solution.<br />

<p>Sorry, does not help, tried those, still the same situation, every now and then (most of the time timing works, but sometimes not)</p>
<p>And it is not about the laptop that I am using, the situation was similar with my previous laptop, and it is still bothering me with this new one...</p>
<p>I am using Firefox,if hat helps... No I am not trying to use another, I like Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not nice, when you think that you have done good event/result, and then you see time that is totally wrong, and you fall to the bottom instead of top, where you shoud be..</p>

 Menu</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a browser may be the cause of the problem, so we suggest this and provide us the feedback on how this goes.</p>

<p>Hello again Jari,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an occurrence that appears at random, and has occurred on more than one device, our next suggestion is to check the current network status in case this happens to be with the game not syncing properly.</p>

</div>
<div>It an Acer lap top that ran a set-up on first boot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ended up creating a bad Microsoft account but in the formate of *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;This created an host of problems. &nbsp;I ended up in closing this account. &nbsp;Everything else is sorted but I have issues with the App store.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I open app store it only gives me the option to sign in using the old and now dead name.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to create a name on line but of course it will not allow Microsoft accounts with an gmail address.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there some way to reset app store and be able to point it at my new Microsoft account?</div>

<h2>            Cannot establish remote connection to PC with user set up as an Office 365 &#47; AzureAD user</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following the advice from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/connect-to-remote-aadj-pc (as best as I can), I have tried the following -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Enabled Network Level Authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Added my user AzureAD\TimProudlock to the list of Remote Desktop Users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, whenever I try to remote connect to my PC using my iPad (either using Jump Desktop or Microsoft Remote Desktop) the connection fails.&nbsp; I'm using the credentials as follows -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Username: AzureAD\TimProudlock <em>&lt;as per the Remote Desktop Users screen&gt;</em></p>
<p>Password: <em>&lt;Office 365 password, i.e. the one that allows me to log in on the PC&gt;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the logs and the common error is that the user credentials are failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a Local User Account as a test and am able to remote connect without any problems, so there is no firewall or security settings blocking a remote connection to the PC itself, but I cannot connect to the user account setup using Office 354
 / AzureAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong?&nbsp; Is there a way to get this to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
<p />

<p><span>After receiving support from the Jump Desktop team, I was able to get it working by turning off NLA on both the PC and iPad and using the username as follows -&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>AzureAD\</span><em>&lt;email address associated with account&gt;<br />
</em>Interestingly, I also had to set the username to the above, as well as adding it as the domain, so on the Jump Desktop overview page, it showed the user credentials as 'AzureAD\AzureAD\&lt;email address associated with account&gt;', but it worked for auto-login.&nbsp;
 Otherwise, it would prompt me to log in again after the connection had been made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps anyone else that is having the same problem.</p>

            New Skype client (v8) has been lacking few features and functionalities which are expected to come in near future.
<br />
<br />Since you are on Windows 10, you must be having Windows 10 default Skype client which is v12. Can you try to use that?
<br />
<br />If you don't have v12 client, just go to Microsoft Store and download from there.

<p>My first suggestion would be to run ver7.x until they fix the most obvious flaws in &nbsp;ver. 8.x</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you insist on using ver 8.x, there is two software you can download from Logitech:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920/downloads#</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Logitech Webcam Software</strong></p>
<p><strong>Logitech Gaming Software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>They both&nbsp; let you access all the cam settings, <span>which one you chose is up to you ….mostly a question about what UI you prefer.</span></p>

<p>Hello </p>
<p>As of right now child accounts are unable to play cross platform on Fortnite. You can contact Epic Games for more information here
<a href="https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fortnite Support Center</a>. You can get on any adult account and be able to access those settings. This is something that is being looked into and more information will be released as soon as it is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed. You can make a new account as an adult and that will work.</p>
<p>Only thing I would like to remind you about is that creating a new account you're starting over again it's an account with no progress.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey there, to access cross-platform you'll need to link your Epic account to Xbox Live. You will also have to have a friend who's not on Xbox to enable the cross-platform servers! :)

<h2>            Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2015 Redistributable Installation Failure</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to install Plex Server to a Windows 10 64 bit machine. The install fails due to the lack of the Subject .msi file (the folder does not exist).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33be7ff5-e9d4-4f30-8907-b9b970cefbb6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33be7ff5-e9d4-4f30-8907-b9b970cefbb6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried to download and install it. This produced a similar error, but upon cancelling, an error box advised that it couldn't remove the old version of the same runtime (14.0.24215).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/794a2bf1-f6bd-44c7-8a38-46f84ec0e5e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/794a2bf1-f6bd-44c7-8a38-46f84ec0e5e8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The x64 version of the distributable is installed, but not the x86 version. I've also checked the registry (to remove it) and could not find it there either. I've also checked for windows update and run the windows update troubleshooting tool (it found errors
 and repaired them, but the problem is still present after a restart).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Adam</p>

<p>I had the same problem in Halo: Reach. I had the Noble Map pack and couldn't play the Difiant. So I deleted the Noble and it worked. Try to delete the First Strike and be better off with Escalation. Maybe even redownload First Strike after awhile.</p>

<h2>            WAV bitrate</h2>
                    
<div><span>
<div><span>Please help. How can I get a bitrate of 24 kbps for WAV files? I did this under Windows XP with the Microsoft Sound Recorder. Recently I installed the Windows Vista Home Basic operating
 system and surprisingly&nbsp;the Sound Recorder&nbsp;in Vista does not do that.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I need a bitrate of 24 kbps to send music by email.<br />
<br />
By using a bitrate of 24 kbps I could compress a 4:00 minutes *.wav song&nbsp;to&nbsp;720 KB (4min x 60sec x 24kbps / 8bits = 720 KB). By using Mono, not Stereo, with a bitrate of 24 kbps I found that the song does&nbsp;not loose too much&nbsp;sound quality ... at least not&nbsp;to
 my ear. I have dial-up internet using GPRS (General Purpose Radio&nbsp;Service).&nbsp;I stay on a farm out in the country, not in a city where they have fast broadband internet. I use my cellphone as modem. My download speed is 5 or 6 KB per second.&nbsp;I cannot send a
 sound file of 3 MB embedded in an email or Powerpoint Slideshow, it's far too&nbsp;heavy, it&nbsp;simply does not send. I need to compress the song to less than&nbsp;one MB.&nbsp;A MPEG Layer-3 24kbps mono WAV sound file does that for me.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Please help. I need to compress WAV files to a bitrate of 24 kbps. The Sound Recorder in Windows XP did that. The Sound Recorder in Vista can not.</span></div>

            Hello Zuikerboschkop,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I've researhed the issue and didn't find a way to do this in the sound recorder in Vista.&nbsp; I myself personally have using 3rd party audio file conversion tools to do the same thing as what you are wanting to do.&nbsp; you can use Bing.com
 or your favorite search engine to search for audio converters.&nbsp; Just as a convience, I've included the Sound Recorder notes as it relates to Vista.&nbsp;
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>To use Sound Recorder, you must have a sound card and speakers installed on your computer. If you want to record sound, you also need a microphone.
</li><li>By default, the recorded audio is saved as a Windows Media Audio (WMA) file.<br />
If you are using Windows&nbsp;Vista Home Basic N or Windows&nbsp;Vista Business N, your Sound Recorder files are saved as .wav files rather than .wma files.
</li><li>You can play your recording in a digital media player program that supports playback of WMA files.
</li></ul>

<p>I noticed that the YouTube app on the XBox One only puts out stereo sound. &nbsp;Is it designed this way or can it put out 5.1 surround sound? &nbsp;Other apps like Netflix have no problem putting out 5.1. &nbsp;YouTube videos work fine on the computer putting out 5.1.</p>

<h3> jimmy-bean  say:</h3>
<h2>            rundll32.exe</h2>
                    
<p>My computer suffers from the old 'cannot find rundll32.exe' problem. The most common solution I'm getting is "full system restore".</p>
<p>So I get my windows XP installation disk, boot it up and the menu appears. However, when I click on the top option, to install XP, nothing happens. The result is the same with most of the buttons except 'browse files on this CD'. How can I work around this
 problem?</p>

<p>Let me translate the&nbsp;<em>solution</em> of Full System Restore for you:</p>
<p>"I have no idea what is going on with your computer or how to fix it, so try this and maybe it will work."</p>
<p>The c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe file is one of 3498 Windows Protected Files. so it is unlikely to be missing. &nbsp;That means that if your Windows File Protection is working, it is almost impossible for that file (or any of the 3497&nbsp;others) to really be
 missing. &nbsp;The file is more likely to be infected or has been replaced by some version of a file with the same name from malicious software.</p>
<p>You could just replace rundll32.exe it with one of the many other good copies already on your HDD and that may relieve your symptom, but not fix the problem - your computer would still be infected.</p>
<p>I would not recommend trying to work around the problem, I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;fixing the problem (not fix the symptom of the problem).</p>
<p>Is your system functional enough to get on the Internet or not? &nbsp;If yes, do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware&nbsp;detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>Do both the scans and then fix any remaining issues after the scans run clean. &nbsp;It does not make sense to try to fix a system while there is malicious software still on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is not functional or cannot get in the Internet to get the scanning softwares or your system is just unmanageable with the current affliction, we can fix it long enough for you to get operational, but you still must do the scans - sooner rather
 than later. &nbsp;Who knows what else is going on!</p>

<p><strong>When you said you were seeing the option to browse the files on the cd I immediately knew you were not booting from the disc. This option does not appear when you boot from the disc. It only displays when you insert the disc after windows is loaded.
 When booting from the disc, place the disc in the disc drive then restart the computer. A screen should then appear instructing you to press any key to boot from a cd. At that point, press any key. Follow the prompts from there. If you are not receiving the
 screen to press any key then it is likely the boot sequence in system bios is not set properly. It should be set to boot from the cd rom first and the hdd second. However, rundll32 errors do not occur for no reason. It is my experience the most common cause
 is an infection. I recommend you ask this question on the free computer support forum below where you will be guided through a series of procedures to determine if in fact you are infected. The reason for posting on a different forum is due to Microsoft's
 unwritten policy prohibiting log files to be posted in the answer forum. Log files are a necessity in order to accurately detect if an infection is present, what type of infection it is and the steps to properly remove it.</strong></p>

<p>I tried this, and it worked....mostly. My 'Control Panel' functions still come up with an error message.</p>
<p>But I can launch .exe files without issue now, so thank you :D</p>

<h2>            How to fix error code 31 for Nvidia Geforce GT 330M&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This problem only started recently (I don't remember exactly). Something is wrong with the Nvidia card. I can't open the Nvidia control panel and the card doesn't show in device manager and now I am stuck with my crappy Intel graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to Device Manager, uninstalling the driver, restarting computer and attempting to install latest drivers for the Nvidia card (can't install because it says there isn't an Nvidia card in the computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is the TravelMate 8572G-6647.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I cannot find the graphics card in the device manager anymore.</p>
