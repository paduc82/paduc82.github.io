<h2>            IF function to determine whether a cell contains the past, present month or future month and year.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to combine the IF and TODAY functions to determine whether a cell contains the current or previous month and year (e.g. June 2018 or earlier) and enters the word "Overdue" if true? If the month and year are in the future (e.g. July 2018
 or later), I would like it to return the word "Current" if true. The cell containing the date is F7.</p>

<h2>            Excel file is locked try again later</h2>
                    I have a shared Excel Worksheet. As of ysterday afternoon it stated that the file was locked and to try again later. Coming out and going back into the folder it told me one of my colleagues was in the file and no changes were allowed. At this point, the
 colleague that was supposedly in it, wasn't. What's more it would not let him back in as he was locking himself out? As the file is an important one, with constant access required, I had to create a copy, save it under a different name, and work from there.
 However this lunchtime, some 18 hours later, I had notification that the worksheet was now available for access. I had created a copy for no reason.&nbsp; I understand if I was trying to enter the wiorksheet whilst someone was saving it would be temporarily locked
 to allow the saved changes to take affect, but this should not last 18 hours to save! Is there anyway around this? It has happned before on more than one occasion and each time I am left with the dilemma of either letting u

<h3> zuma jay  say:</h3>
<h2>            E-mail Folders in Entourage 2008</h2>
                    <p>I just moved all my <strong>POP</strong> e-mail accounts over to <strong>IMAP</strong> accounts (8 of them) and now I have two main problems:</p>
<p>1) I have a long string of e-mail folders and unnecessary subfolders under each(Bulk, Templates, Notes) cluttering the left side of my window</p>
<p>2) My <strong>On My Computer Folder</strong> no longer captures all the e-mails from these new IMAP accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my questions are:</p>
<p>1) How do I de-clutter this string of subfolders under each e-mail account? and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) How do I get my <strong>On My Computer Folder</strong> to capture the e-mails from all the separate e-mails so I don't have to go into each one to check e-mails?</p>
<p>3) How do I re-order my accounts list on the left side to my liking with the <strong>
On My Computer Folder</strong> at the TOP where I can easily access it and get see ALL e-mails at once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included an image of just a sample of the subfolders with the On My Computer folder at the bottom.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Weather App pre installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I bought windows 8.1 2013.&nbsp; Works perfectly. The "Weather" App was pre installed.</p>
<p>It works perfectly until today.&nbsp; When I turn on the Weather app, everything works until</p>
<p>a message tape across the screen says there is a new update for the app.</p>
<p>I tried several times to update, however that update is only for windows Ten.</p>
<p>So I am not going from 8.1 to ten, so please tell me how to turn off the UPDATE Script.</p>
<p>Thanks. Other then this, That Weather App is my favorite. Beats the Accuweather App by far.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>Business at Hand</strong></p>
<p>Sorry. I wasn't Clear Rachel. Not your fault. I wasn't clear about what I needed.</p>
<p>This question only has to do with the MSN Weather App, it's location in Registry, Values, and the one Automatic Message now being continually displayed, rendering the app useless.&nbsp; The Weather App runs perfectly for about 15 seconds, and then stops when
 the Update Message Banner runs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSN Weather APP is now running a two inch banner across the weather page.</p>
<p>It says:&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a New Version Of Weather Available"&nbsp; Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't one for Windows 8.1.&nbsp; This tape which incapacitates the operation of my present Weather for windows 8.1&nbsp; is for a newer version that can only be installed on Windows Ten.&nbsp;&nbsp;MSN Weather was always working perfectly for me, until this update notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I need to effectively block the notice, turn it off, or go to the script and change some code, or go to the registry&nbsp; REGEDIT, and null something .&nbsp; All the Apps are located in one specific area of the Registry, however
</p>
<p>with out your guidance , I won't get it done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp; all the apps are located in the Registry somewhere past my pay grade, and what I need you to do, is to step by step me, tell me where to click and make NULL this Weather Update or rewrite a little tiny script somewhere and stop it from</p>
<p>ruining what was a good my most favorite app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>It's such a good, astounding app.&nbsp; Used alongside my Accuweather app, it's as accurate as you would want it to be before flying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Happy Holidays to the Girls and Boys Microsoft.</p>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is really disgusting. I cant check my call&nbsp;balance&nbsp;for the last 2-3 weeks and also my data usage(Both used to work before). I'm&nbsp;really sick with running out of my balance since i have no idea&nbsp;when&nbsp;to recharge. Usually the data usage
 used to show up when i turn off the data usage in settings. Now that also stopped. Microsoft please urgently need an update for my phone. I am really fond of windows phone and its interface and i am planning to take Lumia 920. Please please&nbsp;don't&nbsp;disappoint&nbsp;me
 :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards</div>

<h2>            Bing.com stops responding</h2>
                    I have a brand new 2 month old &nbsp;hp pavilion that had win8 on it, then updated to 8.1. Anyway, whenever I'm on the Bing Search homepage and click on one of the headline pics at the bottom of the page to open it, sometimes it opens the headline, but mostly
 it goes to a "This page can't be displayed" error , I refresh the page, and sometimes it goes to the headline, and sometimes I get the same "This page can't be displayed" page. I have No problem surfing any other site, and this&nbsp;ONLY happens on the Bing Search
 page with the beautiful daily pics in either browser that I use(IE and Google Chrome), and I would appreciate any help to resolve this glitch.

After searching and searching for a solution to my continuous problem with "This page can't be displayed" when I'm searching out of Bing, I finally did a full system scan with my anti-virus; and it exposed a JavaScript Trojan (JS:inf:Trojan) that is notorious
 for sneaking&nbsp;by your ant-virus protection, embedding itself so that your anti-virus recognizes it but Can't remove it,&nbsp;and slowly starts taking over your browser(IE) and adding programs/apps to your system. I downloaded&nbsp;one of the many system cleaning programs&nbsp;dedicated
 to removing this&nbsp;specific&nbsp;Trojan and it's associated virus rootkits. After fixing 1488 threats and a 116MB Windows 8.1 update, my laptop is like BRAND NEW again, since it's only 3 months old anyway. Now I must stay away from websites with such malicious intent.

<h2>            I can&#39;t recover my old skype id.</h2>
                    <p>I created my skype account in 2011. And been using it in mac osx operating system until july 2014.
</p>
<p>During that time - i think it was late 2012- i signed in to my skype account in my friend's pc, which was microsoft.</p>
<p>My skype account recognized that microsoft as an administrator and merged into that account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no problems until this winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This winter i tried to sign in on my parents' pc, it didn't let me sign in.</p>
<p>I tried to recover my account but I don't remember the answers.</p>
<p>Now my account is connected to my friend's microsoft account and phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked him the password to recover my account but he rejected.</p>
<p>He even changed my surname to "Lama" from "Aras".</p>
<p>He also added some harrasing information to my bio.</p>
<p>He still refuses to give it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do i need to do to get my skype back?</p>

<p>just use the same Microsoft account on the new phone and it'll sync all the backed up texts automatically.</p>

            I just talked to Microsoft support and there is a hidden place to do a sync.&nbsp; Go into the "People" application, go to "Settings", long-tap (right-click) the Microsoft account and click Sync.&nbsp; This will sync messages and people.

            That is the way it is suppose to work and the way it has worked previously. With the Lumia 950 WP 10 it only synced partially&nbsp;from years 2012-2013. For the record I did a backup on my Lumia 920&nbsp;the evening before I purchased the Lumia 950.

            That's interesting, mine stopped at the exact same place. It restored 2012-2013, but after 12/31/2013 it didn't restore anything. It did that twice (once originally and once after I reset it). I have a call into Microsoft, if they figure it out, I'll post
 it here.

            <p>Not a stupid question. Previously a new phone would restore/ransfer all text messages from the old phone. This did not happen all messages from 2014 to present were not restored. Another anomly, favorites were not imported from old phone or from ms account
 and edge cannot open favorites in a&nbsp;backup folder on onedrive.... go figure.</p>

<h2>            How to get back 10-year-old chat from skype</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to get back 10-year-old chat from skype?<br />
<br />
Now I have got completely different computer. I was chatting with one close person. Then realised that she has gone somewhere. I can't find her nowhere. I remember small details, I have got some photos. But nothing can help me. Is it possible to ask Skype to
 give me my old chat log history from 2005-2007 years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't find this person anymore. Maybe I have to ask someone who works in police, and give them a photo?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for your reply. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arthur</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have this particular person/contact in my contacts anymore. Probably I have deleted it a long time ago. How can I find the contacts I have deleted and chat history with them? I do not know their account details, cause it was a long time ago when
 I have been chatting with them.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, if the contact has been deleted to the account for a long time already, the conversation history for that person will no longer be available. You can simply try to search for the person's username or email address.</p>

<h2>            How do I BIN2DEC from a cell&#39;s value&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I can use DEC2BIN to use a cell's value..</p>
<p>eg. =DEC2BIN(F1,8), where F1 is the cell and 8 is the number of binary digits.</p>
<p>..but how do I make BIN2DEC use a cell's value in the same way?&nbsp; It only allows a straight binary value to be put into the formula, as far as I can make out.</p>

<p>If you are able to use VB code, here is a copy of a message that I have posted in the old newsgroups&nbsp;in the past that contains a&nbsp;UDF (user defined function) that can handle very large binary digits...</p>
<p>Below is a UDF that will handle up to a 96-bit binary number (decimal value 79228162514264337593543950335) which I'm guessing is way more than you will ever need.&lt;g&gt; The code is efficient (looping only as many times as necessary to process the passed in
 binary value), so don't worry about it being able to handle such a large binary value. The function returns a real numeric value up to 9999999999 after which it returns text representations of the calculated number.</p>
<p>Function BinToDec(BinaryString As String) As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim X As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const TwoToThe48 As Variant = 281474976710656#<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For X = 0 To Len(BinaryString) - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If X &gt; 48 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BinToDec = CDec(BinToDec) + Val(Mid(BinaryString, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Len(BinaryString) - X, 1)) * _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TwoToThe48 * CDec(2 ^ (X - 48))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BinToDec = CDec(BinToDec) + Val(Mid(BinaryString, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Len(BinaryString) - X, 1)) * CDec(2 ^ X)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(BinToDec) &gt; 10 Then BinToDec = CStr(BinToDec)<br />
End Function</p>
<p>On the assumption that you do not know how to install a UDF, here are the quite simple instructions. From any worksheet, press Alt+F11 which will take you into the VB editor. Once in the VB editor, click Insert/Module on its menu bar. A code window will
 open up... simply paste the code above into that code window. That's it... you are done. You can now use the BinToDec function on your worksheet just like it was a built-in function. So, if your binary value is in A1, then =BinToDec(A1) will display the decimal
 equivalent of it.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word and Powerpoint Disappeared</h2>
                    It was working just fine yesterday, and now I can't seem to open either application. Both were pinned to my taskbar, however, they disappeared. I had a shortcut for Word on my desktop as well, but it says the shortcut has been changed or moved; the same

            Hi JoltLiz, it would seem that somehow Office 2016 has bee n uninstalled from your PC . .. 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install 
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate that PC which Office was installed on 
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation 
<br />
<br />Then, click Install to install Office
<br />
<br />
<br />Hopefully, then everything will be back up and running . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            PC Suite problem</h2>
                    I installed PC suite, the latest one. I tried in all previous versions. But I can not do anything with 'Contact list' by using this software. When I try to see my contact lists, it always show 'The operation could not be completed". I tried a lot but It
 always shows this error. I can see the message box. I can not see any contact- neither SIM nor Phone memory.

            My Phone model is 6230. Connection type is USB cable.<br />
I can work other things like I can copy songs, I can manage mail box. Only I can not manage 'Contact'. When I try to do this, it always shows the above error I mentioned. I do not know what to do.

            Try the "synchronise" option in PC Suite. Select Windows Address Book when asked and sync the contacts to PC , does that work ?<br />
<br />
(what I am suggesting is that do NOT use "contacts", it is a Windows Explorer Extension and it has never been working too well, particularly if you have some explorer settings that are far away from any standard setup or if you have done a lot of manual configuring
 to your PC)

            Hi rich
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. If you want to see for a particular contact, just click on the conversation and scroll up or down to reach to the date when you made the call. It will show you duration as well (see snip)
<br />
<br />2. If you made calls to landline/mobile, you can see here in your Skype account for a particular month (It will not show free Skype to Skype calls. Point 1 will show even Skype to Skype calls as well)

                    <p>I have written a VB2010 program that extracts data from 2010 Access Database. This works fine on my 32 bit XP and Vista systems. However on Win 7 the following message appears "The 'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0' provider is not registered on the local machine".
 I had hoped to eventually run this program on our local web site. My question is "Does this mean that all Win 7 users will get this same error message" and is there a way to resolve the issue.</p>

                    So like everyone I'v been made to switch to Microsoft. I can't log on to see my email, its telling me that i'm not a user. I guess i'm hoping that someone from microsoft will read this, and give me my old account back. I hate this new email, and will be
 going to a different email service. You have lost this customer and I will not return unless you allow me to return to the old layout. Sincerely, This SUCKS. p.s. i only logged in by fluke after an hour. and cant log on with out logging onto this first

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you. Let me&nbsp;answer your&nbsp;concern&nbsp;regarding of switch back to Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>Please be informed&nbsp;that
</span><span>users who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were sent notification messages concerning the upcoming upgrade. Accounts that were automatically upgraded do not have the option to switch

<h2>            Outlook Says it has encountered an error and needs to close</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2016</p>
<p>Using IMAP to&nbsp;sync AOL, POP to download from my provider account (Comcast).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the program it downloads the emails from the POP account, but then when syncing&nbsp;the IMAP a popup comes up that says it has encountered a problem and needs to close. The popup has a repair button that I have clicked multiple times. It goes to
 the "Stopped Working" popup and checking for solutions if you wait any amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the SCANPST,EXE on the .pst file, it found errors but said it corrected them, but every time you run SCANPST.EXE it says it has errors, so I do not think it can fix them. Reading the log file, the same messages are there after each time I run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to run SAFE mode, same result, crashes out within a couple seconds of opening....</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Name displays in all lowercase when sending emails. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billdozr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Name displays in all lowercase when sending emails.</h2>
                    <p>When I log into my outlook mail account via the web page(outlook.com), my name in the top right corner displays in all lower case. For example, it shows as "john smith" instead of with proper capitalization like "John Smith".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, when I send emails, the receiver sees my name displayed in all lowercase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to "edit account" or "view profile", my name displays as it should with proper capitalization of my first and last name. The only places it does not display correctly is the top right corner of my outlook mail box and in sent emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very unprofessional to have my name in my emails displayed in all lowercase, yet there seems to be no way to change this. There are numerous others complaining about this very same issue. This is absolutely ridiculous and very unprofessional!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how to fix this.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to the displayed profile name in Skype or in Microsoft account itself. For us to isolate the issue, we suggest that you check your profile name in
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype</a> and in <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account settings</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward for your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>Account name in Microsoft and skype are correct. Tried that a long time ago and reverified them just now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So problem is not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name also displays in all lowercase in outlook right above "inbox, junk, etc." in the menu to the left of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm ready to ditch all my Microsoft accounts over this. This is ridiculous!</p>

</p><p>Apparently thats a lie because it's now 7days later and a follow up was never provided....</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Thanks" for the help Microsoft. Really making feel like a valued customer....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the obvious answer is to do away with all Microsoft accounts since Microsoft couldn't be any less helpful when issues occur.</p>
