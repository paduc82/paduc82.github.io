    <title>OneDrive for Business does not sync SharePoint folders with limited - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business does not sync SharePoint folders with limited access rights although I am the website administrator</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>since a couple of days I am experiencing some strange behaviour with my Document-Library synchronisation from the company SharePoint with my local drive via OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All folders with unlimited access are synchronised properly. Those folders having restricted access rights do not sync.</p>
<p>- When opening the SharePoint via Edge/Internet Explorer&nbsp;I can see all folders</p>
<p>- When opening the SharePoint folders via "Save" in Office I only see the non-restricted folders.</p>
<p>- All folders were synchronised until a couple of days before</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing the AD keys to role over on Aug 15th, I tested the role over for one of my web pages but left the rest unchanged. May an issue lay here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the administrator and owner of the pages as well as of the office account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for you help in advance</p>

            Hi StefanDE,<br />
<br />
From your description. I noticed that you are using the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client to sync a teamsite library in SharePoint Online. To sync document library, we need the proper permissions at the library level and the site level. Therefore, could
 you check if you have edit or higher permissions at the library level as below: <br />
<br />
1. Go to the library in SharePoint Online &gt; LIBRARY &gt; Library settings &gt; Permissions and Management &gt; Permissions for this document library.
<br />
2. Click Check permissions &gt; type your account into the box &gt; Check Now: <br />
3. If the account doesn’t have the permissions, please click Stop Inheriting Permissions.
<br />
4. Click Grant Permissions to assign the Edit permission to the account used to sync the library.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists or this is not your situation, to clarify the scenario, could you confirm the following details?
<br />
<br />
1. Could you share with a screenshot about the permissions you have at the library level?
<br />
2. As a SharePoint admin or the site admin, a screenshot about your permission at the site level is appreciated. To check permissions on a site, please go to the SharePoint site &gt; Site settings &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; Site permissions &gt; Check Permissions.
<br />
3. About” Those folders having restricted access rights do not sync.”, do you run into any error message when syncing the files? If so, do you mind share with us a screenshot?
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley

<p>Reply on 3:</p>
<p>I am not running into any error message. Those folders are just not synchronised. I can see those folders when logging onto my SharePoint side, but cannot see them if opening&nbsp;the folder from office.&nbsp;OneDrive for business synchronises all folders that are
 accessible for all team members properly. Those folders that are foreseen for a subset of users (including me) are not synchronised at all.</p>
<p>Please find the screenshot of the rights for a restricted folder as an example:</p>

            Hi Stefan,<br />
<br />
About the issue, may I know if you are a SharePoint admin? If not, could you contact the SharePoint admin or global admin to re-add your account into the Admin group of the site collection? As a SharePoint admin or global admin, we can go to SharePoint admin
 center &gt; Site Collections &gt; select the site collection &gt; Owners &gt; Manage admins &gt; Site Collections Administrators &gt; add your account &gt; OK.
<br />
<br />
If there is another site collection admin, he can go to Site Settings &gt; Users and Permissions &gt; Site Permissions &gt; Teamsite Owners &gt; New &gt; Add users to this group.
<br />
<br />
After that, do you mind clearing OneDrive for Business cache with Fix it Tool and stop sync the library. Then resign in and resync the libraries? Note: This tool can cause data loss. To reduce this risk, read this article in its entirety before you use this
 tool: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p>yes I am the SharePoint Admin as well as the&nbsp;Company Administrator. I double checked according to your explanations.</p>
<p>Furthermore I run the tool an restarted the synchronisation.</p>
<p>When logging on to xx.sharepoint.com I am seeing all 10 folders. When synchronising I am getting only 7 downloaded.</p>
<p>Therefore the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it of help knowing that I am running both, the new generation client with one "consumer/outlook.com"+"business account"&nbsp;account as well as the old&nbsp;OneDrive for business to synchronise the SharePoint library? Only the old client is not working as expected
 although it did until a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the next generation sync client along with the legacy sync client is supported, and therefore should not create such problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first like to summarize the issue before moving forward:</p>
<p>You are synchronizing a SharePoint library, however, some folders with unique permissions that you have access to and can see via SharePoint Online, is not synced by OneDrive for Business. Other folders with permissions that everybody can see are synced
 normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your screenshot, you have given yourself <strong>Edit </strong>permission to the folder via a group. You have also given yourself
<strong>Contribute </strong>and <strong>Read </strong>permissions to the library via a group. You also have some
<strong>Limited Access</strong> permissions that are possibly given via the <strong>
Sharing </strong>feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To move forward, I would like to confirm a few things:</p>
<p>1. Please confirm whether other users that has the same permissions also encounter this issue where they can't sync folders with unique permissions from the library.</p>
<p>2. Please confirm whether you have customized the <strong>Edit </strong>permission level or it is in the default state. If you are using a customized
<strong>Edit </strong>permission level, make sure you have the <strong>Use Remote Interfaces</strong>, U<strong>se Client Integration Features</strong>, and
<strong>Open</strong> permissions checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, please try disabling the <strong>Limited-access user permission lockdown mode</strong> site collection feature if it is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try removing all permissions and assigning yourself the <strong>Full Control
</strong>permission level to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

            <p>Hi Sheen,</p>
<p>thanks for the additional hints. </p>
<p>Your summary is correct except that I did not give any "limited access" actively. I do not know where those rights come from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the following:</p>
<p>on 1: I checked with one team member having access to the restricted folders as well. He was able to synchronise changed data successfully.</p>
<p>on 2: I did not change the Edit permission and verified the "Use Remove.." being checked.</p>
<p>on 3: The limited-access lockdown mode is disabled and it was disabled.</p>
<p>on&nbsp;4: I removed my account from each group so that&nbsp;only the full access from the admin remains. Unfortunately that did not change the synchronisation behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            WM6.5 SYNC PROBLEM</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
ActiveSync with exchange work fine a few day.<br />
But no longer work... now... since one week... when i was at the hospital.. :-(</p>
<p>ActiveSync says "waiting for network"<br />
In "Statut" i have:<br />
The Server could not be reached.<br />
This can be caused by temporary network conditions<br />
Support code: 0x80072EFF</p>
<p>I tried many things like:<br />
- restart the device, the exchange server, and my router.<br />
- Reinstall certificat for SSL on the device and reboot<br />
- Restart the "connection setup" on the wm device.<br />
- and many other think i found on forum about 0X80072EFF error</p>
<p>I successfully supress the account and recreate it</p>
<p>Now, ActiveSync turn and turn and turn</p>
<p><br />
I have some element that i think it maybe help us to understand what's going on...</p>
<p>I have 3 account:<br />
- Exchange Sync<br />
- Hotmail (configure via windows live)<br />
- Orange (POP3)</p>
<p>At the same time Exchange and hotmail refuse to work, but the orange one is OK</p>
<p>Any idea ?</p>
<p>Does anybody encounter this kind of problem with exchange or windowslive sync and solved it ?</p>
<p>I absolutely need this working for business use !</p>
<p>Does anybody can save me ???</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad english !</p>

                    Hi there. I created a business card on PowerPoint but when I try exporting it to PDF through the Acrobat tab the images in the card get blurry or pixelated around the edges while the text remains crisp. I have the "Do not compress images in file" box selected.
 Is there anything I can do to stop the images from getting pixelated?

<p>In my version of PowerPoint (2016) the setting is called Default Resolution. It is currently set to High Fidelity, which I believe is supposed to preserve the current resolution.<br />

<p>&gt;&gt; which I believe is supposed to preserve the current resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things to check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, if you had an empty content or picture placeholder on the slide when you inserted a picture, the picture would drop in to the placeholder AND would be compressed, regardless of your compression settings.&nbsp; This unwanted compression seems to have
 been corrected in the most recent version/update of 2016, at least.&nbsp; To be sure you have this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Start a new presentation (blank is fine)</li><li>Add a new title &amp; content slide</li><li>Reduce the content placeholder to a small size</li><li>Add a picture to it</li><li>Now enlarge the placeholder</li></ul>
<p>Does the picture become blurry?&nbsp; If so, you might want to force an update and try again. If not, we've eliminated one possible cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPT's compression settings don't affect the compression that Adobe Acrobat's PDF printer driver applies.&nbsp; Try using PPT's own File | Save As | Save as type:&nbsp; PDF and be sure to choose the "Standard (publishing ...)" option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does that compare with the result from Acrobat?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find PPT's PDF save feature to be WAY faster than Acrobat's and generally prefer the result, but there are times when you need the extra control that Acrobat gives you.&nbsp; If so, yell.&nbsp; One of us will explain how to make it happen.</p>

<p>Hi Steve. I followed your instructions re the update issue and the picture does not become more blurry if I enlarge it so that must not be the issue.</p>
<p>
When I saved using PPT's Save As everything got a lot more pixelated than if I use the Acrobat tab. Even the text got pixelated, whereas when using the Acrobat tab only the images become blurrier.</p>

<p>Very strange; usually the results of PPT's PDF save are quite good.</p>

<p>Thanks ... I get pretty much the same result with PPT's Save As PDF option, but when I use the Acrobat save as PDF feature, my results are quite a bit better than what Acrobat's doing for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More than likely this is because I've changed Acrobat's default settings in the past.&nbsp; I don't recall what they were originally, but have a look at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>File | Print, choose the Acrobat PDF printer driver, then click Printer Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose the Adobe PDF settings tab.&nbsp; Try switching from Standard to Press quality (or similar wording) or create your own copy of Standard then Edit and make sure that it's using ZIP rather than JPG compression for both BW and color images, set it to a higher
 DPI and so on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Save the new settings, make sure that your new settings are selected in Adobe PDF tab, then give Acrobat another shot at it.</p>
<p>

<p>On my Blackjack phone with MSMobile 5.0, I have an email account set up using IMAP.&nbsp; I am receving emails and understand how to delete the emails.&nbsp; However, when I delete the emails they do not delete from the IMAP server therefore they stay on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I permanetly delete emails from an IMAP account on the phone?&nbsp; Not just mark for deletion...</p>

I can easily delete the message on my mobile, but it stay's on the server.<br />
In the Advanced E-mailSettings the setting is on: Delete mail from server.<br />
Why is it?<br />
Is it a mobile problem or a server problem?<br />

<p>Change that option to "Immediatly" and your problem is solved.</p>

<p>I have a wierd problem using the HTC Touch. When I delete messages on my Phone, they go to Deleted Items and when I send/recieve the next time - it goes OFF away from the deleted items - BUT remains on the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wierd: The Deleted Items folder on my Phone looks like a local folder (I cant subscribe or unsubscribe) but it shows on my Outlook and Webmail as a folder I need to subscribe to and when I do I can see the messages (on the
 server).\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I so it such that when I delete things on me Phone, it goes to Deleted Items, but I should view it from my Cell Phone as well. Also, this may not be for Mobile but you may know:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I get Outlook 2007 to mvoe messages to Deleted Items (a IMAP folder) when I click Delete? I am trying to do the same for Horde Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

My deleted items IMAP folder is named "Trash", and I can't find a way to make move automatically emails in that folder when I click "delete", and to delete them completely when i delete from the "Trash" folder.<br />
<br />
With sent email I can't find a way to automatically move sent items in my IMAP folder "sent-items".

<p>I guess you are using Pocket Outlook on Windows Mobile which does have som drawbacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion is to try and use FlexMail 4. It's got a lot more features which I think you would find useful as well. They have a 14 day trial so you can give it a go and see if it's the right software for you.</p>

<p>Hi Tariq, your'e guessed right. I use pocket outlook.</p>
<p>The IMAP folder problem is here since WM5! look here: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/outlook_mobile/archive/2006/09/08/745369.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/outlook_mobile/archive/2006/09/08/745369.aspx</a></p>
<p>I&nbsp;hope Microsoft will&nbsp;address this problem in WM6.1 devices with a patch or something...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read&nbsp;that FlexMail 4&nbsp;support Custom IMAP&nbsp;Folders (sent, draft, trash), but that is not the point.</p>
However, thanks for the suggestion.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Even after all these years, it's still a good practice to shutdown/restart a Windows computer once per day. Do you do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. From Internet Options (General tab)&gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete, uncheck "Preserve Favorites website data" and check and delete Temporary Internet Files and History.</p>
<p>Restart. Did that fix things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 .If step #2 wasn't the fix...</p>
<p>&nbsp;With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords (do you have those backed up?) and you will have to re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset IE Settings button in Internet Options&gt; Advanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a reset of IE settings will do:<br />

            First check if it has the latest SW by typin *#0000#.<br />
If not, upgrade the FW by either downloadin the nokia software updater tool or by the nearest nokia care centre.<br />
If it has the latest, try a hard reset.

<h2>            Cannot find&#47;add&#47;get messages from certain users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had my skype account for years... since long before it was owned by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today a friend tried to add me, and sent a message. I did not get it. When I search for his account, nothing comes up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He had first messaged using the email he knows me best by, which is associated with my MS account. If I sign in to skype using that ms account, I do have his message, and was able to add him to my contacts... but of course, he's the only contact there now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some other people (whom were not on my contacts) try to contact me on my actual skype account, and I saw their messages and was able to search for and add them as well, no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the webapp, the windows app, and the iphone app... all the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<br />
<br />Select that App and choose Advanced Options - Reset

<p>Hi Charles:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I tried using .10 as well as .10%, 10%, etc.&nbsp; nothing seems to work.&nbsp; I also made sure column AG is formatted as a number and not text.&nbsp; It is formatted as a percentage.</p>

            Again, the sample file would help.
<br />
<br />Do you mean &lt;-10   or &lt; 10?
<br />
<br /> -40 &lt; -10  
<br />-5 &gt; -10
<br />6 &gt; -10

</p><p>I was able to figure it out.&nbsp; I had to change the format of the % column... then it worked... then changed back to the percentage (number format).&nbsp; Yet another stupid thing with Microsoft software, that I despise sometimes, and will never get back the 1.5

<p>Hello Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the SD card before doing a hard reset can help prevent data loss. Some people encrypts the SD card to protect its data and can only be deactivated using the encryption key or password, so make sure to decrypt it before removing the SD card or performing
 a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, creating a back up of your photos, videos, music, and other important files that you need is also recommended before performing a hard reset. See the article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up your stuff for Windows 10 Mobile</a></strong> to get more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to post back.</p>

<h3> mpauley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Visio Premium 2010 Activation, Error Code 0x8007232B</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a copy of Microsoft Visio Premium 2010.&nbsp; I installed the product some time ago and have used it without a problem.&nbsp; Whenever I start it now, however, I get a message that "This copy of Microsoft Office is not activated", "Error Code 0x8007232B".&nbsp; (I
 did a search on the error code but only got hits relating to Microsoft Server 2008.) &nbsp; I have gone under File | Help | Change Product Key and entered the product key which is validated.&nbsp; After an installation message, I get a message that installation was
 successful and that I should restart Office.&nbsp; I do but still get the message that the Visio is still not activated.<br />
<br />
HELP!!<br />
<br />
Don't know if it's related but:<br />
- I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit.<br />
- I recently had to replace the motherboard of my computer following a lightning strike on my house.<br />
- Visio seems to work fine (i can make and edit drawings) but is unstable.&nbsp; In particular, when I try to close it I often get the message that the program is no longer responding.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>It sounds like your hardware changes were large enough to cause the activation code to trigger. It is possible that the re-activation is blocked by the same problem that is causing the instability.&nbsp;Your best best at this point would be to contact customer
 support directly, as installation issues are no charge to you, and working with a technician on the phone is a more appropriate way to attack the problem and get your system fixed.&nbsp; You can call 1-800-Microsoft and request support assistance to get routed
 properly.</p>
<p>You may find that fixing the instability still leaves the product un-activated.&nbsp; In that case, try requesting the program to activate "By Telephone" instead of over the internet.&nbsp; You will dial into a voice response system, and if it cannot activate you
 immediately, you can then talk with an activation person, explain that your hardware failed and had to be replaced, and they will be able to provide you with a code to get going again.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I had updated Adobe Reader to 10.0.01, and it seems this is what caused the problems.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the latest version and reinstalled Adobe Reader&nbsp;9.4.&nbsp; Everything is OK now.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Not Responding - Corrupts OST</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Office 2016 Home and Business. &nbsp;Outlook crashes mutliple times a day. &nbsp;It goes into a "Not Responding" state, then upon Outlook restarting, I receive an error stating that my .ost file is corrupt and that the set of folders could not be displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary fix has been to create a new mail profile, which works, for about one day. &nbsp;Then the crash, the error, and then another mail profile needs to be made in order for it to work for another day or two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on my 10th email profile and this is getting ridiculous. &nbsp;I've uninstalled/reinstalled Office twice. &nbsp; I've done the online repair and regular repair, and have also made sure all latest updates are installed. &nbsp; I'm completely frustrated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook crashes at any given time: &nbsp;in the middle of replying to an email, while inbox is just sitting idle, etc. &nbsp;There is no action that seems to cause Outlook to crash. &nbsp;Extremely random. &nbsp;Please help!</p>

<h2>            excel wont sort data properly</h2>
                    <p>i have this large spreadsheet columns A-DF and cant sort column BS properly.&nbsp; Column BS has part numbers while other columns are details related to the part number such as price, description, etc.&nbsp; The part numbers consist of numbers, letters, symbols or
 all the above-random character.&nbsp; &nbsp;Some part numbers do duplicate.&nbsp; When i attempt sorting by that column, the result is no where sorted.&nbsp; Even the duplicate part numbers don't order consecutively.&nbsp; What do i need to do to get excel to sort properly?&nbsp; it sort
 properly if i copy and paste the column onto a separate sheet.&nbsp; but then i cant just copy and paste the sorted data back into where it came because the order would be messed up- part numbers would not align to their description etc.<br />
</p>
<p>The Filter is set correctly; it captures all the rows.</p>
<p>i checked for spaces preceding the part numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i cleared all Formts from down the column.</p>
<p>i changed the cell format to General.</p>
<p>i changed the cell format to Text.</p>
<p>i did the Text to Columns Delimited with none of the selections check marked (Tab, Semicoln, Comma, Space, Other)&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas what else i can try?</p>

    <title>How Do I Get Autocorrect to &#34;Re-Learn&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeflarremore  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I Get Autocorrect to &#34;Re-Learn&#34;</h2>
                    I've run into this issue for a while with Windows phones, probably since 7.5. I have a 640 XL but this has happened on different models. Certain words autocorrect for no reason. It started with "been" on one phone. "Been" was corrected to "beer". I never
 spell "beer". New phone, different words, different problems. Currently my phone wants to correct "with" (spelled correctly) to "worth". It's frustrating because I'm swiping along and look back and every "with" is "worth".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get Windows mobile to "re-learn" words or a place where they are stored so I can tell it to stop correcting certain words?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is the learning process?
