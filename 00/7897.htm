</p><p>You should be able to log in to your Windows 10 tablet even if it is not connected to the Internet. Your log-in credentials should work given that you have already set up before. Another way to log on to your tablet is to use the local account credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above criteria do not apply to you, please enable the Wi-Fi capability on your Windows 10 tablet computer. You may refer the device manual for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After enabling the Wi-Fi function on your device, tap on the Wi-Fi icon located at the lower-right corner of the log-in screen to view the available connection that you can connect to.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure that you know the key to log-in to the Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After establishing the connection to your preferred Wi-Fi network, try logging in again using your Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            Wajam is still out there&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Thanks for previous posts about this but as those threads are now closed I wished to start this one to add to the history so that newbies are aware that Wajam is either piggy-backing other software or perhaps even already installed. I have just bought an
 ISUS computer, tried to log into my facebook account and wam! This thing is there taking over my computer. &nbsp;Prior to that my computer was 'resetting' for hours. Little did I know that was probably the Wajam trojan taking over my computer. Well having read
 previous posts I have tried the uninstall function and will send an email to them - not that I'll expect them to answer it. It will be interesting to see whether the uninstall function has worked. &nbsp;But I categorically deny that I at any time 'accidentally'
 downloaded that programme. &nbsp;I have absolutely no idea where it came from. How could such an organisation win awards...unless it was for sneaking and embedding itself onto people's &nbsp;computers. It cannot be any good or trustworthy if that is the only way it
 can get customers. &nbsp;Shame on Wajam and all who are working with it.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            microsoft database daemon</h2>
                    Office 2011 did a routine update yesterday, but failed to install as some applications were open.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They are:</div>
<div>Microsoft Database Daemon</div>
<div>SynServicesAgent</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no idea what they are, or where they are hidden or how to find them - they do not appear in the Force Quit window.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So how do I complete the install?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, why does Microsoft ask so many questions during install? I think this one is 8 - really annoying.</div>

            Make sure ALL Office applications are completely closed and not running, this includes Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. There cannot be a dot above or alongside the application's shortcut icon in your dock.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>ALL web browsers must also be completely closed and also close any cloud based drop boxes. SynServicesAgent's presence indicates an open drop box.
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            <p>HI Samuel,</p>
<p>office version in 2013 Pro.</p>
<p>I use to install all software on SD card, and same the Office in SD card work well, no problem at all.</p>
<p>But when I do the update through Windows Update the download goes to the main eMMC memory and then because of this the available space is reducing tremendously.</p>
<p>Since after the installation of update the "old" files are no longer necessary I would like to delete it, but I don't know where they are to delete manually and save a lot f space on my eMMC min memory.</p>
<p>Hope is clear</p>

<h2>            lost my email address</h2>
                    I had a hotmail email address for 15 years. Yesterday I changed the alias for my outlook account to another address. Only afterwards did I realise that I could no longer sign in with my hotmail address, nor receive any emails on it anymore. I thought it
 would not be linked to a microsoft account anymore (where I was&nbsp;received emails waking me up at 4 am from Microsoft) but I thought&nbsp;that I would still be able to use the email address as such.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to add it back as alias to outlook account but it is not
 possible, the&nbsp;communication says this address is reserved. When I try to sign in with it it says this login does not exist. When I tried to open a new&nbsp;account with&nbsp;the same address it says it is reserved. How can I get my hotmail email address back?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> workplaydrive  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Install connecting to Exchange 2010 Calendar sharing issues</h2>
                    <p>We have a sister company hosted on our exchange 2010 servers, the employees license their office software through office 365 business.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One user has access to shared calendars from her entire team of 12 people, 7 of these 12 users calendars are shown with no issues the remaining 5 will 99% of the time not display. &nbsp;I go to calendars, and when checking the box near their name it will acknowledge
 the click but never check the box. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have removed and reinstalled office (including registry entries and app data)</li><li>Removed and reset the profile</li><li>Removed and reset the OST</li><li>I've tried with cached exchange on or off</li><li>I've disabled caching of shared folders</li></ul>
<p>When testing on other laptops I was unable to get the calendars to fail however my test laptops are owned by our company and licensed via volume licensing. This made me think there was something different between the 2 versions of office. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the volume install from one of the working laptops and installed their office 365. &nbsp;After connecting and updating the OST All the working shared calendars were populated. &nbsp;I tried to add one of the faulty ones and it behaved the same\ as did the
 remaining faulty calendars. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas on why these calendars work on office 2016 Pro Plus VL and not Office 2016 Pro Plus office 365?&nbsp;<br />

            Hi WorkPlayDrive,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, I understand that one user (problematic user) can access other 12 people’s calendars. However, the user only can see all calendar information for 7 of these 12 users. Other 5 people’s calendar cannot show 99% information for this
 problematic user. If I misunderstand anything, please feel free to correct me.<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot the issue, I’d like to collect some information:<br />
<br />
1.<span> </span>Since you have exchange 2010 servers, do you have any Hybrid configuration?<br />
2.<span> </span>If so, are these users in cloud or on-premise, including the problematic user and other 12 people?<br />
3.<span> </span>Can you provide some screenshots of the issue? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access your Private Message:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list</a><br />
<br />
4.<span> </span>How do 12 people share their calendars to this problematic user? Please provide some detailed steps and I can do some tests on my side.<br />
5.<span> </span>If you delete the calendar and share it to the problematic user again, does the issue persists?<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Erick

<p>To answer your questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's important to note that these calendars work fine when using the volume licensed version of office. &nbsp;When using Office 365 Business version the calendars fail to open. &nbsp;I can go back and forth (uninstall\reinstall) between office versions on the same
 computer and with Office VL the calendars will open fine where Office 365 Business will fail to load these calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No hybrid solution, just exchange 2010 running on premise with 98% of the users licensed through Volume licensing. &nbsp;This sister company is simply using office 365 for the Office licensing and connecting to our exchange server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. On premise only so all users are on the same servers</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;will work on that shortly</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. File &gt; Open other user's folder &gt; browse through the address book to the specific user select calendar &gt; OK. &nbsp;The calendar gets added but does not open. &nbsp;In Calendars when checking the box next to the calendar it will not check the box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. This is the important part</p>
<ul>
<li>If I delete/add the calendar it will behave the same and fail to open</li><li>If I delete/recreate the outlook profile and try again it will behave the same.</li><li>If I setup the Office 365 for business install on a NEW COMPUTER and try again it will fail to open</li><li><strong>if I uninstall office 2016 Professional Plus from Office 365 business subscription and install the volume Licensing version it will work FINE</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2>            Excel - Formula to find an specific result</h2>
                    I have a spreadsheet with rows and columns as the following (e.g.):<br />
<br />
&nbsp; A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; B &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;

&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.11&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.18&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.21<br />

10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.15&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />
<br />
I also have a formula to get the maximum and the minimum automatically updated once I fill the table with the newest info.<br />
= MAX(B1:E10)<br />
=MIN(B1:E10)<br />
<br />
Now, I would like to get the date where those MAX and MIN values are located in the table.<br />
What formula should I use?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, just in this case, I know the MAX value right now is 11.30 located on B10 that corresponds to ENE 10 (January 10) but maybe in the future could be another cell that refers to another date. I've tried with MATCH, LOOKUP,
 INDEX, FIND, but I'm not able to find the correct one.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea what you have in row 1, all I can see is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ene Feb Mar Abr May Jun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have assumed this is text and <strong>NOT</strong> a date formatted to display as the month. However, the ARRAY formula below will return the row 1 value and column 1 value for the maximum so for your posted data it will return 1 Jan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I don't know what is in row 1 here's 2 ARRAY formula for the max value</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First get the day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(A1:A32,MIN(IF(B1:M32=MAX(B1:M32),ROW(B1:M32)-MIN(ROW(B1:M32))+1)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the month from row 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=OFFSET(INDEX(A1:M1,MIN(IF(B2:M32=MAX(B2:M32),COLUMN(B2:M32)-MIN(COLUMN(B2:M32))+1))),0,1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and for the minimum day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(A1:A32,MIN(IF(B1:M32=MIN(B1:M32),ROW(B1:M32)-MIN(ROW(B1:M32))+1)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minimum month</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=OFFSET(INDEX(A1:M1,MIN(IF(B2:M32=MIN(B2:M32),COLUMN(B2:M32)-MIN(COLUMN(B2:M32))+1))),0,1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
'and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
'around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
'you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

                    <p>Am I getting this right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did MS add a language barrier post-RTM&nbsp;and now only allows those on the list of supported Windows Insider Program languages to upgrade beyond RTM builds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to receive Windows Insider builds just fine even though my language was never supported. I just downloaded a language pack - and it was good. Now I've waited three fast builds and&nbsp;still nothing in Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume it is because I installed the Danish RTM iso from https://www.microsoft.com/da-dk/software-download/windows10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... Really? MS is not going to offer&nbsp;iso downloads&nbsp;so I can get back in?</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac not opening</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I get a screen that says my version will expire in 10 days and to activate - I have paid for an Office 365 subscription so thought it was already activated. When I click activate I then get a window to say that Outlook had to quit and click to send an error
 report. The error report sends and that's it. Same thing again and again - in the meantime i can't check my email!</p>
<p>

            <p>First, verify your Office 2016 is activated using another application such as Excel, PowerPoint or Word. If Outlook won’t launch for you then one of these others should. See if you’re able to activate with one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re able to get activated, test Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Outlook still won’t run, verify you’re running the latest version of Office 2016 (currently 15.12.3). Your issue sounds like one resolved by an earlier update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have corrupt preferences too. In the Finder, hold the Option key as you choose Go menu &gt; Library. In there open Containers and drag the com.microsoft.outlook folder to your Trash. (Don’t empty it.) Test Outlook. If it still won’t open then return
 that preferences folder to Containers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a sledgehammer approach, but you might want to try it if nothing else works. Again, in the Finder hold the Option key as you choose Go menu &gt; Library. In there open Group Containers &gt;&nbsp;UBF8T346G9.Office &gt; Outlook &gt; Outlook 15 Profiles and move the
 Main Profile folder to the Trash. (Don’t empty it.) This effectively trashes your local copy of your Office 365 mail, preferences, rules, signatures, etc. Launch Outlook and configure your Office 365 account again and allow time for it to sync with the server.
 Your mail should return from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, even if you can’t get Outlook running, you can still access your Office 365 mail using
<a href="http://outlook.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.office365.com</a> using any web browser. That will at least keep you working while trying to resolve your application issues.</p>

    <title>Cannot print excel from online browser. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodney allen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot print excel from online browser.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>I am unable to print my workbook in Excel Online. I click print, then the screen goes grey with the message "Working on it..." and then I get a pop-up error message box. The error is "Something went wrong, and we can't print
 your workbook." with "Excel" in the top-left corner and an option to "Give Feedback". There are no other indications. I can't print the active selection, the active sheet, or the workbook. My coworkers cannot print it out either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 7 tabs. The first two are protected sheets that only allow you to select unlocked cells. I protected them without a password in desktop excel and then I synced to Excel Online to make them protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Google Chrome and Internet Explorer 11 and neither works.</p>
<p>I cannot print the two protected sheets.<br />
I cannot print the unprotected sheets.<br />
I tried removing protection from every sheet and it still doesn't print any of them.<br />
I saved a copy of the workbook online and that file can't be printed either.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

    <title>Is there a way to create a folder structure from document library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alison slater  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to create a folder structure from document library Metadata</h2>
                    I have a case whereby we need to migrate completed Office 365 SharePoint project site libraries/ documentation to another Records Management system with Metadata but they are not able to be integrated due to technology restrictions.&nbsp; Does anyone know of
 a way to convert library metadata into folders and say open in Windows Explorer to then click and drag into the required Records Management System.&nbsp; If there is a way to create a workflow to convert the metadata then I could potentially have this workflow
 created but wondering if there is another simple out of the box solution for this?&nbsp; Appreciate any help with this!

<p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three different ways to open a document library in File Explorer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the document library with Internet Explorer and use the "View in File Explorer" feature. For details please check this article:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/copy-or-move-library-files-by-using-open-with-explorer-aaee7bfb-e2a1-42ee-8fc0-bcc0754f04d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Copy or move library files by using Open with Explorer</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p>2. Sync the document library to the OneDrive folder in your computer by the OneDrive sync client by clicking the "Sync" icon in your document library.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p>3. Use "Map network drive". Please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-mapped-network-drives-that-connect-to-sharepoint-online-ef399c67-4578-4c3a-adbe-0b489084eabe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> for the detailed process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mentioned exporting metadata of your document library, may I ask if you means that you want to keep your files in the library classified by metadata after you opened your library in File Explorer? Please take a look at the following article and
 see if it could address your concern:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-metadata-navigation-for-a-list-or-library-c222a75d-8b18-44e2-9ed8-7ee4e0d23cfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up metadata navigation for a list or library</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If my information above could not address your concern, please post back and let us further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>No, that is not possible. The 500 is a low end&nbsp;entry level model and it's hardware cannot be modified.</p>
<p><br />
Your best option is to sell the 500 and put the money towards a 603. Not all low end androids can play those games either.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 crash while creating account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exxeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 crash while creating account</h2>
                    I've recently encountered the following problem when creating new pop3 or imap accounts.&nbsp; At the point where Outlook attempts to connect with and test&nbsp;the outbound server, I get a pop-up that Outlook has stopped working and will restart.&nbsp; This happens
 with both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.&nbsp; If I run Outlook with elevated privileges, the problem does not occur.&nbsp; At least that allows me to create accounts, for now.&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea of what may be causing this problem?

<h2>            how to determine if one value in a column exists in another</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I am currently working with two columns containing similar data, column A and B. Column B contains data with duplicates and contains thousands of values. Column A contains maybe 100 values.<br />
<br />
What function should I use to determine if values in column A, exist in column B?<br />
<br />
I've tried vlookup, and match functions and I believe I'm using them incorrectly, as my values return as N/A.<br />
<br />
I would like the values to populate in another column and show values of "True" or "False".<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>I use Windows 10 along with Outlook 2010 to check my email (Outlook.com &amp; Gmail). I have configured Outlook 2010 to use IMAP and SMTP (on port 993 and 465, respectively) and chosen SSL option for that. And everything works fine but I don't know what type
 SSL connection is used for that, I mean, SSL 3.0 or tls 1.0, considered as insecure or tls 1.1 or 1.2. but I don't know how to check it. I use default Windows settings.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Transferring data from a locked phone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've recently broken my touchscreen on my Lumia 520, causing a crack that allows the screen to remain visible but not registering any input on the touchscreen itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As repairing it is more expensive than a new model, I've been trying to retrieve my data (notes, photos, videos etc) from it using the Windows Phone app but as the screen is locked (and I have no way of unlocking it now the screen is unresponsive) it's not
 allowing me access. Is there any way around this or am I out of luck?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>What OS are you using? Basically you don't need Windows Phone App to sync your data. You can access the phone memory by only connecting the phone to your PC and using Windows Explorer. If this doesn't work either, don't worry much, because part of your data,
 such as contacts and calendar entries, is already synced to your Live ID.</p>
