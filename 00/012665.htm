<h2>            How to find an uninstalled app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had an app someone has accidentally uninstalled that app (I don't know that app's name). I tried search for that app in the store by using the key word, but it didn't help me. Even I couldn't find that app in My Library too. Please help me to find that
 app.</p>
<p>Description about the app - A app help to download bing daily image.</p>
<p>I have tried other app similar to this one but the app that I used is the best. Because you can search for a photo form 2009 to current date.</p>

    <title>Rule Line Misalignment Due to Bullets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ceciliayang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rule Line Misalignment Due to Bullets</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone notice that there is a bug with the bullets and the rule lines? This happens in all iOS versions of OneNote, and the most recent OneNote for Mac.&nbsp;The rule lines have a fixed width in between them, but when using certain bullets, specifically the
 open-circle bullet, it causes the line spacing after a line break to increase ever-so slighty. By the time I have written a document with about 30 bullets, the words DO NOT ALIGN with the rule lines anymore. And after removing all the bullets, the text re-aligns
 with the rule lines once again. It is very irritating trying to read my notes with the rule lines going through them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This phenomenon happens in OneNote on Windows too, but only with bullets that I use less often because they are further down on the indentation ladder, such as the diamonds. So I normally can avoid this problem just by making less complicated outlines, haha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it for yourself: open a OneNote document with about 50 lines of text (with line/paragraph breaks after each line), bullet them, and increase the indent until you have a bullet that cause the line spacing to grow and the document will misalign near the
 end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, I am just using the default font, Calibri 11. As far as I know, it is the only font that actually aligns with the rule lines (without bullets of course).</p>

            <p>It would be great if Microsoft could look into this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rule lines are probably there for people that will write (with a stylus) rather than type notes. Because of that, the text gets misaligned if you type and add bullets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to see Microsoft fix this. I love how rule lines look when re-reading my notes instead of a wall of text on a blank background.</p>

    <title>Giving other SharePoint Online users access to Word Building Blocks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Giving other SharePoint Online users access to Word Building Blocks</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all</p>
<p>
</p><p>The small company (70 users over different locations) has a SharePoint site. I have an MS Word template saved on local drives which includes Building Blocks of text in a customer drop down menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want all other users to be able to use these drop down menus in the template. However, when I upload the document to the SharePoint library the drop building blocks are not an option in the online version of Word. If I choose to edit the document in Word
 itself then *I* have access to the Building Blocks but other users do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand this is because when I created the building blocks they were saved in my local drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can recreate these building blocks on SharePoint for all other others?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back. I believe that you already know the content of my last reply. But please allow me to do a briefly supplement.
</p>
<p>If you upload the .dotx file in SharePoint Online and If users download it, it won’t show building blocks in the Quick Parts unless users save the .dotx to custom Office template folder or Microsoft\Document Building
<span>&nbsp;</span>Block\1033\16 folder. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I’m afraid that we can’t use building blocks in the Word documents that are uploaded to SharePoint Online, unless the users open the Word document in client application. However, I think this is a good idea to improve our product,
 we suggest you post this idea in <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share Point UserVoice</a>. The high votes may raise attention of related teams and bring a better using experience to users. Your suggestion is likely to make this feature possible and more convenient for more users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Ivy</p>

</p><p>Yes, they could have a selection to choose xbox but to me it seems to suggest that since they are combining

<p>the two that there will only be <strong>one</strong> new Insider Program that has

            It looks to me like the forum structure can already accommodate this:<br />
<br />
1) Microsoft can add another platform choice where we can currently filter by PC or Phone.
<br />
2) There is already a category called Windows Insider Gaming where the gaming specific questions could go.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Yes, there is an Insider Gaming selection in the Windows Insider Program<br />
but there already is a different Xbox Forum for Xbox on Windows 10 Insider Program.<br />

How will the decision to merge Xbox One and the Windows Insider programs &nbsp;<br />
after the Anniversary Update in July 2016 is released affect these different Insider Forums?<br />

    <title>How do you format footnotes so that there is no paragraph spacing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa0328  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you format footnotes so that there is no paragraph spacing inside the footnote, but the footnotes are separated by a space&#63;</h2>
                    I want spacing between discrete footnotes, but I have footnotes with multiple paragraphs and I don't want any paragraph spacing within the footnote.&nbsp; If you modify the Footnote Text style and set the spacing between paragraphs it spaces both within the
 footnote and between the footnotes. This is <span style="font-style: italic">not </span>
related to the footnote separator as I often have anywhere from 2 to 10 footnotes on a page.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Example of what I want:</span><br />
<br />
1 FN Text paragraph 1<br />
paragraph 2<br />

            <p>I don't believe there's any way to do this except with direct formatting if you use the Footnote Text style for all footnote paragraphs. You could define a Footnote Continue style with no Spacing Before/After and make it the "Style for following paragraph"
 of Footnote Text. To have space between footnotes, however, you'd have to add Spacing Before to the Footnote Text style, and that would result in extra space between the first footnote and the Footnote Separator.</p>

<div>&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; Was attacked yesterday by this horrible ransomeware, Cryptolocker.&nbsp; Was able to clean everything up and fix registry using Norton and Norton's Power&nbsp;Erase.&nbsp; Unfortunately like many others a lot of my pictures and documents are corrupt.&nbsp; Has anyone
 found a way to de-crypt docs and pics, I have Windows 7.&nbsp; I read in the forum about trying Shadow Box.&nbsp; Is this safe to download and try?&nbsp; Also, I thought I read that it was for Vista.&nbsp; Is that true or do they have a Shadow Box for Windows 7 also?&nbsp; Has anyone
 tried it or anything else with success in getting their photos and docs back???</div>

            <p>Thank you for your quick response.&nbsp; Also, the first time we thought we had taken care of everything in the registry we went back to put pictures back on the computer from our external hard drive and while the external hard drive was in in the usb port the
 crypto lock virus came back.&nbsp; We think we saw that it had encrypted pictures on the external hard drive but we pulled it out of the usb so quickly we don't know what we lost and are afraid to put it back in.&nbsp; Is it possible that this crypto locker has infected
 our external hard drive?&nbsp; Can I put it back in and run an antivirus on the the external drive before it would attack my computer?&nbsp; We think the second time, with Norton Experts help, we finally have gotten rid of everything on the computer including manually
 removing the virus on our registry.</p>

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be caused by some add-ins or settings that you on Google Chrome. We would like to know the following information for us to isolate the issue:</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can try to launch the browser using the New Private Window. If the issue still occur, we suggest that you clear the browser cache and history.</p>
<p>

            Do not import.&nbsp; Simply open the file in Outlook.&nbsp; Click the File tab, the Account Settings button, then choose the Data Files tab.&nbsp; Add the file there.&nbsp; It will contain everything it already had in it.

<br />
First, there is no need to use SUM.&nbsp; Simply use the "+" operator.&nbsp; That should eliminate the 30-argument error.<br />
<br />
(I presume you are editing a ".xls" file in compatiblity mode, since your "applies to" line says you are using Excel 2007, which normally does not have a 30-argument limitation.)<br />
<br />
Second, there is no need to test ISNUMBER($F73).&nbsp; The PRODUCT function ignores non-numeric parameters.<br />
<br />
So at a minimum, your example above could be written simply as:<br />
<br />
=PRODUCT($F$73,$J$73)/100 + PRODUCT($G$74,$J$74)<br />
<br />
Note that I moved "/100" outside the PRODUCT function.&nbsp; It is arithmetically equivalent.<br />
<br />
However, you might still encounter a "formula too long" error if your fully-loaded formula exceeds one of several applicable limitations, including a limit on the number of characters in a formula.<br />
<br />
You can shorten your example formula as follows:<br />
<br />
=N($F$73)*N($J$73)/100 + N($G$74)*N($J$74)<br />
<br />
That assumes that F73, J73, G74 and J74 are never the logic value TRUE.<br />
<br />
However, if you show us more of the arguments (and preferably all of them), we might be able to see a pattern that could lead to a much simpler formula.<br />
<br />
(I wonder if you meant to write PRODUCT($G$74,$J$74/100), similar to PRODUCT($F$73,$J$73)/100.&nbsp; Then ostensibly, it appears that you might be multiplying pairs along a diagonal.&nbsp; But F*J/100+G*J/100+H*J/100+... does not allow for 30 similar arguments unless
 the terms can become ...+J*J/100+K*J/100+L*J/100+....&nbsp; And you might avoid the repetitive J/100 simply by dividing the values in column J by 100.&nbsp; For example, if column J contains percentages, calculate them as true percentages -- decimal fractions formatted
 as Percentage.)<br />

            Is Snow Leopard fully updated?&nbsp; Be sure you got the supplemental updater for 10.6.8.<br />
<br />
If you restart in Safe Boot mode then insert the CD, does it work? There is no reason that Office 2004 does not work under Snow Leopard. Clean it first. Wipe from center of disc to the outside with a damp cloth.<br />
<br />
SAFE BOOT MODE<br />
<br />
Hold down the Shift key when booting your computer. You can let go of the Shift key when you see ’Safe Boot’ and a progress bar. When booting into safe boot mode it forces your computer to run various maintenance tasks.

<h2>            Onenote for windows and Android, display different formats to that of an online shared document.</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">
&nbsp;I use Onenote to annotate photographs. When I produce the annotations in Onenote for windows I may use say the pencil, pen and text functions.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">
In below two examples I drew on the photos with the pencil and pen, then wrote text next to these photos.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">
Then I shared this note from the windows app (onenote) via the share button - Get a link.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">
When the link is clicked on it opens a webpage displaying the contents of the note, except the pencil marks are more like pen marks with no transparent quality like in the original note. Some of the pen marks are not where they were on the original (i think
 because when annotating photos the annotations are created over the photos rather than directly editing the photo). And the text is positioned half over the photos instead of next to them.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">
When I open the same note on the android app (onenote) it also has lost the original qualities, but looks different again. The drawings are aligned in a different place.</div>

<p>Thankyou for replying, I appreciate the effort but fail to see how either link is relevant. They just give info on what is possible, and neither give any indication why i might be seeing this problem while sharing solely from the windows 10 app (which comes
 with my surface book).</p>
<p>Currently Onenote seems like a real mess, which is a shame because it promises so much.</p>
<p>I will post on user voice page as you said. Is that something I should expect some service from?</p>

<p>I received an email stating that it was noticed that my question remained un-answered. Here is my response;</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I did not get any resolution with my issue but rather got the run around over the phone and forum. Basically I think one note is full of bugs and inconsistencies. I assume the format changes through sharing are just that.
</p>
<p>From the Android app I can note share via pdf which is preferred to sharing an active link to an active note, because I can later delete that note and not be concerned who else might lose access to it. The windows app does not have this pdf sharing
 option. Why not?<br />
The problem is that a note created in the windows app looks different when shared via active link. Why?<br />
I also an continuously frustrated with the inability to share notes immediately, or even quickly. Sometimes the notebooks seem to just be endlessly syncing and I get errors when trying to share a page via link. It seems that the link is not ready yet because
 the note is not yet synced. If I could just share add via email all would be well.&nbsp;<br />
Adding images is also cumbersome. To share multiple images to a note from the photos app. Requires me to individually select then and add them. Often the never Surat after waiting once again for the images to of through the cloud. The only way to add them direct
 from the hard drive is one at a time!<br />
I could go on.</p>

<p>Following instructions, I click "modify" and get asked to permit Microsoft to modify the program (under the title Microsoft Office Client Virtualization Handler).&nbsp; I give permission but then nothing more happens, and I eventually get the message "click to

I have tried this but without success.&nbsp; Message read "System Restore failed while restoring the directory from the restore point.&nbsp; An unspecified error occurred during System Restore (0x80070005)".&nbsp; Is it time to obtain a newer version of Office?

            You could try a different restore point, but sooner or later, you are almost certainly going to need to get a copy of the current version of Office.

                    <p>So my Excel 2013 is installed on a desktop computer running Windows 10. And it has a weird number formatting glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see in the screenshot, my thousands separator is set to a space ( ) or " ". And instead of separating thousands by putting the separator every three digits it puts it every TWO digits!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Bernie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already thought about checking that place.. My location is set to Latvia (because I live here) and the formats (date, time, currency) are set to Latvian as well. But since I upgraded to Windows 10 the formatting has been messed up. Not just thousands separation
 but date formatting as well (can see my latest question&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/624ae84d-1452-41a6-af00-2174eae00419">here</a>&nbsp;which I believe is related to the same regional formatting glitch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to somehow refresh or reset the default formatting?</p>

            Sorry - I only recognized the formatting, but have never had to actually solve this issue. &nbsp;You might want to post a question in the operating system forum for whichever version you have.

<p>
</p><p>Forgive me if this is a misdirection, but you might take a look at the Excel Options.&nbsp; As I recall, Excel 2010 and later have a Language option that might override features that depend on Regional and Language Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot double-check myself because I only have Excel 2007 to use at the moment, and apparently it does not have a Language option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Advanced Options, there is also an option to override "system separators".&nbsp; That might explain the unexpected thousands separator, but not problems with date, time and currency formatting.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, but the problem still persists. There is something even deeper messed up in my computer..</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>And something worth noting is that the problem only occurs if my computer is set to Latvian regional settings (in Control Panel/Region). Please tell me how I can fix the Latvian formatting template!</p>

            <p>Hi DrOwnage,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your contribution to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds to me that your new password has more than 16 characters.&nbsp; In order to fix your issue, I would suggest to create a new password with 8 characters. it should fix your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hakim B.</p>
