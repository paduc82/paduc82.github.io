<h2>            Problems and possible bug&#47;flaw in wifi settings.</h2>
                    <p>Found what I would best describe as a flaw or bug in the windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set the IP address of ALL wifi connections under the adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you go into the WIFI connect properties and try to hard set a ip address instead of dhcp of A access point. The operating system says</p>
<p>"Cant save IP settings. Check one or more settings and try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize this is a duplicate area of settings. But I think the intention was for this to replace having to change the adapter settings every time you link into a different AP. Its problematic for my use and would like to
 know a fix or if there is a repair under way.</p>

            Hello, EngTech1,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.

<br />"When assigning static IP addresses, you want to assign them outside the DHCP lease pool, and that generally means excluding a portion of the range from the DHCP pool.   If you assign a local static IP that is in the DHCP lease pool, the DHCP service will not know about it, and may potentially assign the same IP address to a different client device, causing an IP address conflict and communication problems for both devices."

<h2>            Desktop off-center</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Not sure if you can help.&nbsp; I recently experienced a power surge due to a summer storm.&nbsp; When I rebooted, the desktop was off center.&nbsp; There is a black vertical bar/space on the right side of the monitor.&nbsp; Also, when I open a browser, that same black bar/space
 reappears.&nbsp; I cannot adjust the window to fit the monitor by dragging it over.&nbsp; And, I lose the left side of the window(file menu, favorites, back button, etc.)&nbsp; My screen resolution is set to 60.<br />
<br />
I was going&nbsp;to do a start-up repair to try to fix the problem.&nbsp; But, I cannot find the Windows Vista installation discs.&nbsp; I created recovery discs, but this is a last resort.&nbsp; I do not want to move all my files and programs that I would lose in a clean installation.<br />
<br />
Can you help?

            On the frame of the screen you will find several small buttons, one of them is either 'Auto' or 'Menu'/'Settings'/'OSD'/... which will open a small menu on the screen. You can navigate through it using the arrow keys.<br />

    <title>Cant upgrade Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart anderson grant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant upgrade Windows 8.1 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded a Desktop from 8.1 to 10 without any problem but I am trying to convert a small laptop also but not getting anywhere. I start with the usual screen "Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to W10". It confirms that the computer is capable of running
 Windows 10 and I start with the screen which asks if you want to update now or download and install later. I have tried both and neither works. It starts of course with the Download. This goes on and on for a long time but doesn't get anywhere. After several
 attempts I looked at my Download Folder. I found three files</p>
<p>GetWindows10-sds________________.exe&nbsp; 7457KB</p>
<p>GetWindows10-Web_Default_Atttr.exe also 7457KB</p>
<p>GWX-WebWindows.exe&nbsp; 29KB</p>
<p>Trying to Open or Run any of them produces the same result.&nbsp; Back to the same screen - Do you want to Update or Download and Update Later. Choosing either starts again a very long download - I mean HOURS.</p>
<p>I am sure that it is not coincidence that I have another problem. I have not been getting any more W8.1 updates since 13&nbsp; November. If I find upgrades and try to install them it insists on going to the W10 upgrade. Can anyone help ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try upgrading to Win 10 manually by downloading a ISO and\or Creating media... Then just run it from within Win 8.1... At least you will only need to download once...

            <p>Appreciate your suggestion. I have already spent hours on this and I am reluctant to try a new approach. I did not mention in my original message my experience with trying to install on my main Desktop which has Windows 7 Professional. My first attempt seemed
 to work until I tried to print. None of my four printers would work&nbsp; with Windows 10. I turned to Microsoft Chat Help. fter two&nbsp;days&nbsp;and&nbsp;a nuber of fruitless suggestions, I was told that I would have to move up&nbsp; to Level 2 Help. I would have to make an appointment
 three days in advance&nbsp;! I did and duly got contact with someone from Level 2. I agreed to turn over my computer to his control and he duly started. He ran a program from an outside firm, not Microsoft which after two hours completed. I still could not print&nbsp;!
 I said I thought I should give up and go back to W7. Level 2 agreed. Told me I should do a complete reinstall from disc. I was not keen to do this and searched the web for help and someone showed me how in Windows 10 you could&nbsp; within, I think , 10 days do
 it simply with a few clicks. It worked and W7 is fine and all my printers work.</p>
<p>So I am reluctant to try ANY new&nbsp;&nbsp;approach but I will think about it. Thanks again</p>
<p>Stuart</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say I blame you for being reluctant to upgrade... The process I mentioned works about the same as Windows Update, but a lot of times bypasses some of the issues associated with Windows Update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your printers go, if you try again in the future, you might try REMOVING them in Devices and Printers... Physically unhook them from the machine... Go to Print Spooler in SERVICES and STOP it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then completely uninstall the printer software and reboot...</p>
<p>Again turn off the Print Spooler, and reinstall the printers software package using Compatibility Mode for a earlier version of Windows in which they worked...</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks again.&nbsp; You certainly seem to have lots of answers!</p>
<p>When I was trying to solve this problem I visited the&nbsp;TenForum several times. My last message there was as follows -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote</p>
<p>My update to Windows 10 from Windows 7 went without problems but none of the three printers attached to my computer worked and I have been struggling with the problem over the last two weeks. There is another long thread "Can't connect to Printer" which
 has not produced a solution.<br />
One solution seemed to be to delete the printers and then Add. Problem is they won't delete - just get a notation "No
<a href="http://link.tweakbit.com/tds/7fDU?source=TFdrv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
If you go to Services/Print Spooler/Properties you find that the Spooler is indeed stopped. There is a Start button and a space for Start Parameters. I don't know what any parameters would be but if you press Start without any, you get an error Message 0x70080057
 "Wrong Parameters".<br />
A search in Google for this error produces a flood of items. It seems too be a very common error ! I didn't find anything helpful.</p>
<p>Unquote</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will still find the thread on TenForums under "Print Spooler". I seem to have tried some of your suggestions.</p>
<p>By an amazing coincidence, after a gap of several months someone TODAY asked on this thread if I had found an answer. He has the same problem ! I&nbsp; have told him NO.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do these printers have any type of installation CD, or drivers available from the manufacturers ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't actually use the "Add Printer"... I just run the installation software\drivers installer, plug it in when instructed, and it works.... Providing t has never been hooked up before...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it has been hooked up before, I have to do the process I mentioned above, or regardless of what I do, I get "Con Not Communicate With Printer" message...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your error is a bit different than mine... My print Spooler was in fact "Started", but still getting the error... I had to stop it to get the software to uninstall and reinstall properly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where you are trying to Delete your printer, but I "REMOVED" m ine in Devices and Printers... Which was also required...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the best of my knowledge, needing to reinstall printers after upgrading is about the norm.... The ones that actually work are the exception...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on at least since WIN 8 Previews were released in 2012 or so with my machines..</p>

            <p>Appreciate the efforts to help me but I have already spent (wasted) so much time on this that I have to get on with other things. I am not convinced that Windows 10 has great advantages having tried it on the one computer where the installation succeeded.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p><span>Hi SharuSouza,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link and try the steps mentioned to make the printer work under Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Windows-7/HP-color-laser-jet-1500L-Drivers-for-windows-7-ultimate-32-bit/td-p/1125173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30499.www3.hp.com/t5/Windows-7/HP-color-laser-jet-1500L-Drivers-for-windows-7-ultimate-32-bit/td-p/1125173</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you refer the &nbsp;<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=81959&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=81954&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=4062#1130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a>&nbsp;
 to download and install the universal printer driver, check if it works.</span></p>

*******************************************************************************<br />
<br />
THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER_M (100000ea)<br />
The device driver is spinning in an infinite loop, most likely waiting for<br />
hardware to become idle. This usually indicates problem with the hardware<br />
itself or with the device driver programming the hardware incorrectly.<br />
If the kernel debugger is connected and running when watchdog detects a<br />
timeout condition then DbgBreakPoint() will be called instead of KeBugCheckEx()<br />
and detailed message including bugcheck arguments will be printed to the<br />
debugger. This way we can identify an offending thread, set breakpoints in it,<br />
and hit go to return to the spinning code to debug it further. Because<br />
KeBugCheckEx() is not called the .bugcheck directive will not return bugcheck<br />
information in this case. The arguments are already printed out to the kernel<br />
debugger. You can also retrieve them from a global variable via<br />
"dd watchdog!g_WdBugCheckData l5" (use dq on NT64).<br />
On MP machines it is possible to hit a timeout when the spinning thread is<br />
interrupted by hardware interrupt and ISR or DPC routine is running at the time<br />
of the bugcheck (this is because the timeout's work item can be delivered and<br />
handled on the second CPU and the same time). If this is the case you will have<br />
to look deeper at the offending thread's stack (e.g. using dds) to determine<br />
spinning code which caused the timeout to occur.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: ffff850944ab5080, Pointer to a stuck thread object.&nbsp; Do .thread then kb on it to find<br />
the hung location.<br />
Arg2: 0000000000000000, Pointer to a DEFERRED_WATCHDOG object.<br />
Arg3: 0000000000000000, Pointer to offending driver name.<br />
Arg4: 0000000000000000, Number of times "intercepted" bugcheck 0xEA was hit (see notes).<br />

    <title>Transferring folder of emails from one Hotmail account to another. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raymondfry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring folder of emails from one Hotmail account to another.</h2>
                    Trueswitch no longer transfers files from one Hotmail account into another. I want to close out one of my old Hotmail email addresses and move a folder of saved emails into my other Hotmail account before I close it out.<br />
<br />
How can I get that done?<br />

<br />
Download and install <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=mailother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Mail</a> and follow the prompts on first use to set up one of the Hotmail accounts. It will take some time, so be patient. Eventually all your folders and messages will be downloaded. Then press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the
<em>Add your email accounts </em>wizard again and use it to add the other Hotmail account.<br />
<br />
You can then move messages from a folder under one account to a folder under the other. Again, these will eventually synchronize with folders online.</p>

            I considered that, Ron: I first wrote 'copied or moved'. However, on reflection, bearing in mind the increasing number of problems with the database that we've been seeing, I thought that the 'move' option was more likely to proceed without hitches. 'Move'
 only involves changing the location field in the index, while 'copy' requires a whole new set of files to be created and indexed (and virus -scanned). On balance, I came to the conclusion that 'less is better'. The old account is scheduled for removal, anyway.<br />
<br />
If the 'move' is conducted while working offline, I think the probability of data loss resulting from untimely synchronizations is minimized. A 'belt and braces' procedure would be to copy first to a folder under storage folders, then copy from there to the
 new account. <br />

            <p>We are both suggesting ways to safely move the messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>'Move' only involves changing the location field in the index</em></p>
<p>This is true for WLMail, but when an account synchronization occurs, the 'moved' emails will be removed from the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add the 'move emails' account first.</p>
<p>After the folders and emails have synchronized, right click on the account name in the folder pane, Properties, uncheck Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing.</p>
<p>Now if something happens, the emails are still on the 'move emails' server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that will help the database is to close WLMail several minutes before turning off or putting the computer to sleep.</p>

<h2>            Wireless printing</h2>
                    <p>I recently replaced my laptop with a Surface Pro 4. I know the Surface Pro is connected wirelessly to the network and so is my printer (Brother HL-L2305W). &nbsp;But I cannot print wirelessly to the printer. &nbsp;When I go through Settings&gt; Devices, etc., I can see
 the printer, but it is shown as "offline". &nbsp;I can print fine with a cable from the printer connected to the USB port of the Surface. &nbsp;What am I missing here?</p>

<p>Setting up a wireless printer with your sp4 is no different then setting up any other windows 10 laptop. &nbsp;See these instructions and other related info on Youtube and the Brother site.</p>

            I have connected the printer to the network. &nbsp;That is not the problem. &nbsp;When I go to Windows&gt;Settings&gt;Devices, I see my printer, but it shows "Offline" How do I get it "online" so I can print to it. &nbsp;All I see under the printer are three buttons, 1) Open
 Queue, 2) Manage, and 3) Remove Device.&nbsp;

            Has anyone found a solution to this yet?&nbsp; I have an Epson xp-430 and nearly every other time I want to print, the printer is offline.&nbsp; I just reinstalled the driver from the Epson website, printer was back online, and I was able to print wirelessly yesterday.&nbsp;
 Today, it is offline again.&nbsp; So sick of this.&nbsp; I have been under the impression that this is an Epson problem, but decided to check on my smartphone (iPhone) and the printer shows up as being ready to print wirelessly.&nbsp; So it leads me to think this is a problem
 on Microsoft's end that needs to be addressed once and for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I had the same problem so reinstalled driver from downloaded driver the driver asked if the printer will be used wirelessly or usb I ticked wireless and all is ok. That's a Canon printer though but they should be the same I had a HP that did it.

<h3> captsteve84  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Windows 10 Mail to work with bellsouth.net&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read the other posts and tried to use those solutions, but cannot get the bellsouth account to sync with Mail. I am using the advanced mailbox settings and am using the "inbound.att.net" and "outbound.att.net" for the inbound and outbound messages and
 the POP3 selection. I am using those settings on my laptop and they work just fine. However, they don't seem to be working in this newer version. What am I doing wrong?
</p>
<p>Mail keeps telling me that my settings are "out of date," but my password is current, which I have already verified.</p>

            <p>Can I suggest that you familiarize yourself with a subject first before you spout nonsense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook Mail and Calendar app (otherwise known as Mail (and Calendar)) contrary to the&nbsp;Win8 Mail app works fine with POP accounts as a preview app and mail send app. Except that it still handles it as IMAP and doesn't delete the messages from the server
 once read, which is why I use it as preview and mail send app and use another email client (OE classic) to store my inbound emails permanently once they start&nbsp;piling up on the server. This then empties the inbox on Mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a proper POP3 Email app and I'm not sure if it is even a proper IMAP email app.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Since this is an App that can be used on multiple devices and you want to see all your mail on all devices the mail has to stay on the server or else mail will be scattered over different devices and only be visible on the devices that messages were saved
 to. This is most likely the reason why the Mail app leaves messages on the server even in POP mode.</p>

<p>Can I suggest that you familiarize yourself with a subject first before you spout nonsense?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook Mail and Calendar app (otherwise known as Mail) contrary to the&nbsp;Live Mail app works fine with POP accounts as a preview app and mail send app. Except that is still handles it as IMAP and doesn't delete the messages from the server once read (or even
 deleted), which is why I use it as preview and mail send app and use another email client (OE classic) to store my inbound emails permanently once they start&nbsp;piling up on the server. This then empties the inbox on Mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a proper POP3 Email app and I'm not sure if it is even a proper IMAP email app.</p>

Although I don't seem to have any problem, I still get the message "Your Bellsouth settings are out of date".&nbsp; Someone please advise.

            <p>While I don't know what triggers it during normal use&nbsp;I do know how to invoke it. Somehow this has to do with changing&nbsp;the mail server SSL settings and this is how the app stops you from&nbsp;going forward without identifying yourself. You are blocked out of
 syncing your account unless you provide your password. Both the account and the sync button get a warning sign added to it and Syncing brings back the aforementioned message banner.</p>

<h3> foxwold  say:</h3>
<h2>            plugplay service using all of cpu</h2>
                    I have recently hit a performance problem on my PC - looking at the task manager I can see that an instance of svchost.exe is gobbling CPU. &nbsp;I have selected the process and found that it was running DCOMLaunch and PlugPlay services. I have found other
 similar problems on this forum, but no definitive answer to fix things when the service is identified as PlugPlay.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm guessing that it's something about the PlugPlay service that's causing the problem, but how can I fix it ? I looked at the options for disabling a service but it said that Plug and Play is essential &amp; if I disable it I might get system instability.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Vista Home Premium with service pack 2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions gratefully received !</div>

            I didn't get around to your suggestion as I think I finally found the answer ! When I ran the system health report one thing that it picked up was my C drive was rather full, so I moved all my pictures &amp; photos onto the D drive. It didn't help straight
 away, but later I defragged the C drive &amp; after that my problem disappeared. I think it must have been that the files accessed by PlugPlay must have been badly fragmented.

<div>
<p>Hi-</p>
<p>&nbsp;Quick question.&nbsp; I changed the security settings for an external HD because for work I was trying to privatize the confidential information from most users on a shared network.&nbsp; I added a few users as having "full control" and denied the rest of the other
 users-allowing "read-only" capabilities.&nbsp; Now when I set these settings, I tried to access the external HD and it is blocking me from manipulating it (even under a full control user), even worse, i can't change the security settings back to remove the "deny"
 options/read-only settings I have for the majority of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

<p>did you do this on the local policy, i.e. only one XP workstatoin, or on your domain controller? (is this on a domain, or a workgroup?) Simplist fix is safemode if you did this on only one workstation, login with the admin account and revert the changes</p>

<p>that may not work if the owner is an administrator, or he is the current owner and the local policy is what is stopping him from accessing the drive.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reponses...I'm still working on the problem, but to answer the questions it was done on a workstation under a user who was not the admin on this computer but is an admin on another computer.&nbsp; Another question I had-is going into safe
 mode and manipulating the ownership at all a risk for damaging the information on the hard drive?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Goozfx 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />If that is a Retail Licence, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

            Hi Goozfx 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />The last resort is to contact Support if it is a retail license.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call/contact Microsoft Support.
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link:

<h2>            Movie Maker 2012 won&#39;t start</h2>
                    I've been trying for some time to get Movie Maker 2012 to open.&nbsp; I've got a Lenovo Z560 laptop, with an Intel HD Graphics driver version 8.15.10.2104.&nbsp; I'm running DirectX 11.&nbsp; Try as I might to update the video driver to 8.15.10.2761, it says "the computer
 does not meet the minimum requirement for installing the software."<br />
<br />
I'd like to know what I can do to get Movie Maker to work, as I'd rather not purchase video editing software.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            I wound up not doing this update, instead I tried something different.&nbsp; My manufacturer warranty has expired, but my extended warranty had not, so I figured I would try something I read on another chat board.<br />
<br />
Having installed the updated Intel driver you had previously suggested, I knew I had the right thing.&nbsp; The problem was simply that it wouldn't automatically update.&nbsp; So, I went into the device manager and uninstalled the driver.&nbsp; This totally messed up the
 screen resolution, and required a reboot.&nbsp; Upon restart the resolution was still messed up, but that was understandable, given there was now no video driver.&nbsp; Then I found the downloaded replacement driver and ran it.&nbsp; Everything loaded.&nbsp; Following the update
 I had to reboot.<br />
<br />
Voila!&nbsp; I started Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp; Works great!<br />
<br />
I simply had to do this through the device manager.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.&nbsp; Problem solved.<br />

<p>
</p><p>In the former version of paint, you could easily control the size of the graphic. &nbsp;You could drag the size of the picture larger or smaller, or you could specify it in the menu. &nbsp;The graphic had a white background and the unused space was dark. &nbsp;Now the
 entire space is&nbsp;white and you cannot control the size of the graphic.</p>

            Hello Phygmente,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Windows Answers Community Forum,<br />
<br />
I would suggest to download the update instead of allowing Windows Update to apply this critial update. Then apply the update manually and see if you can successfully install it<br />
<br />
You can select the download the update from the following Microsoft URL:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms08-075.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/ms08-075.mspx</a><br />
<br />
depending on whether you are are SP1 or not.<br />
<br />
Please post back and let us know if you were successful in installing the update manually.
<br />
<br />
Thank you,

            If you are doing this from the Windows Update site automatically, I would try some of the basic troubleshooting steps.<br />
