    <title>Text formatting problem with MS Word 2008 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leahcadore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text formatting problem with MS Word 2008</h2>
                    When I want to make a formatting change to a paragraph of text, such as bolding, lining through, font color, etc., I select the paragraph, make the change, and often the change will be implemented throughout other portions of the document rather than just
 the paragraph I selected. If I happen to notice it, I can hit the Undo key once and the unwanted changes will be undone. If I don't happen to notice it, I end up saving the document with massive formatting errors and have to reformat the entire thing, often
 one paragraph at a time. Can I fix this problem? If so, how?

            <p>Word is based on the use of Styles for formatting. Styles control the formatting of text anywhere the Style is applied. One of the attributes of a Style is Automatically Update, which causes the Style to be modified any time direct formatting changes are
 made to text which has that Style applied to it. In turn, the same change is made to any other text which has that same Style applied to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to identify which Style that is &amp; modify the Style to remove the Automatically Update attribute.</p>

    <title>cross reference - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave gayler  say:</h3>
<h2>            cross reference</h2>
                    I have a number of files stored under OneNote which I need to cross reference for the simple reason that to have fresh copies in a number of folders consumes more disc space than I can afford.<br />
<br />
Is there any way of cross referencing under OneNote 2013, so that only one copy may appear to have been filed in various sections in different section groups, or even notebooks?
<br />
<br />
Simple example: I want to file my invoice for the insurance on the car under "car expenses" against the quote and under "to be paid" invoices<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            That is not possible in the current version of OneNote. It's a frequent<br />
request that I'm sure is being seriously considered by the MS development<br />
team.<br />
<br />
A few workarounds exist:<br />
1) OneNote supports manually creating "File" URLs. You could create a link<br />
in OneNote that points to another *.ONE file in your "My Notebook" folder.<br />
You cannot navigate to a specific page/subpage/location within that *.ONE<br />
file, so whatever page was active the last time you navigated to that section<br />
will be visible when you click on the link.<br />
<br />
2) You might be able to cobble something together using Note Flags. If you<br />
create a Flag for "Definitions", you could potentially use the Notes Flag<br />
summary to navigate to any note that has that flag applied to it.

            Two problems. "Link" does no execute a link when pointing to another page in OneNote, but a "Jump" or "Branch". You are left in another section. Fun until you have lots of pages and have to find your way back.
<br />
<br />
AS to flags, I have difficulty in seeing that as practial for one thousand pages, let alone more.<br />

<h2>            Where does my old BlackBerry 9300 synchronize to &#39;Outlook&#39; when I don&#39;t use Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>(I've already looked at a similar post from 2014 and it does not answer my particular question)<br />
<br />
Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been puzzled by this question for some time, but never desperately needed to know before now, but my BlackBerry calendar and Tasks have become very important, and I want to make sure I can find them if the phone packs up as it's getting old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BlackBerry Desktop Software only gives an option to synchronize contacts, tasks, memos, and calendar with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Outlook because I am happy with Thunderbird, and don't trust my data to be all in one huge pst file that disappears when your pc has a hiccup and corrupts your profile, as happened to a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do, however, have a home and student edition of Office 2010, from which I mostly just use Excel, as most of my communication is on email, with my BlackBerries, and I don't have time for fancy stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first got it, I did try to open Outlook, but the setup dialogue wanted a key, which I had not been given, and couldn't find out how to get, so I've never bothered with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: &nbsp;I don't have Outlook installed, but my BlackBerry Desktop Software is still spending hours synchronizing my phones: &nbsp;I just don't know where. &nbsp;I need to check that 'where' to remove contacts duplicates for one thing, and to access a history of around
 18,000 'tasks' (that I only noticed recently, were a separate app to my calendar!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software tells me the tasks and memos are going to 'myispmail\tasks', and 'myispmail\notes'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't find any trace of these on my pc, but my Windows Live Mail (Which, I believe is now, confusingly, called 'Outlook.com') does have a 'notes' folder for my hotmail accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed that my BlackBerry must be synchronizing with my Live Mail contacts and calendar as 'Outlook', and, indeed, there are entries in my Live Mail calendar, but the thousands of tasks that I keep track of on my BlackBerry calendar, are nowhere to be
 seen, even though my pc busily copies many thousands of them over several hours of comparing and updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, where are they? &nbsp;I keep my Live Mail for hotmail accounts, so there is no 'myispmail\notes, or, tasks' folder in Live Mail 'Outlook.com' for them to be saved to, so I'm baffled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the BlackBerry software have some 'backdoor' access to the Office Outlook folders that have never been activated, or what? &nbsp;Is it being synchronized to some Outlook.com, server in 'the cloud', that I'm unaware of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never thought something so basic could be so confusing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any light that people can throw on this situation will be much appreciated. &nbsp;I'm getting no answers from the BlackBerry forums, or the Thunderbird forum (Though I do know that Thunderbird can't synchronize directly with the BlackBerry calendar, I can synchronize
 the contacts with 'Outlook', once I know for sure what it means by 'Outlook', and where the magic folders are!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>SteveH</p>

<p>Just to clarify a few things</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Outlook has nothing to do with "any" 3rd party sync software program so any questions regarding what BB Desktop software does or doesn't do need to be answered by the people who wrote the program. However, given that this involves BB - I wouldn't hold
 my breath)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Sounds like you have a trial version of Outlook installed - all you need to do is uninstall it via the Control Panel. In terms of where Outlook stores its data - it would be in a single PST file for any POP accounts and 2 PST files for an IMAP Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Windows Live Mail is an &lt;Email Client&gt; and Outlook.com is an &lt;Email Account&gt;. When you access your Outlook.com account via your browser, - no data is stored locally, Don't have a system handy with WLM installed to provide where it stores its data. but
 bottom line has nothing to do with Outlook (desktop) especially if it has never been with any email accounts.

            <p>Thank you Karl: Nice to hear from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem most likely that the locations shown in the desktop software are located in the Outlook pst profile file, but I have no idea how the desktop software can get in there, when I can't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop software is directing the sync to locations ending with the name of my email account plus '\notes', or '\tasks'.&nbsp; If these are in the pst file, is it simply necessary to add these to the location of the pst file to get the full address?&nbsp; Thus
 ...pst file\myemailac\notes etc. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A search finds that the pst folders are named *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' but the desktop software set up maps the location *** Email address is removed for privacy ***\notes'.&nbsp; Is that an abbreviation for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***\notes'?&nbsp; Nothing comes up if I search *.pst\notes etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you're saying there are two folders if it's IMAP, that may make a further complication, because I started off on POP3 and then changed to IMAP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm only seeing one pst for each email address.&nbsp; :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to simply remap the desktop software to the appropriate files in the Windows Live Client, and not bother with Office Outlook at all, but still nobody can tell me the simple location of the appropriate files, or folders so that I can create the
 files myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally: since I posted on here I have had two phishing emails claiming to be from MS Outlook.&nbsp; It looks like someone is watching to see who is communicating with MS in order to try and make the phish look more authentic.&nbsp; I've never had 'MS' phishing
 mail before.&nbsp; :/</p>

<p>#1 - As you're saying there are two folders if it's IMAP, that may make a further complication, because I started off on POP3 and then changed to IMAP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm only seeing one pst for each email address.&nbsp; :/<br />
</p>
<p>#2 - I was hoping to simply remap the desktop software to the appropriate files in the Windows Live Client, and not bother with Office Outlook at all, but still nobody can tell me the simple location of the appropriate files, or folders so that I can create
 the files myself.<br />
</p>
<p>#3 - Incidentally: since I posted on here I have had two phishing emails claiming to be from MS Outlook.&nbsp; It looks like someone is watching to see who is communicating with MS in order to try and make the phish look more authentic.&nbsp; I've never had 'MS' phishing
 mail before.&nbsp; :/<br />

<p>
</p><p>#1 &amp; #2 - this description is really starting to sound "contorted" - you either did configure Outlook at one point or you didn't. If you did, the fact that you no longer use it is absolutely and totally irrelevant. What your BB software is picking up is
 the current active Outlook profile. Simply re-mapping to Windows Live files is not your choice to make if BB doesn;'t support WLC files (have never used BB Desktop so have no idea of what you can or cannot do with it but was under the impression it worked
 with Outlook and not Win Live).</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1a - If you started with a POP account - you would only have been using one PST file (under normal conditions). If you then removed the POP3 account and configured it as IMAP in the same profile - you would have been using 2 PST files (1) the original from
 the POP account which would be the default data file containing the default contact/calendar folders and (2) one specific for the IMAP email folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Where are you Outlook files located? Two ways to find out&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) from within OL'2010 --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab</p>
<p>b) Using Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app --&gt; Click on &lt;Data Files&gt; button which will show the data files configured for the current active Outlook profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Re: Phishing emails - MS never sends out anything and not sure what you mean by "someone is watching" - same kind of garbage I get on a regular basis for all kinds of different targets (US banks, PayPal, shipments that couldn't be delivered with the
 "see attached doc" nonsense etc etc etc. One thing to do with all of those - hit the &lt;delete&gt; button and move on to the next thing on your agenda.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell if BB can write to WLC or not, because I don't have the address of the necessary folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an option to write to 'Windows Contacts' or Outlook, when you first set up the phone with the software.&nbsp; There's no indication where 'Windows Contacts' is either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't configure Office Outlook, because it would not let me even open it without a key.&nbsp; As it was supposed to be a demonstration copy, I thought this was rather poor show.&nbsp; I did try to find out how to get a key for the existing software, but this
 seemed to be impossible, so I didn't bother with it, and used Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the BlackBerry software made the Outlook profiles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I now know where the Office Outlook pst files are: I do not know where the Windows Live 'Outlook' files are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's beginning to look like I'll have to back up the phone and then extract the data from the backup file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still seems odd that I had no 'Outlook' phishing mail, until I started discussing it on here and with the service team.&nbsp; :/</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, eventually, realised I was being a bit dumb, and could open pst files without having to use the Office Outlook front end.&nbsp; Then I found that the tasks, memos, and calendar had, indeed, been synchronising in the pst files.&nbsp; My reader software doesn't have
 as many fields as I would like, but, at least it has helped me solve part of the mystery.&nbsp; The BlackBerry software *can* open pst files without needing Outlook.&nbsp; I wish someone could have answered this simple question a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't know where the data in the 'Contacts' folder of Windows Live Mail client is though.&nbsp; There are folders for the email and calendar in the profile folders, but no folder for contacts, so I still don't know where the 903 contacts in Windows Live
 Mail client are, so that I can try and make sure I always synchronise in the same folder and don't keep getting multiple copies after each synchronise.</p>

 that's of any use in terms of BB Desktop - will leave that to someone familiar with the inner workings of BB Desktop.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Formula of a BLANK cell to NOT A PART OF CALCULATION - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Formula of a BLANK cell to NOT A PART OF CALCULATION</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I make my Excel spreadsheet with a lot of BLANK cells OMIT the BLANK CELLS in the formula calculation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the Excel spreadsheet to calculate ALL cells with data.&nbsp; Calculated points of ALL the cells WITH data BUT DO NOT INCLUDE any data for the blank cells.&nbsp; I think the Excel blank cells are taken as "0" (zeros) ...which is messing up the final calculations
 because includes the blank cells in the calculation.&nbsp; In other words, the blank cells (missing work) is making many students fail!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the steps to convert the blank cells to UNUSED cells in calculation of students points. Thank you!</p>

</p><p>I will reply with the exact formula after I get home.&nbsp; (My school work spreadsheet is on my laptop at home.&nbsp; Thought that I attached that Excel sheet to an email message, but I can not locate it in my email.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the most of the Excel cells have point values; then, a few columns total points....and divide the total earned by total points ATTEMPTED.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
BUT WHEN THE CELLS ARE BLANK, I WANT TO OMIT THOSE CELLS FROM THE CALCULATIONS COMPLETELY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need the exact formula, I will send it today when I get home. </p>

</p><p>Does the above information help at this point?&nbsp; &nbsp;Please let me know. Thank you.</p>

            The exact formulas are better. Better yet, can you save a non-confidential copy of the file to OneDrive and post the link here? Then I can go into the file and see what is happening.

<p>Unsure how to make the file "unconfidential" and how to allow you access to my OneDrive and post the link there. I will do my best to do so.&nbsp; If at all possible, I would really like to get this issue resolved today.&nbsp; (Students' grades are due tomorrow...and
 this influences&nbsp; grade calculations. I will send it asap, probably just before 5:00 pm.&nbsp; I hope that you are available after 5:00 pm today.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can give me a guiding tip on how to make file "unconfidential" and save to OneDrive and allow you access, that would be great!&nbsp; I've used OneDrive before, but not often.&nbsp; And I do not recall how to make a OneDrive file accessible to someone.&nbsp; Is that
 done through email message...after saving to OneDrive?</p>

</p><p>By non-confidential I mean don't include anything in the file that you don't want the rest of the world to&nbsp;be able to see, since once you post a link to a file here, anyone can click that link and view the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Perhaps this will help you in the meantime.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you are calculating the average by using a sum formula to total points and then dividing by the&nbsp;total&nbsp;number of cells, blank cells will influence the average, which is what you don't want. I am assuming you are using something like this which

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I am guessing that the formula should be Total Points EARNED divided by Total Points ATTEMPTED.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the Excel blank cells are completely ignored...that means, blank cells are NOT taken as "zero", but just not included in the calculation.</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If the issue persists you could try to capture a user mode dump of the crash and see if any further useful information can be obtained on the crash.
<br />
<br />You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.
<br />
<br />If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as iedump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file at the time iexplore.exe crashes should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]
<br />"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\
<br />00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00
<br />
<br />
<br />After Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />More info on collecting user-mode dumps:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181</a>(VS.85).aspx
<br />
<br />To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />
<br />[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]
<br />
<br />You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.

<p>Internet Explorer on windows 10 build 1903 18362.1 will crash until it upgrades to Windows 10 Build 1903 18362.145 is fully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another thing is to ensure it is configured right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now depending on the site you are visiting most common issue is Internet page will lock up and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better off in that case copying the link and opening Edge paste the link there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the same crashes happen in google too o ditched google long ago due to the amount of crappy ads that was using up my month downloads and I never gone back to it since glad I did computers running hell better and my monthly usage is down by 40 percent.</p>

<p>The dump file shows that modules associated to printing are being "unloaded" such as the printui.dll and&nbsp; prntvpt.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, from a Debug Diag analysis this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>prncache!PrintCache::Store::CacheStore::RegistryMonitor::MonitorRegistryChanges+195</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>prncache!PrintCache::Store::CacheStore::RegistryMonitor::MonitorRegistryChangesThreadProc+43</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are two loaded HP modules :</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;hpcui190.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>hpmdp190.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>These modules may be a component of the HP Universal Print Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this driver installed or another HP printer driver and is the driver installed on all computers having the issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so can you drag the hpcui190.dll and hpmdp190.dll out of the&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3 folder to another location such as the Desktop then log out and log back in again and see if the same error still occurs.<br />

                    after installing this latest preview, my hard drive became dysfunctional, to the point of seizure meaning it fried. Have the technicians repaired this flaw in the new preview?

            HD's or SSD's wont fry with software issues. Highly doubtful. That may happen with GPU or CPU (software voltage regulators). That's it.

<p>Can you explain what makes you think that the failure is the direct result of the previous build? &nbsp;Was it correlation of timing, something specific in terms of an error, or something else? &nbsp;Are you certain that there was causation, not just coincidental
 correlation with a normal hardware failure (like an older hard drive)? Did you report the issue as a bug through Feedback Hub?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, how did you recover from the failure? &nbsp;Were you able to recover the hard drive, or did you replace it with a new one? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask, because I don't recall any other reports of associated hard drive failure, and it would be an extremely unlikely scenario in any case. More likely *might* be a case where the data on the drive became highly fragmented - however, that wouldn't likely
 make you think the drive had seized. &nbsp;</p>

<p>you are indeed right, I do not have the expertise, nor the technical equipment to analize the former hdd.&nbsp; But, the local Granby technician does have that equipment, and he is the one who told me , my hdd had seized. now if you look at the insider preview
 records you will note, that I did download a new preview a few days earlier. (that would be last month, since I had to wait to get the necessary funds to do this major repair on this Hp laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it the programming of the new preview, or did something happen with the new preview in regards to my Microsoft visual studio 2015-16&nbsp; set up, once again, I do not know. If Microsoft wants to examine my hdd, I would be happy to send it over, for analysis
 to get to the bottom of this question.</p>

<p>Highly unlikely,&nbsp;impossible even, that any OS would 'fry' HDD's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the wording used, such as <em>dysfunctional, seizure, fried</em>. Are these your words or are they what the technician himself used? Reason I ask is it sounds like you have been given incorrect information / explanation from this technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be more likely that the HDD had some kind of pre-existing issue that became detrimental, possibly the read / writes to the HDD simply reached its MTBF. Bad sectors could even be responsible for the death of the HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you noticed odd behaviour from your HDD over the past 6 months or less? It could even come down to the I/O controller, power supply, rail voltages could have been faulty also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the technician&nbsp;try to update the HDD firmware, which in turn failed, which could have killed the HDD, this is can be recoverable though, in some instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit 12 May 2017</p>
<p>You also mention and I quote "<em>is it the programming of the new preview, or did something happen with the new preview in regards to my Microsoft visual studio 2015-16&nbsp; set up, once again, I do not know. If Microsoft wants to examine my hdd, I would be
 happy to send it over, for analysis to get to the bottom of this question.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you talking about your HDD being 'fried' by the OS or are you talkin about the Visual Studio software setup being fried by the OS? They are completely two separate issues, the HDD is&nbsp;a hardware issue and the Visual Studio is a software issue, as you
 can see, a lot of us are asking for more details and nothing is being provided from you.</p>

The preview did not fry your HDD. That is a very idiotic thing to say.

            As you only want replies from MS employees, suggest that you post in the Feedback Hub as this forum is manned mainly by unpaid volunteers who are not employed by Microsoft, as you posted no info about your system, make and model of the HDD, it is hard
 for anyone (including Microsoft) &nbsp;to give you a proper answer.

<p>yes indeed I try to incorporate meaning to my phrases, but sometimes I do get carried away...anyways back to subject:&nbsp;</p>
<p>the local technician said it was not normal failure due to age of the hdd, even his equipment could not extract any data on it. It could not be formatted either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the other hand, I personally do chkdsk very often in administrator mode so I dont think it would be cause of bad sectors.</p>

<h2>            Lumia back cover stains.</h2>
                    Hello, good people!<br />
Its just couple of days since I bought Lumia 620. And already I,can see stains building up on my phones back cover. These I guess are due to sweat and they appear slightly yellow on my white phone.<br />
<br />
Before posting I browsed through Nokia FAQ and one of it suggested,using eraser. I tried but it did not help. Has anyone faced same problem and found solution to it too??

<p>As a short term solution prior to replacing it you could try method advocated here, although I expect casing would discoulour even faster afterwards so would be

            we don't have that kind of information here, as we are only a user to user forum for Nokia products and services. you will need to liaise with your nearest Nokia Care location directly.

<h2>            Purpose of &#34;Share with Everyone&#34; folder in OneDrive in 2018</h2>
                    I understand from reading other posts that the "Share with Everyone" folder would no longer be available to new users after 2018. Our business activated OneDrive in 2017, and the "Share with Everyone" folder still appears. My question is in 2018 does this
 folder function differently&nbsp; than my other folders in OneDrive? In other words, can my colleagues see this folder if I don't give them access to it in the standard OneDrive way?&nbsp; Thank you in advance.

<h2>            Problem signing in outlook.com a&#47;c aka hotmail - asking for code verification &#40;sms&#41; using google chrome</h2>
                    A few weeks/months ago I was asked to confirm my outlook.com a/c aka hotmail - which sent a verification code to my cellular phone.<br />
<br />
Now I am asked the same again (after fiddling with settings) - however no sms received and hence cannot sign in (I press the I have a code link, see attachment)<br />
<br />
If I switch to other browser (Opera or Firefox), I am able to sign in without this code...<br />
<br />
The x-notifier extension for Outlook has also stopped working since Monday (on both Chrome and Firefox). Any help to any of these issues most welcome. Today I was going to revert to old Outlook.com - to see if that would solve the x-notifier problem. However,
 could not find any such option in the settings - instead I am now asked about sms code - which do not work... (correct mobile no). I am running windows 7 on one client and win 10 on another. Same problems on both clients...<br />

            I did a test on another win10/chrome client - which worked without this code verification problem. So I decided to run CC Cleaner to start from fresh - which resolved above issue - it seems.

<h2>            Not able to open Outlook files which appear in the Windows search results anymore</h2>
                    Previously I could easily search in the Windows "Search programs and files" not only in documents but also in emails, and open these emails from within the search results.&nbsp;
<div>Since a couple of days however, the icon representing the Outlook files has changed from the typical Outlook icon to the blue Windows Live (?) icon, and when clicking on the item, nothing happens. (whereas previously you simply opened the email itself....).
 Attached is a screenshot of the situation: see the blueish icons in front of the search results.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even though this seems like a detail, this does have an important impact as it renders the Windows Search pretty much useless.</div>
<div>
<div>How can this be corrected?</div>
<div>The default programs and file associations seem to be ok (Outlook as the default client for all emails)</div>

<p>Hi Hans,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The icon displaying in the screenshot provided is for Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>Which version of Outlook are you using, is it Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Outlook 2010, then ensure there are no other versions of Office installed on the computer.</p>
<p>Click <font>
Control Panel,</span> open <span style="font-weight: bold">Programs and Features.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not use Office 2013, then you may run the fixit from the following link to completely remove all traces of Office 2013 installation files:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501/en-us</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the Office 2013 is removed, you may repair Office 2010 installation files following the steps from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now search for the Outlook items in the Windows explorer and verify the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance and I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello Aravinda,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks to your suggestions I indeed discovered that I'm having a mix of Office 2010 and Office 2013 for the following reason: I was using Office 2010 as a fat client on my PC. I'm also having Exchange online (the Outlook component of Office 365), for which
 I'm using my installed Outlook 2010 as a client. Since last week, I activated Lync as part of the Office 365 license. Due to this activation, the Lync 2013 client had been installed on my PC which probably cause the icons to change in the Office 2013 icons.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So this means that - if I were to uninstall Office 2013, I wouldn't be able to use Lync anymore.&nbsp;</div>
<div>What's the solution taking this situation into account?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hans</div>

            This has now occurred to me following install of the free OneNote 2013. &nbsp;I have no other 2013 components, and am running Office 2010. &nbsp;Now all e-mails appear with 2013 icons, and will not preview or open in Windows Search. &nbsp;2010 Excel files are not impacted.
 &nbsp;How do I uncross 2013 with my Outlook 2010?

<h2>            Re-installing Outlook 2010 without the original stand alone CD</h2>
                    <p><span>After getting a blue screen of death on my PC, I reinstalled Windows 10 64-bit and MS Office XP professional. I originally had a separate Outlook 2010 disk with product code but cannot find it. I am trying to install Outlook by copying and pasting

<p><span>If I try to install Outlook from the MS Office XP disc I get a message saying</span></p>
<p><span>“ Cannot start Microsoft Outlook.Outlook requires Microsoft Express 4.01 or greater.” When, a instructed, I try to run IE5Setup.exe from the IE5 folder on my CD I get a message saying that my computer is already running a later version,
</span></p>
<p><span>Any suggestions? Is there some way to download a Outlook 2010 stand alone disc and use my product key to install it?
</span></p>

<p>OfficeXP went out of support some years ago, so no security updates or bug fixes, which means your system will be wide open to exploits. Its also not fully compatible with Win10, hence the IE error msgs, so uninstall OfficeXp, if you can :(</p>
<p>You cannot copy outlook.exe, well you can, but you wont be able to run the program</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook.com too slow in updating new messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is this a flaw in the 'new' outlook???</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get better clarification on this please answer the questions below.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the version of Windows and Internet Explorer that you are using?</li><li>Is the issue is specific browser or all the browser?</li><li>If you are using Internet Explorer, Have you installed latest updates for Internet Explorer?</li><li>Do you have fast internet connection (to the computer)?</li></ol>
<p>Let me share some information about Outlook.com (webmail).</p>
<ul>
<li>There might be a problem with the server which you try to login to your outlook.com email.
</li><li>It might be the issue with the browser that you are using.</li><li>Also it might be because of the internet connection speed.</li></ul>
<p>There is no current issue with outlook.com currently. I would advise you to check the status of your account by going to this link
<a href="https://status.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://status.live.com</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try to optimize Internet Explorer and check whether you have the same issue.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not specific to any browser. I have used Internet Explorer 11, Google Chrome and Safari and the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Internet connection is fine as everything else works fine (we have a cloud based booking system which works fine on our connection &amp; my personal emails work fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is definitely with Outlook because all other programs work fine. The problem is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have our outlook account and we also have our second email account which is forwarded to our outlook account. This second email account takes 3-4hours to show new emails yet on my phone it updates instantly. This is not an issue with the email provider
 (123reg) because we receive the emails on our phones. The problem is with Outlook that takes forever to update new emails from our second email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have a look at this and get it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have now been advised by MICROSOFT technicians that this is a known issue and forwarded messages take a long time to come through.</p>
<p>

    <title>copy &#47; paste into read-only table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lenny33  say:</h3>
<h2>            copy &#47; paste into read-only table</h2>
                    <p>I have a read-only form with editable areas which include a six column table.&nbsp; I have highlighted each row, including end-of-cell markers and made editable.&nbsp; I cannot copy and paste multiple rows of copy, but if I copy and paste one row at a time the text
 gets pasted in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the way it is supposed to work?&nbsp; I don't want to copy in the rows, only the contents.&nbsp; Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Old dog... new tricks</p>

            I'm assuming this is document restriction selected in the Restrict Formatting and Editing task pane? In that case, what you are seeing is by design. When you specify editable areas of a restricted document, it only applies to the text, not to table cells
 or other "text containers."

<h2>            What was fixed in the new 10041 build</h2>
                    <p>As there is no official changelog here</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me:</p>
<p>1. Start menu: Drag and drop apps from the left column to the "tiles" area in addition to "pin to start" - yes<br />
2. Search is working with "autohide" option of Task Bar</p>
<p>3. Wake from deep sleep (zero core) of the AMD 290 adapter - partially.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wakes up now but wallpaper is not displayed correctly. &nbsp;It seems that wallpaper was drawn at the resolution of the secondary display. Snipping tool does not capture the screen correctly in this situation.</p>

            <p>Where did you get the device? If it has reset protection on it the only way I know is to have the original owner&nbsp;turn it off. As far as I know there is no way for you to get that info (who the owner was) unless you were given that info from where you purchased
 it. Hopefully they have it and can assist you.</p>

            <p>I had this same problem with the program refusing to open and it telling me to go and repair it, but now i&nbsp;just fixed it a few minutes ago after days of trying. I did the repair and it still wouldn't open. I went to uninstall MS Word Starter from the control
 panel and it said it was already running so it couldn't, though it didn't show it as running. I shut down completely hoping to sever that link. I re-booted and tried to uninstall and it worked. I then clicked on the Microsoft Office 2010 icon in my task bar
 that usually gives me the choice to buy the full version, but this time it also had the option to INSTALL the MS Word Starter 2010! So i re-installed it and everything works fine again *cross fingers*. Good luck!</p>

            I am getting the same message. This happened after I installed updates for some reason. There is no choice to repair when I go to the control panel. So if I un-install it , will I still be able to re-install it ? Where do I find the program after uninstalling?
