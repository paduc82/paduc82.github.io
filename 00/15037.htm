<h2>            A virus I can&#39;t locate&#33; Endless pop-up ads, slowing down the system</h2>
                    My computer has contracted a virus that none of my firewalls and virus protections seem to be able to deal with, or even detect it (I use avast, tried avira as well, and now adwcleaner for this specific problem). I accidentally clicked on some side-bar
 ad a few days ago and this has been bothering me ever since: the ads pop up, first on the left bar, then at the bottom and on the right side, and if I have multiple tabs open, they pop up on every tab and start playing videos. New tabs also open up (more ads)
 all the time. <br />
<br />
I've been using firefox, which is where I first detected the problem, and when I tried using chrome the virus immediately spread to there as well. Every time I scan and clean the browsers with adwcleaner, this is the report I get afterwards:
<br />
<br />
Could somebody please help me solving this thing? It's slowing down my computer a lot and I have no idea what to do :/<br />

            I've never seen any "report" like that when using AdwCleaner.

<div>Since you did not identify the specific adware I recommend you try all of the steps in this guide - the procedures and tools are free. &nbsp; Suggest you run AdwCleaner again following the directions in the guide.</div>

<h2>            Unable to Insert shapes into PowerPoint 2010 slide</h2>
                    Hello, I have PowerPoint-10 under Windows 7 and am trying to edit a slide I created four months ago on the same PC, but I cannot now insert any shapes. When I use Insert/Shapes in Normal View&nbsp;and select a shape, then drag the shape, all I get is the dashed
 line outline box with handles, which immediately disappears, but not the shape itself, even on a slide with shapes previously inserted. Same problem on all other slides in this deck. &nbsp;If I add a new slide to this deck, same problem. If I create a new file,
 it works correctly. Any help appreciated! Thanks!

<p>Hello Pam,<br />
<br />
<br />
The time it takes to upload pictures usually depends on the combined file size and your Internet speed. To isolate the issue, we'll need to ask clarifying questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the total size of the pictures being uploaded?</li><li>Can you see the progress of the upload? If yes, is it stuck?</li><li>Are the pictures being uploaded from your hard drive, or from OneDrive?</li><li>Are you uploading the pictures through the Sway app, or web?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>We've seen some users report this bug with the Windows Photo app and they are looking into it.&nbsp; In the meantime, one thing you can do is go directly to Sway (either the Sway Windows app or sway.com) and try creating it directly from in there.&nbsp; I know this
 isn't necessarily the answer you were looking for, but I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I don't know what the total size is.&nbsp; Where would I find this?</p>
<p>No I cannot see the progress of the upload.&nbsp; When I click on the upload icon nothing happens.&nbsp; All the other icons (share, slideshow, edit, etc) are highlighted when I hover over them.&nbsp; Not so for the upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pictures are being uploaded from the hard drive. &nbsp; &nbsp; Question: if I delete them from hard drive might this solve the issue?</p>
<p>Not sure about the last question. &nbsp; Since I was not on the web when doing this I will say Sway app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really had no reason to want to upload to Sway other than to see what it was all about. &nbsp; Very sorry I did this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I am still having this issue after several weeks I would say the upload is stuck.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>cannot use table field name &#34;Version&#34; in a report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rasmus8  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot use table field name &#34;Version&#34; in a report</h2>
                    I have a table/query which includes a field named "Version".<br />
<br />
When I try to use it in a Report, I always get the value 14.0 (which is the Access 2010 Version number) rather than my data value.<br />
<br />
My specific problem was that I had a design that was working fine (for years), but I decided to rename a field from XxxxVersion to just Version.&nbsp; This field is used to limit records being displayed in sub-reports contained in a report.&nbsp; When I changed the name,
 all my sub-report data disappeared from the main report.&nbsp; Took some time to pin it down to my data "Version" value being replaced with the Access Version.<br />
<br />
I cannot find anywhere that refers to any kind of Reserved word/field name restrictions in Access.<br />
<br />
This appears to be a bug (and I can't believe I just found this - 'Version' is a pretty common field name!)<br />
<br />
So what am I missing?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and use [Version] instead of Version, to tell the program that you're explicitly referring to a fieldname rather than to a property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoiding the reserved words (and there are a lot of them, and Microsoft doesn't do anything to protect you from using them!) is a prudent strategy.</p>

            Thanks...&nbsp; that is the list was looking for.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe MS doesn't publish/maintain such a list (if they do, I couldn't find it!)<br />
<br />
I always use the [Version] format...&nbsp; didn't help in this case.<br />
<br />
I also cannot find written anywhere that 'Version' is a "reserved" field name.&nbsp; And it should NOT be, either.&nbsp; One would think/expect the heirarch of search would start with user-defined fields, and end with a Microsoft hidden/system/reserved field as a last
 report for assigning a value.<br />
<br />
I already knew how to get around the problem, but I reported it anyway.&nbsp; Curious to see if anyone else has reported this - couldn't find anything anywhere.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned, this IS A BUG!<br />

            <p>Every once in a while, someone comes across a common word that is also the name of an access property/method/function name or VBA/SQL key word.&nbsp; Version is a property of both the Access and DAO libraries so it's no surprise you got that result.&nbsp; A long time
 ago I estimated that there were upwards of a thousand English words that are "reserved" and as a consequence, I try to make it a habit to never use a real word for the name of anything I create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That list on Allen's web site includes a utility that checks if a word is in his (not MS's) list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I definitely agree with you that MS should at least publish a list of all reserved words in the libraries that are commonly included in Access applications.&nbsp; But, I suspect that they don't even know&nbsp;how to find out what all&nbsp;of them are without making a major
 project out of it, especially when there is no definition of the set of common libraries.</p>

<h2>            Format pane does not show on right side of screen for graphics</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word version 15.32 on a Mac. In previous versions, when I double clicked on a image, the Format Pane would appear on the right side of the Word window. This does work any longer. Instead, I noticed there is a button (Picture Effects) in the Picture
 Format toolbar. OK, that is great, but when I go into the Shadow submenu and choose Shadow options, nothing happens. Any ideas?</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 90px">Here is how I have fixed these in the past. You have only 2 ways you might be able to fix this. THe 2nd Option is to open up a ticket with Microsoft because the only full proof way it will get fixed is by Microsoft running a process
 on the backend that will reProvision it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">The other thing you can try before this is doing these steps.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">1. Have the user log out</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">2. Login as an admin, go the users License and uncheck "SharePoint Online" , "ODFB", Office Online check box. So basically you are removing the license for these services for the user.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">3. Go to the SharePoint Admin Center, click on "User Profies",click "Manage User Profile".</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">4 Do a search for the user, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">5. Once you find the user, hover your mouse over the users account and you will see a little drop down arrow on the right. Use the Dropdown and choose "Delete". This will delete the users SharePoint Profile (Also ODFB profile)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">6. Now you wait for about 1hr (do not log back into that account&nbsp; for at least 1hr.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">7. After 1hr, login to the portal as an admin, and go to the Active Users again, find the user and add the license back for the services you removed earlier.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">Now, once the user logs back in, the services will reprovision.&nbsp; This should fix it, if it does not, the only other option you have is open a ticket with Microsoft and have them fix it on the backend</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Cannot open hyperlinks within emails</h2>
                    If someone emails me a hyperlink within an email I was always able to open it by just clicking on it. However, since installing the newest version of Office applications including Outlook on Windows 10 I can't open hyperlinks in emails anymore.&nbsp; My only
 option to view the page is to select "copy hyperlink" then paste the address in your browser's address bar.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; Anyone else having the same issues?

    <title>Print Selection grayed out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul domaskis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Selection grayed out</h2>
                    <p>I want to print only selected object(s).&nbsp; The Print Selection is grayed out regardless of whether I selected an equation, a chart object, or a simple rectangle.&nbsp; Of course, it is also grayed out when a grouped collection of such things is selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would cause the Print Selection to be grayed out?&nbsp; Is it normally unavailable in Powerpoint?&nbsp; If so, why is it in the dropdown list?&nbsp; I noticed that it isn't grayed out so long as nothing is selected...what a teaser.&nbsp; Software developer humour?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afternote: A workaround if you have Adobe Pro is to print the entire slide, ensuring that the whole slide is blank except for the objects of interest.&nbsp; You can then crop away the white space.&nbsp; You might be able to use other PDF manipulation tools as well.&nbsp;
 How easy it is in Adobe Pro also depends on the version, I suspect, as well as on the PDF writer used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, it was a chart I wanted from Excel.&nbsp; After pasting it into powerpoint and inserting a math forumla as one of the axis titles, I printed the otherwise blank slide to PDF.&nbsp; When cropping the PDF, I could not take advantage of the Adobe's 1-click
 checkbox to crop away white space.&nbsp; The cropping had to be manually adjusted.&nbsp; I was using PDF 24 as the writer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I print the chart directly to PDF from Excel, Adobe's 1-click cropping of margin white space worked.&nbsp; Fortunately, I found that I *could* print directly from Excel because Excel had the same equation creation tool so Powerpoint became an unnecessary
 step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that when printing from Excel, I had to plunk the chart and formula into a temporary worksheet, then print that worksheet in isolation. This is because (surprise) I could not Print Selection when the chart and equation objects were selected. That option
 was grayed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your situation may differ, of course.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone, though.&nbsp; Save them an entire blooming evening.</p>

            Print Selection means "Print the slides I've selected" ... it doesn't print the selected shapes.
<div><br />
<div>So if you haven't selected at least one or more slides, the option will be grayed out. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And if no shapes are selected, then from PPT's point of view, the current selection is the current slide ...and with a slide selected, you DO get the Print Selected option. &nbsp;</div>

            <span>Which printer are you using?<br />
<br />
As per the logs, it should be an printer issue(HP printer).<br />
<br />
Check the steps below to add an virtual printer and set as default:<br />
Click Start | Control Panel | Printers and Faxes. If you do not see Control Panel after you click Start, click Start | Settings | Control Panel | Printers and Faxes.<br />
On the Printers and Faxes window, double-click Add a Printer.<br />
On the Add Printer Wizard window, click Next.<br />
On the Local or Network window, check Local printer attached to this computer and uncheck Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer. Click Next to continue.<br />
On the Select a Printer Port window, select FILE: (Print to File) from the Use the following port: drop-down list. Click Next to continue.<br />
On the Install Printer Software window, click Generic from the Manufacturer pane. Click Generic / Text Only from the Printers pane. Click Next to continue.<br />
On the Name Your Printer window, use the Generic / Text Only printer name in the Printer name: field. In the Do you want to use this printer as the default printer field, click No. Click Next to continue.<br />
On the Printer Sharing window, click Do not share this printer. Click Next to continue.<br />
On the Print Test Page window, click No. You do not want to print a text page. Click Next to continue.<br />
Click Finish to finish adding your printer. <br />
Right click on it and set as default printer<br />
<br />
Now try checking if it works fine?<br />
<br />
If it works fine, then uninstall the complete printer software and then logon to HP printer website.<br />
Download the full package of the printer based on the MODEL of the printer.<br />

    <title>Obtaining a dump of old email account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter schaafsma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Obtaining a dump of old email account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the early 2000s, I had a hotmail address: &lt;<em>PII removed by a moderator</em>&gt; that I also used as my MSN login account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It some point, I wasn't using it anymore, and I suppose it got hacked or deleted, as I couldn't gain access to it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to obtain access to, or a dump of the data in that account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing of any value, purely for nostalgic reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have, aside from my passport name matching that of the account, is the password it had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter J. Schaafsma</p>

            When was the last time you logged into your account with a browser?&nbsp; Accounts are marked as inactive and the data deleted if you do not sign into them at least once per year, and unless you made the back up that Microsoft recommended when you signed up
 for the email address, the data is gone because, like you, the online servers are not backed up

            <p>Hi kunwalmalik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you left your emails on the deleted folder of your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend that you try auto recovery again to try to recover the deleted emails from your account. I would like you to know that emails on the deleted folder will automatically be deleted after 5 days so any emails on your deleted folder that you want
 to keep should be moved to another folder on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you have other questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

            Hi Johan,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. I had recovered approximately 3000 emails over a week ago, and left them in the deleted folder thinking it will take me time to sort them out. Yesterday I checked my email account and saw everything disappeared. I tried to recover
 them again, unfortunately couldn't recover them as it came blank. Is there anyway I can recover them again?</div>

<p>
</p><p>...When I set up my Outlook.com account, I used my Gmail account email address. My Gmail account is my primary email application. But now I would like to use my Outlook.com account, but I cannot locate my Outlook email address when I log into my Outlook
 account. Just so we're clear---I want to use my Outlook.com email account wholly separate from my current Gmail account. For example, if I send an email from my Outlook account, the recipient will see my Outlook.com email address (whatever that may be) and
 not my Gmail account. &nbsp;Is that possible? If not, why not? &nbsp;I looked through the Support page, but I still don't understand how Outlook.com works&nbsp;<span>because it seems to be linked to my Gmail account, but none of my Gmail emails get pushed to my Outlook.com
 account, so I don't get it. &nbsp;I'm very confused...&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Submit data from list box in userform, Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toffleb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Submit data from list box in userform, Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to Visual Basic and need to get a form together quickly without learning all of the basics. Everything I can find is either very specific template examples that don't work for me, or tutorials that assume you know too much, or basic-level tutorials
 that don't explain everything I need. Also I'm on a Mac, so all of the shortcuts/menus described for PC mean it takes me another 10 minutes for every step to try to find where the option is on my version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a user form with a list box, and managed to get all of the values I need into the box. It's a long list of phrases. I have a "submit" button and a "cancel" button below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About halfway through my form, which is currently a .docm, I need the user to be able to call up this box, select multiple entries from the list, click "submit," and have the phrases appear in the right place on the form. I'm stuck at two places:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do I call up the box? I actually had this one but managed to delete it while trying to fix something else, and can't get back there now. The way I had it before was I think a little macro in a module so that when the user moves through the form, pressing
 Tab, and lands on the right text box, the form came up. A button to open it manually would also be fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do I make the selections from the list box enter into the document?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm about to tear my hair out, hope someone can help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To make your UserForm appear when the end user either clicks directly or "tabs" to your document based form control you need to set the Run macro on Entry parameter on the forms Option control with the name of your Macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4ffe677-1042-456b-9e2f-02c7e79e4110" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The VBA coding for your UserForm needs to have private routines that look something like this:</p>
<p>
<strong>Private Sub CloseButton_Click()</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unload Me</strong><br />
<strong>End Sub</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Private Sub SubmitButton_Click()</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim i As Integer</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = 0 To Me.ListBox1.ListCount - 1</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Me.ListBox1.Selected(i) = True Then</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If i &lt; Me.ListBox1.ListCount - 1 Then</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.FormFields("Text1").Result = _</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.FormFields("Text1").Result &amp; Me.ListBox1.List(i) &amp; vbCr</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Else</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.FormFields("Text1").Result = _</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.FormFields("Text1").Result &amp; Me.ListBox1.List(i)</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; End If</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unload Me</strong><br />
<strong>End Sub</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; With Me.ListBox1</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .AddItem "Red"</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .AddItem "White"</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .AddItem "Blue"</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</strong><br />
<strong>End Sub</strong><br />
</p><p>
</p><p>The UserForm_Initialize routine loads the list items and the SubmitButton routine takes what the end user has selected and puts it into the document form as if the end user had typed it. This is just one crude example of how it would work and hopefully you
 will be able to customize the SubmitButton routine to meet your specific needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally you need a public subroutine in a VBA module that displays the UserForm. This is the subroutine that you list in the Entry Marco setting for the document form.</p>
<p>
<strong>Option Explicit</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Sub RunUserForm()</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim frmUserForm As New UserForm1</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; frmUserForm.Show</strong><br />
<strong>End Sub</strong><br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully this gets you on your way to completing your project.</p>

<h2>            Repairing corrupt Word Document orginally saved from USB stick</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Is it possible to repair a corrupt word document that was orginally saved in Pen Drive. I have tried a number of things&nbsp;to recover or repair the documents as it is really important. I have scan the pen drive for problems but&nbsp; it appears to be fine, have
 tried checking for problems through prompt command, open and repair, coverting the file to another format. Finally I took it to a repair shop and they were unable to repair or recover anything. Im still skeptical about the repair shop because they told me
 they have repair some files however when I got home non of the files were repaired or recovered. Im not keen to approach them again as they were extremely rude and unhelpful.</p>
<p>please help</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it looks like that is a throughly messed up file. I tried several things with no luck at all other than messages that boiled down&nbsp;"WTF is this monstrocity are you asking me to open ..."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;My guess is that as I said earlier, a big chunk of the file was truncated, probably including the body&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>I know this is the proverbial horse and the barn door ..., but&nbsp;here are a couple of macros that help you create backup copies easily:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t accept password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> computerlady143  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t accept password</h2>
                    <p>Originally I was just going to download Windows 10 upgrade but not install yet. When I click the download it said it would give me the option of installing immediately or schedule for later. &nbsp;Well I was working on another computer and got busy. &nbsp;Hours later
 Looked up and it had already upgraded. Now I can't log in or switch to the other account on the computer. &nbsp;I assuming the problem is that since the upgrade ran on its own, there is no Microsoft Account assigned for the password or if there is &nbsp;don't know what
 it is. I have tried the password for the account when it was Windows 7 Home Premium. &nbsp;I booted up with a DVD and see I can their is a Windows Directory and a Windows old directory. I have an anxious grandson wanting to play on his computer. Eventually I like
 just to reinstall Windows 10 as full installation and not an upgrade. It may not be finished because the bottom right has "Next"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks In Advance!!!</p>

            Are you using the public build or the Preview build? as you have posted in the Preview section which is for testing of new builds of window10, as for it loading on it's own someone had to click ok for it to load...just saying!

            Actually not true. &nbsp;I was the only one here and was letting it download and was surprised to see it loaded on it own. I assuming I had so long to make the decision before it downloaded on its own. &nbsp;I assume it not the preview load. &nbsp;It the whatever I get
 when I click on the screen that keeps popping up to get you to upgrade.

</p><p>I might roll back to before the upgrade.... install&nbsp;win10 again later when more prepared.&nbsp; Looks like I might remove my password for the next install of it :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you access the repair environment it has an option to&nbsp;go back to&nbsp; the previous operating system link and rolls back to the prior win7 version using win.old and the saved old files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer will go into the repair environment automatically if you&nbsp;crash it 3x in a row.... on my laptop I just push &amp; hold the power button after I see the bios screen complete twice and on the third attempt to start windows automatically&nbsp;starts up the
 repair environment where you can&nbsp;choose to return to previous operating system as your password isn't working for some reason.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks I will try this got busy. &nbsp;Also, this is exactly what I wanted to do so that I can have a copy because I have another laptop can't upgrade yet &nbsp;because I have a program that is not compatible with Windows 10 and it free now. &nbsp;Also, I prefer to do
 clean installations and not upgrades. Is the F8 key for safe mode available in Windows 10? &nbsp;I originally was just trying to download Windows 10 and not install it yet.</p>

<p>Originally I was just going to download Windows 10 upgrade but not install yet. When I click the download it said it would give me the option of installing immediately or schedule for later. &nbsp;Well I was working on another computer and got busy. &nbsp;Hours later
 Looked up and it had already upgraded. Now I can't log in or switch to the other account on the computer. &nbsp;I assuming the problem is that since the upgrade ran on its own, there is no Microsoft Account assigned for the password or if there is &nbsp;don't know what
 it is. I have tried the password for the account when it was Windows 7 Home Premium. &nbsp;I booted up with a DVD and see I can their is a Windows Directory and a Windows old directory. I have an anxious grandson wanting to play on his computer. Eventually I like
 just to reinstall Windows 10 as full installation and not an upgrade. It may not be finished because the bottom right has "Next"</p>

</p><p>Hi @computerlady143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Microsoft Account assigned. If you read the entire message about Restarting the Computer to Install the upgrade, there were two times Restart Now or to pick a time to restart. If you did not choose a time, then the Computer restarts when the time
 arrives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process does not change any existing User Accounts, including bad ones, and the passwords remain the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do need to click on Sign In, if no password is assigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you installing on top of Windows 7? You were probably installing Windows 10 Pro either 32-Bit or 64-Bit Build 10586, the Public Release of Windows 10.</p>

                    I recently changed my Microsoft password. I then opened Outlook 2016, entered the new password when prompted, but it is still not syncing. I just get the message at the bottom of the screen saying it is trying to connect. When I got into Account Settings
 to try and re-enter the password, it doesn't give me the option. I have also tried signing out of my Microsoft account and signing back in. Outlook is syncing fine on my phone and on Outlook.com and all other Office apps are syncing as well.&nbsp;

    <title>Back and forth with Pages and Word makes pictures blurry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slinger84098  say:</h3>
<h2>            Back and forth with Pages and Word makes pictures blurry</h2>
                    I don't think it's different at all. The problem is importing documents containing images created in something else and then saving them in MS 11 and having them become blurry. &nbsp; She has an insert that becomes blurry when she saves a document that was
 created in another program in MS11 she saves it and so did I. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had documents created in both Word X and Pages that had images inserted into them. I converted the Pages document into word format and then opened in in Word 11. &nbsp;When I saved that document in Word 11 format and then opened it up again, all of the images
 were blurry, even though they were clear when they were first opened in Word 11. &nbsp; The same thing happened when I opened a Word X document with images in Word 11. &nbsp;It opened fine until I saved it as a .docx Word 11 document. &nbsp;Then when I opened the saved .docx
 again, the images were blurry. &nbsp;I didn't do that with a PDF because I haven't figured out exactly how she did that, but the result is basically the same.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;When I used the "convert document" selection prior to saving it in MS 11, it solved my problem of having the images becoming blurry when they are saved. &nbsp;Perhaps using the same procedure would keep her documents and the images she exported into them clear
 when she saves them. &nbsp;She stated that she's still dealing with images: &nbsp;"I made a nice image in another program that I then I exported into PDF.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I insert the PDF into the word document (using Insert --&gt; Object), the image is clear and nice. But when
 I save the document it turns blurry." &nbsp;It sounds just like what I was doing. &nbsp;Her problem is dealing with Word 11, not dealing with PDF's.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's worth a try. &nbsp;It worked for me. &nbsp;What could it hurt? &nbsp;I don't need to start another thread because I have already found a scenario that works for me. &nbsp;I didn't think it would hurt to share it.</div>

            <p>Your problem is VERY different. PDF is not an image format. You are talking about inserting IMAGES, not PDF files. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The question you are responding to involves PDF files that contain images, not images themselves. You should not try to hijack someone else's problem because some symptoms are the same. Please start a new question with steps to reproduce, version level,
 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your question is about doing something other than inserting a PDF that contains an image. People who are looking for solutions to the PDF problem should not have to wade through the solution to your IMAGES problem.</p>
