<h2>            Absent Messages &#40;&#40;urgent&#41;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm at a loss here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I exported chat history from Skype v 7 on my Mac, and while it seems to be all there, a lot of it is also completely missing. When I go into a chat, hoping to find a series of messages or one in particular, it's just not there. None of my recent messages
 are present, either. Some from the very beginning, but that's all. Where are my messages? How can I find what I'm looking for again? Or is it all lost in the void of cyber-space? I'm desperately searching for a string of messages in one conversation, but they
 aren't around. Please, please help.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/030735e5-225e-4d39-9350-5c32fe9186a3" title="WinnyPiffPuff">
<p>
</p><p>According to the FAQ in <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/updating-to-the-latest-version-of-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Updating to the latest version of Skype</a>, you will be able to access your chat history from the past one year. History older than a year will be stored locally on your device and can be exported to an&nbsp;HTML file. The HTML file that has been exported will
 only show your chat history up until the date you have&nbsp;upgraded&nbsp;to Skype 8. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;the words and phrases would not show any of the results, it is better to re-export the chat history again from Skype 7 to an HTML file. We cannot recover any conversations other than the ones saved in the main.db file within Skype 7.

    <title>Registry settings for OPEN and OPEN1 etc are now deleted after opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seancreighton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Registry settings for OPEN and OPEN1 etc are now deleted after opening an excel Addin</h2>
                    <p>I set the settings OPEN and OPEN1 etc inside the registry here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Excel\Options</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is to set excel to open certain files. For example this is how it looks now:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e2eb46b-8244-49ac-ab65-9915c1b4a947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e2eb46b-8244-49ac-ab65-9915c1b4a947" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This approach has been working fine for a number of years. Now it appears that after some updates with office, that after Excel opens and opens the above xll (or any other addin i specify) that Excel now goes on to remove the OPEN setting under options,
 see below gone</p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should not be effecting anythin on OneDrive, however I have not tried this either so I don't know exactly. However, to be sure, please back up any documents/folders saved in the OneDrive account before convering your mailbox into a shared one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will ensure that, if anything does happen, you have the files backed up.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Might be that your Kaspersky product version is not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I think you need to have Kaspersky 2016 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to contact Kaspersky Support:</p>

            <p>This is the additional price you pay for subscription service:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you pay for Month to Month Subscription every 30 days&nbsp; you will receive a notice to reactivate.</li><li>If you Pay yearly every thirty days you will be asked to reactivate.</li><li>Lose your Internet connect for certain length of time you will be asked to reactivate.<br />
</li><li>School/College/University students If they turn on their computer and Open an Office and even if the close lid to Sleep keeping connection alive while taking computer to class. if they take computer to class, and there is no&nbsp;Internet you'll be asked to
 reactivate, and if no signal You won't be able to use Office.</li><li>If you have terrible, unreliable Internet&nbsp; and you lose signal for a certain length of time you will be asked to reactivate and you may lose your work. (If you happen to be in the middle of something.)<br />
</li><li>You have a Mac that uses a Hybrid Drive it may constantly every day or at every restart, be asked to reactivate. (because these Hybrid drives present a new Serial number and the purchase is tied to Hard Drive serial number instead of computer's internal
 serial number. Hard Drives are the most likely thing to break down. (even more so with these Solid state Drives where if they go bad it's either good or bad and no in-between on Mechanical Drive (except hybrid that still have Solid state section)&nbsp; you have
 an in-between state where you can either repair or send off to Drive Savers and they can get your information off the drive. With Solid State all that is out the window.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>This based not on my Personal Experience but from post I am Reading on Getting started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Number 6, as Former Electronics Technician, I know from experience that there are only three quality states in solid state, be it&nbsp; Transistors, IC Processors Memory Chips. Good/working, Leakage (state between working and going south develops resistance where
 it shouldn't), a Non working inanimate object. And the time between these state can be milliseconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on these post I think the way the subscription service works is several times a day the service send a phone home signal it doesn't receive I'm here signal back, it will ask to reactive if you don't respond in a given time then it deactivates and you
 have a $9 or $99 paperweight depending up what you signed up for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 and 2 is in the nature of <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span></em></strong> subscription services.&nbsp;
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&lt;Grin&gt; It's not that they don't trust you. It's that they don't trust you. &lt;/grin&gt;</span></em>. Actually that is just the way subscription service works every 30 days or thereabouts, you receive a Phone home signal
 asking to reactivate. (if you're Paying for a Service you need to verify that your still using the service.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all go to the extreme. Once they receive the "I'm here, I'm here" signal they should shut down for 30 days and&nbsp; ask again in 30 days.&nbsp; Instead its constant, It seems like they don't trust you, even though you're the one forking over the money and it's
 up to them to keep their end of the bargain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the yearly service once they receive "I'm here" signal (activation) they should time stamp and send a phone home signal on that anniversary date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they did as I outlined&nbsp; items 3-6 would not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't fuss at MS. Adobe's service runs the same way and has the same identical problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Makes you wonder if they don't use the same outside firm to provide the subscription server and it uses the same faulty software.

<h2>            Windows Insider - Redstone 4, Build 17093 - The Themes tab in Personalization option is not working on Settings app and Desktop icons bugs.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone at the Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Kho Kho Kun and I am from Vietnam. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first question that I send to the Community about this problem on Windows 10 Insider Preview. I also send about this issue on the Feedback Hub for Insiders to know about this issue that I am having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed the newest Insider Preview build for <strong>Redstone 4</strong>,
<strong>build 1709</strong><strong>3.</strong> It works just fine, but there is a problem however.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to the <strong>Settings</strong> app and then <strong>Personalization</strong> option and then go to the
<strong>Themes</strong> tab, but the <strong>Settings</strong> app freezes and then crashed by itself. I cannot change the theme thanks to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the desktop icons is very <strong>buggy</strong>, the text messed up all over the place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of that issue, I have to roll back to my previous Windows 10 installation on the
<strong>Fall Creators Update, build 16299. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft and everybody will noticed this problem and fix it for me and everyone.</p>

<h2>            Extending an existing Office 365 Personal Subscription</h2>
                    <p>March 9, 2019</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preface: This inquiry pertains to only a single PC (WIN 10) with a single user, and only to Office 365 PERSONAL subscriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Microsoft Community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that Office 365 Personal subscriptions are sold with a 1 year duration.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The current subscription on my PC will expire in March 2020.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The existing subscription was activated using a “key card,” vs. an online auto-renewal purchase.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My questions are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A) Please confirm if purchasing an additional Office 365 Personal subscription and immediately adding it to an existing subscription will extend the time of the existing subscription. {Y/N}?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>One new subscription added to an existing subscription with a current expiration of March 1, 2020 would extend the expiration to March 1, 2021. {Y/N?}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) Please confirm what is the MAXIMUM number of Office 365 Personal subscriptions which can be added onto an existing subscription.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have read conflicting Community answers ranging from 3 to 5 as the maximum.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the above example, the new expiration date would be extended to March 1 of 2022, 2023 (etc.), depending on the maximum permitted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>{Y/N}?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind assistance.</p>

            Hello, thanks to contact the Microsoft Community. My name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />
<br />The maximum time that you can extend a Microsoft subscription is 5 years, for longer periods of extension to 5 years you will find an error in the system.
<br />It is to say, if your current subscription expires in March of 2020 and you add a new subscription of the same type, you will be extending it until 2021 and again and again with a maximum of 5 years.
<br />Keep in mind that the activation benefits do not vary by adding more subscriptions to the same Microsoft account, you will only be extending the validity time of the subscription.
<br />
<br />In the following article you will find more information about it.

<h2>            Internet Explorer doesn&#39;t load any web pages or doesn&#39;t respond</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For most of you Windows 7 users, and for those who have set their Windows Updates to install updates automatically, your Internet Explorer would have received an update for the latest version, i.e Internet Explorer 11. As per my investigations through
 many scenarios, I've gone through many customers come rushing with problems that they cannot access any web pages on their Internet Explorer, or that the browser doesn't load fine or freezes.</div>
<div>The main reason is that Internet Explorer 11 is not compatible with Windows 7 and so these problems occur.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The method to resolve this is by downgrading Internet Explorer 11 to a lower version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please follow these instructions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Click on Start</div>
<div>2) Click on Control Panel</div>
<div>3) Click on Program and Features</div>
<div>4) On the left pane, click on Turn Windows Features on or Off</div>
<div>5) Untick Internet Explorer 11</div>
<div>6) Click OK</div>
<div>7) Then click on View Installed Updates</div>
<div>8) In the list of updates, look for Windows Internet Explorer 11, click on it and select Uninstall on the top.</div>
<div>9) Restart the computer, and most of the time the previously installed version will be automatically gets enabled and you can find it under the Start Menu.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Minhaj</div>
                </div>

<p>this is true or not?</p>

<p>Firstly, please be aware that nobody here is going to help you break the law in your country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A similar problem exists in China, where WiFi is banned. Units that ship to China do have the WiFi circuits removed because it would be trivial to re-enable them if it was just a software issue. I think it is safe to assume that the Syrian authorities would
 nor allow units to be sold in Syria if the GPS was simply deactivated by software.</p>

<p>I catched only 3 times GPS in Syria. One time it was on the boat 50m from coast.. In Lebanon working but in Beirut often going down.&nbsp; I think they are interrupting signal. Nokia 5800 from Turkey. In Syria hard to try if the GPS chip is there. You must go
 on the sea or another country....</p>

            Yes, I want to do this, and I some cases, I already can do this. <br />
<br />
Note: All SDT tags, which I added manually into document.xml, behave with text as I expect using word UI. That is, when removing Content Control Element, text is not removed from word document. Just Content Control Element.<br />
All SDT tags, which I added using Word UI, cleans text inside sdtContent tag. This is not what I want and expect.

<h2>            Getting error &#34;Microsoft Security Client OOBE Kernel Event Tracing Event ID 3&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Microsoft Security Client OOBE Kernel Event Tracing Event ID 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon installing Windows 10 I was told that they had removed Microsoft Security. Today I go to open my Windows Defender and it looks like this. I am thinking it is the reason for my error event. Is there a fix for this? It's not in my control panel to delete
 it. It's only here. And it runs lol. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is built into the latest versions of Windows and helps guard your computer against viruses and other malware.&nbsp;When you start up Windows&nbsp;10 for the first time, Windows Defender is on and working to protect your computer by scanning for malicious
 software. It will turn itself off if you install another antivirus app.&nbsp;Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the article&nbsp;for additional information. </p>

            <p>If it is the main account, you need to factory reset the phone (since everything in the phone is associated with it). You do that&nbsp;by going to
<strong>Settings &gt; About</strong> and tapping '<strong>reset your phone</strong>'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it isn't the main account go to <strong>Settings &gt; email+accounts</strong>. Then tap and hold the account you want to remove and tap
<strong>delete </strong>in the popup menu that appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> steve marketing  say:</h3>
<h2>            pointer calibration word 2010</h2>
                    One of the primary reasons to replace my Toshiba Tecra was a calibration problem with the pointing device. Well the same problem is evident on my new Lenovo T520. In a Word document when placing the pointer over a character and clicking, the pointer jumps
 to the left of the character. Has anyone else experienced this? What can be done to correct it?

<p>Hello Dianneurmston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype takes the privacy and security of our customers very seriously, therefore when you log in many times using the password reset code, the system will tell you that you reach the maximum limit to reset your password in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to wait for 24 hours before you can reset your Skype password again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for understanding.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you are having issues accessing your emails. If you are using your browser to access your account, let us perform some troubleshooting steps to isolate if this is an issue with the email server. Please follow the troubleshooting steps
 below: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Update and optimize your browser. Clear browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that this is not a browser issue. Once done, please try again to access your email using a different web browser.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, add-ins etc. feature. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. Try to access your account directly from OneDrive site. Go to https://onedrive.live.com/?id=root&amp;cid=C7E3B6219549BEB5 and log in to your account. Click on the box like icon on the upper left hand corner of the web page. Select Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. To make sure that Outlook.com is running normally, we suggest that you check the service status from this
<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, let us know if there will be any difference after performing the suggested steps.</p>

<p>Let's say that your tower names are in column A of your "Master Sheet", and that on each of your 18 sheets the appropriate tower name is in cell A1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to get column K's values, array-enter (enter using Ctrl-Shift-Enter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR(INDEX('Master Sheet'!$A:$X,SMALL(IF('Master Sheet'!$A$1:$A$1000=$A$1,ROW($A$1:$A$1000)),ROW(A1)),COLUMN(K1)),"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Column L's data, array enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IFERROR(INDEX('Master Sheet'!$A:$X,SMALL(IF('Master Sheet'!$A$1:$A$1000=$A$1,ROW($A$1:$A$1000)),ROW(A1)),COLUMN(L1)),"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>etc., then copy those formulas down until they return blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your tower names are in a column other than A, only change the&nbsp;'Master Sheet'!$A$1:$A$1000 - and increase the 1000 to a number higher than your amount of data.</p>

<p><span>Wait for more than
<strong>24 hours</strong> and log in to the Delve app again.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, to help us clarify the scenario, please provide some more information:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The version of Delve, you can check in "Settings" &gt; "Installed apps" &gt; "Delve”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does the phone number display correctly in Delve online?</span></p>

<h3> dragonpu  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Online&#58; No way to get simplified ribbon back after turning it off</h2>
                    <p>I turned off the simplified ribbon in MS OneNote Online (Mac, Safari) because I couldn't find the style picker. I liked the simplified ribbon and now I want it back, but there is no button for it. Support page here (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/the-new-look-of-office-a6cdf19a-b2bd-4be1-9515-d74a37aa59bf)
 says it can be toggled on the View menu. But there is no option there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's also missing from the purple top bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, the "Tell me what you want to do" button doesn't understand anything about the simplified ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I turn the simplified ribbon back on again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And on another side note, why do I get this on the support site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why do I have no support options? I am paying $100/yr.</p>

<p>Hi DragonPu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would like to explain that the article you referred to is apply to OneNote 2016 for Windows and OneNote 2016 for Mac, not for OneNote Online, thus you cannot find View menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, you can click the ribbon button to bring back the options, then click
<p>

<p>Hi again, sorry I was so crabby before. Had a long day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did not actually answer my question, I'm afraid. I had previously been using the simplified ribbon in OneNote online, but hit the button to turn it off. But then I could not find a way to turn it back on again (and still can't). The instructions you
 sent describe how to expand/contract the "unsimplified" ribbon, not return to the simplified ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re screenshots: The Microsoft support center said I had no support options available. I can't reproduce that now, so never mind. :)</p>

<p>I have the same problem as DragonPu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that Word Online has a "simplified ribbon" check box on View tab. Perhaps some day someone at Microsoft decides to spread such feature to all Office Online applications.&nbsp; Just open a document there.</p>

            I'm seeing this behaviour as well. Word Online has the simplified ribbon toggle, but OneNote online doesn't. Is there a setting the tenant has to turn on?

<h3> brandoncole1  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Not Implemented Error&#34; in Outlook 2007 after an auto update in Windows 10 on 12-15-2017</h2>
                    <p>Happy Holidays.</p>
<p>Today my machine auto-updated... a big one... took a long time. Windows 10. I let it do its thing, and it never showed me any errors in the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened up my Outlook program (2007... yes, old, but was working just fine until today with this update), and when I click on send/receive, or Forward, or New- basically anything- I receive the Not Implemented popup dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell what the update did to cause this... and how I can get back to where I was, with a working Outlook 2007?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it matters, but I have a stand-alone version of Outlook 2007. Other Outlook programs (Word, Excel, etc.) came with the HOme and Student 2007 package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, now everytime I open Word and Excel it needs to go through the stupid Configuration Process again. What a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a horrible OS upgrade. Wish I wouldn't have allowed it (or knew how to stop it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            No, unfortunately not. I am so frustrated. Microsoft forced this update on us, and now we are stuck. They cannot even make their own software compatible with their own software. If we cannot figure out what to do then I must consider changing operating
 systems. <br />

            This just happened to me also. I don't think the person missed what was said. The person said after the OS upgrade the Outlook program stopped working. It's Microsoft who should be careful not to do an upgrade that would damage one of their programs. Just
 because they no longer support updates for Office 2007 doesn't mean they should be careless in their upgrades. This has nothing to do with whether it's supported or not. Microsoft did something to make Outlook unusable.

            I have had this same issue. The only thing I have found to work is to uninstall this windows update and go back to the previous version. Everything works fine including Word and Excel. Only problem is the system will eventually auto upgrade after a few
 days whether you want to or not.&nbsp;

I resolved this problem. I had to uninstall office 2007 and then re-install it. Outlook as well as Excel and Word all work as before.

    <title>Applying vlookups to multiple columns across one row - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhoyt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applying vlookups to multiple columns across one row</h2>
                    <p>The question is, can I drag a vlookup formula across multiple columns and get the column index number to ascend while dragging. Assume I anchor the vlookup's first two selections so they won't move - then is there a way to get the column index number to
 change without having to change this manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there isn't a way to get my vlookups to do this, the follow up question is is there a formula that will do what I need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the column index number to increment by 1, then try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Suppose your first VLOOKUP() is being written in column C (could be any row number)</p>
<p>2. Suppose you want to start extracting data from the the second column from the lookup_table</p>
<p>3. The column index number should be COLUMN()-1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> livasiufanua  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am getting cut off on my calls every hour now. I used to have 4 hours.</h2>
                    <p>I have been calling my boyfriend's mobile number in South Africa for about 8 months now.&nbsp; We are on the phone for many hours and we use to be cut off at 4 hours which is fine because I was warned by Skype that this would be the case. But then 4 or 5 months
 in, Skype started to cut us off every two hours, and this past month we are now being cut off every hour. This is very frustrating and I want to talk to a representative about my account. I don't want to be posting my business on the community page, but I
 can't find a number to call customer service and every time I try to get to the customer service chat, it is having technical problems. The customer service here is very frustrating. I want to know what is going on with my account and if it can be resolved.
 Thanks.</p>
