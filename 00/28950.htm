    <title>Windows 7 Homegroup simply does not work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Homegroup simply does not work</h2>
                    
<p>I have a desktop PC running Win7 Home Premium, and I have never been able to get Homegroup to work correctly. For a time, I had it set up so that my laptop, which also runs Win7 Home Premium, could see shared files on the desktop via the homegroup, but the
 desktop has never been able to see files on the laptop. At no point have I ever been able to get anything to appear in the "Share with" menu other than "Advanced settings". I've seen lots of tutorials and forums online that say that it should give me options
 such as Homegroup/Read, but that has never happened.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I attempted to add a new device to the network - a Logitech Revue with GoogleTV. I got it running for a bit, but not correctly - the Revue said it was connecting to the desktop, but the files were all wrong - there were many files showing up on
 the Revue that had been long-since deleted.</p>
<p>As neither Logitech nor Microsoft provides anything resembling helpful support, I have been messing with the settings in an attempt to get the list to refresh. Last night, I removed the PC from the Homegroup, hoping that by setting it up again I could force
 a refresh, but that has become an epic failure. Now, the PC simply gets stuck on the "Homegroup is currently sharing libraries on this computer" message. It has now been displaying that message for 12 hours. Neither the Revue nor the laptop can see the PC
 at all anymore.</p>
<p>Please help! I would very much like Homegroup to work as advertised. If not, I would like some alternate method of setting this up so that I can share files between the laptop and PC effortlessly, as well as getting the Revue to see the files that are actually
 on the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

As do most people AFAICS. Homegroups are flaky and flawed - don't bother with them. Use the tried and trusted Workgroup instead...

            It looks like my HomeGroup is on the verge of working, but it just goes so far. I can see all the HomeGroup computers displayed. I can open the display of folders. I simply get no response except a 'beep' noise when I try to open any of the folders in
 the HomeGroup. No error messages are generated or displayed. Just a beep. Great help that is.

            <p>I would have created a homegroup more than 20 times during installs and moments of enthusiasm. I have NEVER been able to use a home group. I have networking at home and file sharing to the main things like my phone and central storage&nbsp;but that's due to other
 means.. (I vaguely recall having something that actually worked for file sharing in about win98???)</p>
<p>its a crock.</p>
<p>my partner, who is an engineer uses thumb drives to move things about on the network... he says its easier to download and walk from room to room- uses the wired network rather than th wan I set up. says its faster- certainly the internet is faster, not
 sure about the walking. </p>
<p>homegroups just disappear!!! ground hog day-- would you like to create a homegroup-- yes--</p>
<p>next day same question. oh so&nbsp; I do have a masters in information systems, so although we are not nerds we are not technophobes either.. what chance does granny have?</p>
<p>sorry for the rave and I am really not interested in solutions after the several years of failure I am over homegroups.</p>
<p>I guess my message is if it doesn't work for you save&nbsp; literally weeks of your life and step away.

<p>Hey there Demon! Just to clarify, you are experiencing a disconnect between the button you are pressing and what is happening on screen, namely you are melee attacking when pressing the fire button, correct? Also, that you have tested this with multiple
 controllers, correct?<br />
<br />
Also, do you notice a similar disconnect in other games, namely pressing the right trigger activates the right stick press action? If there is a hardware issue here, it would persist in other games. Let me know, thanks!</p>

            Hi Madhava
<br />
<br />To develop for Windows currently you need 2 languages, C# and XAML
<br />
<br />The Front End (UI) should be coded in XAML which is the language for describing the Windows and its components, it provides excellent libraries and scales UI's beautifully for all devices
<br />
<br />The Back End (program logic) should be coded in C# again this language is particularly suited to Windows development, including WIn32, WPF and UWP app development

<h2>            MS not willing to let you Play Elder Scrolls Online without a Gold Subscription&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So why was the first thread closed? It was just a disscussion and ther where no reason to close it without any further comment! No Critic allowed here anymore or what?</p>

<p>So i only wantet to respond to post from Closing Racer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>IceStorm III:</strong></div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Kasi Cage:</strong></div>
<div>Confirmed: You will nee a Gold Membeship to play Elder Scrolls Online on Xbox One!</div>
</blockquote>
If it's using Xbox Live services, it requires a subscription to Gold.
<blockquote>
<div>Well, for the most of you it will not be a Mojor bummer but i really think this ist not acceptable anymore!</div>
</blockquote>
MS is very up front about the cost of Live Gold and what it provides. If you don't like Live, don't buy a MS console.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Final fantasy 11 for 360 doesn't require XBL gold sub and nothing really confirms you do need XBL gold for Xbox one version of ESO ( it isnt confirmed until the publisher/developer says so)</p>

<p>They Confirmed it already at the Bethesda Forum! ----&gt; http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1485779-eso-and-ps4-questions-and-answers-revealed/page-2</p>
<p>Look for the Post of GStaff</p>

<p>Pretty much all online play is covered by your Gold subscription so needing Gold for "The Elder Scrolls Online" should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I care about is that the monthly fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At £8.99 per month Bethesda can get stuffed.</p>

<p>Yes i do not like the Subscription model too, but why can't MS be a little mor Open on such things? If they want to keep up with Sony they have to come up with something and i don't mean bringin a new Gears or whatever.^^</p>

<p>Yeah so what? The same goes for Sony and the PSN and there you can play without PS+ so i think Gamers with both systems will choose the PS4 version, that means lower sales for the One.</p>

<p>Not getting this game because of the subscription fee and to justify €15 a month for a game I would want to be on it constantly which is not going to happen. It may be the norm for PC players to pay subscription for MMO's but I am predicting this not doing
 well on consoles because of this fee. Pay 60 for this and 180 for the year. That is over half the cost of a PS4 or the cost of 4 games. That's just my opinion though I am sure there are people who thinks it is reasonable and will pay it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason your last thread on this subject was locked is because you turned a discussion about "The Elder Scrolls Online" into a Comparisson Thread between XBox LIVE and whatever Sony use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do that again then the Moderating Team will simply lock this thread again for that reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a worth while topic for discussion so try to leave the comparissons out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>£8.99 is not something I'm willing to pay on a monthly basis for this, especially if the game is full price at release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discussion of the Monthly Fee is forbidden on Bethesda's official Forums however they have hinted that there could be a discount for committing to multiple months which could bring the monthly fee down to something worth committing to, as long as they also
 drop the price of the actual game.</p>

</p><p>I am running Windows 10 (with latest updates).&nbsp; This is an upgrade from my Windows 8.1.&nbsp; This is a 64-bit OS.&nbsp; I noticed it runs msiexec.exe from the system32 folder by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run msiexec /? from the syswow64 folder then it does not crash.</p>

            <p>Hi Parth,</p>
<p>I tried what you said.&nbsp; Still the same I'm afraid.&nbsp; No errors in sfc.&nbsp; DISM Restore Health didn't find anything.&nbsp; Restore completed ok - so don't know if they did anything.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Now what should I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that there is a 32 and 64 bit version of the msiexec.exe.&nbsp; I am running 64 bit Windows 10.&nbsp; I am running from the system32 folder.&nbsp; However if I do this from the SysWOW64 then it is fine.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Still I wouldn't expect the&nbsp;64-bit one to crash (in system32 folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>OK.&nbsp; This is a strange one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran ProcMon (SysInternals) utility to determine what msiexec was doing.&nbsp; I ran msiexec.exe /? from system32 folder in command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that there was some references to Bins.&nbsp; It was a nice utility.&nbsp; It worked on Windows 8.1 before I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.1upindustries.com/bins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bins Website</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I uninstalled that and rebooted it worked.&nbsp; I'm certain that no updates occurred between running ProcMon and uninstalling and rebooting - like in a 2 minute window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange!&nbsp; Why would msiexec look for Bins stuff unless there was something iffy in the registry.</p>

            Bins definitely causes an instant MSIEXEC crash. You do not need to uninstall bins though, just close the utility, do the MSI and then restart it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or if you dont require an automated solution you just set a calendar reminder, to print the report</p>

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>You can try the following suggestions.</p>
<p>1. Clear Temporary Internet Files: &lt;&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>2. Click Start -&gt; type <b><i>%temp%</i></b> in the search box -&gt; press Enter. Delete anything in this folder.</p>
<p>3. Internet Option -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Reset… button.</p>
<p>4. Click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Internet Explorer (with no add-ons). Then test the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Verify that the</span><i> <b>time</b>, <b>date/year</b> &amp; <b><u>time-zone</u></b></i><span>are set correctly</span></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Set-the-clock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set the clock</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Clear up your <b>Temp File/Cache</b>. Clean up the system (clearing out all the temp/tmp folders, and included all offline content, clearing the browser tif, delete cookies, do a Disk Cleanup</p>

<p>(<b>Important:</b> One of the normal steps in eliminating malicious programs is to entirely delete the contents of all Temp folders.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click <b>Start</b> &gt; <b>All Programs</b> &gt; <b>Accessories</b> &gt; <b>System Tools</b> &gt;<b>Disk Cleanup</b></p>

<p>Best and easier to use - <b>CCleaner</b>. </p>

<p>&lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/download/builds.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/download/builds.aspx</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The basic (slim) build does not contain the disgusted Toolbar</p>
<p>DO NOT USE ANY Advanced cleaning options. <b>DO NOT TOUCH THE REGISTRY</b>. At least not for now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</i></p>
<p><em>A very good antimalware app are SUPERAntiSpyware (<b>SAS</b>) and MalwareBytes Anti-Malware (<b>MBAM</b>) .</em></p>
<p><em>The recommendation is to use the <b>intelligent quick scan</b> routinely, and do full scans either on a longer periodicity--weekly, monthly--or only when something is found or you have some rəason for suspicion</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Internet Explorer <b>32 bit</b> (only!) to &lt;&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336</a>&gt;&gt; [<i>ignore the title, etc</i>.], dismiss the automated troubleshooter pop-up then run Fix It

<p>2. Reboot &amp; test. </p>

            Hi Minh,
<br />
<br />I’m here to help. Have you tried using the HP USB Storage Tool to format the flash drive? <a href="http://majorgeeks.com/files/details/hp_usb_disk_storage_format_tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://majorgeeks.com/files/details/hp_usb_disk...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also scan the drive using Malwarebytes, here: <a href="http://malwarebytes.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.com</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if you make progress, good luck.

            Hi Minh, do you mean you can delete those files and when you plug the drive back into your PC, the files are regenerated?
<br />
<br />If yo your PC is infected with a Trojan. The most popular method of spreading a Trojan is with USB flash drives, they specifically target flash drives in order to jump from PC to PC, that is why in Windows 10, Microsoft disabled Autorun on flash driver
<br />
<br />If the files are indeed, auto generating when the flash drive is plugged into your PC, you should perform a full scan of your PC . . .

            My window defender can spot the trojan, and remove it as well so i think my computer wasnt infect with virus.<br />
But i'll scan to make sure<br />
Thank you

            Looks like a virus. I recommend the following 2 things:
<br />
<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />Perform a Windows Defender Offline Scan:

            Minh,
<br />
<br />No problem, let's try something else. Head over to Disk Management (Windows key + R into Run, enter: diskmgmt.msc) and find the USB flash drive's Disk number on the left pane on the bottom half of the window.
<br />
<br />Right-click the volume corresponding to your flash drive (or both, if not just a single volume), and click Delete Volume if possible.
<br />
<br />You should then create a new volume under NTFS, FAT32, choose your poison.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this is possible, or if you need further assistance. I wish you luck.

            Hi Minh,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your efforts. I think you should try DiskPart to further attempt to format the drive and rid it of any malware.
<br />
<br />To illuminate the process, you should follow this guide here, it does a very good job of letting you know what you need to do: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-clean-and-format-storage-drive-using-diskpart-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-clean-and-fo...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes.

<p>Tiburave: If you purchased it from the US Amazon, then the code is probably only going to work for US region accounts. You'll need to purchase a code for the proper region or simply purchase it through the console.

<h2>            Error&#58; Windows was unable to find username, when sharing folder in Homegroup.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows was unable to find username</p>
<p>I am using Window 7 Ultimate and have setup a&nbsp;Homegroup. In Windows Explorer, I select a Folder and choose Share with. In the File Sharing dialog I select a Username (I checked that it is a valid user), then click Add. I get a message "Windows was unable
 to find &lt;username I selected&gt;. I can't find a reference anywhere on the web for this problem. Am I the first to see this?</p>

<p>In my new MSI laptop the microphone is not working. I'm using realtek high definition audio&nbsp;driver. when I try to setup the microphone&nbsp;in my laptop the inbuilt microphone does not hear anything. No green bars are moving. I tried to setup the voice to stero
 mix but still don't work.&nbsp; Also I have enhanced the microphone to 30dB but still no use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to setup the microphone in windows 10.</p>

            Try the following. In Revit OPTIONS: Under Graphics Tab &gt; Uncheck the "Use Hardware Acceleration.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, you might need to update your Display driver.
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />How to update the driver.

            The solution on the AutoDesk website is:

<br />
<br />If the above does not solve this issue for you, your best option is to post your question to the AutoDesk - Revit forum, there does seem to be a lot of users of Revit getting this error!
