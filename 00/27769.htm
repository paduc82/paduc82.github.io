<h2>            How can I share my hotmail calendar so it&#39;s on my wife&#39;s iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    I have an outlook.com calendar that I use on my android (just a beater I have until WP8 comes out). I've been using that calendar with my Windows 8 RC and everything else.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My wife isn't as keen on MS stuff as me so she got herself an iPhone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I want to get my calendar on her iPhone so we can coordinate our schedules. She has a gmail account and an OWA account for work. Is there any way I can get my calendar to sync with her iPhone without making her sign up for a hotmail/windowslive/outlook/etc.
 account and if so, how?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            Note that this does not work with OWA accounts. It will work with @hotmail or @outlook accounts but not with OWA/Exchange accounts. If I share my @outlook account calendar (i.e., hotmail calendar) then she will get an e-mail telling her that I've shared
 the calendar with her and she can even click the link in the e-mail to view the calendar. However, this calendar will NOT sync with her OWA calendar. The only solution we've found is to have her open up a separate (i.e., independent) @outlook.com account and
 share the calendar with that account. Then she has to setup that account as a separate e-mail account on her phone. So now she has one OWA account that she sends/recieves e-mails and one @outlook.com account that has a shared calendar. From what I've gathered
 with tech support at the university we work at, Microsoft has blocked syncing hotmail calendars to OWA calendars. I'm hoping when Microsoft updates the web calendar, these syncronization issues will be resolved.

<h2>            Powerpoint  2010 in Presentation mode</h2>
                    As a work round, some recommend inserting a video as a WMP object. These don't always 'start' in Presentation Mode. &nbsp; In Presentation Mode cannot (?) make adjustments on the hoof - like zoom to full screen or pause video? So can't give it a nudge?

            I am able to play video when inserted as wmp object and also starts in presentation mode.<br />
<br />
Can you provide the steps in details how are you inserting and playing.<br />
<br />
Also check if its an issue with one wmp file or all the files<br />

            One file it may be limited to at the moment (out of 5) so I accept that could be a one-off. But read on!
<div><br />
<div>I insert per the method suggested somewhere on Answers which is to get the Developer mode up, insert a WMP object on the slide and give the URL address as to where the media resides.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I also find is that although I can change in the properties of the WMP the FullScreen to True, it does not stay in; reverting after one play to False.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My other related original question was 'when in Presenter View - is it possible to adjust properties on the slide show monitor &nbsp;e.g. zoom, as that would overcome paragraph above. &nbsp;I cannot see a way of changing properties once in play.............</div>

<p>This does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue for me (and several other commenters on this thread) is that when you select either 'Print' or 'Save as PDF', NOTHING happens. Nothing. No error dialog box. It simply sits there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I've found out that 'dumbing down' to an earlier version of Word doesn't work for me, either, as whatever the license is that my school district has will not support that workaround; i get an error that my 'account does not support editing on a Mac.'
 (FYI - editing, saving, etc. is possible under version 16.1 - only printing/save as PDF fails.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have tried subscribing to 'Office Fast' builds (which has a version 16.12); same failure to print/save as PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing/updating printer drivers/software is ineffectual; you don't GET to the point of 'printing'. It simply does not even give a Print Dialog box at all.</p>

<p><strong>If you use Antidote, Webex, Silverlight, EndNote, Zotero or other add-ins there is a potential for crashes unless you also update your add-ins to the latest update. Install updates for these programs if you have them.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SAFE BOOT</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think the next thing to do after updating everything is another relatively simple procedure: Perform a
</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21875?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 153, 1)">Safe Boot</span></strong></a><span>.
 It will take a long time for your Mac to start up in Safe Mode. When you do a Safe Boot Mac OS fixes troubles with your Mac's directory and file system. The font cache is emptied. Only a limited number of fonts are enabled. Applications that run at startup
 don't run automatically.&nbsp;This allows you to test your app(s) by running them with a minimal set of fonts, an empty font cache, and without potentially conflicting apps running.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you reach the desktop in Safe Mode try running the app having a problem. Is the problem still there?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem is gone</span></strong><span>: Performing a Safe Boot may have fixed the ailment. Or
 perhaps one of the fonts that wasn't loaded is bad. Or perhaps some other software utility is interfering. After testing in Safe Mode, do regular restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem is still evident in Safe mode</span></strong><span>, you may still have a bad font.
 Use Font Book to restore system fonts, then test again in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem was gone in Safe Mode but returns during a regular boot:</span></strong><span> I think the first thing to do would
 be to use a font utility to validate ALL your fonts. Mac OS comes with a free font utility called
</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Font Book</span></strong></a><span>, which you can use for this purpose.
 Get rid of any font that doesn't pass as clean and green. Then, restart your Mac and immediately empty the trash. If you've gotten this far and still have a problem, then there are more things to explore. But if you get this far you've probably gotten rid
 of the crash. Either way, please reply with your results.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Access &#47; 32bit vs 64bit</h2>
                    I wish to use Microsoft Power BI with data from MS Access.&nbsp; Power BI says I need the 64bit Microsoft Access Database Engine.&nbsp; The download site says I cannot have&nbsp;the 64-bit version&nbsp;because I run the 32 bit version of Access.&nbsp; I downloaded the 32 bit Database
 Engine.&nbsp; The Power BI software doesn't like it.
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that if I want to use Microsoft Power BI with Access source data I have no option but to upgrade to the 64 bit version Access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If "yes":</p>
<p>&nbsp;- How do I do that (link preferably) and do I need to uninstall the 32bit version first?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Can 64 bit Access co-exist in Office alongside 32-bit application (like Word, Excel) but replacing 32 Access?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I understand the impediments on 3rd party software written for 32 bit Access that will not necessarily run on 64 bit Access.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; I am more interested in the Power BI tool.</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Office 2013 when initial installation was done without an account.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I had Office 2013 Home &amp; Student installed.&nbsp; Recently we have had to carry out a system restore which wiped everything including Office 2013.&nbsp; I am now trying to reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had a Microsoft account. Ideally I would like to reinstall without an account (I have the product key), but this does not seem to be possible so I have created an account. However, as the previous installation was done without an account, I keep
 getting diverted away from the page once I put the product key in and I can't reinstall Office 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how I can reinstall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Re: "<em>I have the product key</em>".&nbsp; If you purchased a one-time-purchase of Office 2013 and was provided with a card on which there was a 25 character key, then you have a big problem.&nbsp; That is not actually the Product Key. It is a Redemption Key and
 proof of purchase. You can only use it once to install Office 2013 on the same computer. You should have used the email address and password for a Microsoft Account during the installation process.&nbsp; This would have created an Office Account from where you
 can reinstall Office as many times as you desire. You also need the email address and password for the Microsoft Account to do an online repair of your Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to contact Microsoft for assistance:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHpM33hovRAhVKBsAKHWGLD08QFggtMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNEx58DgpkDGGvvg3wzR3TABuDw9MA&amp;bvm=bv.142059868,d.d24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>PS: If I have misunderstood your post and your Office came preinstalled by the vendor you will need to see if the vendor will help you.&nbsp; If your Office was OEM, usually&nbsp;that means, you did not pay the full retail purchase price, then Microsoft will not take
 any responsibility for any problem you have with your Office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you paid the full retail price and the vendor installed your Office, they should not have done so without using the email address and password for your Microsoft Account. Microsoft should assist you in that is the case.&nbsp; Despite what anyone else may say
 you CANNOT use the Redemption key to install Office 2013 more than once on the same computer.&nbsp; When you install a one-time-purchase using the 25 character key from the card provided the key is passed to the Office Account.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what allows you to reinstall
 your Office from your Office&nbsp;Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI to retrieve the actual Product Key for Office 2013 you need to sign in at your Office Account using the email address and password for the Microsoft Account used to install your Office.</p>

            <p>Not quite correct; If H&amp;S 2013 was supplied by the PC maker, as a 'free full version' the user is provided with the 25 Character key.</p>
<p>But unfortunately since MS Updated it 'download office 2013 link' that has to the best of my knowledge led to the removal of the required download file (Unless its hosted Ellesmere on MS)
</p>
<p>And as such the user would need the original installation file.</p>
<p>PS Don't tell me I'm wrong as I've re-installed 2013 using the key supplied, and the installation file I saved

<p>Hi Stuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sending those files. SVG is a comparatively new addition to PowerPoint. So if your client is using an earlier version of PowerPoint, they won't work and will be stripped out when they save. Even if they are on Office 2016, but using the licensed
 version instead of an Office 365 subscription, SVG will not work for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best practice is to ask your client what version they are using, then work in that version to supply them with a file that is guaranteed compatible. Microsoft has made the world of the designer infinitely more complicated by having so many different
 versions with different capabilities available at the same time.</p>

    <title>Sync problem with Outlook &#38; HTC3600 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sync problem with Outlook &#38; HTC3600</h2>
                    Hi, Can anyone help ? &nbsp;I have had a HTC3600 (TRIN100) for 2 years &amp; had no problems until now. It will no longer sync with my PC. I uninstalled windows mobile off the PC. Re installed it from Microsoft. It now syncronizes everything (Tasks/Notes/Contacts
 etc) but not Outlook. I have tried changing the settings from 1 week up to all past appointments, but it make no difference. Can anyone suggest anything ? Thanks

<p>I have rebooted the PC &amp; have done a soft reset on the device. I have re synchronised &amp; it did transfer 1 days information from the device to the PC.&nbsp; However there is still another 30 days it hasn't transferred.

<p>If I end the partnership with the device &amp; the PC, I will loose all the information previously synchronised with the device from both the PC &amp; the device. Any other ideas ?

<p>You shouldn't lose it!&nbsp; When you end the partnership the create a new one it will ask how you want to sync.&nbsp; All the info on the PC will be brought over.</p>

<p>You can do a backup just to be safe and you can also make a copy of the PIM.VOL in case there is a trajedy.....</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>AFAIK&nbsp;there is no command line switch for this, you would have to resort to vb code</p>
<p>Private Sub Workbook_Open()<br />
Application.DisplayFullScreen = True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Now you can put this in the workbook you want it to apply to or if you want it to be the default for every workbook in the 'workbook' module of personal.xls</p>
<p>for what it's worth all the command line switches can be found here</p>

<h3> kim l  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to copy calendar list from outlook 2010 to excel</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to copy shared&nbsp;calendar entries in list format to Excel, for keeping track of statistics. It works fine in 2007, but not in Outlook 2010. In Outlook 2007, I just switch to the shared calendar, change view to Category, select all and copy, then
 it pastes perfectly into Excel 2007. When using Outlook 2010, I get inconsistent results when switching to List view in the shared calendar (sometimes get subjects to display, other times not), I cannot select all, and what I do get I cannot paste into Excel.
 Only the headers paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried Exporting from Outlook 2010, but my shared calendar is not available.</p>

            It should work exactly the same in Outlook 2010. Try resetting the view on the folder - View tab, Reset button.

<p>Contact your IT department and have them restore a copy.&nbsp; Of course this assumes that either 1. you save your files to a network server or your IT dept has a backup plan in place to backup individual hard drives automatically.</p>
<p>Of course if you back up your own hard drive then you can use that copy.</p>

    <title>Proof Reading error in Microsoft Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhishek verma_557  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proof Reading error in Microsoft Word 2016</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a word file. It shows some gramatical error with blue lines. I want to ignore it, so when I do a "spelling and grammer check", I ignore those errors. This removes the line.</p>
<p>However, when I opens the decument next day, the blue lines comes again. How can I prevent it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to reproduce error: </p>
<p>1. Create a new docx file.</p>
<p>2. Write "Tiger was killed by hunter." </p>
<p>3. You will see a blue line </p>
<p>4. Click "Spelling and Grammer" under review tab. </p>
<p>5. It will say your sentence is in passive voice. </p>
<p>6. Click "Ignore".</p>
<p>7. The blue line is gone.</p>
<p>8. Close the document. </p>
<p>9. Open it again</p>
<p>10. The blue line comes again &lt;&lt; This is what wrong. Why this error is coming again when I told it to ignore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing, this error ( step 10 above ) has started coming after Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Earlier it was working fine.</p>
<p>

    <title>memory card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lec12  say:</h3>
<h2>            memory card</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I experience a rather curious 'phenomenon'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I connect my 5800 Xpress to the PC (windows 7)&nbsp; in mass storage mode I've got the message that I should first format my storage card, although this card has worked correctly for about half a year.</p>
<p>If I choose the PC Suite mode an icon in systray appears. After activate this icon an explorer-like window pop up and displays two storage devices: a memory card (with a red bar) and the SIM card (with a blue bar). Further if I choose the the red (perhaps
 red for somehow corrupted??) I have full access to all files and I can copy or move etc. the files. Likewise, I also have access to the SIM card which is was not possible in mass storage mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>In mass storage mode I do not have any access (which was possible some days before)</p>
<p>In PC suite mode I have access. This means that the card behaves like a non-corrupted card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help and/or explanation etc is appreciated! Thanks in advance.</p>

            Well, after I formatted the three devices on Win7, they didnt seem to cause any problems anymore. For the past 6 months that I have been using them after reformatting, they'd been working fine.

            Hi InesBilbao,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your confirmation.<br />
<br />
Based on my research and test, it’s not feasible to Forward as iCalendar when forwarding events in the Outlook Web App. Given the situation, you are welcome to submit feedback via the link below:<br />

            <p><span>Hi Thekochs,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, you are an Office 365 end user in your company. After you change your job, usually, the Office 365 admin in the company will remove your Office 365 for
 Business licenses. And then you cannot access the Office 365 for Business services anymore. So, we suggest you let the admin help back up your data before removing the licenses.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need to change from Office 365 for Business plan to Office 365 Home or Personal plan, you will need to uninstall and reinstall Office 365 because you need to reactivate
 it with the new Office 365 credentials. Here is an article about uninstalling Office 2016, 2013, or Office 365 from a PC for your reference:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 src="https://(domain)/frJVv32/mountainrose-For-Outlook-App.jpg" width="100%"&gt;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some special format the jpg needs to be for it to work?&nbsp; It's a very large image but the web has no issues with it.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Solved my own issue.&nbsp; It was a 4000px image....scaled it to 2000px and it works.<br />
