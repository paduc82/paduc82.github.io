<h2>            Graphics card missing from device manager after Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently noticed that my NVIDIA GPU icon is missing from the taskbar. When I inspected the issue, I noticed that nothing showed up when searching for NVIDIA via the Start Menu and that the only item under Display adaptors in the Device Manager is
 Intel HD 5500. I have downloaded the official driver from Acer's website and the NVIDIA website. Both said that they could not find compatible hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has started occuring somewhere around two months ago leading me to strongly believe that the Windows Spring 2018 update is to blame here as it was installed on 23rd of May - the same date my Intel HD driver's properties (in Device Manager) say
 that the driver was reinstalled and 'migrated', whatever that means. Intel HD is not the only driver which shows similar info for 23rd of May.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/support-product/6362?b=1&amp;pn=NX.GA4EX.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="My laptop model">
Aspire F5-571G</a> and the graphics card is NVIDIA Geforce 940M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting already done as per common advice:</p>
<p>1.) There was an NVIDIA related entry in the Programs and Apps settings menu and I uninstalled it hoping that Windows Update would install the driver again correctly. It did not.</p>
<p>2.) I have used the Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) for my NVIDIA driver hoping that either Windows Update or NVIDIA driver downloaded from Acer website would be able to download/install the driver. They were not able to do that.</p>
<p>3.) I have attempted to uninstall Intel HD using Device manager (checking the "Remove driver software"). Windows Update downloaded the appropriate driver and installed, however there was still no sign of NVIDIA drivers.</p>
<p>4.) I have restored BIOS to factory settings. There is no option for 'discrete graphics', 'dGPU' or anything similar.</p>
<p>5.) I have attempted to run DriverEasy and other similar programs to no avail.</p>
<p>6.) I have attempted to type in&nbsp;bcedit /set pciexpress forcedisable to admin CMD.</p>
<p>7.) There are no yellow marks near any devices in the Device manager and there is no "Other devices section". The show hidden devices option is on.</p>
<p>8.) There are no restore points before June available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other info: </p>
<p>1.) I have used Autoruns for Windows for unrelated performance issues and it found two
<a href="https://snag.gy/Ws29lk.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NVIDIA related entries</a>.</p>
<p>2.) I have used MalwareBytes a week ago and it found and deleted a Trojan malware. I cannot 100% confirm that the NVIDIA driver was there before the MalwareBytes scan.</p>

<p>Hi John, <br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate you brought this to the <em>Community</em>. We hope that you will be satisfied on the help the we can provide as we go on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the issue, it shows that the series of your notebook's (or <em>laptop</em>) graphic card is having issues on running with Windows 10 1803. Running Windows update to get the recommended driver, can definitely resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may fall on compatibility matters, which can normally be solved by a <strong>
cleanly uninstalling of the driv</strong><strong>er, including its software interface,</strong> and downloading the best available driver from the manufacturer's site,
<em>NVIDIA</em>. You have to ensure that the driver that will be downloaded is tagged working for Windows 10; and if Windows 10 1803 will be specified, its much better.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that the incompatibility to the said series is considerable, given that the GPU series is old. Also,
<strong>please ensure that the core processor (<em>CPU</em>) driver have been fully updated to its latest version prior to installing the GPU driver.</strong> Please consult your original equipment manufacturer (<em>OEM</em>), for they can provide certified
 drivers for the said peripherals for he specific device</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to keep us updated. </p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update does not unfortunately download the GPU driver. I have even tried uninstalling Intel's graphics driver and it downloaded as expected, however there was still no sign of my main GPU driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completely uninstalled NVIDIA's driver (used the utility Display Driver Uninstaller). When I run the driver setup I downloaded from the NVIDIA website it says it cannot find a compatible graphics card. I have also tried to download the GPU driver
 from the ACER website (older version, but for my notebook) to the same outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding updating the CPU driver, what is it usually called on the OEM's website? Is it the chipset driver? Please take a look at the
<a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/support-product/6362?b=1&amp;pn=NX.GA4EX.002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
notebook's support website</a>&nbsp;and let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, we can resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>            Fast way to switch between desktop apps</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
<br />
From what I can understand, the "move to the upper-left corner, click and move down the left edge' maneuver in Win8 only works with modern apps.<br />
<br />
Using mostly desktop apps , I often find it difficult to swiftly switch from one to another. The task bar or the defilement bar (alt+tab) are much too cluttered.<br />
<br />
Is there a swifter, more effective way?<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, whatever happened to the spinning wheel (Win key + tab)?<br />

            What about Windows Key + Tab
<div>There also 3rd party software to change your Alt + Tab completely like <a href="http://www.ntwind.com/software/vistaswitcher.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VistaSwitcher</a> (I think it's compatible with Windows 8)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Taskbar is a good way to switch between desktop apps too</div>
<div>You can line the software in taskbar side by side and switch with Windows Key + 1,2,3,4</div>

<h2>            svshost.exe suspiciously using too much cpu</h2>
                    <p>So for several months i noticed from time to time my machine would suffer a drastic slowdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this occurred i opened task manager only to find a process with no name running under svchost.exe, using about 80% of cpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually i just closed it and that's it, the problem was gone until it happened again. I never really worried about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since I make a lot of dowloads i was wondering whether this could be a virus, so i decided to check. I found what svchost.exe is and what it does, where it should be, etc. I was also informed that it would be suspicious to more than one running at once
 or running under my current user and not system or local/network service etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i found two things. One is that i do have a svchost listed under my user name, however whenever i do have this problem the one running is under system and located at&nbsp;Windows\Temp the one under my user i never found running, but this is where i got confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one under my user is at&nbsp;Windows\System32. So is any of them "suspicious" or is are they both ok and it's just a hung process or something like that that causes the issue?</p>

            <p>I'm not sure when i first encountered it. When i started noticing it was about 2-3 months ago.</p>
<p>I've closed the "ghost process" through task manager whenever it happened. That results in the performance to go back to normal.</p>
<p>No error messages are displayed.</p>
<p>When you say changes, you mean installing programs? I'm a gamer and a "software developer" (not graduated), I install and uninstall programs and games constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that several windows updates passed by and the issue is still there. I'm not sure what exactly causes it. I just notice it when the computer runs slower than normal (it is very noticeable).</p>

    <title>Upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I am looking to dual boot my computer and so in turn I have Ubuntu running from a flash drive temporally until I install windows. I get a discount from my work on windows products including windows 8.1 upgrade and it specifically states that it is only compatible
 with windows 7 however the people I have asked said that there is not issue in installing it onto a blank computer. The windows 8 has no such warning and I am quite certain that I can upgrade from 8 to 8.1 even with my buying it from my work but I would prefer
 to not have to upgrade after installing the operating system. So my best bet would be to buy which copy the 8 upgrade or the 8.1 upgrade.</p>

Which Windows operating system is installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
You will not be able to perform clean Install using upgrade product key. If you want to perform fresh install of Windows 8.1, then you will need to buy full version of Windows 8.1 or you can buy Windows 8.0 and upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows store at free
 of cost. <br />
<br />
I would suggest you to see the following links for more information on performing clean install of Windows 8.1, Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.0 to Windows 8.1.<br />

<h2>            Error 651 ethernet but ok when wireless</h2>
                    I have bought an ASUS laptop 8 months ago with Windows 7 installed. It was working fine when connected by ethernet from a router, just recently (maybe a month ago) I turned on my laptop and it showed it wasnt connected. So, I restarted it and still having
 the problem. I went through a trouble shooting process of turning off the computer and unplugged the cable from the computer turned off the router for a few minutes then plugged everything in and checked it, still didnt work. So, I decided to use a netbook
 I had to test that maybe it was the cable, it wasnt. I plugged the ASUS into the modem and it didnt work. So, now that I knew it was something to do with the computer I started to investigate why. I noticed that I didnt have a 'local area connection' just
 a 'manage wireless networks', 'change adapter settings' and change advance sharing settings'. So, I tried to maybe set up a new connection to the router with the ethernet and everytime I tried to set up a new network to router i got

<p><span>Hi JoeJ1986,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Did you try running the troubleshooter and uninstalling and reinstall the network adapter by following the above steps?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Local Area Connection should be present even if its connected through wireless. However, you may try uninstalling the network adapter
 and reinstalling it and check if it works. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to verify if the Network connection and network list services are started and set to automatic.<span>&nbsp;</span>To do
 this follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on Start.</span></li><li><span>In the start search box type services.msc and press enter</span></li><li><span>In the services Window, scroll down to Network connection.</span></li><li><span>Right click on it and click on Properties.</span></li><li><span>Check if the startup type is set to Automatic, if not set it to automatic.</span></li><li><span>Click on start button, this will start the Network connection services.</span></li><li><span>Click on Apply and Ok.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Repeat the same steps for Network list service and check it it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the result.</span></p>

    <title>No login screen after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmserra  say:</h3>
<h2>            No login screen after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent update I can't login into windows 10 because I only see the welcome screen (with the date and the keybord, wifi and power buttons) and it keeps trying to show the login screen but apparently it fails and returns to the welcome screen</p>
<p>1-I have already tried automatic repair: doesn't work</p>
<p>2-Tried to go into safe mode: my two accounts appear and are working. </p>
<p>I tried sfc /scannow and didn't find any integrety violations</p>
<p>3- restart brings the same issue back again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aditional info</p>
<p>In safe mode I noticed the following about my two user accounts:</p>
<p>normal user account: The start button works normally. However I can't see the settings for sign-in options; although I see for example the apps, devices etc</p>
<p>administrator account: I simply don't see any of the windows settings. Just the blue window with the wheel. Only the right mouse button works on the start button</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first symptom things were not okay was that my fingerprint stopped working at the login screen. I had to login with the password. After returning from the screen saver my login screen was gone for good.</p>
<p>I already read many tutorials but none of the things seems to recover this issue</p>
<p>The issue seems to be related to a recent update by microsoft</p>
<p>

            Hello Jm,<br />
<br />
Issues appearing after an update may possibly be due to a system file corruption or missing update components. We would recommend that you perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file and check you'll be able to login afterwards. Kindly click on this

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice but unfortunately it does not work.</p>
<p>I created a USB bootable pen with windows 10 according to the instructions</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I run it it says that the upgrade option is not available if you start your computer using windows installation media.</p>
<p>It tells me to start windows normally and then run windows setup. But this is precisely my problem; I can't login into windows so I cannot do this.</p>
<p>So the option is a dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I can't either do it inside windows safe mode which is the only thing I can do</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joao</p>

            We appreciate your response. Since the upgrade option is not available, we suggest that you try to do a custom installation if Windows 10. This will overwrite you corrupted operating system and will let you keep all your files in the process. To perform
 a custom installation of Windows 10, kindly refer to this article: <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">How

<p>My situation is a little different - I don't have a fingerprint reader to get to safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC finally "completed" the major Windows 10 update last night after failing daily for the past week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I had the original splash screen, with datetime and wifi icon.&nbsp; When click to go to login screen, ID comes up with circling progress icon - THEN reverts to splash screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never get login box, or power icon.&nbsp; (However, Windows is running - all shared drives are available t o others in the office.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get to login?</p>

WARNING!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;Followed the instructions and got Windows 10 back - BUT watch out for the fine print.&nbsp; Yes, my files were all saved.&nbsp; However, they all get dumped into a folder called \windows.old.000 - so yes you keep your files, BUT you have none of your installed
 programs.&nbsp; :-(

<p>I was experiencing the no-login-screen issue and searched to see if anyone was having the same issue.&nbsp; I came across this and others, then solved my issue, then decided to come back here to share my particular problem and resolution.&nbsp; I was not having the
 issue directly after a Windows 10 update, but rather my symptoms appeared out of the blue, seemingly.&nbsp; But I believe the "fix" is applicable here.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the problem started, I found that i<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">f I waited it out, the login screen would come up eventually</span>, but still it was an unusually long time before it did (minutes instead of seconds).&nbsp; After logging in, the
 system would function as normal, except for the annoying delay on startup.&nbsp; So I looked and I found various different suggestions for "fixes" online for this particular symptom going back a couple of years, ranging from booting into safe-mode, to disabling
 fast start-up, to disabling hibernation, to re-installing windows, and other exotic remedies that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I <em>did </em>notice was Windows Defender Security Center was notifying me one of my devices failed a health check.&nbsp; It was an external USB drive, and after turning it off, the login-screen issue I was having
<strong>disappeared</strong>.&nbsp; This is what I think was happening:&nbsp; It appears as the system was booting up, Windows was enumerating through the different devices attached and found and issue with the drive, and after some pre-determined time, gives up on checking
 the problem and simply reports a device failure.&nbsp; The problem is, during that time it's checking, it refuses to present you with the log-in screen; instead you have to wait until its checks are done before it gives you that next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm not saying that is the exact cause (USB device failure) for the no-log-in-screen in every case, but I'm thinking that on boot up, Windows is finding something wrong with some device and will not go on to the log-on screen until it's done checking
 what's up.&nbsp; I <strong>am </strong>pretty confident that in every case the log-in screen will eventually come up, but only after its issue resolution process has run its course (and that time taken will vary for whatever the issue may be).&nbsp; In the case of this
 thread, It <em>could </em>be that after a Windows update, the updated system now found some kind of incompatibility with some device in your system, and basically doing the same thing here.&nbsp; If I'm correct, needless to say this is a behavior/peculiarity that
 needs fixing.</p>

<p>tnx, did in the interim envoke the help of a service agent whose invoice records 'enabled mail apps in gmail &amp; adjusted power settings to fix shutdown/taskbar problems'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However seems also that perhaps a back up system has been reloaded as&nbsp; shutdown options are now restricted to shut down &amp; restart and had a raft of out of date e-mails reloaded.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I can't install a modem (like usb modem) to use interenet after upgrading from windows7 to windows7 service pack1. why it's happening? i've updated it by online update. can anyone tell me please what to do? i've bought the laptop from Malaysia. i live in
 Bangladesh. I tried to contact with microsoft chat option but they gave a list of country where Bangladesh is not mentioned. so i wasn't able to mail or chat.</p>
<p>the seller told me that windows7 is original and you can update everything through online. i've updated 3 months ago but when i install a modem it's not working. it shows error. but before updating same modem i could use.</p>

<p>Click Start, type: programs and features</p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard</p>
<p>Scroll down and point to the Modem software, select it and click Uninstall</p>
<p>Restart if prompted.</p>
<p>You will need to reinstall the software, but this time, do it using Troubleshoot compatibility</p>
<p>USB modems usually have the install software on the USB stick itself, if not, go to the manufacturers website and download the software.</p>
<p>Point to the driver files.</p>
<p>Right click the setup file and click 'Troubleshoot compatibility'</p>
<p>Wait while it detects the problem.</p>
<p>Click the option 'Worked in a previous version of Windows'</p>
<p>Select Windows 7 RTM or preferable Windows Vista SP2</p>

            Hi I'm sorry for the late reply. I posted this before going to bed last night and i just saw your post and applied your solution. I ran the troubleshooter an looks like it may have fixed this issue. Its currently downloading several updates because as
 i said in the post, i don't use the pc very often. I could let you know if the updates I successfully install if you wish. &nbsp;

<h3> cybermatrix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 MD5 &#47; SAHA-1 Hash</h2>
                    I bought Windows 7 Home Premium from the student offer Microsoft is offering; I've already downloaded and such and I found a guide to create the extracted files from the .box files into an ISO and I obviously know it's validity. But, I'm curious what the
 MD5/SAHA-1 hash is for the Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit (x86) Retail ISO, not the MSDN RTM ISO.<br />
<br />
I already know how to get the hash for the bootable ISO I created from the guide.<br />
<br />
The version of Windows I bought and downloaded is Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit (x86) Upgrade; I believe it's the retail upgrade.<br />

<p>I am running a dell xps 32 bit system with windows home premium. All of a sudden my lexmark x2600 printer quit scanning so i uninstalled and then reinstalled. Now not only does the scanner not work, but I cannot print documents. I have uninstalled and reinstalled
 the printer multiple times. I have also looked for newer drivers from lexmarks website and looked for patches and fixes from microsofts website. I keep getting the same message "Printer cannont communicate with Computer." I have tried all the solutions that
 come up with the error message and all have failed. It has been 2 weeks since I was last able to use my printer and any help to resolve this would be deeply appreciated.</p>

            In the Services utility you'll find 'lxddCATSCustomerConnect'. You need to change the properties to 'Disabled' and 'Stopped' or it will cause errors. When your in Services make sure that the lxdd_device is set to 'Automatic' and started. Open 'Devices
 and Printers' and right-click on the Lexmark to be sure it is the default printer.&nbsp;

    <title>can&#39;t right-click icons in taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deke12  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t right-click icons in taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I have Win 10 v1703, and have tried checking files, have restored back 4 days, and then back 12 days to no avail. (Both restores failed because: "Failed to extract SystemSettingsViewModel.Desktop.dll")</p>
<p>In addition to not being able to right-click on any taskbar icon, I can't left-click on the "start" button. I CAN right-click the "start" button, but can't, for example, choose "search." Also. I can't left-click the "speakers" button to adjust volume, nor
 left-click "notifications."</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade Games and Security Features</h2>
                    I am running Windows 8.1 on my computer, and I read that the current Microsoft Solitaire Collection is being replaced by a Windows 10 version of Microsoft Solitaire Collection.&nbsp; My question is will there be a replacement for Microsoft Mahjong Games with
 the Windows 10 upgrade? I am currently a full time student at college and I am taking courses for a Computer Support Specialist Certificate and Server + Certificate.&nbsp; I would like to know what kind of hardware I will need to purchase to take advantage of security
 features that are offered with the Microsoft Widows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Thank you.

<h2>            What kind of power adapter does my 10&#39;&#39; Windows tablet need&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My brother recently purchased a generic 10'' Windows tablet from Best Buy. Everything works great, except that the power supply is not giving the tablet enough power to keep it charged. Even when the tablet is plugged in, the power slowly drains.</p>

</p><p>The tablet did not come with a power supply. It charges through micro USB. The adapters we have do charge the tablet, but too slowly to keep the tablet from draining if my brother is using it. What should we do?</p>

            <p>That depends entirely on the hardware and has nothing to do with Windows. There are clear specifications for the USB interface which limits the amount of power the USB interface can draw. If the tablet can demand more that a standard USB port can deliver
 that is a design error that could only be covered by a specific supply that should have been included with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nominally 1A for USB although there are some sold that state that they can support 2A, you would need to look for that specification through whatever supplier is available to you in your region.</p>

            <p>Power demand depends on the specification and design of the tablet which from the OP cannot be determined, there is no such thing as a "generic Windows tablet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What power is consumed by the display, CPU? Newer models use less than older ones. What technology is in the RAM &amp; SSD? Again the power demand is different. How big is the battery? How long does it last? What is the stated recharge time? Can you use it whilst
 charging?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this defines the requirements of the PSU and has nothing to do with Windows, you could wipe of Windows and install Linux, the problem would be the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is USB connectors are actually completely inappropriate for a charging connector for this type of device but it is a cheap tablet because it uses cheap components. It came with a USB charger, that should be limited to 2A at best, probably less for
 the micro-USB connector in the chassis, Windows does not limit that.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry if I offended you. Microsoft sent me an email asking me to review the answer I received. The answer was very short, and did not contain the helpful detail you provided, HairyFool. I answered honestly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth mentioning that if you are going to respond to posts by calling customers "snotty," customer service (in this case, providing a Microsoft customer with an answer to a question) might not be the area where you should concentrate your efforts.</p>

            <p>Most of the people here are not Microsoft employees.&nbsp; They are offering their time to help people, and when help is characterized by an ungrateful petitioner as "totally unhelpful" after the petitioner has admitted that he had no idea what the respondent
 meant (thus being unable to evaluate the helpfulness of the answer), a characterization of that as being snotty shouldn't be surprising.</p>

<h2>            Castleminer Z for Backward Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was wondering if the best indie game from Xbox 360, Castleminer Z, is going to be added to the list of games.</p>
<p>The game itself was very nostalgic and fun, and I’d like to play it again on Xbox One. Please, I mean please bring it back. Xbox has never been the same since the indie game’s program was shutdown.</p>
