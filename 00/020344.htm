            That is a known issue: Old versions of that tool do not update automatically anymore. You have to download/install the latest version manually:
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Software Recovery Tool</a> (currently: 6.0.5). Then, auto-update works again.

            Hello NieseLee, <br />
<br />
I am sorry to hear that you are having an issue with Microsoft Outlook as you are constantly spammed by errors of illegal symbol in a folder's name. I know how annoying this can be, fret not, I will try my best to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />
I find that this thread may be relevant to you: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/12b798f5-d85d-4367-99fa-c14dd8818210/imap-invalid-folder-name?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/off...</a> <br />
<br />
In order for me to help you, I need the following information from you: <br />
<br />
1. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
2. Did you setup your email account with <strong>IMAP</strong> or <strong>Exchange ActiveSync</strong>?
<br />
3. Have you tried removing and re-adding the affected email account? <em>(unless you are using
<strong>POP3</strong> which may result in data loss) </em><br />
4. Just to confirm, what is your <strong>email service provider?</strong> Like Outlook.com, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail
<br />
<br />
Can you try to access your email account by its <strong>web version</strong> and verify if all folders have been renamed and none of them contain illegal character(s)?
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you may like to start Microsoft Outlook in <strong>safe mode</strong> and see if the issue persists:
<code>Windows</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>/safemode</code> <br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

            Hello NieseLee, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your response. I am sorry that my answer above was overwhelming for you, but it is a very comprehensive reply that contains most solutions that you could try at your own time.
<br />
<br />
No worries, we can do this together slowly. Let's started off with <strong>safe mode</strong>: on your keyboard, hold down
<code>Win</code> and <code>R</code>, a window will pop out and enter <code>/safemode</code>
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Outlook application will start up. Can you check if the issue persist? <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />
Sutharsan

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Following are likely solutions.<br />
<br />
1. Please try to repair your Office as a quick fix.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
6. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
7. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
8. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
9. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
10. File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options.<br />
<br />
11. Review the KB articles - https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592 and https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2779852<br />
<br />
12. If none of above works, please uninstall the current installed Office, and reinstall it again. Before resorting to uninstall, make sure that you have the license keys.<br />
<br />
To uninstall the Office, follow the instructions in the following support article: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 &amp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179/en-us<br />
<br />
Note: Ensure to save the Fix it on the desktop and then run the file.

<p>It looks like many of the labels on the buttons are in a larger than normal font size. The only way I'm aware of to affect that is a Windows setting: Go to Start button &gt; Settings icon &gt; System &gt; Display and look at the slider marked "Change the size of
 text, apps, and other items". I don't know the translation of that to Hebrew, but it looks like this in English:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d62beba1-15e0-4177-856c-72d8966a14f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d62beba1-15e0-4177-856c-72d8966a14f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's set to a value larger than 100%, move the slider to the 100% position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that isn't the cause, the next question is whether this problem appears in other programs. If it does appear, is it only in Office programs or in all programs?</p>

<p>Hi Janet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings...!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting. There could be many reasons for the Yammer page not appearing. We would need details of your Yammer network and user. These information cannot be shared on public forum, hence I would request you to create a service request with Yammer
 where we would help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to reply for further queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to get Skype for Business work while joining to a SfB meeting on my Mac OS. I can see the meeting in the app, I can even press the Join button, but after I press it I am redirected to the call window and I am constantly hearing the call sound.
 I can see attendees joining the meeting in that window but everything is black and I have the answer or cancel call buttons. By pressing the answer call nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get into the meeting successful if I use the "Skype Meetings App" for mac os.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following specs:</p>
<p>Skype for Business: 16.10.97</p>
<p>Mac OS: 10.13</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone has this issue? Can someone help me fix it?</p>
<p>

    <title>Tenant to Tenant migration - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tenant to Tenant migration</h2>
                    
<p>Hello&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please see if I have understood this correctly -</p>
<p>During the migration until we move &nbsp;the abc.com from a.tenant &nbsp;to b.tenant the users will continue to get the valid license from a.tenant. Once the &nbsp;switch &nbsp;and DNS &nbsp;change is made successfully the outlook profile needs to be recreated&nbsp; at which time it
 will get the &nbsp;license activation/ verification from b.tenant.</p>
<p>We will be purchasing new licenses on b.tenant for the migrated users. Will be using migrationwiz to migrated mailboxes. &nbsp; I believe rest of the &nbsp;Office suite handled once the profile is successfully added.</p>
<p>Do this sound correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any insight is appreciated.</p>

<p>hi smithanair,</p>
<p>basically, what you said in your original post are correct.</p>
<p>regarding the client system, i’d like to explain as below:</p>
<p>1. if the clients type in a.tenant and b.tenant are the same such as microsoft office 365 business. then you just need to activate the new office 365 account in the clients.</p>
<p>2. if the clients type in a.tenant and b.tenant are different. for example, a.tenant is microsoft office 365 business while b.tenant is microsoft office 365 proplus, then you need to uninstall the old microsoft office 365 business clients-&gt;install microsoft
 office 365 proplus clients from the office 365 portal of b.tenant-&gt;activate the new office 365 account in the new clients.</p>
<p>you can open the outlook or word client and then click <strong>file</strong>-&gt;<strong>office account</strong> to get the clients type. pictures below are for your reference:</p>

    <title>Deleting old Hotmail account now I have Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eve22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting old Hotmail account now I have Outlook</h2>
                    Hi there. I jumped at the chance of switching to Outlook as I've been getting so much junk mail to my hotmail account and so I'm gradually informing contacts of my new address. When I've finally done that, I'd like to delete my old hotmail account. (At
 the present time, I still receive all hotmail emails, which I get sent to a different folder.) My question is this: if I delete the old hotmail account, will I lose all the folders and emails therein that I transferred over when I switched to Outlook? I'd
 like to be able to keep them as an archive after I've closed the hotmail account down.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.<br />

            Hi Eve22,
<div><br />
<div>You've gotten some solid feedback, and it looks like you've found the resource you were looking for.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would just like to clarify, for yourself and others, that renaming or adding a new alias will still allow you to keep your current Microsoft account. That is to say, your e-mails, settings, contacts, etc. will remain intact.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should you decide to delete an alias at a later date (as you were suggesting), you can navigate to&nbsp;<a href="https://df.account.live.com/ManageAssocIds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/ManageAssocIds</a>. From this page you can add or delete aliases.</div>

            <p>There really isn't a printed time frame for how long the hotmail messages will be diverted to the renamed account,</p>
<p>I haven't done it and intend to keep my hotmail address.</p>
<p>As far as I know microsoft is just switching format and offering outlook.com email addresses as an option to users.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem likely they will force people to change email addresses if users do not wish to ?</p>
<p>I've noticed you have multiple issues so a ms tech should address them.</p>

<h2>            What is maximum speed for N95-1 in 3.5G network when downloading files &#63;</h2>
                    Hi, i wish to know what is the maximum speed in 3.5G (HSDPA) network... let say use N95 to download a file with 3 MB big...? For my country in Malaysia, althought my operator can support 3.5G up to 3.6mbps...but the maximum i experience in off-peak period
 ie early morning with less user online...is only 250kbps...so low ? ! if during peak period during day time it do reduced to less than 200kbps...<br />
<br />
I hope all N95 user with 3.5G signal seen when you all downlod a file or mp3 can tell me the maximum speed u can reached...<br />
<br />
Thanks !

            Some networks limit the speed to save on bandwidth. The signal strength also affects the speed.<br />
<br />
My network (O2 UK) used to limit 3G to the same speed as Edge (128kbps). They recently removed this limit and now I get full speed.<br />
<br />
The fastest stable speed i've had in a good signal area is just over 3mbps. On average I get around 1mbps due to the signal in my area.

            Exactly. The key phrase here is "up to". You can achieve theoretical speeds of
<u>up to</u> 3.6mbps (more than that in fact, I get bursts of 4-5 mbps on my N95-1).<br />
<br />
Also remember that this is a burst technology and that the speeds are not sustained over time.

Depending on how close I am to my WAP, I get transfer speeds of 100 to 160 kilobytes/sec while transferring data over an FTP connection. That's obviously nowhere near the highest throughput of 802.11b, let alone .11g, but then again WPA encryption might have
 something to do with that. I've not dared run my network with no encryption to see if there's any improvement.

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a very important email from 2010 (when outlook.com used to be Hotmail). I thought I kept it safe in my archive but somehow the mail got deleted by mistake from my hotmail account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It had a PDF attachment which I desperately want now. I have heard that email once written are kept forever in email service provider database? So it is possible to contact Microsoft team to help me retrieve the message. Or go to some hacker etc to get it
 back for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the email&nbsp;<strong>desperately.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>hi donna,<br />
<br />
commonly, in office 365, when creating a folder in favorites, a same folder will be created in inbox. removing the folder in favorites will not affect the folder in inbox. regarding your scenario, i would like to confirm some more details below before troubleshooting:<br />
1. as you said the folders didn’t show up in inbox folder and you can search the items in these folders, could you capture some screenshots on your side about upload them here for further research?<br />
to upload the screenshot, click "use rich formatting"&gt; "insert media".<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f941fb53-23c5-4251-869b-1d0aa795b423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df941fb53-23c5-4251-869b-1d0aa795b423" /></a><br />
2. office 365 subscription purchased directly from microsoft or other syndicate partners will have some differences. so do you purchase your office 365 subscription from microsoft or other syndicate partners like godaddy?
<br />
as the subscription purchased from microsoft and other syndicate partner will has some difference about the user interface, if you purchase your office 365 subscription from a syndicate partner like godaddy, you will need to contact the support of the syndicate
 partner to help you.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

            No not really. If you made 1 cell into 2 then both cells would have to occupy the cell address which just can not happen. Perhaps if you told us more about what you wanted to do we could give you&nbsp;a way around it.

            Are you talking about cells that contain text? If so, you can select the two cells and click the "Merge and Center" button (-a-), which is located in the Home tab next to the increase indent marker. The cells will then be joined into one.

                    In the latest Word for Mac (currently at version 15.30), is there any way to manually organize the order in which Styles appear in the Styles Pane? In my current pane, related styles are not grouped in the way I would like, and it is often hard to find

            This is not possible in the Mac user interface, though you can do so in a Windows version. As a workaround, I've written this article abut how to manage styles by hacking the Word XML files:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.brandwares.com/bestpractices/2015/12/xml-hacking-managing-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XML

<h2>            Show Total Number of Items - global</h2>
                    We have a shared mailbox that has over 50 folders.&nbsp; I've logged into the shared mailbox and changed the setting on each folder individually, however, each of the 250 people that also use the mailbox do not see the total number of items (they still see
 the default 'show number of unread items'). &nbsp;Is it seriously necessary for each person to click on each folder to change this setting?&nbsp; There has to be a better way to change this globally.

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One known reason why those folders disappears is because of a possible migration of your Hotmail account to Outlook. How long has it been missing on your account? Usually migration takes 2-4 days before everything will be successfully migrated.</p>
<p>

<p>About 6 days now, and I think I was already migrated to Outlook last year.</p>
<p>Any other helpful tips? How do I get in contact with somebody from hotmail/outlook? Because all my folders are gone even the deleted and sent items. And all important docs and pictures I put in folders...</p>

<p>If it’s past the migration time frame and you’re still not able to access folders on your Outlook, we need to gather some information to provide you with appropriate steps to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Which version of Outlook are you having this concern with, is it web-based Outlook or the installed app on your PC?</li><li>Are there any changes made recently on your email account?</li></ul>

<p>What can be done right now is to run the

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the web-based outlook. And up till now my folders are still not available. I already tried different browsers, but that also does not work.</p>
<p>If I logon to hotmail.com via my smartphone (using safari), I do get to see my folders and the emails in them.</p>
<p>So the good news is that it does not seem that my emails are gone. I just would like to know how I can get them back on my laptop.</p>

<p>It’s good to know that the emails are still there. I did research on a possible cause of the issue and troubleshooting steps as well however, your concern seems to be very unusual since they are both web-based.
 Outlook.com should be synced with one another since that is server-based, whichever platform you use should automatically be saved and you should be able to see those whichever browser and device you open it. I just need to check on this further, can you send
 us a screenshot of Outlook.com when opened on your laptop, and when opened on your mobile?</p>

<p>@Arthur, I guess this is not about the Migration. JMHO<br />
@D4nnyKr4 Try this instead.<br />
Go to outlook.live.com &gt; In the left side pane beside the "Folders" click the "+" (create new folder icon)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you got this error message "The email address associated with your Microsoft account can't be changed", did you rename your account successfully? It is possible your account was successfully renamed but currently moving your old account name's inbox
 to your new account name's inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, regarding this error message "The email address associated with your Microsoft account can't be changed", as of now, the Rename feature is currently not available.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Engineering team is aware of the problem and working to fix it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At this time, we don’t have a date when the feature will be restored.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I created a private message wherein you will provide some information we needed in order for us to investigate your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Please click on "You have a private reply to this message" link just above your post to view the message.</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 &#58; Junk Email Filter Settings</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original Title: filters&gt;</p>
<p>About a year ago we purchased a new desk top system and plugged it into our 6 system network. This new system replaced an XP/Outlook Express system and it came with Windows 7 and Outlook 2010. All other systems in our network are still XP/OE. In addition,
 we have only one email account and we all access it from each of our individual systems. Because we have no official tech and because I seem to be the bravest, this poor ol GPa is the Defaut Tech. While there are many things in this new 7/Outlook system we
 still are unable to figure out, we have found workarounds for most of them but there is one thing that we have not been able to work around - email filters, or at least we assume that's the problem we are having. Occasionally Outlook, but none of the OE's,
 will send an email to spam that is actually company business. We would like to look at the spam filters and see if an adjustment is available that may reduce these misdirections but have been unable to find anything that we recognize as email filters. Because
 of all this we would greatly appreciate any links to email filter tutorials - how to find them as well as how to use them - any may wish to share. All ideas, comments, suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, K.</p>

            Thanks Nayana S M for considering and responding to my post. Just followed a couple of the links. You have provided the part I consider the most imortant - How To Find The Filter. As soon as everyone gets here and settled in this morning we will be giving
 this a try. Really appreciate your help, K.<br />

<p>
</p><p>This is an annoying re-occurring intermittent problem with Microsoft's update website. Various posts about this problem go unanswered. This is not a client issue. It happens on multiple computers, multiple versions of IE, multiple OSes, across the world.
 Microsoft, please fix this.</p>
<p>1. visit site https://catalog.update.microsoft.com</p>
<p>2. search</p>
<p>3. add item to basket</p>
<p>4. view basket</p>

            On a whim, I tried again and didn't get the error. I happened to have access to remote to a Windows Server 2012 R2 desktop which is located two time zones away and uses a different internet ISP. The version of IE is 11.&nbsp;

            This error unfortunately seems to be by design. &nbsp;It happens periodically and we can't do anything but wait until the site just magically works again. &nbsp;Shame on ms.
