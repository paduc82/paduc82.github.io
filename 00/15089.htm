<h2>            Project 2016 - Visual Reports - Save Data</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Project 2016 to integrate with an ERP. My goal is to read information about Resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, I use VSTO and I export all data to an mdb file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The line that do the trick is that:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">projApp.VisualReportsSaveDatabase(FileNameCompleteMdb, PjVisualReportsDataLevel.pjLevelDays)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This command works very well, but some of my users are using Project 2016 in another Language - Portuguese-BR</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, the access database generated has all its fields in Portuguese and all my select statements fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I force to Save the MS Access database in English, independently of the current language of the software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Pivot tables crash &#47; close Access under Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly corbet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot tables crash &#47; close Access under Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a database that has not had this problem using both Access 2007 and Access 2010 on Windows XP.&nbsp; I recently got a new laptop with Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (32-bit) and when I copy the database there and try to open any existing pivot table, it completely
 crashes the database - no error message - it just closes Access completely.<br />
<br />
I can bring up the queries in Design view or run them in datasheet view, but they all crash when I switch to pivottable view.<br />
<br />
Once, I was able to run a simple query that did not have anything set up for a pivot table, switch to pivot table view and create a pivot table just fine.&nbsp; I then made it default to pivot table view and it still worked.&nbsp; And after that ALL my already created
 pivot tables worked as well!<br />
<br />
Then I made some changes to the copy of the database on my Windows XP computer, and when I copied that version to the Windows 7 computer, all the pivot tables started crashing in the same way again.&nbsp; And to top it off, I have not been able to do what I did
 before when I created a pivot table from scratch and got them all to work again.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Kelly

            Just to follow up with some additional details...&nbsp; when I create a new query and then go to pivot table view, as soon as I drag and drop a field into the pivot table, Access closes down with no message at all.&nbsp; In a couple instances, the pivot tables have
 started to work, but I have not been able to consistently reproduce whatever led to them working, so I have no idea why.<br />

    <title>Word not opening docx files from Dropbox on iPad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevedude95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word not opening docx files from Dropbox on iPad</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i have Word on iPad and have linked it with my Dropbox so I can save files I create on my iPad to there and edit/view files in my Dropbox. However, when I try to open word files from my Dropbox (all .docx created on a windows laptop), it begins to download
 the file and then comes up with 2 error messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first one says: sorry, we can't open ."</p>
<p>and then the second says: a file error has occurred&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to be able to open .doc files and files created on my iPad, but not .docx files from my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            Are those the completer error messages?<br />
<br />
Can you access the docx files&nbsp;through Word online?&nbsp;If no, then it could be something to do&nbsp;with the security function.<br />
<br />
Check if you can open the&nbsp;docx files from onedrive.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Could there be be some security function blocking the opening of documents due to the fact the my office 365 subscription and onedrive are provided by my university, while my Dropbox is personal, and so is connected to a different account/email
 address altogether?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have found some sort of work around though. If I first open the file in Dropbox, and then press 'open with' the word app, word will open the document and then give me the option to save a duplicate of the document. Interestingly I can save
 this duplicate back to my Dropbox and then open/edit it</span></p>

</p><p>I recently learned that the error only occurs on certain folders, specifically with ones that have "#" in their name. &nbsp;I tried creating a doc in word, saved it to my main dropbox folder, then opened it with no problem. &nbsp;Then tried opening another doc under
 a folder with # in the name, it would not open. &nbsp;Went to a random folder without # in the name, opened a random doc no issues. &nbsp;It appears the problem I am having is with opening any doc with # in the folder name the doc is contained in. &nbsp;I haven't tried with
 any other symbols, I only use # and just to keep the folder at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I get specifically is "Cannot find file - The location has changed since you last opened the file." and then "A file error has occurred." after I click ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll try testing other symbols to see what works with dropbox and word and allows me to open files.</p>

            I was getting the same error, but for me it only appeared when the file name had # in it, not the folder. I found that if I went to the file via the dropbox app, clicked the three dot icon in the upper right corner, selected rename, and then renamed the
 file so that the # was removed, I could open the file through the microsoft word app no problem. It seems that you were on the right track, and that the error has to do with the # symbol being in the file name.

    <title>Why can&#39;t I import an OLM file &#40;Outlook for Mac&#41; to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david-cslu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I import an OLM file &#40;Outlook for Mac&#41; to Outlook for Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As I ave seen in several other questions/answers, there is no pssibility to import an OLM file (that's how PST files are called in Microsoft's Mac version of Outlook) into Outlook for Windows. The other way round it's possible. It's no problem to import
 PST files in Microsoft Office for Mac. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now this seems to be quite absurd because this means that Microsoft helps their customers to switch to the competitions operating system (Mac) while they don't help Mac users to switch (back) to Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now I have called Microsofts German Hotline about this issue and have been told that they can't do it because of problems with the license agreement. He told me that Apple somehow puts some signature on the OLM file on the Mac so that it's not legally possible
 to import it on a Windows machine.</p>
<p>But this seems a bit strange(although not impossible)&nbsp; to me because I don't see why Apple should mess around with the OLM files which are produced by Microsoft's Office for Mac. So I'm wondering if the guy form the hotline maybe has missunderstood me and
 was thining that I'm trying to import some database file form 'Apple Mail' and not form 'Outlook for Mac'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I pose the question again here: What is the reason that I can't import an Outlook for Mac database file in Outlook for Windows?</p>
<p>It should be Microsofts innermost interest to make it possible because otherwise they are scaring away users that are willing to switch form Mac to Windows...</p>
<p><br />

            I precisely do not know the reason why it cannot be imported in outlook for windows.<br />
<br />
Might be some the platform design makes some kind of difference...<br />
<br />
AFAIK this is how it is designed to work.<br />
<br />
Tried looking for definite reason and i ran out of luck.<br />
<br />
We need to wait to check if someone has an answer to this.<br />

            <p>I found a solution to bypass parts of the issue that does cos't nothing but a bit of effort.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Export all the Mail-Folders (e.g. Inbox, Sent, ...) of your Outlook for Mac as MBOX files (you can do this only by drag-and-dropping them right out of Outlook onto your desktop or some other folder.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Copy those MBOX files to the Windows machine</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. There you have to use an MBOX to EML converter (there are some available as freeware) to make single EML files for every e-mail stored in the MOBX files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Then you can drag-and-drop those EML files inot your Outlook for Windows</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But the solution is not perfect, because Outlook for Windows doesn't show the date and subject of the mail in the list view.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This morning in Hotmail i wanted to forward my emails to my work email address but i entered the wrong email address.&nbsp; I also selected thew option to NOT save messages in my hotmail account which means i think i've missed emails sent to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i wasn't getting emails i expected coming through i checked and realised my mistake. Is there anyway of finding out if i've missed any emails sent to me but forwarded to the wrong email address i entered and not saved in my Hotmail email list?</p>
<p>

</p><p>If you used WU download you can copy the 14332 ESD from the $WINDOWS.~BT &gt; sources &nbsp;folder on your c: drive if it hasent been to long and convert it to a mountable/ burnable ISO file and maybe re install the new build that way either mount it inside of Windows
 or create a bootable USB or DVD ( tell it not to update in the set up tick box it's faster and may not stall that way ) and use the standard install ( not custom ) if you want to keep your files ,data and apps or do a clean install . Then update 14332 &nbsp;later
 normally in the WU setting run time app it'a all really very simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;AFAIK there aren't any or many updates to 14332 right now anyway .</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I always copy a new WU ESD right away then re start install or clean install&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Phishing Scam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
When I attempted to log in to my Outlook email today, I was blocked due to the need to verify my account. It was not an email, but a screen block that prevented me from email access. There was a code process where they sent codes to my phone and email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email the code came from was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
<br />
The phone number the other code came from was 855-330-8653.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very concerned that I may have opened myself up to a phishing scam because it wasn't an email and I went through the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please verify if this email and phone number are legitimate to the Microsoft company?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they aren't, there is a widespread scam filtering through the place I work, and I will need to warn them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any more details, please let me know.</p>

</p>
<p>You were asked "if you could "log in"? Why when you stated your are "Blocked"?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried what you suggested but it still doesn't work. It's stange because it gives me the results of something in my computer like movies etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just settings on my pc that would not be displayed. Like fonts or device manager etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rebecca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are sure about that this is the spam emails, you can try blocking the sender and do not click any link in the email for security reason. For blocking the sender, as an Office 365 user, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for "now they are ocming in to shared email inboxes - I have also lost 10,000 emails in my inbox", do you mean the spam emails are filled your inbox, as a result, your original emails are covered by the spam emails or you mean the original good emails
 really loose?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean the former situation, you can delete the spam emails after blocking the sender; if the latter situation, (if you are an admin) you can try searching the emails via the Office 365 eDiscovery &amp; Search. You may contact your admin for help if you
 are not an admin.<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/praveenkumar/2013/07/19/how-to-do-in-place-ediscovery-in-new-o365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/praveenkumar/2013/07/19/how-to-do-in-place-ediscovery-in-new-o365/</a></p>

<h2>            Message saying Microsoft Office 2016 is not activated - I bought Home and Business, but it tells me it is Professional Plus</h2>
                    <p>I bought Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 about a month ago, activated it with a product key, and everything has been fine thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I started getting this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Microsoft Office Activation Wizard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation Wizard</p>
<p>
</p><p>This copy of Microsoft Office is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 1 day left to activate. Ensure you are connected to your corporate network to ensure automatic activation. Your system administrator can help'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the Account File it says 'Activation Required: Microsoft Professional Plus 2016.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confused, because I purchased and downloaded and have been using Home and Business, not Professional Plus, so am not sure what I should now do. Nor do I have a corporate network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me out on this?</p>

<h3> jonvonnieda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nvidia 680 driver update 10166</h2>
                    I have been having issues getting my machine up to TH1. &nbsp; I have tried numerous things and did see TH1 show up at one point but failed out on a x### something error. &nbsp;I keep getting updates such as a nvidia 680 update that installed fine but seems to break
 my second screen, also the main screen has a black border around the edges but still shows up in the settings as 1920x1080. &nbsp;Downloading the drivers from nvidia directly and installing them fixes the issue but the windows update still has the driver that downloads
 when I check for windows updates. &nbsp; If I install that it breaks again and basically then I am back to square one.

    <title>Does ActiveSync work at all&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward forgacs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does ActiveSync work at all&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a HP iPAQ 212 with Windows Mobile 6 a couple of months ago and have had nothing but trouble with it due to ActiveSync's inability to perform virtually any function correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is syncing to Exchange 2007 and using ActiveSync 4.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am utterly fed up with the device and about to return it for a refund. Before I do, I thought I'd ask if anyone has encountered any of the following problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* At least 9 out of 10 times when I try to sync, it fails to connect. I constantly have to reset the the device and flip the connection settings - especially noticeable when I alternate between Wifi, the USB cable and bluetooth via a phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Emails I have sent completely disappear from Exchange. No "reply" or "forward" flag on messages, and nothing in the Sent Items or Deleted Items folder. I even searched my entire mailbox for some messages - so I have no idea whether I actually
 replied to a message or not. Not in the outbox on the PDA either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The "completed" or "follow up" flags are never synchronized properly when a message is moved out of the inbox. Occasionally they sync properly if the messages are left in the inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Despite entering and saving&nbsp;password on the PC, it refuses to sync without re-entering the password on the device on every single connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I have verified (via the Exchange server logs) that two messages I sent this morning which "synced" never sent at all, they just vanished without a trace...completely lost, not even in the drafts folder.</p>

<p>Greetings Edward Forgacs!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Owners Circle Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you are experiencing the number of problem you related to us.&nbsp; I'll try to answer the questions that I can address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong> Using ActiveSync 4.5 (AS), you will not be able to perform a sync via WiFi.&nbsp; This has been removed after version 3.8.&nbsp; Your only choices left are to use USB, InfraRED,&nbsp;or Bluetooth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth via phone may not work unless
 your Data service on the phone allows for "tethering" (allowing access to the internet to other external devices through your phone).&nbsp; Failure of WiFi and BT would therefore not be the fault of your iPAQ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. &amp;&nbsp; 3.)</strong> The number of options you wish to utilize in mail may require the purchase of a higher-end 3rd party application such as FlexMail.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may download and install a trial-version to see if this program meets your needs.&nbsp;
 If this doesn't resolve your problems, you may need to consider purchasing a UMPC (ultra-mobile PC), which will have an XP or Vista tablet edition OS installed.&nbsp; Here you can use Outlook for the PC, so all of your needs will be met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.)</strong> If the password needs to be entered on the Device, several issues could be happening.&nbsp; If you have "password protection upon turning the device on" setup on the device, then obviously this is normal.&nbsp; If you have this option
 disabled, and you are having the problem via BT AS sessions, then the challenge may result from not having "paired" the device with the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you experience the challenge when using the&nbsp;normal USB connection, then it sounds like you need to delete the partnership
 profile on the PC and start-over again.&nbsp; This may also clear up other issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps you in your endeavors!&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us know if any of them help, or if you need more assistance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for the follow up.<br />
<br />
1) I'm not sure I quite understand this, but I am using Wifi from the PDA directly, not via the PC. USB is via the PC and bluetooth is via the phone.<br />
<br />
All three mechanisms work sometimes, but bluetooth and Wifi are totally intermittent. Often with Bluetooth, for example, I don't even get the message on the phone asking whether I want to allow the IPAQ connection - so it isn't a problem with the phone.<br />
<br />
Wifi has the same problem - it connects to the Wifi network, but ActiveSync often complains it can't connect to the server, and a PDA reset is required before it successfully syncs.<br />
<br />
I should also point out I am not trying to use Wifi while the USB cable is plugged in - I am aware that won't work, and I believe it is set up to disable Wifi when USB is connected.<br />
<br />
2 &amp; 3) I don't think this really answers my question...is there a specific reason why none of these (basic) features work as they should? Is it just that ActiveSync is buggy, or is there some documentation that states they are unsupported? Obviously I need
 a highly portable solution so the other options are not possible.<br />
<br />
4) You are correct that the device is set up with a password (enforced from the Exchange server), but I specifically set up ActiveSync to remember the password, and the prompt keeps coming up on the PDA, not ActiveSync, then I get a "timed out waiting for credentials
 error" before I look at the device screen and realise what is happening. Can't I get it to save the credentials on the PC?<br />

<p>Hello Edward!&nbsp;&nbsp; (the one who asked the question anyways)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds as though you have multiple problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.)</strong> When you connect to the PC via USB, ActiveSync remains in that USB mode until you manually change the computer that it is supposed to interface with.&nbsp; Presumably you only have one PC that you are attempting to Sync with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.)</strong> When you attempt to utilize WiFi, your Server must be within the same domain network that your Exchange Server is in.&nbsp; If you are at a coffee-shop hotspot, you'll need to establish a WiFi connection, then after you are connected
 to the internet, you will also need to start a VPN connection to your Server's Domain network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.)</strong> When you attempt to bridge a connection via BT to your phone, you have to clear two hurdles: Primarily, the relationship between your phone and PDA must be pre-setup by way of pairing.&nbsp; Both have to readily recognize each
 other.&nbsp; Secondarily, your service provider has to allow you to bridge your BT connection over to their data service. This is typically referred to as tethering.&nbsp; You need to ensure that your provider allows this, or else this particular equation will be dead
 in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have a clear connection from the PDA to the internet via the phone (and the BT pairing), you will once again need to setup a VPN connection to your Exchange Server's domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe a quick check of the VPN server logs will indicate that your VPN connections are not stable enough to allow the BT and WiFi connections to work consistently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Not sure what you mean by "ActiveSync remains in USB mode"? It does allow me to sync on the PDA when it is disconnected to the computer, just that it only works sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The server I am using Wifi with is on the same domain - I have not even bothered to try and get it to work from other hot spots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Clearly it is not a service provider issue because it is possible to get the bluetooth to work (and I know the service provider supports this as I am using a data plan with them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no VPN being used in the equation (in any of the sync methods) at all because it is running over Exchange 2007 RPC over HTTP - and as stated before it is possible to get it to work sometimes, it just isn't reliable.</p>
        </p>

<p>Can't reproduce it anymore now in 2010<br />
Maybe my xlb file was bad when I test it</p>
<p>I have try it in 2007 and can't reproduce your problem</p>
<p>Start with renaming or deleting your xlb file and post back with the results<br />
with the exact problem that you see after you run the code<br />

<p>Here are the steps again</p>
<p>Maybe you have a corrupt or bloated xlb file <strong>normal</strong> size is &lt; 30 kb.<br />
The .xlb file has all Toolbar customization in it.</p>
<p>1) Close Excel<br />
2) Do a search for .xlb in Windows (Use: search hidden files and folders)<br />
3) Rename or delete the .xlb file or files (In 2007 the name = Excel12.xlb)<br />
4) Start Excel</p>
<p>Deleting the file or renaming will do no harm to your system<br />
Excel will create a new file for you. (You lost your customization remember that)<br />
If you make your own toolbars or add buttons to the others<br />
this file is important (backup it so you can restore it)<br />
&nbsp;See if that fix it so you can use PasteSpecial again</p>

<h2>            inserting pdf file into powerpoint 2007</h2>
                    <p>I have a pdf file (with several pages) where I have to select the individual pages I want, copy them, and paste them onto slides in a powerpoint document. This is a daily routine.</p>
<p>Is there a way to import the pages from the pdf file into the powerpoint presentation&nbsp;as individual slides?</p>
<p>Or export the pdf file into a powerpoint document and&nbsp;in the process each page becomes its own powerpoint slide?</p>

            Part of the information is derived from the user information data. The easiest thing to do is this:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>In the main menu bar, select <i>Word &gt; Preferences &gt; User information</i> (it's in the last line of icons)</li><li>Fill in all the information</li><li>If the information in the Résumé does not update, do <i>Edit &gt; Select All</i> (or
<i>Command A</i>), then press <i>F9</i> to update the fields</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Another thing you can do is get rid of the fields by replacing them with their current values:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><i>Edit &gt; Select All</i>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<i>Command A</i>)</li><li>Press&nbsp;<span>⌘&nbsp;SHIFT F9</span></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>The first method has the advantage that any other smart template you use from now on will have all the information already filled in for you.</div>

    <title>What is the best way to sync outlook contacts to an android phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevy kev  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the best way to sync outlook contacts to an android phone</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I Just picked up a Samsung Note phone and need to sync my contacts from outlook.com in order to use them on the phone for calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Microsoft phones... years ago I had an android and it kept deleting my contacts... so I am worried about messing up my outlook database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also prefer that google does not have all my contacts, and that this phone does not alter the contacts in outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>

<p>Yes, using the android outlook app, my contacts are showing.&nbsp; However, the pictures are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had selected outlook to sync with the contacts and it keept failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Contacts, select settings, then accounts, then Outlook, then sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally deleted all contacts and the cache, then retried syncing.&nbsp; Now it seem to have finally synced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even some of the faces show.&nbsp; (odd because they do not in the outlook android app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I miss being able to link contacts from other sources like FB.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Emails are being deleted if I shut down my computer</h2>
                    <p>Since I got windows 8 it seems I have no control over what happens to my mail. If I shut my computer or even sleep it when I go back into my e-mail all my mail is gone; It even is gone, on occasion, just out of the blue. I have two questions. The first is
 how do I keep the e-mails active and only delete the ones I want deleted and not have the system decide which ones and when&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;and two} how do I create folders that I can move e-mails into. (I do not want them in documents but rather within the realm of e-mail}

<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>
