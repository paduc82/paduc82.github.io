<h2>            Where Hotmail.com archived my old emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have some old emails that I want to keep. I highlighted all emails and clicked to archive them all. The system confirms they have been archived. To make sure they are archived, I am trying to find where they were saved in my hard drive; I just cannot find
 them. Where Hotmail.com archived my old emails?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

                    I have been using Outlook 2010 for sometime and now suddenly when I print my monthly calendar some of my appointments are missing. I have read several post here and some stated to change the month view to high detail which I have but it does not fix my
 problem.&nbsp; In the print preview I can see some days with appointments but some days are missing. Please help!<br />

            Yes the appointments to show up in the month view. When I go to print the only appointments that appear are on the weekends. I did ensure that the option "Print only Workdays" was not selected. This issue effects every month.<br />

            I'm also having this problem. What's weird is that it is a recurring appointment that was showing up when I printed until this month. I've tried cancelling and starting over, changing colors, deleting the whole series and rescheduling. I can't get the
 appointment to show up when I print. I don't have it marked as private or anything like that.

            <p>I FIGURED IT OUT!! When you go to print, look at the hours. Mine was marked as print from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Any meetings scheduled before 8, weren't printing! I changed to 7:00 AM to 5:00, and lo and behold, IT WORKS!</p>

<h2>            Word Formatting Marks Keep appearing</h2>
                    Formatting marks keep appearing.&nbsp; I have gone to the options/view and "All" is always checked in the formatting marks section.&nbsp; After I uncheck it, I go back to my documet and begin typing. As soon as the first character&nbsp;typed the formatting mark appears.
 I have uninstalled Office and reinstalled it.&nbsp; This did not fix the problem. Where are the configurations stored? I have asked that before and was told normal.dat. There is no normal*.* anywhere on the computer.

<p>Doing this will create a Normal.dot and the Formatting Marks will be taken care of.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Email folders won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cicadacat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Email folders won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to Windows 10--BIG MISTAKE!!!&nbsp; I have Windows Live Email 2012 that worked fine until I kept getting emails saying I needed to update to Windows 10 because otherwise I might not be able to get my emails due to system changes etc.&nbsp; It continued
 to work, though, probably because I didn't attempt to access my email through Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day I received an email that said I needed to do repairs to Windows Live Email 2012 and, like a fool, I clicked on the link and downloaded the repairs.&nbsp; All seemed to be working until I tried to access subfolders within folders:&nbsp; for example, my
 Travel folders has subfolders for various airlines, Super Shuttle, cruise info.&nbsp; Those folders are all missing.&nbsp; I tried doing a restore but the folders were still missing.&nbsp; I had to log onto the web and access Hot Mail from there and then move every subfolder
 into the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access mail through Windows 10 but, although the folders show up, when I click on any of them I get a message "not synched yet."&nbsp; I have no idea of how to do this.&nbsp; You would think it would be automatic but no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a piece of ****; I'm tired of trying to make this work and want to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; I very much regret updating to this.</p>
<p>

            <p>The folders wouldn't open in Windows Live Mail 2012.&nbsp; I had to go online and open my Hotmail account from there rather than Windows Live Mail 2012 and then remove each subfolder and put it under Inbox before it would appear in Windows Live Mail 2012 Outlook.&nbsp;
 This started when I clicked on the repair link on the email I received several days ago.&nbsp; Now when I open a new email or respond to one, I have to add the contact back in because it doesn't recognize the sender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the Windows 10 Mail app, the folders are there but don't open.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I click on one of my folders, I see "Not synced yet" and then it switches&nbsp;"We didn't find anything to show here" but I know the folders have emails in them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet reverted to Windows 7; I wrote that I am thinking about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a disappointment.&nbsp; I should not be having as many problems with it as I have been experiencing.&nbsp; Why put out an inferior product that doesn't work correctly?</p>

            <p>After getting no help at all&nbsp;from the Windows 10 engineers, I did some experimenting.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's ridiculous that they would put out something that doesn't&nbsp;automatically transfer your email folders and then not be able to tell you how to fix the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize:&nbsp; My list of folders I've added were there but, when I tried to open the folders, I'd get a message that nothing could be found and that the folders hadn't been synced yet.&nbsp; I couldn't find anything that would help me and I did a lot of searching.&nbsp;
 Finally, I stumbled on what seems to be the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open&nbsp;Windows 10 Outlook and right click.&nbsp; Go to Acct Setting and click on change email sync settings.&nbsp; Set download email to Anytime.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;folders and click on one.&nbsp; At the top where you see the search box with the magnifying glass, click on the rounded arrows next to it.&nbsp; When I did this, mine started syncing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of folders so it is taking some time to sync them all.&nbsp; I started about 25 minutes ago and some of the folders now show their contents but most are scrolling with a "still syncing" message at the bottom.</p>

    <title>Improved Rollbacks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennis_c-jr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Improved Rollbacks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Under the framework of the Windows Technical Preview, would it be possible for Updates to appear on a Rollback menu as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>9926</strong> <em>(initial Release)</em></p>
<p><strong>9926a</strong></p>
<p><strong>9926b</strong></p>
<p><strong>9926c</strong></p>
<p>.. and so on?&nbsp; Even going so far as to, if there is still a calendar involved with choosing a
<strong>Restore Point</strong>, show the <strong>Build Update</strong> number ON a specific date in the calendar?&nbsp; This would give
<strong>Insider</strong> participants the ability to jump from <strong>9926c</strong> back to
<strong>9926a</strong> IF they had made notes for themselves to the effect, 'The last time my video/audio/network/VMware-thingy worked correctly was in Build
<strong>a</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I was thinking, <em>'Man it would be great if the Sign-in screen could show the last two or three Builds, and ALL OF THEM could still be
</em><strong><em>fully working installations</em></strong><em> the User could log-on to.'</em> but that would probably pose a GIANT technical hurdle, and be kind of disruptive to the User experience (mentioned here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the "point" of testing out the features of the Preview Builds as they are released is to move the ball forward on the playing field.&nbsp; I completely understand when Users write they want to delay the installation of the next Release, because
 evaluating a system TAKES TIME and for myself, I know I do not like to rush through these things.&nbsp; But, we must also consider the pace of development of the software itself; literally Microsoft must have suggestions and "fixes" to give to the Engineers and
 Programmers to keep them busy.&nbsp; I know, I know, that even sounds a little ridiculous to me, but there is a pace to everything these days and idle employees are unproductive employees...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to keep notes on my "User experience" as I go along, fully realizing I will not get to "test" every aspect of each Build, so it is important to maintain a sense of perspective on my "position" relative to the changes as they roll-out.&nbsp; Here is
 a sample of my notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Registry backup file sizes:</strong></p>
<p>Build 9841:&nbsp; 170,155 KB<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 9879:&nbsp; 214,537 KB (26.083% larger)<br />
- Includes Internet Explorer 11.0.9879.0<br />
- 1/25/2015 at 10:07 PM.<br />
&nbsp; Used a USB drive to copy "bookmark.html" file from the<br />
&nbsp; LAB laptop and import the file.&nbsp; Everything worked as<br />
&nbsp; expected and the alerts shown when the Thumb Drive was<br />
&nbsp; plugged in were nice and visually informative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 9926:&nbsp; 221,105 KB (3.061% larger)<br />
- Installed on 1/28/2015.<br />
- Significant changes made to the Start button and Start<br />
&nbsp; menus.<br />
- Using the Photos App to import images from London CD<br />
&nbsp; #1. 1/28 @ 3:27 AM. (won't due much with this, cause<br />
&nbsp; of the late hour)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes to all.</p>

    <title>Tried out Windows 10 Technical Preview in x64, should I try it in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincentconcepcion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tried out Windows 10 Technical Preview in x64, should I try it in x86&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a dual-boot of Win 8.1 Pro <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>(x86)</em></span> and&nbsp;Win10 Technical Preview <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>(x64)</strong></span></em> and I'm quite happy with Technical Preview running really well and snappy&nbsp;on my notebook hardware (core 2 duo t5870, intel integrated
 GMA, 4gb ram, readyboost SD &amp; USB).&nbsp; The only aspect that I can't test out yet&nbsp;is running PC&nbsp;games that require dx9, I think an eventual update will resolve that.&nbsp; (<em>*Btw, games from the App Store, like Halo Assault, work well.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I did notice is the Hardware Reserved amount&nbsp;is different between Win8.1 x86 and Win10 TP x64:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left"><em>Windows 10 Technical Preview x64:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Useable RAM: 3.83gb</em></li><li><em>Hardware Reserved: 168mb</em></li></ul>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Windows 8.1 Pro x86:&nbsp;the usable&nbsp;RAM&nbsp;is lower than average</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Useable RAM: 2.84gb</em></li><li><em>Hardware Reserved: 1.2gb</em></li></ul>
<p>Question #1 Will running x64 deny the ability to run a game the requires a GPU of 256MB?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question #2 Should I remove Technical Preview x64 and install <strong><em>Technical Preview x86
</em></strong>to see if&nbsp;itwill retain or&nbsp;keep something close to&nbsp;the previous amount of Hardware Reserved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*The reasoning behind the questions is that the most hardware-demanding game I can currently run is&nbsp;Shogun 2 Total War (which is a miracle in itself) on Windows 8.1 x86&nbsp;and the minimum requirement for it to run is a&nbsp;GPU of&nbsp;256MB and I eventually want to
 see how well it runs in Technical Preview.&nbsp; Also, I don't have the option in the BIOS to change the graphics amount.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything helps, thanks!</p>

            I was getting D3D9 errors on my system until I downgraded my Intel graphics drivers, but I'm using a much newer processor than you and I believe the downgrade just allowed the integrated card pass off the graphics to the dedicated card, because my games
 are running way too well to be using the integrated card, but you could try installing a different version of your Intel graphics drivers to see if that helps your dx9 issue.<br />
<br />
Good luck! &nbsp;Have a good one!

<p>Thanks for the advice, I rolled back to the manufacturer driver but dx9 wasn't included for some reason but that was still&nbsp;good cause now I can disable any power saving features for better 'performance'.&nbsp; I ended up unpacking and running the .exe from "DirectX
 End-User Runtimes (June 2010)" and that solved the missing error.</p>

<p>I don't have access to that setting in the BIOS because I'm running S2TW and NTW on a non-gaming laptop.&nbsp; Fortunately these games allow for adjusting video memory in the scripts.</p>

<p>I agree, hopefully MS will provide the option for us to choose to upgrade to x64 when upgrading to Windows 10;&nbsp; I didn't have that option when I upgraded to 8.1.</p>

            Don't&nbsp;use x86 anymore. You will not be able to play the last games, loose the ability to have more than 4Gb Ram,... I'm now testing the x86 version for a first test, but be sure that my setup will run the x64 version.

            Back button should work fine.<br />
I think it is a hardware issue, you need to visit your nearest Nokia care centre for repairs.<br />
Proof of purchase might be required and the service is free of charge if phone is under warranty.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

    <title>Inserting a row does not copy my formula into the new row - but Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wooderios  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting a row does not copy my formula into the new row - but Data Validation List does copy into new row</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a&nbsp;file that has:</p>
<p>a) Data Validation (drop down list of names on a Hidden TAB)</p>
<p>b) Hidden Columns (I am still using IF functions to calculate other columns)</p>
<p>c) Sheet Protection &amp; Hidden (I have allowed users to&nbsp;Insert&nbsp;Row without knowing the password)&nbsp;</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Specific cells password protected&nbsp;(Edit Ranges) for authorisation at a later stage</p>
<p>* I have not set the rows as a table, as I clicked / dragged the formulas down initially before locking the Sheet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I 'insert row', the Data Validation List is applied in the new row, but my formulas are not.
</p>
<p>I tried setting the data as a TABLE - but this was done after the sheet had been created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried writing a simple MACRO - but when I run it, it asks for the password - which I don't want to give to the people using the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to understand (solve) is why the formulas are not copying down when I insert a row between two rows that have the formula already.
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi Beth, thank you for such a quick reply.</p>
<p>The idea is to have the supervisor of the sheet 'insert rows' when nearing the end to keep the file going and going.</p>
<p>I did a small table, as you suggested, and can get the formula inserting - but once I lock certain columns, it stops working.</p>
<p>The file I have (not a TABLE) is too much work to redo and I need to keep it locked. It's time sheet / salary related so cannot have it open for amendments.
</p>
<p>So, for now I'm looking for a way to keep the&nbsp;protection and insert the new rows/formulas without giving out the password.
</p>
<p>Next thing may need to be a VBA script to add rows that does recognise&nbsp;the password.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Lyndon&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, if you need to keep a portion of the range for the insert row&nbsp;locked and want the formula to be copied, sheet protection won't work for you and you'd need to go with VBA. That said, is it possible to store the info in the locked column and
 use a formula to reference it in the unprotected range? That way, the only possible modification&nbsp;would be to a formula rather than the actual data. Perhaps if we had&nbsp;more details on what you're trying to lock, exactly, we could offer other ideas.

            <p>Thanks again for such a quick reply Beth. </p>
<p>The data entry sheet has a pivot table sitting on it so we can analyse&nbsp;by staff/month/years. So as the rows increase, so the pivot grows. At a certain point, we will need to increase the number of rows and I wanted my supervisor to be able to do this rather
 than come back to me for password unlock.</p>
<p>From the unlocked data entry fields, I am calculating various numbers / hours / weekend worked: yes no etc... through the formulas I've created. So for me, the formula cannot be changed as it determines salary etc...
</p>
<p>I thought of saving each month into an individual TAB by month to prevent the original TAB from 'overflowing', but then the pivot isn't working as I don't have a unique relationship item.
</p>
<p>For now, as I'm not VBA literate, I'm going to just create a 600 row master&nbsp;TAB and increase when I reach the end. And start learning VBA.</p>
<p>Thanks again. Lyndon</p>

<h2>            Insiders Slow v16.17 VERY SLOW at saving files on Mac</h2>
                    Anyone notice how much (and painful) it is to save a file on V16.17 PPT? I just upgraded to solve a previous issue, and I'm finding the writing to my SSD really really slow ... so slow I'm wondering if an old pixelated hour glass is going to come back
 to my screen from the early 90s.

<p>As I recall The Hourglass was Windows invention It would flip over and the sand would move again Back in the day of OS 3-9, a Black and white pinwheel was the wait symbol.</p>
<p>

<p>Ha! You may be right ... the flipping sand was thinking perhaps. Anyway, I get the spinning colour wheel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the file is 680MB and it takes 8-10 seconds to save with a spinning color wheel and it happens on all PPTXs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW, I try it with a file with a single slide that is 40MB and it's very fast. I try the same change on the same file on an older version of PPT and it appears to me it saved much faster. Is there a large file I/O handler going on, or perhaps a bigger checksum
 or something? But it was noticeable.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience with us. To confirm the situation, we'd like to confirm whether the problem happens since you update to PowerPoint for Mac 16.17, and can you remember how long does
 it take in the previous version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can provide a sample file via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a> to us so we can try to reproduce the problem on our side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>So here is an update to thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One my one Mac that is running Insider's Slow v180909 it DOES NOT HAPPEN (~2 seconds to save)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other Mac also running Insider's Slow but v180904 it DOES HAPPEN (this is where I experienced the problem - ~10-12 seconds to save to SSD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I updated the slow save Mac and it shows v180909 now --- BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS on that machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be a save setting on the one Mac?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested it on a smaller file (580 MB)&nbsp; and I had the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested it on a different large file that was 280 MB and ... it saved in 3 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a file that is 80 MB it saved in 2 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all on the Slow Save computer. I could test the same file on one more Mac if you want,</p>

            Hi there. Sorry for delay. I do find it very slow for large files ... much slower than other files or this same large file on another machine. Are there some save settings perhaps I should look at that could be the difference.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's think about this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the RAM amount the same on both Macs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the file type the same? I recommend using Excel Binary file format (.xlsb) for large files. Personally, I use that as my default file type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you run Disk Utility on the slow Mac to see if there's a problem with the file system?</p>

</p><p>I don't know the XLSB format, I can do that for PPTX? (I'm working with PowerPoint here).</p>

I recently brought one N72. But the Phone was giving me problems from very beginning.<br />
<br />
The phone sometimes show No signal strength at all and will prompt the message No network coverage even though the phone is at a place having full network coverage. But after one or two days it will be back to normal.<br />
<br />
The Service center people are absolutely clueless about the same. Please do help...............

Also I tried using a different SIM on this phone. But still it is showing the same network error in between.<br />

            We have heard that N series has got some minor problems in network catagory. I think after using for some days you shud try to change the firmware if available new version. Sometimes you face problems in your mobile because of your operators or your SIM.<br />
Some of the old SIM cards are not acceptable in new cell phones. Or some old SIM cards gives problems in those cell phones. So it's better check with new SIM cards.<br />
Even after if you get problems you have to take it to the service center for firmware update.<br />
Hope and pray your N72 will b allright.

<p>Hello sfshopman,</p>
<p>There is an issue with the Zune personal digital certificate. To resolve this issue, please create a new certificate:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If it is running, close the Zune software and disconnect your phone.&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Open Certificate Manager. To do this, click Start , type certmgr.msc , and press Enter .&nbsp;<br />

<p>The default template in Word is the Normal.dotm template and you should NOT mess with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing that you can do is to create a new template with the features that you want and create an Add-in - a template that is saved in the Word Startup folder that contains a macro that when used will create a new document from the first template
 mentioned above.&nbsp; To facilitate the use of that macro you could either:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Include Ribbon Customization in the Add-in so that you have a button on save the Home tab of the ribbon that would run the macro to create a new document from your template</li><li>Add a button to the Quick Access Toolbar to run that macro.&nbsp;</li></ol>

                    <p>I just bought and downloaded Outlook 2016 and checking spelling as I type is not enabled and cannot be enabled. I upgraded from the 2007 version and had no problem in this area. In File&gt;Options&gt;Mail&gt;Spelling and Autocorrect, the "When correcting spelling

<div>IE8: Is This a Security Setting Issue ??</div>
<div>Hi;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1)</strong> I tried to download a&nbsp;file (for Win XP SP3 32-bit) and I got the message:</div>
<div>"<strong>Internet Explorer - Security Warning</strong>:</div>
<div>... <strong>Windows has found a problem with this file</strong>.</div>
<div>... <strong>Name: whatever.exe</strong></div>
<div>... <strong>Publisher: Unknown Publisher</strong>"</div>
<div>I pressed OK (the only option available in the message box) and the downloading/installing was terminated!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2)</strong> I wonder if the above message has something to do with the
<strong>IE8</strong> security settings.</div>
<div>Here're the settings I have:<br />
Internet Explorer --&gt; Tools --&gt; Internet Options --&gt; Security tab<br />
... Internet: <strong>Medium-high</strong><br />
... Local internet: <strong>Medium-low</strong><br />
... Trusted sites: <strong>Medium</strong><br />
... Restricted sites: <strong>High</strong><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3) Can</strong> I&nbsp;relax ALL of the&nbsp;above&nbsp;IE security levels to, say, low (temporarily, just for few minutes) and try again ??</div>
<div>(That's of course assuming the above msg &amp; the IE Security are related, and assuming no harm would be done by temporarily relaxing the security.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can later go back to the initial settings!)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please advise.&nbsp; Thank you.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Follow the steps mentioned below to unblock the files that do not have a valid digital signature to load on your system.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>‘Start’</strong> button.<br />
b<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type<strong> “Internet Explorer” in the</strong> <strong>
“Start Search Box”</strong> and select it from the menu.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>“Tools”</strong> in the menu bar and select<strong> “Internet Options</strong>”.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>“Advanced tab”</strong> and locate <strong>“Allow software to run or install even if the signature is invalid” under the “Security”</strong> category and check the box.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Apply and then <strong>‘Ok’</strong>.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close the Internet Explorer and restart Internet Explorer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also see the following link:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/875351#appliesto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/875351#appliesto</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>The software needs to be signed by the publisher. If not signed, Windows cannot verify the software's origin, thus the "unknown publisher".&nbsp; If you see this kind of message in the future, you need to contact the author of the software to see if they want
 to spend extra to make their software tamper-proof.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>We change title only when it is required, e.g. if the title doesn’t contains the 'error message'.</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            SharePoint online search result is not showing all the documents from the library</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a document library with 10 pdf documents. There are metadata properties associated with each document in the library. When we try to search using any of Managed Properties, the results show only 7 pdf documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some documents with same content but different name and properties. Ideally search result should show all the documents irrespective of the content in it.</p>
<p>We also disabled trim duplicates in search result web part. Still not able to see all the documents in search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly suggest.</p>
<p>

<p style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To clarify the issue, could you confirm the following?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>1. Have you used the default columns for the pdf documents or custom columns?<br />
2. Have you created a new managed property or the default managed property?<br />
3. For investigation, could you give us some screenshots related to the crawled properties and the managed properties you have set.<br />
4. Some screenshots related to the symptom of the issue you encountered. Do you use the default search box in the document library to search the result?
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>As you said, some documents with same content but different names and properties. So please make sure that you have mapped all crawled

<p style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">For example, three different document types might have different names for the property that identifies the author.
 One document type might name this property Author, another Writer, and a third Property3. Although all three are crawled properties, only the documents with the Author property appear in search results when a user queries by author. To ensure that all documents
 appear in search results, map each of these crawled properties to the Author managed property.</span><span>

<h2>            hOW CAN i MAKE AN ACTIVEX COMBOBOX DEPENDENT ON ANOTHER ACTIVEX COMBOBOX</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several data validation drop down list that are dependent&nbsp;on another drop down list.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the size of the fonts using this method.&nbsp; I have the activex comboboxes on my worksheet and they work great, but&nbsp;I do not know how to make the second combobox
 dependent on the first.&nbsp; Is this possible and if so how can I accomplish this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The only question I have is that when I am filling the form out and the first set of enclosures that are configured alike are less than the total being quoted, when I click on the Next Enclosures it takes me to the new worksheet.&nbsp; I then have to go back
 to WKSHT1 to continue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I intended to fix that and forgot. Just to explain why it does it&nbsp;on the first save&nbsp;and not subsequent saves is that the first time it&nbsp;adds the new worksheet and when a new worksheet is added, it automatically becomes the Active Sheet. On subsequent saves
 it does not create a new sheet and therefore the worksheet with the form remains the Active Sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway the fix is easy and as you are taking an interest in the code, guidelines to fix as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the tab name for WKSHT1.</li><li>Select View code to open the VBA editor at the code module for WKSH1</li><li>Find the sub "Private Sub btnSave_Click()"</li><li>Then find the "End Sub" line for this sub.</li><li>Insert the&nbsp;a line "Me.Activate" (without the double quotes) between&nbsp;the lines&nbsp;"Call NextEnclosure" and "End Sub" so it looks like the following. (Doesn't matter if there are any blank lines between the code lines because they are ignored. Blank lines are
 often left to make the code easier to read.)</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call NextEnclosure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Activate<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explanation of Me. It is the generic object&nbsp;reference of the worksheet to which the code module belongs. In lieu of&nbsp;Me.Activate you could use the following code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worksheets("WKSHT1").Activate</p>

<p>Phillip should have moved your question to the Insider forum, as you are talking about the 16.8 Insider update (not 16.9). I took care of that for you. Please post to the Insider forum when discussing Insider builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What steps are you taking to copy? It makes a difference whether you simply select an entire cell, or select the cell's contents in the formula bar.</p>

            Jim, i simply select an entire cell, actually many cells (for example, with text) — but after i click cmd+v — this text don't paste to text editors.

<p>Just a wild guess, and not being a Mac expert, I might be wrong. In Windows, the clipboard has info that says what kind of data it's copying. It's possible the text editor is checking, and seeing Excel info (from the cell),&nbsp;is ignoring it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try selecting the cell, then going to the Formula bar and copying the data from there (highlight, cmd+c), and then pasting.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Switching Accounts Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activated Office on my brother's laptop using his school's subscription.. Since he has Windows 8.1, it automatically signed him into his personal Microsoft account (used on his laptop).. I signed his school account in as well, so that he could access his
 organization's SharePoint directly from Word. Next time he opened Word, the school account was no longer logged in, so I signed his personal Microsoft account off, and tried adding his school account again. Problem is, the "Type email address or phone number
 in here" that is already in the field doesn't delete automatically, and then after I delete it, enter his account and click Next, it doesn't do anything.. Reinstalled Office, but that didn't fix the problem. It's up-to-date.. What's going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I originally redeemed it on the school address but I believe I unchecked "keep me signed in." I also found on another thread that the problem could have had something to do with the browser and pop-up settings (perhaps?) but regardless,
 I was able to use it normally after completely resetting all browser settings.</p>

<p>Yes. Windows Security Center will remove it automatically.</p>
<p>Feel free to open Windows Defender Security Center/Quarantined Items/Full History&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete it and run the scan again.</p>

            With my experience in studding code when it's quarantined the code uses @echo to "screw" with your computer and input files with malicious intent. What I think is that Windows Defender stopped the file from executing any type of script within your computer.
 Download Malwarebytes, do a scan and there should be an option to remove it.

<p>Malwarebytes did a scan but found no malware. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it is an issue if it has been quarantined?</p>

    <title>Inserting Excel print layout into Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> southessex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting Excel print layout into Word</h2>
                    <p>Having taken a lot of time to create the required print layout for an Excel spreadsheet which takes up several pages and has been restricted to print on only one page wide (either portrate or landscape) I now wish to insert this print layout into a Word
 document as part of a report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot find a way to do this so that I get the same layout as the original Excel print layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I copy the Excel spreadsheet and past it into Word the data will occupy more than one page wide in Word.&nbsp; I then have to re-design the print titles and font size and column widths in order to get the Word version vaguely looking like the original Excel
 version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be much simpler if I could copy and paste the Excel print layout into Word.&nbsp; Alternatively if I printed the Excel spreadsheet to PDF I could paste the PDF file into Word however this does not appear to work as either I only get a file icon or PDF
 only prints page 1 into my Word document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Binder used to solve this problem without any trouble at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an easy and quick answer to this problem?</p>
