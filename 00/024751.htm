<h2>            Pictures don&#39;t get uploaded from Windows 10 Mobile phone to OneDrive anymore</h2>
                    <p>(this is clearly a regression introduced by some update of the phone OS, the OneDrive app and/or the Photos app--this used to work like a charm)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After two days, the most recent pictures I have taken with my Lumia 830 running Windows 10 Mobile 10.0.14393.189 still don't show up on my OneDrive "Camera Roll."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting the phone, the OneDrive app, the Photos app, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm typing this, the spinning arrows in the Photos app are still spinning (connection is WiFi to my FTTH 200Mbps Internet connection, so connection speed is not the issue). Sometimes they stop spinning at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempt to turn off photo backup in the OneDrive app, it hangs with "disabling photo backup..." (not the exact message, my phone is running French W10M).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I go from here?</p>

    <title>No sign of 6230i Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madmick69---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sign of 6230i Update</h2>
                    Hi Everybody<br />
<br />
I have been away from the forum for a wee while after some ill health.<br />
I logged on today to see if there is any good information concerning the supposed to be released firmware update for the nokia 6230i .<br />
<br />
I was personnally promised from many sources directly connected to nokia that the NSU would have the newest firmware included in its software update list..<br />
<br />
These promises have yet to be met and to date I have personnally lost faith in the whole system of software updates.<br />
<br />
The 6230i handset as any owner of one will tell you should have been already added to the NSU a long time ago and by rights should have been the very first handset added .<br />
<br />
This handset has the most software bugs over and above any other handset produced by nokia.<br />
<br />
Common sense should have made the 6230i priority over and above all other old or new handsets.<br />
<br />
here is a list of faults depending on your what firmware you have .<br />
some of these faults may not be relevent to you..<br />
<br />
Faults list....<br />
<br />
access time to media and music too slow.<br />
<br />
music changing by its self .<br />
<br />
music not playing fully (moving to next track after only a few seconds).<br />
<br />
camera delay when taking photos (as much as a second).<br />
<br />
shutting down for no reason.<br />
<br />
losing contacts.<br />
<br />
low sound quality.<br />
<br />
titles of music displayed as (gobbledegook) not proper text.<br />
<br />
slower access using data cable/bluetooth dependant on firmware(newer firmwre quicker access).<br />
<br />
these are only some of the many faults connected with this handset I have catalogued 61 faults to date but have had no help back if and when the NSU will add a firmware/software release for this handset..<br />
<br />
The highest amount of faults reported by any other model is around 3 I think the figures speak for themselves...<br />
<br />
So i ask anyone who has a 6230i that is no longer in warranty to write in to nokia and to call them as soon as possible to complain and even if it is in warranty doesnt mean it will be free to have it updated as there will be a outlying cost at some point.<br />
<br />

            I can't say anything other than I agree completely.<br />
<br />
I've been using this handset for something like a year now, and it's the **bleep**piest phone I've ever owned.<br />
<br />
It garbles up text messages at random.<br />
It displays "Insert SIM" for no reason at random.<br />
It drops out of touch with the net without displaying this, so if you don't get any calls for a certain period of time, there's always the chance that the phone decided to drop and needs to be restarted to accept calls and texts again (WITH NO INDICATION ON
 THE DISPLAY WHATSOEVER)<br />
<br />
Frankly the only reason I haven't thrown this piece of **bleep** phone away, was the hope that software updates were pending on the website here. I'm not really keen on handing over my phone to the reseller so they can take 4 weeks to do a simple update on
 it.<br />
<br />
If nothing happens in the next few months, the only thing I can say for certain is that my next phone will not be a Nokia - and that I will probably seek some pleasure in terminating this handset in the most spectacular way possible. I'm thinking train tracks
 at the moment..

            hi decipher<br />
<br />
Glad to see wee are on the same wavelength.<br />
<br />
I have been promised for an extremely long time that there was to be a new firmware on the NSU for this handset .<br />
<br />
I have only witnessed that Nokia seems to prefer updating newer handsets with the smallest and liveable microscopic glitches that 99% of users wouldnt even bother with..<br />
<br />
Nokia seems to have turned thier backs on the little folk in this world who are always the majority .<br />
<br />
My sister and her friend both have nokia 6230i but with higher firmware (version 03.80)and surprise surprise they have a lot less bugs including most of the ones I have previously posted being fixed...<br />
<br />
What nokia users of this and any other nokia handset fail to understand is whether or not the handset is in warranty is that when you have to update your handset outwith the help uf NSU or OTA(over the air)is you have a cost of some sort ..<br />
Examples Below<br />
1. you may have to hand over your handset to service centre for as much as a few weeks.<br />
<br />
2. you dont get a replacement handset whilest you wait for yours to be updated.<br />
<br />
3. you may have to send of your handset at your cost taking the chance that your handset gets lost or stolen in the post (more likely to be stolen especially with uk postal service).<br />
<br />
4.you may not be offered the latest firmware when you do go to a service centre and may have to return again.<br />
<br />
5. out of warranty handsets can cost up to £20 or more each time you have to upgrade your handset..<br />
<br />
6. in warranty handsets can also cost to be upgraded if you do not live anywhere near a service centre .<br />
<br />
7. Some so called service centres have a history of fleecing customers by updating handsets to out of date firmware so as to recharge the customer again for the proper updated version netting them on average £20 to £30 for each update (i have experienced this
 tactic twice already and reported it to nokia with no response or compensation from them as they are the ones who stated that these service centres where trustwothy..<br />
<br />
All of the above that i have stated could quite easily be avoided and save the nokia customer money which could by rights be spent later on a new handset as thanks to nokia for thier great customer help(as if)..<br />
At the end of the day it is Nokia that is losing out as i have already stated in one of my previous posts whereas nokia has lost a 1.5 million replacement contract due to the exact same handset as ours...<br />
<br />
The correct firmware for this handset is at present 04.22 but you may only be offered 03.80 or above depending on where you take the handset also it only takes on average under an hour to update any handset hope this helps so please dont just post your issues
 and problems here e-mail nokia as well or even better phone and leave a complaint..<br />
<br />

            I finally got around to taking my handset to an official Care Point or whatever they call it today.<br />
<br />
I asked them to just firmware update it, as I thought most of the issues are software related.<br />
<br />
He asked what was wrong with it, and I started explaining the list of issues from memory, and probably missed some issues, and he insisted that they take it in for repairs/evaluation by one of their techs. He refused to simply update the software on the spot
 and let me take the phone with me.<br />
<br />
So now I'm likely without my phone for anywhere from a week to a month, depending on what they decide needs to be done. If it wasn't a software problem only anyway, I would have been happier just buying a different phone from some other company.<br />
<br />
I'm so so disappointed with Nokia - I've used their phones for many years now and have been working as a saleman selling them as well.<br />
<br />
I have moved my SIM to an old 8310 - and ironically this phone is already so much more pleasing. I mean, monochrome display sure, but at least the dictionary isn't completely ludicrously bad at suggesting words - and after at least a year and a half in my drawer
 and having been completely submerged in a glass of water (the reason I bought my 6230i in the first place) it still works flawlessly and had half the battery power still when I turned it on. (!)<br />
<br />
Can only conclude that things have gone downhill.<br />
<br />
(btw, yeah - I bought it in febuary 2006 I think and even back then I checked for an update. Back then it was promised on NSU "right around the corner" as well from several sources.)

            The 6230i will never be compatible with the NSU, it's operating system can only be updated by a care centre.<br />
<br />
This is because the 6230i was out long before the NSU existed and it has the older series 40 operating system that cannot be updated by the consumer.

            Really? That's odd.<br />
<br />
I succesfully updated my very old 6150 myself years ago - I wouldn't have thought it was age related.<br />
<br />
Either way, fact remains that this handset is junk, just poor quality control.

.. at least 3 years old. If Nokia haven't fixed the firmware by now, it ain't gonna happen, NSU compatibility or not.

            hi psychomania<br />
<br />
Can you please get it right in future about your information.<br />
series 40 phones are updateable by NSU as there are 12 at present in the NSU list..<br />
I have successfully pointed this out to someone else on this forum who then procceeded to appologise for his error..<br />
please get it right the 6230 and 6230i have always been upgradeable on the NSU its just nokia dragging things out and going back on their promises.<br />
<br />
to also point out is doesnt matter what dct version the handset is either or any other problem you may have read about.<br />
so please listen to the experts here not the rubbish that makes the rounds on this forum .<br />
dont build on the hear say as all the information that i have posted on this forum is concrete and from both nokia and other sources ..<br />
<br />
please read my other posts before you make any un-proven statements in future<br />
<br />

            Nokia want you to part with some of your cash - so get rid of that old thing, and get a newer Nokia.<br />
<br />
Seriously...why would Nokia update their old phones on NSU, when they know you can just can buy a new one? They're at least going to want the service centre to charge you for the update.

<h2>            Optimizing a cutting list for least waste</h2>
                    
<p>I guess I need to use nested IF statements but not sure how to start.</p>
<p><br />
Trying to make a cutting list for aluminium material lengths to be cut.</p>
<p><br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
Stock length: 6500mm<br />
<br />
Cut sizes:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2100mm x 25<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1800mm x 14<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1200mm x 24<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2400mm x 12</p>
<p><br />
How many stock lengths do I need and how are they to be cut, best optimal cutting possible with least waste.</p>
<p>Obviously biggest items are to be ccut first and so on, but more than one length per stock length is required.<br />
<br />
Help?</p>

<p>Imagine a whole box of lengths of aluminium sections for making windows.</p>
<p>To make those windows I need to cut these lengths into smaller sizes.</p>
<p>I need to do this economically.</p>
<p>How can I use Excel to help me make this a reality.</p>
<p>Firstly you would take a big size out of it and then another size out of the offcut piece.</p>
<p>And then another size out of the offcut left over.</p>
<p>I need to know how many full stock lengths (6500) long it will take to cut all the pieces listed above.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>You need to take into account the quantity of each size and fit it all in together for the most optimal outcome.</p>
<p>Your example is not relevent for this requirement.</p>

            <p>Thanks Ashish for your response. However, I've not &nbsp;used an ISO &nbsp;to install Windows 10. I started from 8.1 and have only used Windows Update to finally arrive at 10240. Unfortunately, after taking the option to 'Go back to the previous build', the system
 hung for over 5 hours with the message 'Restarting'... &nbsp;I had no option but to force a system restart... I pulled the plug. On restart, the system could not locate &nbsp;the operating system... Seemingly it had corrupted the boot files. I have now started again
 with Win8.0. Ah well...&nbsp;</p>

            It seems that, after paying £100 for Windows 8 about a year ago, then joining the Windows Insider program and keeping up to date all the way with Windows 10 Technical Previews ... &nbsp;on the threshold of obtaining the final release of Windows 10, build 10240,
 it has trashed my hard drive and there appears to be no way of getting back on track. I've reinstalled the original Windows 8.0, but upgrades are no longer working to put me back on the Windows 10 track!!!!!&nbsp;

<h2>            FTP Hyperlinks in Excel 2016 .xlsx file not working after being reopened</h2>
                    I have created an ftp://... link in Excel 2016 that seems to work while I'm editing the .xlsx file.<br />
<br />
I have two cells, one is a text description which I formatted as a Link and added the web address.<br />
The other cell is the web address which I also turned into a hyperlink.<br />
<br />
But if I close it and reopen it, or send it to someone else and they open it, the ftp// hyperlinks disappear and turn to just text.<br />
<br />
While if I create two more cells as http://... hyperlinks, it works fine on a save, close, and reopen.<br />
<br />
I've also tried this on two other PCs.<br />
Is there a proper way or workaround to create this type of ftp hyperlink?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<h2>            Suggestion&#58; Continue using Win Mobile 10 or Switch back to 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Lumia 640XL</p>
<p>Shipped version was 8.1</p>
<p>Updated to version 10 with with Upgrade Adisor app</p>
<p>Received few OS updates. Current:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version: 1607</p>
<p>OS Build: 10.0.14393.953</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am experiencing new issues after each OS update. Last few major (show-stopper) bugs discovered after update are:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">unable to new app or update existing app installed on SD card</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">no vibration, no sound, no notification bar for any kind of notification.</span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Images downloaded from WhatsApp do appear with exclamation sign in Photos soon after download (not posted this query).

<p>I have posted above questions here but no solution OR only solution is to "hard reset". I can't..just can't perform "hard reset" for every show stopper issues. I had done twice times earlier; looking at no other go! I don't want to do it again and face some
 new creepy show-stopper issue after some updates. I have down "soft reset" and nothing helped. All settings looks good!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win Mobile 10 is beautiful but BUGGY! Sadly, Microsoft following Android. They way navigation appears for app like Store &amp; few others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Win Mobile 10 really stable? What's guarantee that I won't face any new creepy issues if I do "hard reset" fourth time? Shall I switch back to 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I understand where you're coming from. You have already been more patient than I would be after months with various issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the SD memory card previously used in the phone is confirmed defective, poor quality, fake, or became corrupted (Whatsapp images work now), we must consider the configuration and system files in the phone itself are still affected by the bad SD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be worth a try remove the SD card, start up the phone without SD, open the pictures gallery, music player and other apps, open the Store, install a small app - to verify the phone itself is healthy and works as expected. Then soft reset, set the date
 and time correct again if needed, sync the Microsoft account, and let the phone sit overnight to update its search indexes etc.</p>
<p>The phone must work as expected without the SD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the next day insert a new or freshly formatted SD card and see how it goes.</p>
<p>It's vital to use a genuine, reputable brand memory card from a reputable store.<br />
Installing and running apps on a memory card is heavy duty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next steps is hard reset &gt; recovery &gt; replace the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the recovery tool reverts Lumia 640 phones to WP8.1 if you decide to try that.<br />
I suggest use the phone for a few days on WP8.1, without SD, without restoring a backup, only add your Microsoft account and confirm the phone is fully stable after fetching and applying all further updates for WP8.1.</p>
<p>

<p>I then log in through a pop up window and it accepts my log in details for OneDrive and then immediately it again says: Synchronization error, log in to&nbsp;synchronize this notebook. once again.<br />
This circle can go on forever, and it has been like this for over a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errorcode is: 0xE0000024, but the forums on this for Microsoft Pc's has something to do with internet explorer, which I do not have on my Mac...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            LUMIA SECURE BOOT UEFI BIOS policy certificate has expired.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft representative,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deeper research of my Lumia booting problem&nbsp;I found that in the retail installation flashing image (WP8.1 CYAN) of my phone there is located UEFI BIOS Secure Boot policy certificate.&nbsp;This certificate&nbsp;is a part&nbsp;of UEFI booting conditions engine and
 it&nbsp;was expired by Dec 24, 2014. The total lifecycle of this certificate was around 14 months, but in the retail box of my Lumia smartphone there is a note that Lumia product is usable for at least 3 years. So why&nbsp;so short UEFI Secure Boot conditions apply?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the description of flashing procedure is pointed that before UEFI flashing&nbsp;program validates signatures of the Platform Key certificate and the Microsoft Windows Phone Production PCA 2012 retail certificate. The last one is in the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certificate details:&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Make a value appear in one cell from another in Excel 2010 on a date&#47;dates</h2>
                    <p>I use excel to keep track of all my household bills and need a bit of help with some formulas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Problem 1:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a formula entered into a cell to make a value from another (M22) appear in it between the 25th &amp; 31st of each month. I now need the value to appear on the 1st of each month as well as between these dates,
 but can’t seem to change the formula to do so. The formula I’m using is: =IF(AND(DAY(TODAY())&gt;25, DAY(TODAY())&lt;=31), M22, "")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Problem 2:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need a formula to work in a similar way to that above, except this time I need the value to appear on a specific date of the year and for 7 days beforehand. This date is stored in cell B36 which has been formatted
 as a date cell and reads 31 March 2013. The cell in which I wish this value to appear is H36 and the cell in which the value is stored is M36.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Problem 3:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need a formula to work in exactly the same way as that above but this time I need the value to appear for 7 days up to and including any of 4 specific dates entered into cells. These cells are formatted as date
 cells and are as follows: B30 = 10 Feb, C30 = 10 May, D30 = 10 Aug, E30 = 10 Nov. The cell in which the value needs to appear is H30 and the cell where the value is stored is M30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Problem 4:</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some bills I’m able to pay before the actual due dates. Because the values will enter themselves into cells which are part of a sum calculating column; I would like to have the ability to override the formulas
 above without actually deleting them. I would like to do this by entering the letter P into a cell next to the one where the value will appear. Doing this should make the value disappear or read £0.00 so that is not calculated. If there is no letter then the
 formula should function as normal. Is there a way to this? If this override cell was used with the example given in problem 2, it would be cell I36.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Help with any of these problems would be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

            The formulas are not complete. They represent just the conditional part. I assumed you knew how to complete them.<br />
<br />
Problem 1:<br />
<br />
=IF(OR(AND(DAY(TODAY())&gt;25, DAY(TODAY())&lt;=31),DAY(TODAY()=1)),M23,"")<br />
<br />
Problem 2:<br />
<br />
=IF(AND(TODAY()&gt;B36-7,TODAY()&lt;=B36),H36,"")<br />
<br />
Problem 3:<br />
<br />
=IF(OR((H1&gt;$B$30:$E$30-7)*(H1&lt;=$B$30:$E$30)),M30,"")<br />
<br />
Problem 4:<br />
<br />
=IF(Cell="P","",IF(AND(TODAY()&gt;B36-7,TODAY()&lt;=B36),H36,""))<br />

            I kinda goofed up a few things. Fixed:<br />
<br />
=IF(OR(($C$2&gt;$B$30:$E$30-7)*($C$2&lt;=$B$30:$E$30)),$M$30,"")<br />
<br />
Enter as an array formula (CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER).<br />

            You have do this in the classic version unfortunately.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

                    <p>After the 15.32 update I am now getting the following error with every word document I use, new or old, doc or docx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Word is unable to save the AutoRecover file in the location you have specified.&nbsp; Make sure that you have specified a valid location for AutoRecover files in Preferences, and that you

<p>
</p><p>I have looked in these forums and on Google, but I have not found any way to fix this. My disk has ample space (100s of GB) and I verified that I have the correct permissions to write
 and read the specified autorecover folder. I have submitted a bug report with the smiley face thing, but I thought it would be good to see if anyone else had this crop up with 15.32. It appears to have been a problem with previous releases and even previous
 versions of Word. I am running latest MacOS Sierra release.</p>

<p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>To clarify the scenario, could you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. For “so you don't have to DUPLICATE IE save off a Word/Xfile from email before you can start editing it”, could you share with us more detailed steps so that we can try to reproduce the issue.
<br />
2. Could you share with us some screenshots about “Duplicate” function you mentioned? To upload images, please click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> when replying to the post, then click the<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.<br />
3. May I know which version of Office client you are using?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

                    <span>
<p>HI,</p>
<p>I'm trying to automate the processing of some Excel 2010 spreadsheets by running a VBScript on the command line (WSH) under Windows 7.</p>
<p>I declare an array with</p>
<p>Dim ss(25202,10)</p>
<p>and assign to it with</p>
<p>ss = objExcel.Range("A1:K25203").Value</p>
<p>However, I get a "type mismatch" (error code 800A000D) on the assignment statement.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong.</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, the statement objExcel.Range("A25204:K29952").Delete does seem to work.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>First of all, thanks to everyone who took the time to think about the problem and post replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally found the key to the solution in OssieMac's first post "ranges assigned to a variant produce a 1 based array". I assumed it was a 0 based array. I got a type mismatch error at runtime because the first row of each of my spreadsheets contains text
 column headings and I was inadvertently comparing that to numerical constants. After I adjusted the limits on the For loop and shifted the indices on all array references, the script worked. No other changes were required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail</h2>
                    <p>When opening some emails in Windows 10 Mail, the message comes up "there is not enough memory or disk space to update the display", so&nbsp;I can't open it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think these particular emails are MS Word-based? as they tend to be mailshot-type mails rather than just written mails&nbsp;from Contacts.</p>
<p>I've got plenty of RAM and disk space spare on an Acer laptop running Windows 10.</p>
<p>MS Word (my version is Word 2007) opens perfectly normally from the normal Word icon, from a&nbsp; *.doc file in Explorer or from a&nbsp;short cut etc.</p>

I did a FULL SCAN of my PC after I updated the Definitions and it shows that there is some threats active in my PC and I want to see them but this error won't let me. (Look picture above) It says "Class not registered". What does it even mean? I really want
 to know where does the virus come from. Anyone who can help me out? Thanks in advance :D</p>

</p><p>You might want to consider scanning the PC with a second opinion scanner</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you run Disk Cleanup or CCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Delete temporary files</strong>. </p>
<p>To delete temporary files: Do a disk cləanup. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, in the səarch box, type
<em>disk cleanup</em>, and then, in the list of results, click disk cləanup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And/Or</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>CCleaner</strong></p>
<p>One of the single-best system maintenance tools around. Can be used for cleaning junk, browser safety, startup management, and plenty more. A must have on almost every system.</p>

<h2>            Fix for recent MS Update problem now preventing creation of IMAP subfolders</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a user who was having trouble sending or deleting messages in Outlook 365 on Windows 7, and after researching I discovered many people having the same problem after a recent MS Update. The fix was to modify the account settings for the IMAP account
 to put "inbox" in the Root Folder Path. I did so, and the issue of sending/deleting messages has now been resolved; however, when the user attempts to create subfolders of Inbox by right-clicking Inbox and choosing New Folder... he is now presented with the
 following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Cannot create the folder. Cannot create or navigate to the folder. You cannot create or navigate to subfolders of your Inbox when you have a non-empty Root Folder Path."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The user is still able to create a subfolder by using the Webmail interface, but our wish is to have that capability from within Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>
                </div>

            I have an IMAP Account in Outlook 365. I am trying to create subfolders in my Inbox so I can organize my mail. When I try to create it, I get an error message:&nbsp;
<p>"You cannot create or navigate to subfolders of your inbox when you have a non-empty root folder path"</p>
<p>My root folder path says INBOX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am afraid based on multiple comments that say that you need a root folder path in Outlook, that if I take the root folder out then I won't get the mail delivered to my inbox.</p>
<p>What are the suggestions for solving this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            I am having this same issue to in Outlook 2016. &nbsp;If I put Inbox in the root folder path I am unable to create folders in the IMAP. &nbsp;However if I keep the root folder path empty I am able to create a new folder. &nbsp;So how can I have Inbox in the root folder
 and create folders in the IMAP?

            <p>I encountered the same issue when I added a new IMAP account to Outlook 2016&nbsp;... I could not add sub-folders. I already had another IMAP account set up in Outlook which was allowing sub-folders, so I compared the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found is that for the new account, I let Outlook locate the account and automatically set it up. The server information set up by Outlook was mail.hostingplatform.com for both incoming and outgoing servers. All I did was, per directions from my ISP,
 add "Inbox" to the Root Folder path. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The IMAP already set up in Outlook uses my actual mail server names for incoming and outgoing (which can be obtained from your ISP or email admin). The Root Folder path is blank for this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I made these two changes to the new IMAP account I was able to create sub-folders under Inbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick note, I did experiment and found there is a way to&nbsp;create folders even with the Outlook auto-settings and with having "Inbox" in the Root Folder path: they cannot be sub-folders of Inbox, you create them at the same level as Inbox by right-clicking
 the mailbox name.</p>

            I had this issue with a previous user and just deleted the inbox in the advanced settings under account setup. The error that came up said that a folder couldn't be created in a non-empty Root Folder Path. I haven't had any issues yet.

            <p>There is a work-around for this issue: right click the inbox name (not inbox, but the name of the account just above it), then you can add subfolders.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 730 &#39;s GPS Problem</h2>
                    <p>First, apologize for my bad English. I bought Lumia 730 and change twice because of these problem, and I had test many many Lumia 730, they also have same problems
</p>
<p>1/ I know there are many question say about the GPS bug on Lumia 730 dual sim. The problem occur when the air plane mode turn on, wifi also turn off and only the location turn on, Lumia 730 can not find a location (or can find with a much time, about 30
 minutes and more). I find and read many website say about this problem, but there is not any answers of Microsoft about this problem. Not only Lumia 730, many Lumia 830 and Lumia 640 have this problem. And I see thay are all use Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 4 cores
 1.2 GHz. I think may be this is problem about the hardware. But not, because Lumia 630 use the same chip with a same Navigation module. Microsoft, please answers about this problem and have some act to fix it.
</p>
<p>2/ Double tap to turn on screen on Lumia 730 is not good, and I hope Microsoft will fix it, too.</p>
<p>3/ Super - Sensitive Touch on Lumia 730 is very bad, I had use Lumia 520 and it really bad than Cheap-Range phone like Lumia 520.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Windows Phone, and I also like the design of Lumia 730, very nice. Any product, from the cheapest to flag-ship, all can have problem, I and many customers know it. But we will disappoint if Microsoft have no any answers about these. Please give us
 answers and fix it soon, Microsoft.</p>
<p>Best regard </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is something seriously wrong in Lumia 730 GPS. I have used lumia 520 and 620 in which GPS is working very well. I think Nokia compromised quality of GPS device for cost minimization. GPS problem overshadowed by positive overall performance. I have
 updated lo latest firmware and windows 10 latest preview build too but still the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>

Lumia730DH</a>. Enabling Wi-Fi on your phone allows to use information from the access point to find your position faster, at lower power, and more accurately, particularly when you're indoors. Without cellular data or Wi-Fi connection, it may take longer for
 the location service to locate your phone, or it may not work at all. What do you mean by "Double tap to turn on screen on Lumia 730 is not good"? Do you mean that it is not working? Have you tried changing the touch sensitivity by going to Settings&gt;touch,
 on your phone to see if there are any changes? We look forward to your reply.

            Thank you, but I think it is not an hardware problem because GPS chip is a module on SoC CPU. If there is any problem about hardware, it is the fault of Qualcomm. I also find on Qualcomm's website and found that Lumia 630, 730, 830 use the same chip, only
 difference in code name. But they all use the same module of GPS. Lumia 630 have no problem, Lumia 730 and Lumia 830 - the higher range, more expensive have big problem with GPS (I had test many Lumia 830 at Mobile Store). So I don't think becase of price
 of Lumia 730. I only hope it belone to software, the Lumia Denim update. I had update to the lastest Windows 10 Mobile and I found that many part of OS still uses the core of Denim (like touch, super sensitive,...). That mean in the Preview build, or RTM,
 not the Final, the OS would not have specific to each model, it is only a general function of OS and only made something to tally with each model to use with general function, not for specific function. Hope it will have change in the final update in December.<br />
But all are my guess. And I'm so sorry for my bad English...

 if you let us know the outcome.

            I´m facing also this issue and I´m really angry about it. It seems to stat appearing since some update, but i´m not sure. I like the 730 because of the display, camera, design, but i hate its GPS. If you´re using the 730 as a navigation in a car it might
 be dangerous because after losing the fix (for example in a tunnel), it isn´t mostly able to fix again (after leaving the tunnel). It gets fix only via WIFI and than holds it (until you get under big cloud on the sky or in a tunnel). Fix with GSM (without
 WIFI connection) is very inaccurate and slow and impossible in a moving car, in airplane mode the fix is absolutely impossible also under free sky, maybe after few hours. Comparing with my old Lumia 520, it is another universe, the 520 is able to get very
 fast fix in offline mode also in a moving car. I was expecting also a good performing GPS in the 730 but it was a mistake.

            <p>So somebody who can contact direct to product manager of Lumia 730, or softwere manager, anyone can fix this, let them know about this. I have post this on many big forum but no one can help. Lumia 730 is very good at another things, design, display. And
 with a basic function of Lumia smart phone, they fail. And one more thing, any one find out that super sensitive of Lumia 730 has problem, too. Sometime it work, sometime no. Forgive for my bad English.

MarekPršín</a> &amp; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/eb5caad8-5ecf-43a2-890a-2a19049da248" title="Lumia730DH">
Lumia730DH</a>. When using the GPS receiver, check that you have a clear view of the sky. The time it takes to establish a GPS connection may vary between a few seconds and several minutes. Establishing a GPS connection in the car may take longer. We recommend
 that you make use of <strong>Assisted GPS (A-GPS)</strong> to speed up the connection time for your GPS. A-GPS uses your mobile internet connection to connect to a server that tells your device which GPS satellites it will be able to connect to, substantially
 reducing the time taken to get a GPS fix. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Lumia phones, Assisted GPS is automatically used when the location services are enabled and you have an internet connection available. If no satellite signal is found,&nbsp;make sure that your hand or any accessory&nbsp;does not cover the GPS receiver. If the weather
 conditions are bad or you are behind UV protected or heated windscreen, the signal strength may also be affected. If the issue persists, we advise visiting the nearest Care Point in your area as suggested by

            <p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1eb453da-79bd-4f38-b120-112369d07175" title="mdmohiyuddinkhan">

 maps also over your cellular connection, but for larger maps, you need to use Wi-Fi. You have to make sure that both your phone and HERE Drive can find your location. Check that the following settings are turned on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In HERE Drive, tap <strong>Settings &gt; Location </strong>and turn it on. </p>
<p>2. In your phone, go to <strong>Settings &gt; location </strong>and turn it on. It could be more difficult to find your location if you're indoors or in a built-up area.
