<p>
</p><p>When adding comments, the Exchange Online license is required and the mailbox needs to be hosted in Exchange Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Microsoft Planner in a hybrid environment in which your users may have Exchange Online or on-premises mailboxes, note that:</p>
<p>1.Planner has full functionality when your user has an Exchange Online mailbox</p>
<p>2.Planner users without Exchange online mailboxes may have the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users may have issues with viewing or adding comments to a task.</li><li>Users may have issues viewing their Favorite plans in Planner.</li></ul>
<p>You can check the details in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3169632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hybrid Exchange users can't manage Favorite Plans and can't add comments in Microsoft Planner</a>.<br />

If have the Exchange Online license and use the Exchange Online mailbox and can't add comments, please confirm the information I mentioned above.</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint images are accurate on my computer screen but distorted&#47;shifted when printing</h2>
                    Although I'm following the same steps I've used over the last three years for creating pages for catalogs and product installation sheets (saving an image from AutoCAD; cleaning it up with image correction and newly-drawn lines, arrows and measurements
 to show dimensions; and adding other text boxes around it with product description, company logo, etc.), my PowerPoint pages are not printing correctly. The PowerPoint pages look great on the computer at any zoom level, but when I print, the lines, and other
 figures are shifted approximately 14" to the right on top of the original image. At first, it was an occasional problem with one file, now it's happening regularly with other files as well. I've eliminated the printer as the problem; it was happening on my
 previous printer, and it's still occurring on the upgraded model I just replaced it with. Also, there's no problem with scan and print functions; only with printing from my computer. Shutting down and restarting does nothing to corr

            <p>I've run into similar, though not identical, problems when printing slides that include largish images combined with vector graphics that I added in PPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One trick that seems to help is to "flatten" everything by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select All, Copy, then Paste Special, as PNG onto a new slide</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Export the slide to a high resolution image, then insert the image onto a new blank slide and print that.&nbsp; This page will help with the high-rez export part:</p>

            <p>I have this same issue today. All the boxes I set up on my desktop for easy access have disappeared (apart from News and Photo ones). I can open Outlook and the store, they are pinned to my task bar. When I searched for Word using the search function it
 looks like an older version that is available. None of the 365 files in the menu have their brand showing, they are just plain yellow files. Cortana is working. I have done a system scan and that came up fine. Some other apps like Evernote also don't work
 from the menu.</p>
<p>I can't work out whether it's a start menu issue or 365 office files have been deleted somehow. This is the second PC it's installed on. It's working fine on my laptop...</p>

<h2>            Snap and resize images automatically...</h2>
                    <p>I'm a teacher with a problem. You see, I'm trying to find a way to create a circle or ring of images without having to painstakingly adjust each size, rotate them to fit a ring template that I created, and reposition them. I know there are programs online
 where you can drag an image and it will automatically snap into a set grid and be resized. Is there a way to do this in Word? Ideally, I want to create a ring of 9 images. I see you can make a Text ring using the Transform feature under Text Effect, but it
 doesn't work with images. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

First off, thank you for taking the time to respond, Cyber-Taz. With that said, I think it's safe to say that&nbsp;Microsoft Word isn't like most text-based programs. They've made a lot of changes over the years, and as&nbsp;there is a built-in graphic program that allows
 you to manipulate images, I was hoping there might be a trick out there for doing what I described. It may, in fact, be impossible as you suggest, but&nbsp;then again, who can say? Anyway, I came up with a workaround In Word&nbsp;that I can use for now, until something
 better presents itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
* From what I've seen of lessons&nbsp;on ESLprintables.com, most of which were designed with Microsoft Word, there might be a way to do this.<br />

<h2>            Security Access  has &#34;unknown&#34; Accounts in Build 10166</h2>
                    Seeing weird access issues since Build 10166 update. When I attempt to "print to PDF" it's giving a " administrator permission needed" warning. I am the administrator, and am logged in. When I check the folder I'm trying to save to I see two "unknown"
 accounts in addition to &nbsp;System and Administrator. I'm guessing here, but think the Admin Account may be corrupted and need a "least disruptive" way of fixing it. I have attached to shots of what I see on one of the unknowns and one of the "good" account security.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a820c622-db66-43f1-a451-021ce932f931" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8f19a69-9e9a-4c0a-b0d0-9957c14c51b1" />

    <title>Why DUP emails arrive in Outlook 2013 for any that are sent to my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why DUP emails arrive in Outlook 2013 for any that are sent to my outlook.com address&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I only have my outlook.com address set up in my Outlook 2013 and it is set up as an Exchange ActiveSync account. My other 6 email addresses are set up online at live.com aka outlook.com so that any incoming email to them is sent thru outlook.com into my
 computer's Outlook 2013. I'm pretty sure this is pretty standard stuff.</p>
<p>But for some weird reason, I get two of each email that I send to myself from my Windows 8.1 Nokia Lumia 635 phone to my own outlook.com address, which I do frequently to either send myself photos to save on my computer since my OneDrive is broken and can't
 be trusted (that's another Question that I've got going).</p>
<p>So this is what I end up seeing in my Outlook which is kind of a pain if the emails have as many Photo Attachments as these two did but you can also see that I get DUP emails whenever anyone Replies to one of my Questions on this site since they to are sent
 to my outlook.com address.</p>
<p>This is what I see but I'm sure I've described it so anyone could understand what I'm trying to fix:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84f13088-8178-4a4c-9d70-eba86d9d5e3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84f13088-8178-4a4c-9d70-eba86d9d5e3a" /></a></p>
<p>So here's how my Outlook 2013 is set up:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c85d286-1b2c-4400-9bb6-b62909d1069b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c85d286-1b2c-4400-9bb6-b62909d1069b" /></a></p>
<p>And since I'm sure that I'll be asked, I went online to outlook.com and NO, there aren't any DUPs in there for these same emails.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi and thanks for some help on this. I need to add that I just came to my computer that has been running ever since I asked this Question and now it displays 3 of both of those same 2 emails that I imaged and asked about in this Question originally, that
 I'd sent to my outlook.com address from my Windows phone but quite oddly it only&nbsp;has 2 of another email that I'd sent myself from my phone just before it.</p>
<p>This to me would suggest that Microsoft is having issues with the server or software that runs this whole outlook.com thing.
</p>
<p>Here's what I'm talking about that I see:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/517dda6d-6e0d-4b49-a0f5-07753344a617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/517dda6d-6e0d-4b49-a0f5-07753344a617" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had heard that Microsoft is in the process of moving accounts over to a new server because they'd had some problems and I'd been shown how to determine if I'd been moved yet and I learned that I hadn't yet. I forget what this telltale sign is to know if
 you'd been moved yet but I think it was something that is displayed across the top line when you are logged into live.com aka outlook.com.</p>
<p>To be thorough in my info, I logged in to live.com aka outlook.com and I only see ONE of each of those three emails that somehow get DUPs in my Outlook 2013. So that would probably surely indicate that this issue is in my Outlook 2013 and isn't their server's
 fault.</p>
<p>As far as your Question about Rules, I don't know anything about using Rules in either Outlook 2013 or online in outlook.com. Since you've asked&nbsp;if I have any&nbsp;Rules set up in&nbsp;outlook.com, I logged in, which I rarely do, and I couldn't even&nbsp;figure out where
 anything called Rules would be. <strong>So I need to ask where&nbsp;Rules are</strong>. I sure doubt that I have any but you never know these days if something might have automatically created some rule or Connection crud without you knowing it. They sneak this
 stuff in on us all the time. Just like how Outlook on my Windows phone will&nbsp;give me a person's latest Facebook posting (I think), when I go to their 'People' i.e. Contact. GRRRR</p>

            <p>I forgot to add this in that last Reply a few minutes ago. I've noticed something weird that happens all of the time if I try to Delete the second DUP copy of any of those emails in my Outlook 2013 to soon after I've Deleted the first one. It always pops
 this box</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a29ed359-0729-4de3-b491-70cd2f8645fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a29ed359-0729-4de3-b491-70cd2f8645fc" /></a></p>
<p>saying that ONE OR MORE ITEMS CANNOT BE MOVED BECAUSE ITEMS YOU PREVIOUSLY MOVE ARE STILL BEING PROCESSED BY THE SERVER.</p>
<p>All I need to do is close that box and then I can Delete that last copy of the DUP email.</p>
<p>So, my workaround has always been to just move more slowly when I'm Deleting emails OR to hilite all of them that I want to Delete&nbsp;all at once and then click [DELETE]</p>

            <p>I'm working on this again since it is driving me crazy to get the DUP emails in my Outlook 2013 on my computer. I've got to fix the Question's title since it isn't just happening that I get DUPs of emails that were sent to my outlook.com address. Just as
 I'd thought before, it doesn't just happen with emails that I send to myself from my Windows phone but it also happens to Notifications of Replies from this site which also obviously are sent to my outlook.com address.</p>
<p>What The Heck?</p>
<p>Here's another example of a DUP&nbsp;email that came&nbsp;from this site:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86aec8ce-2534-4843-89da-ef68c295bac4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86aec8ce-2534-4843-89da-ef68c295bac4" /></a></p>
<p>As you see, they arrive at the same minute. But here's something that might tell someone else who knows more that I do about how outlook.com works, whenever I want to Delete these emails, I can Delete the first one of any DUP pair but if I try to Delete
 the second one right after that, it refuses and pops this box telling me "ONE OR MORE ITEMS CANNOT BE MOVED BECAUSE ITEMS YOU PREVIOUSLY MOVED ARE STILL BEING PROCESSED BY THE SERVER."</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9324b223-f6f3-4d36-bf96-c502e7d3667b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9324b223-f6f3-4d36-bf96-c502e7d3667b" /></a></p>
<p>Then, I've learned that all I need to do is wait a minute or so and then&nbsp;the DUP email&nbsp;can then be deleted. So, this would seem to say that somehow they are considered to be the same email, perhaps on the outlook.com server, even though they are displayed
 separately in Outlook 2013.&nbsp;</p>

            I'd also meant to mention that if I just want to Delete the pair of twin emails, all I need to do, if I remember before I Delete the first one, is to hilite them both and then&nbsp;right click and Delete and they both are gone instantly.

            This is still happening to me occasionally and I'm not sure why. I could sure use some help from an Outlook expert who is willing to help dig thru things. I do have some email addresses set up to Forward to my outlook.com account so perhaps one of those
 is causing this to happen every now and then. The only account that I have set up directly in Outlook 2013 is my outlook.com address and it is set up using Exchange ActiveSync.

<h2>            Calculating CPI SPI</h2>
                    <p>We have a schedule is that was baselined, however we did not have any rates for the resource.</p>
<p>We have statused the schedule by entering % complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am told now that mgmt. wants to see the CPI and SPI.&nbsp; Any ideas how I can accomplish this task?</p>

</p><p>In the Set Baseline dialog, you can copy a baseline by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Set Interim Plan option.</li><li>Click the From pick list and select the baseline you want to copy, such as Baseline.</li><li>Click the Into pick list and select the baseline into which you want to copy it, such as Baseline 1.</li><li>Click the OK button.</li></ol>
<p>In essence, this process backs up your baseline for safekeeping so you do not lose the original information for historical purposes.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I agree with Dale, plus Earned Value needs mature schedules. The accuracy of CPI and SPI are directly proportional to how realistically you have assigned resources, defined links etc and then baselined and how accurately you track your schedule. EG after
 updating there should be no incomplete work in the past and no completed work in the future.</p>
<p>Poor schedules will produce fairly meaningless and probably misleading CPI and SPI values.</p>

            <p>The default date system in Excel starts at January 1, 1900.</p>
<p>But there is an alternative system where dates start at January 1, 1904. This is intended for compatibility with workbooks created on an Apple Macintosh.</p>
<p>The setting is stored with the workbook. If you copy dates from a workbook that uses the 1900 date system to a workbook that uses the 1904 date system, or vice versa, they shift by 4 years.</p>
<p>You can change the date system for the active workbook as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Office button.</li><li>Click Excel Options.</li><li>Click Advanced.</li><li>In the section "When calculating this workbook", tick or clear the check box "Use 1904 date system". (Clear it for optimal compatibility with workbooks created in Windows)</li><li>Click OK.</li></ul>

            Thanks for the reply. Yes, it matches. Sorry- 0x80072F06. i should mention that it's worked perfectly for years, and as far as i know I haven't changed anything. Also, when I tried to reconfigure the settings, I noticed that I can't override or edit User
 name, or Domain fields. Is this normal?<br />

            <p>After a&nbsp;little Binging, it really seems like this is a certificate error. You should be able to generate a certificate to install on the phone from the "options" in your Outlook Web app. IIRC, it was a .cer file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm not much of an Exchange expert- I blundered my around this certificate stuff a couple of years ago when I worked at a small company where i was the sole Windows Mobile user&nbsp;alongside a group of coworkers with iPhones.&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't used Exchange
 since, but I remember I had to download a program from Samsung's site (my WM5 phone is a Samsung) to be able to add the cert once I&nbsp;copied it to my phone.&nbsp;Apparently with&nbsp;newer devices like WM6.x, you can just tap on the .cer file to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much this will help, but there is some info on installing certs here:</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc182295.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc182295.aspx</a>&nbsp;(although it's for WM6, it also covers 5)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your last question, yes, it's perfectly normal not to be able to edit those fields in the server setup. The correct procedure to edit the server credentials is actually to delete the server profile (in Activesync Options on the phone, tap and hold
 on the server connection and select delete) then re-enter all of the server info.</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability and conflicts between programs, and can hinder the effectiveness

<p>If Avast is working as well as Windows Defender then suggest you need to leave&nbsp;well enough&nbsp;alone and stick with Avast - it's a good program.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might disable WD but Avast does not require it so that's optional on your part.&nbsp; You can't use both programs
 on the same computer so...be sure you have uninstalled MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you do not want to use Avast then uninstall it, run the Avast Removal Utility and perhaps MSE will&nbsp;work for you....but you'll need to once again try to uninstall/reinstall MSE.</p>

            I also read your thread. <i>He</i> made you work very hard! So many tools and logs! But, I think it helped you a lot.<br />
<br />
According to me, you should have some knowledge about malware you are fighting with for so long rather than just blindly following any suggestion (<i>Hope you understand what I am saying</i>). So I suggest you to see these:<br />

Are you using Avast or any other security program other than MSE and Malwarebytes Free?</p>

<p>There are different versions of Alureon that may require different fixes.&nbsp; That's why I asked you about the complete name of the malware...but if Major Geeks is helping you remove malware let's not deviate from their suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Avast is working okay then you probably need to stay with Avast and not worry about removing it to use MSE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever malware issues you had may have damaged or removed files so that MSE will not install and work properly&nbsp;again without an OS&nbsp;reformat/reinstall.</p>

            Have you tried both the links given by me. If it doesn't help, chances malware removal process corrupted system file(s). Scan your PC for errors. For that:<br />
<br />
<i>Make sure to be logged in as Admin before proceeding.</i><br />
<ol>
<li>Click on <b>Start</b> menu.</li><li>Type "<b>command</b>" in search box.</li><li>Right click on <b>Command Prompt</b> from results.</li><li>Click on <b>Run as Administrator</b>.</li><li>Type "<b>sfc /scannow</b>" in command prompt.</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, perform clean boot and then try to install MSE. For performing clean boot:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Make sure to be logged in as Admin before proceeding.</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <b>Win key + R</b>. This would open Run Dialog.</li><li>Type "<b>msconfig</b>" and click on <b>OK</b>.</li><li>In <b>General</b> tab click on <b>Selective Startup</b> radio button.</li><li>Uncheck <b>Load Startup Items</b>.</li><li>Click on <b>Services</b> tab.</li><li>Check <b>Hide all Microsoft Services</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Disable all</b>.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li><li><b>Restart</b> your PC.</li></ol>
<p>Share results of both methods with us.<br />

<p>I did try both links.&nbsp; The first link what what prompted me to post here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally found out how enable full on administrator mode, so thank you for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the sfc file in my regular profile as administrator and it came back clean.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I figured out how to open the administrator profile, I ran it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both times I got:</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried clean boot and installing MSE but got the same error.</p>

<h2>            I just renewed our office 365 subscription but it wants the email account info from the previous person and I don&#39;t know that. What now&#63;</h2>
                    Our office 365 subscription expired. The button popped up to renew the subscription, so I clicked it and paid the renewal fee. Now it's asking for the original purchaser's email and password to update the subscription. I don't know either of those answers.
 I have a Microsoft account, but it wont take that. It says I can use the product key to activate it, but I don't know where that is either. Is that available on my computer? I just want to finish my work..... why is this so complicated? I paid the fee....
 just turn it on already!!! Way too frustrated with this.&nbsp;

<p>This would be a problem with the settings on the iPhone. iMessages can only be sent between iDevices. There is an iPhone setting to Send as SMS when iMessage is unavailable which must be toggled on.</p>

    <title>Cannot sign into Onedrive or Onenote on Android or iOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sign into Onedrive or Onenote on Android or iOS</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been dealing with a strange issue since I've started at my new job where I cannot sign into Onedrive or Onenote on my mobile devices with my account. I am able to use a test office 365 account with the same exact licensing to
 login on my Galaxy S4 and iPad without any issues. I have been working with support for the past week but I can't seem to get an escalation out of level 1 to an engineer who can fix what seems to be an account level issue.</p>
<p>On the iPad when I try to login to Onedrive it tells me "We couldn't sign you in. Sorry, there was a problem signing you in. Please try again in a few minutes." I've cleared all the settings, uninstalled and reinstalled and it makes
 no difference. If I use another user's office 365 account with our domain it logs in without any issues. In Onenote on the iPad when lo logging into my account &nbsp;I get past the login screen but as it is trying to load my notebooks it says "Cannot set up notebook:
 Go to &nbsp;Settings &gt; OneNote &gt; Reset OneNote &gt; Delete All Notebooks &gt; ON. Then quit and restart OneNote." I've have followed these instructions and it hasn't fixed the issues. If I log into Onenote with a different account it works fine.</p>
<p>On the Android side of things, when I log into OneNote I get a message that reads, "We can't complete this task. Try again. Error code: 800003e9." If I use a different account OneNote logs in and operates normally. With Onedrive,
 when I login I get an error message that reads, "Setup required. Your account may not be set up. To set it up, we need you to sign in to the website first. If you still can't sign in, contact your IT admin for more info." If I use another account it works
 fine.</p>
<p>Here are some troubleshooting notes and general information:</p>
<p>1. We run hybrid Office 365. When my account was created it was done incorrectly and exchange wasn't working. The office 365 admin here recreated my account.&nbsp;<br />
2. Onedrive and Onenote work fine on my desktop and in the browser.<br />
3. After dissatisfaction with level 1 Onenote troubleshooting, our Office 365 admin wiped my account out a second time and recreated it. This resulted in a ID mismatch that completely broke Onedrive and Sharepoint. A Microsoft engineer just fixed this today,
 but I'm still back to square one in regards to mobile access to Onedrive/Onenote.<br />
4. Exchange and Skype for Business work fine on mobile, whether it's on iOS or Android.<br />
5. Removing and adding back licensing on my account has not fixed the issue.<br />
6. Wiping the iPad and Android phone of the Onedrive and Onenote apps and reinstalling has not fixed the issue. I've even done a factory reset on both platforms.<br />
7. Using another account I can sign into Onedrive/Onenote on iOS and Android without any issues.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for:</p>
<p>I need someone at Microsoft to take my issue seriously. I spent 5 hours on the phone last week trying to troubleshoot this issue and the level 1 engineer only had me change settings on my devices. I will admit we got a bit impatient
 and made the problem worse by recreating the account and causing an ID mismatch, however, once the Onenote engineer escalated to the Onedrive/Sharepoint team she attempted to close the ticket as quickly as possible. I've emailed that engineer to reopen the
 ticket but I've yet to receive a response. It's clear that my devices work fine with Office 365 and our domain. My account simply will not login to mobile for Onedrive and Onenote.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading through this post. I would greatly appreciate any assistance the Microsoft support team can provide.</p>

    <title>Multi-level List or List Style question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony kaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi-level List or List Style question</h2>
                    <p>I have a technical document that uses a list style to apply numbering to each section. I only use Headings 1, 2, and 3 for numbering purposes and they look like this on the ribbon while I am working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question has two parts I think. One is when I select the list style that I originally named and choose "modify" it no longer shows the numbering being linked to the headings. The second part, and the reason I tried to modify the style is because the section
 I amj working in is not numbering correctly. I am at 2.20 which is the 20th Heading 2 paragraph following the second Heading 1 paragraph. I want to insert a Heading 3 paragraph which should number 2.20.1 directly following the 2.20 Heading 2 paragraph. In
 the rest of my document the numbering is fine but this time it numbered my paragraph 1.1.1. I can fix it by copying a previous Heading 3 paragraph but I wonder why do I have to do that ? If I apply the saved list style I get the 1.1.1 and going in to modify
 it shows me it is not linked to any Heading styles. If I link them, then the next time I go in, it unlinked again. What gives? Maybe I am confusing defining a new list style and defining a new multilevel list? What is the difference?</p>

            Hi Tony,
<br />
<br />Step by step instructions for setting up your numbering can be found here:
<br /><a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbe...</a>
<br />----------------------------------
<br />This is a link to a Word MVP website. It contains accurate safe information that I think will help you. However, as an Independent Advisor I am required to give the following notice when providing non-Microsoft links:
<br />----------------------------------
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />This method may seem a bit of work but not using it for important work is asking for trouble. Once you have it set, you can save a template with it and use that template for new documents where you need good numbering that can survive editing.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

<h3> alirezanadi  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Lumia 950 XL</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I bought a Lumia 950 Xl, earlier last year. I really love Lumia. I remember that when I decided to buy it,&nbsp;I searched all the mobile phone stores in my city, but I didn't find it.&nbsp;A selling agent in one of the stores&nbsp;had himself this phone. He ordered it
 for me from Tehran, the capital in Iran. I really&nbsp;love it. I've been using it for a year. &nbsp;A few days ago, I was on a summit, the weather so cold and snowy. I gave my Lumia to a friend of me to take a photo from me. But, my Lumia slid from his hand and fell
 on the ground. Its screen broke. After it, I have been searching for LCD/Touch for it to restore it. I asked many the stores in my city and Tehran to buy it. It's been now 12 days. There's no LCD/Touch for my Lumia, unfortunately. I'm really unhappy. I just
 love to have Lumia windows phone. I love to restore it. Yet,&nbsp;this is my situation.&nbsp;I want to know who is in Iran whom I can buy this LCD/Touch from. Please help me. I want to buy an original LCD/Touch for my Lumia. I really don't know what to do. It's a bad
 situation. All my friends blame me why I bought this phone. I loved it. I don't listen to them. Please don't let me get unhappy with it. I just want Lumia. How can I have Lumia 950 XL, again?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know. I purchased My Lumia earlier last year, brand-new. But, in the inside settings, it says 2015 model. But, B2X doesn't support my IMEI. It says my phone is out of warranty. So it is out of service on this site. I really don't
 know what to do. Nobody tells me the right answer. Is this a Microsoft customer? There's no way ahead of me.</p>

            I did so. There's no official Microsoft store in Iran. I brought my Lumia to CityTel store I purchased my Lumia from. He didn't have LCD/Touch for it. He called via phone to a few stores in Tehran to collect it, but they didn't have it. He tried three
 days without any result. If, anyway, I find LCD/Touch, it would be very likely to be fake and that is another worry for me. I'm not sure how I can collect, if any, the original one. Do you see how&nbsp;hard and boring it is to be a Microsoft Lumia&nbsp;lover here??&nbsp;Is
 it&nbsp;the way it should be??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi. I mailed my phone to a so-called, Lumia Microsoft services center "lumiaservice.ir"&nbsp;in Tehran. I paid nearly half the price of the phone to replace its Touch/LCD for it. After two weeks, they fixed it and sent it to me. I checked it and discovered
 that both front and rear cameras didn't work. I have sent it back to the center to be fixed for it. I'm not sure if it's going to be fixed. Anyway, it's so frustrating to have a Lumia 950 XL here. Yet, I still love my phone and if I have to buy a new one,
 I would still buy it.
