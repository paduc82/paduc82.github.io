<h2>            Start button does the same thing on both&#63; This is supposed to be a system to work on every platform</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is supposed to be the operating system to work across all systems so that it has near the same feel and look across each system but to operate in the best fashion for each. I work with tablets, laptops, touchscreen ultrabooks, all in one pc's
 and desktops. All using preview there are some ups and downs. Mainly on systems in which use a mouse keyboard and touchscreen are all there it doesn't make sense for the bottom and side start button to do the same function. The bottom start button should bring
 up the new start menu that can use work but is improving, while the side start button should bring up the entire metro style page. These two buttons were built for different era's of use as we saw in 8 when it was mainly for tablets vs all preceding operating
 systems with it on the button with the generic start menu. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In other issues 8 and 8.1 has been great with splitting the screen so multiple apps can be used, but with the growth in tablet only devices using the multi window the ability to split the screen horizontally is also needed. To use two apps when walking and
 carrying the tablet as you would carry any notebook all the information is squished into two long bars, if they were to be stacked it would be a better use of the space on the screen a better viewing experience for all users</p>

            <p>This preview is intended to test out the "desktop" features and that's where the focus lies. The Modern-UI stuff is coming, in the Consumer Preview next year. Just be patient - what you &amp; I want is in the works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I'm feeling kind of restricted by this Preview, as I don't consider Modern as "tablet-only" and like it on my big mouse-driven machines as well. But I'm making MS aware that there's a demand for the Modern UI, not only on tablets, but still on
 the traditional computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's hope they find a good balance.</p>

</p><p>Hi Bennotevan</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video is a simple demonstration of what will happen when you change the computers configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Continuum component has not been released yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will need to wait until it is included in a future preview build.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am trying to formulate this whole spreadsheet so that it is only dependant on the B2. currently cell B3 matches the correct name to&nbsp;cell B2. I have a range of staff names allocated to varied departments (as below)&nbsp;in a data sheet that i am provided with
 this is for a range of about 800 staff amongst 15 departments.</p>
<p>What i need to do is Match and generate a list of the Full names of the staff by matching the department name.&nbsp; For example if i enter 2000 into cell B2 currently it matches to indicate that this is HR department. However.</p>
<p>In cell A10 i am currently trying to formulate using the INDEX MATCH option to generate all staff names however i only keep getting the first name then N/A after that. Below is the formula that i am using.</p>
<p>Summary Tab: Cell B2 - department code; Cell A9 - Full name</p>

<div>Another approach could be to Filter the data table (Data/Filter) and then select your Department number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or sort the list by Department Code.</div>

<p>Mike.... Could you please help me out again.</p>
<p>I currently am now getting all the data not specified to HR. just all departments</p>
<p>i.e</p>
<p>Currently in the All staff (data) tab column E is the full name Coulmn&nbsp;H is the department and B2 is the department 'HR'&nbsp;in the summary tab</p>
<p>=INDEX('All Staff (data)'!E:E,SMALL(IF('All Staff (data)'!H:H=$B$2,ROW('All Staff (data)'!E:E)),ROWS('All Staff (data)'!$H$1:$H$1)))</p>
<p>could you advise. Previously i was getting the first result for HR. Now the name doesnt correspond to the department. I needed what i did before though not just picking up the first value kind of letting the formula start again after it finds a value i.e
 so my results show:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Edward X</p>
<p>Megan H</p>
<p>Whoever else..</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
If you're using Excel 2003 then you can't use entire columns as range references in some functions in array formulas.</p>
<p>You'll have to use specific range addresses in these functions:</p>
<p><strong>IF('All Staff (data)'!H:H</strong></p>
<p><strong>ROW('All Staff (data)'!E:E</strong></p>
<p>I didn't read the whole thread but it looks like you want to return TEXT values.</p>
<p>Here's the array formula** (without the sheet name, you can add it yourself) with an error trap for TEXT.</p>
<p>=LOOKUP("zzzzz",CHOOSE({1,2},"",INDEX(E:E,SMALL(IF(H$2:H$10=$B$2,ROW(E$2:E$10)),ROWS(A$1:A1)))))</p>
<p>** array formulas need to be entered using the key combination of CTRL,SHIFT,ENTER (not just ENTER). Hold down both the CTRL key and the SHIFT key then hit ENTER.</p>

<h2>            Highly Focussed and Strong Feedback to Microsoft &#47; Developer Team</h2>
                    <p>Dear Windows Developer Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am using windows based phone since more than 2 years and i have great experience till now. But there are many things which i would like to point it out to make windows platform even more strong and stable. I have started my journey from Lumia
 cyan then updated to Lumia Denim on my Lumia 920 on which cortana was amazing feature. Then i have also enrolled in windows insider program on same phone for windows 10 but since hardware was not enough capable for windows 10 so i have downgraded to windows
 denim again. But i eagerly want to use windows 10 so i have upgraded my handset to Lumia 1520 which is amazing and powerful handset. I was very much happy and proud to use windows 10 on my Lumia 1520 despite of several things which needs rectification in updates
 and i was in hope that the things will get better in new updates. But in actual the things are really not addressed till yet in upcoming updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft is pushing out new updates day by day and my lumia 1520 is up to date as well. I am now in fear and afraid to install new updates as it is deteriorating the performance of my phone instead of making it stable in terms of applications and
 performance. There are many lists of things which microsoft has still not resolved in there latest and upcoming updates. Below are the lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Current OS configuration: 10.0.14393.1770 (released date Oct 2017)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Hey cortana still is not supported in India Region</strong> still need to change phone time and language to either US or UK for Hey Cortana. Really strange!!</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Battery life has drastically decreased</strong>. Need to charge twice in a day for normal usage which includes normal browsing and whatsapp without playing any games. With Previous WP builds battery lasts for 1 and half day with
 same normal usage.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Apart from these, my <strong>phone is also getting heated up</strong> from back top corner side.
<strong>The heat is too much that is similar to mild hot utensil</strong>. It was not heating in previous WP 10 builds.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Also seeing nowadays that <strong>latest apps are not supported on windows platform</strong>. Windows 10 is the latest and running technology in market then too apps are getting developed only for android and i phone ios. What about the
 users who are using windows 10 on there phone? Where will they go??&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>There are still many <strong>applications</strong> which <strong>
crashes abnormally in middle</strong> of the running them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Ram Memory is also the most important concern for now</strong>. With previous WP builds 2 Gb Ram was more than sufficient but now all applications are taking time to load (showing loading..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Developer Team / Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kindly focus on above mentioned feedback. Feedbacks are according to my overall 2+ years of experience and journey with windows platform. I too want to continue using windows platform. And will be glad if any action will be taken on that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I seriously want windows platform to come and stand in front of others competitor OS in all perspective of applications. I am sure that users like me will be always there to support you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking You,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sincere Windows User.</p>

<p>It would be better if you submit your feedback through the Feedback Hub app on your phone, maybe someone will pay some attention to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps development for Windows Mobile is up to the developers themselves. If you have any specific app enquiries you need to approach them direct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you have missed the news, there will be no further development of new features or new hardware for Windows 10 Mobile. You will only get (some) bug fixes and security updates for the next 2 years and that will be the end of support.</p>

            I am able to reproduce this issue as well.<br />
<br />
I'm running a 1st gen Microsoft Surface Pro 4gb ram, 128 gb SSD running Windows 8.1 Pro. The device gets nearly done with the update and then errors out with&nbsp;0x8007002C - 0x3000B and rolls back to a pre-installation restore point. This has happened both times
 I've attempted the installation and I'm happy to provide additional information as needed.

            <p>Hey Matt...that tablet is not compatible with Windows 10 yet. Wait until a later build comes out. But then again it may have something to do with which version of Windows 10 you downloaded between 32-bit&nbsp;or 64-bit</p>

            <p>That's disconcerting. It probably should have stopped me from updating if that was the case. &nbsp;I figured anything that ran Microsoft Windows 8.1 or 8.1 Pro was fine to upgrade as long as it didn't run RT (and even then, I figured there might be an update
 just for RT at some point, but I don't have any RT devices laying around the bat cave). Since I was on 8.1 Professional I figured it'd be fine and was expecting things to work semi-well (with the usual Alpha jitters such as this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I freed up a bit more disk space and mounted the iso (instead of just running the exe in it using Windows as I had the prior two attempts) and it seems to have succeeded. It made it to the whole "configure windows" thing where you can authenticate and configure
 basic settings and things now appear to be in semi working order. I'm not sure if it was just "jiggle the mouse a bit more during install" "mount the iso instead of running the exe" "free up more disk space" or simply 3rd time's the charm, but it appears to
 be better now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my recommendation for this error is to try freeing up disk space if you're as low as I was (~3 gb free at start of install) and don't attempt an unattended install - touch the screen or move the mouse periodically, just in case.</p>

            yes you should have at 16-24 gigs of hard drive space. It also may have been the chipset your PC is using. If your sure that that wasn't case, try testing it out on another computer. It's always good to have another PC laying around to see what works and
 what doesn't. That's what I suggest. The only problem that I had was with my keyboard which wasn't related to Windows at all.

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Microsoft Outlook 2016 and the following items are very tiny and difficult to read:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) folder list</p>
<p>2) contacts and contact listing</p>
<p>3) to-cc-bcc fields and email addresses within those fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change the font size for these items in Outlook 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Microsoft Community and Google/web searches and have not found an answer to this item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a limitation of Outlook 2016 or is there some back-door approach to doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have tried 'zooming' the screen as has been described in other posts and that still does not help me much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance that can be provided would be sincerely appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The items in favorites bar (the horizontal thing at the top) also exist in a folder called (not surprisingly) "Favorites Bar" in the favorites "pane".&nbsp; So, just do the "drag-n-drop" operations from the&nbsp;Favorites Bar<em> folder</em>&nbsp;(instead of doing it directly
 from the actual favorites bar itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving a folder "up" the tree is a bit tricky... since the pre-Anniversary Update version of Edge uses a "bread crumb" view rather than a full "tree view".&nbsp; So, to move something "up", you drop the item on the word "FAVORITES" (not an icon) at the top of
 the favorites pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, the Anniversary Update does make moving between folders a bit&nbsp;easier...</p>

<h2>            1520 will not startup - Stuck on Windows Logo after trying to install 8.1</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't seem to figure out my Lumia 1520 start up issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had windows 8.1 developer preview on my 1520. &nbsp;I was told that i needed to roll back to 8.0 for the device to recognize that the cyan update is available. &nbsp;I used the nokia recovery tool to do that. &nbsp;My device was then on 8.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I got notification that I had an update that "prepared" my device for windows 8.1, so i installed that. &nbsp;It went through a restart and booted up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After restarting I got another notification that I had another update for Windows Phone 8.1 cyan. &nbsp;So i procedded to install that. &nbsp;After it downloaded an installed the device went into a reboot. &nbsp;When it came out of the reboot it stayed stuck on the Blue
 Windows logo screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried both a soft and hard reset. &nbsp;Both do the same thing, after start up I get the nokia logo then it goes to the Windows Logo (Blue in color, center of screen) and stays there. &nbsp;It will stay there until it dies, or if I have it plugged into a computer
 or charger it will stay there forever (i even had it on that screen for over 30 hours!!) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the nokia recovery tool but it says it can't recognize my device, I am assuming this is because of Windows Phone 8.1 being on there...not sure tho. &nbsp;Any help is greatly appreciated, considering I am without a phone right now.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So I kind of used a combination of both responses to get the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I let the phone and Battery Drain all the way down. &nbsp;Then to charge it I used the correct USB cord (previously I was using a android tablet cord, however being an electrical engineer I really do not believe the cord mattered)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I was charging it, I continued to hold the DOWN volume key. &nbsp; This took a few minutes because the battery was so drained. &nbsp;Eventually when it did power up I did the hard reset button combination. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It eventually went to the spinning gears and then rebooted, as it was rebooting&nbsp;&nbsp;I also had the Nokia Recovery tool searching for the Device. Eventually the Nokia Recovery tool asked me to do a soft reset button combination and click OK. &nbsp;I did this, and
 then it found the software package for windows 8.1. &nbsp;It downloaded the file and then installed it. &nbsp;After it forced a restart it finally came out of the Blue Windows Logo, and booted the rest of the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any application for keeping attendance and student results - other than using excel workbooks? I have previously used iDoceo on an ipad and I'm looking for an equivalent to this.&nbsp;</p>

Hi Jilly,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
For your requirement about recording student attendance, test results, homework completion and teaching notes, I know that can be done with iDoceo product with something like a calendar or diary book.
</p>
<p>
The site calendar app in SharePoint Online also can do that. </p>
<p>
Create your own custom column to the even list. For example, Attendance column, teaching note… Then you can add record like below. For example, you had a math class on Apr.20 from 9:00 am to 10:00 am, all students took the class. You can make note in teaching
 note column. </p>

            <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 with external monitor and mini display port to VGA.. and another for DVI... and another for HDMI. Currently running Win 8.1 Pro (I will not commit it to Win 10, yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally my Surface will not recognise the external monitor until I have completely shut down the computer, plugged in the monitor and then started up. This happened when swapping from one monitor type interface&nbsp;to another. The mini display port is not
 too happy with hot swapping at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 on my test computer (HP Mini Netbook), it definitely does not like hot plug in of the external monitor. It has no problems with it's original Windows XP... but Win 10 won't recognise it until a shutdown, plug in and fresh boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 it shows under:</p>

                    My virus protection cannot be turned on after the latest update of Windows. There is notice about unexpected error everytime I try to restart Virus protection (In the security center, it said that threat service has stopped and I need to restart). I have
 tried many methods suggested in the Internet but none work. And I dont install any other virus-protection progam like Norton or Mcaffe.

<p>They really are having a laugh, aren't they. We poor miserable buyers take on a major update which fouls up something as fundamental as Windows Defender, and the best that&nbsp;Microsoft can do is to suggest that we reset the&nbsp;PC and re-install all our programs
 and apps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And I describe us as buyers because that's what we are - Microsoft gets all it's money from us.&nbsp; There are words to describe them........</p>
<p>Oh - and if I see any more idiotic suggestions about restarting the PC or making sure there's no conflicting antivirus software from another source....................&nbsp; Come on Microsoft. YOU have cocked up AGAIN. Don't make us do all the dammed work to
 fix it.</p>

<h2>            How can I stop a website from bombarding my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I mistakenly downloaded a document that I thought was delivery info, from an email.&nbsp; &nbsp;The email contained my address and other personal info, so assuming I or a website I was using, was hacked.&nbsp; Now being bombarded by a website salegrutboy.eu.&nbsp; My Malwarebytes
 program is currently blocking it but I'm getting a constant message pop up now with the following info on the blocked website:</p>
<p>Domain - salegrutboy.eu</p>
<p>IP address: 37.220.1.116</p>
<p>Port - various numbers - keeps changing<br />
Type: Outbound<br />
File: c:\Windows\sysWOW64\svchost.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted the download, run the Malwarebytes premium scan, the windows security scanner and AVG as well as trying to system restore, but nothing has worked so far.&nbsp; Anyone got any suggestions as to how I can resolve?</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am sure this has been asked before but never really resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOTES</strong></span></p>
<p>-&nbsp; After updating a PC to windows 10 we are receiving the following error message (see attached)</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Other PCs in the office have had same update but work with out the error message.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; If i add a .BMP file to the server and point access into that direction the error does go away.&nbsp; However, i dont really want to be converting 100s of images to BMP or cause other error messages to the other pcs in the office.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Also to note that the .BMP file is x10 bigger than the .JPEG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone have an answer for this?&nbsp; (thanks in advance)</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>OTHER NOTES</strong></span></p>

<p>Hi did you get anywhere with this, I have the same problem on 3 computers but the rest of the computers are ok, But what I found was that if you log in to the same pc under a different user name it works ok, so its not the server or database, its not the<br />
pc or office, just the user profile on that pc that's upset. All I can see to resolve this is to do a fresh install and hope Microsoft does not bring out another update that might upset it. Or was it AVG internet security business edition when it removed<br />
something to do with native images in the windows folder?? who knows.</p>

<p>Hi AssadullahAsif,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting error 0x8024a10a could be caused by a possible software conflict or corrupted/damaged system files. If you have any antivirus or antimalware software installed, we suggest that you temporarily disable it when installing an update.<br />
<br />
If the update still fails even if your antivirus software is disabled, then we suggest that you proceed with running the
<em>System File Checker</em> tool to scan and repair various system files that could be corrupted or damaged. See this

    <title>Automatically Taking 30 Minute Lunch Out of Hours Worked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave cole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically Taking 30 Minute Lunch Out of Hours Worked</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to automatically take out 30 minutes from a persons hours worked but only if they worked more than 6 hours. My setup is like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td style="text-align: center">A</td>
<td style="text-align: center">B</td>
<td style="text-align: center">C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Time In</strong></span></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Time Out</strong></span></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Hours Worked</strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">2</td>
<td style="text-align: center">8:30</td>
<td style="text-align: center">17:00</td>
<td style="text-align: center">8.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">3</td>
<td style="text-align: center">10:00</td>
<td style="text-align: center">14:00</td>
<td style="text-align: center">4.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Is there a way within the formula in the C column =(B2-A2)*24 to automatically take out 30 minutes if the total time worked is greater that 6 hours. I do not want to go to a D column because when I print this out for an entire week spacing is at a premium.
 For my staff they have a 30 minutes "lunch" that is unpaid whether it is taken or not so it is a constant with all staff unless they work a shift less than 6 hours then it is not taken out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope what I said makes sense. I feel like it might be an "if" function but not sure how that works in the same cell/formula if your if function is dependent on the same cell. I have decided it is impossible but I would appreciate any help that someone
 smarter than me can give. I have learned with excel there are very few impossibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Getting the actual formula of NORMSDIST in Microsoft Excel 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luinox86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting the actual formula of NORMSDIST in Microsoft Excel 2007</h2>
                    Dear Sir/Madam,<br />
<br />
During my study in Master Program, we reached a phase in our project where we have to calculate the Anderson Darling normality test.<br />
<br />
We are coding our project using Visual Basic 6; for getting the result for Anderson Darling normality test, we were using a calculator written in Microsoft Excel 2007 (can be found here); what we needed was the values of p-value, AD test statistic, AD* test
 statistic, Sample mean and Sample Sigma.<br />
<br />
Let me explain our problem now:<br />
The results calculated in the Excel file are very reliable, but our Visual Basic 6 program needs to calculate a few thausand values and we need the result real-time. We accessed the excel file directly from VB6, but the delay for accesing excel file makes it
 impossible to have our program working real-time. <br />
<br />
We tried to code a calculator like the Excel file I mentioned above in VB6. After a lot of searching in the Internet and by my own, I wrote the code in VB6 and download like 4 functions that claim they calculate the Anderson Darling normality test. I tested
 these 4 and mine one, they are calculating the AD values, but not exactly what we were looking for.<br />
<br />
I looked up the excel file to find the difference and I found out that no one of us (nor writers of the codes I downloaded) have the correct value of function in Excel called NORMSDIST; the value we calculate for this functoin, is different after the 6th decimal
 point onwards.<br />
<br />
I searched a lot and asked a lot of people about this. This matter is stopping us for like 2 month already. I search in Microsoft website and read the help pages about NORMSDIST: First and Second. I&nbsp; followed the instruction but I still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Hereby I would ask Microsoft Excel 2007 support team, we would really appreciate it if we can have the actual formula of NORMSDIST (and the actual values it is using) that Microsoft Excel is using.<br />
<br />
If you need any further details about the project and/or the codes we have found/written in VB6 I can send you all of them once you ask.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are looking forward for your reply,<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely.

<p>Thank everyone for the effort to help me. Yes, I finally came up with a great combination.</p>
<p>I used a combination of Graeme West's Cumnorm code and some other resources (I don't remember/find them now; but I should, as soon as possible if I want to upload it somewhere I think!).</p>
<p>The NORMSDIST comes from the code written from Graeme West's Cumnorm&nbsp; and there are some other functions and calculations for calculating Anderson Darling test.&nbsp;It took my group like 3 month to find a answer to it.</p>
<p>Anyway now I created an encapsulated module in vb6 that calculates the Anderson Darling test statistic exatcly as we want (and exactly like the<a href="http://www.kevinotto.com/RSS/Software/Anderson-Darling%20Normality%20Test%20Calculator.xls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Anderson
 Darling Excel Calculator</a>). Before uploading it somewhere, I need to find all the code's references I used; by the time being if someone needs it send your email in this post and I will email it to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact problem was that we needed this calculation to be done over thousands of data in real-time. Accessing Excel would make a delay of like 0.02 seconds for each data, and for 120,000 data its noticable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank all of you again guys. Happy to join the SocialAnswers ;)</p>
