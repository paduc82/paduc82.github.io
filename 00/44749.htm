<h3> ggn toxicfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            INDIE GAMES for Austria</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello, my Gamertag is GGN Toxicfire.</span></p>
<p><span>Lately&nbsp;I got very interested in Indie games, wich can be seen on youtube and the Live Marketplace more often from month to month, but i live in Austria and have an austrian Account, wich doesn't allow me to buy Indie Games.
</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know why we can't buy such games, even thought we pay the same price for gold membership as every other country. Lots of austrian Gamers would like to buy Indie Games, but just can't because we arn't able to
 buy them here. </span></p>
<p><span>My big Question is: WHY ? Why don't we get the same things as other Countries ?
</span></p>
<p><span>It would be nice if this post would be answered by an Microsoft Employee and not just other Xbox-Members.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope for soon Answer.</span></p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This has to do with your government and their laws on availability of Indie games. Since they are rated in a different way many countries don't allow them. This is a big issue in Australia as well. It's not as though you don't have any Indie game's available,
 it's that you don't have certain ones available and for that you'd need to reach out to the independent developers to find out why their specific game is not available on the Austrian marketplace.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to tell you when and if certain Indie games will be made available on Xbox LIVE in your region, neither will forum support agents, sorry.</p>

    <title>Store &#39;broken&#39; after storage drive fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeo sullivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Store &#39;broken&#39; after storage drive fail</h2>
                    <p>So I had my os on an SSD and my storage on a HDD, the usual setup, and my HDD failed. Problem is that I had Windows set upto install apps on the D drive. I'm not sure which but I think the Store must have been there too, or some files from it since it has
 stopped working along with my storage drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else Windows was storing on it exactly, but I remember seeing a folder called SoftwareDistribution and a few more folders I think were related to Windows, something like WUupdate, or WUapps or something. (not sure why?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,</p>
<p>since the drive failed I set windows to install to the C drive again and relinked the folders and libraries that were previously linked to D. The os is running fine for the most part but I can't get the Store working/installed. The icon has disappeared too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several things like the: </p>
<p>get-apps-package method (didn't work), </p>
<p>wsreset (store purgecache: Package could not be opened), </p>
<p>sfc (won't go past 20%), </p>
<p>DISM (doesn't run at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if there's maybe, a reg entry that has to be changed to tell windows to stop looking for the store at D, or if anyone knows a way to get this sorted again. My last resort is to create a new user account and transfer my files over to it but that's
 a pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to do a reinstall and lose everything, but I have a feeling if I reinstall and keep my stuff (like installing an insider build) that it won't fix it as apps have a way of passing along their mistakes to the next build...</p>

            Hi Joeo,<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your concern about missing Windows store, you can perform the steps below to search and pin Windows store app to Start:<br />
<br />
1. Enter the Windows store in the search box on the taskbar.<br />
2. Right-click on the store and select Pin to Start.<br />
<br />
We also suggest you to create a new Microsoft account to check if the issue persists in a new account. Steps can be found by clicking this

<p>
</p><p>When you reset where you save the apps you used the Settings-System-Storage options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Settings-System-Apps &amp; Features and select one of the errant apps you can left click and get an Advanced Options link.&nbsp; Can you reset one from there, the Store is listed?</p>

            <p>HDD is dead, didn't get a chance to copy the system files from it, or get a new one yet. But I have all my storage files backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yea, I used the storage tab in settings-system-apps &amp; features, the drive options there are blank now. I also moved a few apps manually with the 'move' button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the 'reset' in advanced too and it gives the same result as wsreset.. (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">store purgecache: Package could not be opened)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought storing apps on D would do that, store apps on D, not store all sorts of files critical to the Store itself and other stuff. I only done this because I had downloaded a 20GB game from the store and didn't have enough space to spare on my ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Update and firewall have stopped working now too.. I think I'll just do a full clean install of 1607 and start from scratch..</p>

            <p>Space on Storage locations can be a problem for Win 10.&nbsp; If you are running a small SSD and the large storage volume is no longer present, there may just not be enough room for repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would never run an SSD smaller than 250 GBs on a system.&nbsp; And even that depends on what else is taking up space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose something else you might check is to look at Task Manager and see if any apps are still showing which could need their task ended.&nbsp; The Store could be one unless it has disappeared also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting may also help and running the SFC more than once could help.&nbsp; If you want the command to pull out the SFC listing so you can check what it says, here it is.&nbsp; Use an Admin Command prompt and probably start checking from the bottom up for error messages.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>The MS engineers usually give up after telling you to run sfc or create a new account... lol!</p>
<p>I did run SFC several times, and dism a good few times too but it never got past 20%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I just done a complete fresh install there now. </p>
<p>I did have some backed up system images but they all had the store and store apps linked to D as well, so I would have been back to square one with Windows trying to access them on a drive that wasn't there anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be nice if MS had a proper repair service that actually worked without losing everything..</p>

            <p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query about your Windows Live Mail. I understand that you cannot send email after the error you received in your Internet Explorer. Let's try to isolate if the issue was on the configuration of Send/Receive Messages option in your
 Mail. Kindly follow these steps to check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On Mail, press <strong>ALT + F</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Options</strong> and select <strong>Mail</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under <strong>General</strong> tab, look for the <strong>Send/Receive Messages</strong> section.</p>
<p>4. Make sure that under <em>If my computer is not connected at this time</em>,
<strong>Connect even when working offline</strong> was selected on the dropdown list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, try resetting your settings in Internet Explorer to isolate if this really contributes to the issue. You can do it by following these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On Internet Explorer, press <strong>ALT + T</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click<strong> Internet Options</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under <strong>Advance</strong> tab, find <strong>Reset Internet Explorer settings</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly update us afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<h2>            Stop a Windows 2012 R2 Server from restarting after Windows Update</h2>
                    I have a Windows 2012 R2 server that supports Exchange 2010. Windows updates were installed and now the server says it is going to restart today. Is there a way to prevent it from restarting until I can schedule a maintenance Window?&nbsp;

                    I just&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;Windows Vista Ultimate 64bit after having problems with&nbsp;KB2378111 &amp;&nbsp;KB967723 repeatedly showing me that they needed to updated but in the history it showed that they were installed. I tried to find an 800 number for Windows support
 only to find out later that I called and allowed a scam/phony&nbsp;Windows support person into my computer who then tried to install some bat file onto my computer that my Winpatrol caught and prevented which is the reason for my current&nbsp;re-install.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am usually impatient while installing Windows updates, I will install other&nbsp;software&nbsp;and download software while updates are&nbsp;occurring which I figure may have been the problem with the earlier install, so this time I very patiently just ran the updates
 as they came up, everything was perfect until the last update which I remember was a few after Service pack 3 for Microsoft Office 2007. I shut the computer down after installing the last updates and when I stat the computer up it shows these failed to install
 yet appear to have successfully install earlier in history.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried downloading them to the desktop, installing one by one, selective service&nbsp;start-up, Winpatrol off, Avast uninstalled, and Windows fixit, and none of these have solved the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help as I no longer feel safe using my computer with what has happened in the last week especially when you read what these KBs say they are are for.</div>

<div><span>Hi,</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What happens when you try installing the updates manually? What is the exact error message received?</span></div>
<div><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Have you uninstalled the updates prior installing it manually?</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span>Scenario 1:</span></strong></div>
<div><span>If the updates are successfully installed and still you are offered those updates then follow the steps from the following article and check:</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span>Scenario 2:</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>If the updates are not successfully installed then follow these steps:</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong></div>
<div><span>Uninstall the updates from the computer and install it manually by downloading it from the Microsoft Download Center.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong></div>

<h3> jmp9030  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype continuously logging me out a few seconds after logging in on Android.</h2>
                    I use two Huawei handsets. One is Honor Note 8 and the other is Mate 9. I have used the Note 8 for more than a year and the mate 9 for about 3 months. On both phones, when I log onto my Skype of Hotmail email account I briefly see the content as the account
 initialises then all of a sudden, it logs me out to a dialog box asking for my login credentials. If I go through the login process, I log in as usual but the moment initialization is completed within some seconds, I am logged out again. Please assist on how
 to deal with this problem as I cannot run my Microsoft applications on these to Huawei phones. Skype works well on my TECNO Camon X Pro and it used to work without these complications for the year that I used it on the Honor Note 8. Problems started about
 a month ago when I logged into my hot mail email account on the Google email app on the Mate 9. Not sure if that is where the problem is.&nbsp;

            Hi  ◊†—î—èŒ∑—î◊†26 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I would not be concerned with seeing such an error in Event Viewer:
<br />
<br />Event Viewer will produce entries all the time. As long as you are able to boot to the desktop, launch your programs, use it successfully, these can safely be ignored. Errors will happen from time to time, the operating system will handle it. Unless its catastrophic where you can't use hardware, apps fail to launch, you can't connect and browse the Internet or update Windows.

    <title>How to Get Around Windows 7 SP1 Requirement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jp2code  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Get Around Windows 7 SP1 Requirement&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an older DELL D630 laptop that shipped with Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the basic upgrades to it a few years ago (larger disk drive, RAM), and it is now running Windows 7 x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything about the laptop is fine for my development requirements. It is reasonably fast, never has an issue, and is hooked up to my docking station running smoothly on my dual monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the Windows 7 Service Pack a few times; however, <strong>installation fails because it cannot find compatible display and audio drivers.</strong> I already have the latest for both my older Intel Integrated Graphics and my audio is not
 DirectX 9 compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my display and my audio, so I have not installed <strong>Service Pack 1</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am finding that a lot of software out there will not install on my PC simply because I am still at Win7 instead of Win7.1 (Paint.Net, Visual Studio 2013).<br />
<br />
So, what exactly is Windows 7 with Service Pack 1?<br />
<br />
From <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/whats-included-in-windows-7-service-pack-1-sp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 7 Service Pack 1 Description">
Microsoft's website</a>:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) is an important update that includes previously released security, performance, and stability updates for Windows 7. SP1 also includes new improvements to features and services in Windows 7, such
 as improved reliability when connecting to HDMI audio devices, printing using the XPS Viewer, and restoring previous folders in Windows Explorer after restarting.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>OK. I do not enable Windows Updates on my PC, and my laptop does not have HDMI. Therefore, these features do not appear to be any breaking benefit on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, it looks like there is nothing in Windows 7 that physically prevents new software from installing other than there being some entries in my Windows OS that reports it isn't new enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a way to edit PC settings so that installing software thinks my PC has this service pack?</strong></p>

            <p>So, I ended up doing some research on Dell's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There, I got the model and version of the Intel integrated audio/video, then found an upgrade to that on Intel's website that was just published this past August (was not available the first time I attempted to upgrade to Windows 7 SP1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I upgraded the Dell BIOS to a version that was released in 2013. Before, I was recommended only to upgrade the BIOS when reinstalling an operating system, so I did not elect for that. This time, either it worked or I would reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting, I used Windows Update to select SP1, installed it, and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still came up with non-SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows Update again, again selected and installed the Win 7 SP1. Again rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second time is a charm. The second install worked.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen Error After Windows 10 Upgrade -- Thinking About PC Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonmartin89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screen Error After Windows 10 Upgrade -- Thinking About PC Reset</h2>
                    <p>I got the free upgrade to Windows 10 a while ago from Microsoft. After doing the upgrade, every time the computer boots up and goes to the desktop, it the computer gives me a blue screen with an error message that says: "Your PC ran into a problem and needs
 to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you." Below this, it says on the same screen: "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (igdkmd64.sys)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the problem only occurs if the internet cable is plugged in. If I unplug the internet cable, the computer appears to run fine... I tried playing a few games of cards that came with Windows 10 just to test and verify this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked with some tech help people from Microsoft about this, and they suggested that it might be drivers associated with the network adapter. They said I should go to the website of my motherboard manufacturer, download the latest drivers, put them on
 a flash drive, and transfer them to the computer with the problem, install them, and see if this solves the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went to the following link and got the driver called "ASRock XFast LAN Utility ver:10.10" and transferred it over to the computer having
 issues, then installed it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>http://www.asrock.com/MB/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/index.us.asp#osW1064</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried plugging in the internet cable to test it, and within a minute or so had another blue screen error crash/restart.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Previously, a Microsoft tech thought it was a display adapther, and told me to go into device manager and uninstall it.&nbsp; That didn't fix it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Microsoft tech just told me that it must be a hardware issue since I installed the motherboard driver I mentioned above, and said I would have to bring it into the nearest Microsoft store to have them look at it.&nbsp; Apart from the fact this would be
 a 3 hour drive, I don't really want to do this because I know it can't be a hardware problem for one simple reason:&nbsp; everything was fine while I was on Windows 7.&nbsp; The problems only began after I accepted Microsoft's free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been talking to various Microsoft techs for a few days now and the problem hasn't been resolved.&nbsp; Googling the problem, I see lengthy discussions on these forums and elsewhere of people trying to solve similar issues under similar circumstances (People
 with intel systems who have blue screen errors after upgrading to Windows 10). The forum threads look really long and the fixes look like they would take a lot of time, and in some cases the users say they made their issue worse and make the computer get a
 blue screen error even faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One guy did say doing a clean reinstall of Windows 10 (by this, I'm assuming he means a reformat).... fixed his problem right away, but at the cost of losing his files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking I want to do something like that at this point just to get this computer working quickly and save time, if people here think that would fix it. Or go back to Windows 7... but apparently Windows 10 no longer gives me the option to do that since
 I procrastinated in solving this problem (I upgraded like a year or 2 ago when Microsoft was giving out Windows 10 upgrades for free and I'm only just now getting around to working on this problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm looking at the recovery options on this problem computer... one says "Reset this PC" ... and it says it will let me choose to keep my files or remove them, and I suppose it reinstalls Windows 10. One potential problem though is that I got a warning
 that says "Your apps will be removed," and it shows a long list of programs, many of which came on discs that came with my motherboard and other system components I purchased when I assembled the PC several years ago. I no longer have all those discs.&nbsp; Will
 that create a big problem for me if I choose this option? And also, will doing this "Reset this PC" option put a stop to the blue screen issue? Will this be just as good as reformatting the computer with Windows 10, and would it solve my problem more quickly
 and easily?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some of my system specs in case that's relevant to solving this problem:</p>
<p>Intel Core i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40 GHz</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left"><span>ASRock Z77 Extreme4 LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard</span></p>

<p>Resetting removes all your installed apps, even those you originally installed from discs. You will need to reinstall them manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting is the same as performing a clean install, but it can save your personal files: documents, pictures, music, videos, etc.&nbsp;</p>

            I was going through the procedure one of you linked to to get the minidump files.&nbsp; The directions say to zip them with winzip, but winzip is giving me all sorts of errors too.&nbsp; The files are only 278KB each, which seems pretty small.&nbsp; Do I really need
 to zip them before uploading them to you?

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are getting an error when you zip the files, you can save the DMP files directly to your OneDrive and share it by posting the link here. So we can check what's causing the Blue screen error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Reset this PC and custom install has the same function, but the custom install will let you save your apps, pictures, and files as MVP

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was curious if you had checked your <strong>Settings</strong> within Surface.<br />
First, tap or click your <strong>Messaging</strong> app, then swipe from the right side of the Surface to the left to open your charms.
<br />
Once opened, tap or click <strong>Settings</strong>, then tap or click <strong>Options</strong>.
<br />
Make sure that the <strong>Send/Receive messages</strong> button is slid to <strong>
On.</strong> <br />
</p>
<p>You may also&nbsp;want to check these three settings:</p>
<p><strong>Privacy </strong>and <strong>General Settings</strong>, and <strong>Notifications<br />
</strong><br />
Under <strong>Notifications</strong>, make sure that the <strong>Messaging</strong> notification is turned

            Yes, that was always clicked on. I managed to get it mostly functioning by doing a full, restore-to-factory reformat. The messenger now works normally with almost all my friends, but I can receive incoming messages from one of my friends only about 10%
 of the time. My iPhone and PC work just fine with her messages, so it's something specific to the Surface. I still can see all my outgoing messages in the chat, regardless of the device on which I send it.

            Not really, I just use Internet Explorer to open Facebook and do my messaging there. I was wrong before actually, I can't receive incoming messages from other people just like before. However, it works sporadically. Just today a friend started messaging
 me, and the notifications appeared in Messaging and functioned normally, but a few minutes later another friend messages me without anything showing up on the Surface.

<p>Not sure what you mean by sending pings that don't come back, mate. Do you mean to say that you cannot find a match? Or are you encountering an error code? Does this same issue occur with any other games?

<h2>            Forbidden Windows Kernel Modification - Repost</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to play any game running Easy Anti Cheat (EAC), I have a legitimate version of Windows 10 Home reinstalled TWICE and I also bought a key for it. I updated to the latest version of Windows that released today and
 I'm still having the same problem. This is a literal game-breaking and high severity issue since I can't launch or play any game running Easy Anti Cheat (EAC). I've opened two support tickets with Easy Anti Cheat (EAC) and I've got absolutely no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Naser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Still not fixed with the new Windows Update one individual keeps telling me EAC is a virus, what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This has been reposted due to the fact that my previous post was up for a full week, almost two weeks and it only received 2 responses which were completely useless.</p>

            Hi Naser, 
<br />unfortunately this is typical enough problem with anti-cheat or game protecting tools. They may be updated to compatibility with latest Windows releases too late. Please ask game support too.

<h2>            Running Windows 7 on Bootcamp, can&#39;t activate Windows.</h2>
                    I bought a brand new iMac and am running Windows 7 via BootCamp. The install went fine, but the product key will not work. I bought at WalMart, and it had the hard plastic on the case, so it was not tampered with. I cannot get the option for the automated
 phone call to come up. How do I resolve this, or does it really matter?

            <p>A hard reset can be accomplished by opening up settings and choosing the restart option OR you can hold the button down on the front of the console until it beeps and restarts. In either case it is similar to a hard reset in that it deletes the cache and restarts the console. As J3RS3Y DEVIL said console reset to factory default is the only other option and you can choose to save your games and content or delete it all and start over.</p>
