<h2>            Can&#39;t edit to ODFB doc in Word for Android</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple word files&nbsp;(.docx / Word 16) that cannot be edited on my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) through the Word app.&nbsp;Once the file is opened in Android Word, I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/183ec95c-434c-42ad-9b92-45079e5875d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/183ec95c-434c-42ad-9b92-45079e5875d5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I sign in, and the message pops up again - always. I noticed if I open the document using "Office Mobile" instead, I can edit the file, but without the better editing features Word for Android provides. Also, I saved the same document to my One Drive Personal
 account, and it opened - and was editable - using the Android Word app no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get this message to go away? Using the sign in button does me no good. I'm pretty sure I have full rights to the document, so it seems like an error in the Android Word app.</p>

            <p>Thank you for trying to help Parth, however, it's no longer required.&nbsp;After trying many different approaches, I finally got it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is what I did:</strong><br />
<strong>1. Completely reset the Word Android app by either uninstalling it, or by going to Settings in the app, and pressing "Reset" to get rid of all existing accounts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MOST IMPORTANT STEP:&nbsp;DO NOT USE your @somebusiness.com account - i.e. your Office365 business account. - when you start Word for Android for the first time. Instead, click the "sign in" button and use a different account, like your One Drive Personal
 account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. After this, you can then "Add a place" (if you click Open or Save); add your @somebusiness.com account - i.e. your One Drive - Business / Office365 for work account.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Info that might help this glitch being fixed:<br />
In the past, I had different Microsoft accounts that used the exact same *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account. Somehow, maybe, when I clicked the "sign in" button on Word - even using my newest password - the old Office365 account's&nbsp;authorizations are&nbsp;getting added
 and so when I try to save to my new Office365 account, even though it sees the correct files, it doesn't think I have the correct permissions to save. JUST A GUESS...</p>

    <title>How do I uninstall Office for Mac 2004 after I have already downloaded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rubyru  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I uninstall Office for Mac 2004 after I have already downloaded Lion&#63;</h2>
                    So I installed the new Lion OS to my Mac and realized afterwards that Office 2004 does not work. I have upgraded to Office 2011. Now I'm trying to uninstall Office 2004 and since the whole software package does not work for Lion, I cannot run the uninstaller
 that is found in the "Additional Tools" folder. Does anyone know another way around that? I read on the support site you can manually uninstall the program if you remove all the files but I some how cannot find those files on my computer. Help!&nbsp;

    <title>Subform data disappears after I advance to new record - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trackercabrera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subform data disappears after I advance to new record</h2>
                    <p>I made a database with a form and subform. It was working fine and I was entering data. Then, I decided to add a command button to move to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next Record. After I did that, when I entered data in the subform and advanced to the next record, the data would go into my table, as it should. However, if I clicked back to see the previous record, none of the data show up there. But the entries all show
 up correctly in the proper tables. I am not sure where I went wrong? I tried deleting the command buttons and it still didn't make these forms work properly. I also manually deleted all data from my tables and started over. Same result. Any ideas what I did
 wrong and how I can fix this? Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            That's very hard to say without having a copy of your database. Maybe best for you to restore a backup from before you made this change.

            What code or macro actions are used behind the button to move to a new record?&nbsp; My first thought, from your description of the behaviour, is that the subform's DataEntry property is being set to True, but, as Tom says, one cannot be categorical without
 being able to debug the form hands on.

<h2>            Error code &#58; 0x8007000d</h2>
                    I tried to use the microsoft security esentials program. It installed without any problems. Once I tried to update it a error code came up 0x8007000d with no description. I recently used msconfig.exe to fix a problem witch caused more problems now when
 I start windows after a few secounds I get other errors saying dual core center experienced a problem and needs to close also my video and audio drivers seem to have stopped working as well. I have genuine windows xp professional 32 bit with service pack 3
 and all of the other updates installed and up to date I tried putting it back on normal mode with msconfig with no results. My chkdsk also will not finish and gives me errors only the automated dskchk works when I restart my pc. The help and support will not
 open when I try restarting it in control panel. Plz help and send info to my email address thank you for your time.

<p>That error translates to something meaning that the data is invalid - the installer fails and can't proceed. And that's an odd error to be getting on an update of the signatures. However, you are having loads of other problems that tell me that you may be
 better off backing up your important data and then formatting the drive and installing Windows fresh, or using the manufacturer's restore process.</p>
<p>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</p>
<p>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</p>

 I uninstalled the software of windows mobile device center with intention of reinstalling, but cannot find the actual download to reinstall on my computer, and Sprint is clueless as how to fix it.

<p>I am using lumia 720 for the past 2 years.</p>
<p>My problem started a few days back when my lock key got stuck and operated as if of its own mind. it wont respond to my commands. 2 days later my lock key got totally un-functional and the problem of automatic lock was also gone. I then installed an app
 for locking my screen and turned on the double tap for unlocking the screen. The subsequent night while my phone was charging , i tried to check if the lock key was operating or not. The instant i pressed the lock key, my screen got blank and from then on
 it is not turning on.</p>
<p>I have tried Everything , From soft reset to connecting it to my PC. I also plugged it in for charging for few hours but still it is not responding in any way.</p>
<p>Please tell me Of any solution to it.</p>

<h2>            threatening email received</h2>
                    <p>I received this email today and it is scary.&nbsp; I don't care about being exposed as visiting an adult site but she has my password:</p>

Subject: ladydb1 - edjazz12</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do know, edjazz12, is your password. You do not know me and you're most likely thinking why you're getting this e-mail, right?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well, I actually installed a malware on the adult video clips (sexually graphic) site and guess what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your web browser initiated operating as a RDP (Remote
 Desktop) that has a keylogger which gave me access to your display screen and also web cam. Just after that, my software program gathered every one of your contacts from your Messenger, social networks, and email.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What exactly did I do?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I created a double-screen video. 1st part displays the video you were viewing (you've got a good taste hahah), and second part displays the recording of your web cam.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What should you do?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well, in my opinion, $1900 is a fair price tag for our little secret. You will make the payment via Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search "how to buy bitcoin" in Google).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BTC Address: 19kQT8RpsNNAM5UQ6RjRxRcHbeHhYf6SES</span></p>
<p><span>(It is cAsE sensitive, so copy and paste it)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Important:</span></p>
<p><span>You have one day in order to make the payment. (I have a special pixel in this message, and at this moment I know that you have read through this mail). If I don't receive the BitCoins, I will, no doubt send your video recording to all of your contacts
 including relatives, coworkers, and so forth. Nevertheless, if I receive the payment, I'll destroy the video immidiately. If you want evidence, reply with "Yes!" and I definitely will send your video recording to your 6 friends. It's a non-negotiable offer,
 therefore don't waste my time and yours by replying to this email message.</span></p>

<p>This is a scam.&nbsp; It is a frightening one because it includes an actual password that you have used, but yeah its a scam. Variations of this attack have been making the rounds throughout 2018. Never, ever send money to these criminals.&nbsp; Also, change your
 passwords and use different passwords at different websites </p>

    <title>Excel clearing linked cell when deleting entry within a combobox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel clearing linked cell when deleting entry within a combobox</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a a combobox to populate a specific cell when an item from the dropdown list is selected. &nbsp;In addition, a have a formula on a separate sheet testing the the range where the linked cell lives for any entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTIF(TimeSheet!$A$49:$N$57,"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"")+COUNTIF(BillingSummary!$A$59:$N$67,"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula works fine at first, however when I go back to clear the cell using the combobox the formula still returns as "True" even though it looks like nothing is there. &nbsp;If I manually delete the linked cell the formula returns false. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defintitely stumped, any ideas?</p>

            <p>Facebook is the only place I have problems, and I did contact Facebook&nbsp; and their answer was :
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get rid of explorer and use either Godzilla / firefox&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty much anything but Explorer .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So again my question is : why explorer is not working well with facebook ???</p>

            Hi Sylvie,<br />
<br />
Did you try playing same games using Mozilla firefox?<br />
<br />
As the issue occurs only with the facebook games, then the issue might be with the facebook. I would suggest you to play facebook games in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />

 browser in the store, I would have never of bought this because the reason I bought this was to play games and write and school. my friends asked me about it and so far I have told 10 of them to not bother because there r no options. even my phone gets better

    <title>Mac Excel 2011 Open Recent Dock Option missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oakatc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac Excel 2011 Open Recent Dock Option missing</h2>
                    This week I updated my Office 2011 installation with the recommended update. Since doing so the "Open Recent" option in the dock icon is gone for Excel&nbsp;&nbsp;(14.2.0). The option is still there when you click and hold on the Word dock icon, but not Excel.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm guessing this is a problem with the update.</div>

            I checked my preferences as you suggested and the checkbox&nbsp;for&nbsp;<b>Show this number of recent documents</b> was checked. I unchecked it and quit Excel. I reopened Excel and re-checked the box. I then quit Excel again and reopened
 it.
<div><br />
<div>After that the "Open Recent" option in the dock icon reappeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might be able to get it back by just unchecking and rechecking the box without all the quitting that I did but that is what worked for me.</div>

            <p>Outlook needs a data file to contain the non-mail default folders like Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Journal, and Notes.&nbsp; IMAP data files cannot contain non-mail folders.&nbsp; Also, you cannot make an IMAP data file the default data file for this very reason.&nbsp;
 Thus, when using an IMAP account, you must have at least two data files - one to be the default data file and hold the default folders, and one to hold the IMAP folders.</p>
<p>By its very nature, IMAP accounts leave messages on the server and the contents of the IMAP data file must match exactly the folder structure on the server.&nbsp; Since every IMAP mailbox can have a separate folder structure, every IMAP account in Outlook must
 have its own data file.&nbsp; There's no way to have multiple IMAP accounts share the same data file.</p>

    <title>macro special character - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stormst_13  say:</h3>
<h2>            macro special character</h2>
                    Hi everyone!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a question to ask, because I have run out of options.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have recently bought a MacBook Air and an Office for Mac 2011 Professional software for it, though this Office can't be bought in the hungarian language.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have a macro package for this company, that runs on PCs fine, but when we put it in the Mac version, we loose a character every time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In hungary the letter " &nbsp;ő &nbsp;" is part of the normal alphabet and used in some important words (like for the number 2), and a macro, that writes the written form of numbers, can't work well without it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I copy the macro inside the macro editor it puts in a similar character, but that can't be used in formal documents, and when I try to write the actual letter (it is on the hungarian keyboard) inside the macro, it puts in " &nbsp; _ &nbsp; ". I can't copy it
 in either, it switches the character when I paste.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me with this? If we can't put it in, we can't use the package and it would be important!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in forward</div>
                </div>

            In a macro, you need to show "high-order Unicode" characters like that as character numbers. &nbsp;The internal text strings in VBA will not go above ANSI (128).
<div><br />
<div>That character is Unicode: U+0151, UTF-8: C5 91.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Which makes it a very simple macro:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub Macro1()</div>
<div>'</div>
<div>' Macro1 Macro</div>
<div>'</div>
<div>'</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.InsertSymbol CharacterNumber:=337, Unicode:=True, Bias:=0</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note that CharacterNumber expects a DECIMAL integer, so I converted it. In Word 2011 VBA the function to convert Unicode (Hexadecimal) to decimal does not exist, you need to convert the numbers using a calculator.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 &#38; 2016 - recently hangs after switching users in Windows, corrupts OST &#38; PST</h2>
                    <p>I started experiencing this a few months back when running Win 10 + Outlook 2013, and upgraded to Outlook 2016 in hopes this would fix the issue but it currently occurring. Sure seems like an Outlook bug, any help in finding a solution most appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario: My wife and I share a computer running Windows 10, with separate Microsoft accounts to access our separate profiles on the shared computer. This means it is common for us to switch between our profiles potentially several times each day. I commonly
 leave Outlook running, and use Outlook to access multiple email accounts I use (2 are Hotmail accounts and 2 are gmail accounts). This had worked fine for many years previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago (originally with Outlook 2013), when switching back to my profile I would find Outlook unresponsive (and receive the prompt informing me as much), and have to request to restart Outlook. Sometimes Outlook would restart fine, but typically
 after a few days of this at some point I'd get the message "The File C:\&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.OST cannot be opened" followed by "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution is to create a new Outlook profile and re-setup all my email accounts. What a pain. I also have a .PST file for keeping my historical mails, and have also had that become corrupted requiring me to run SCANPST to repair the file (and suffer
 some data loss due to corruption along the way). I upgraded to Outlook 2016 via an Office 365 subscription in hopes it would fix this problem. Sadly the same thing keeps happening. I am currently seeing this happen about once every 3 days and have to keep
 recreating new Outlook profiles. Wastes my time and frustrating to say the least. The only pluggins for Outlook I have are the Microsoft Exchange add-in and Norton Anti spam add in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

                    I was calling up my resume to reformat and suddenly this message from Linked-In came up indicating I could get help with my resume. &nbsp;This is an invasion of my privacy! &nbsp;I did not sign up to receive ads from an external company, and particularly from one

<p>
</p><p>The first column is the data to insert conditional formatting and also the result returned by Excel. &nbsp;As you can see, result shows only two yellow icons instead of the result I expected - five icons. The second and third column is my working to show why

<p>I am just 14 and know that Lumia 535 does not support zoom while clicking photos in camera but want to know that is any software needed to introduce the feature of zoom or its a hardware responsible for the lack of this feature ? If the feature can be added
 by a software update then I request Microsoft to introduce the update for Lumia 535 supporting camera zooming feature but if its a hardware issue than I know that no one can do anything in that.</p>

<h2>            burning cds using windows media player</h2>
                    When I try to burn a cd , I get the message, Cannot burn some of the files. I followed the suggestions, clicking on the blank disk and deleting the files on my burn list that indicated some error had occurred. This eliminated half of the tracks on my burn
 list. The tracks were a mix from various CDs that I ripped, with some from the same original CD working and some not. I checked to see if the songs were protected, and they were not. Why won't they all burn?

            <p>It's a bug - MS are focussed on Groove Music which has no burn (or rip) options and IMO, not maintaining WMP properly - because disc use is in decline they don't seem bothered! I have replicated this problem on two different laptops (Dell/HP) running WMP12
 and Windows 10. It is to do with temporary burn files not being deleted properly -so wmp 'thinks' there are too many files to fit the disc. I have got it to work by using disk cleanup to remove temporary files but even this has failed to resolve the issue
 completely.</p>
<p>Until MS fix this (will they ever?) I have to (reluctantly) suggest TP software is the best option. I can burn the same set of tracks straight away (no problem at all) using iTunes for WIndows... but a less space-heavy option for anyone not needing iTunes
 would be something like imgburn - Cheers, Ric.</p>
