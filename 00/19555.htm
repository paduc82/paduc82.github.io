<h2>            Problem with video playback in HD</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if it is "normal" reproduction cutting in certain occasions when an HD video (1280 x 720p).<br />
<br />
I downloaded a YouTube video with that resolution and copied it to the mass memory of my Nokia N8-00. When I see him going all right, but sometimes short and says "Loading ...", sometimes 2 or 3 times in a 5 minute video.<br />
<br />
This also happens when playing HD videos recorded with the camera. Is it normal? I think not, it seems that the processor (CPU) and the GPU are overloaded, but my phone has no more applications. I have 140 MB free memory on C and 10GB mass memory.<br />
<br />
The only application is memory resident 'WhatsApp'. I have an N8-00 with the OS 'Nokia Belle Refresh' but this happened since 8 February (when Nokia launched 'Nokia Belle').<br />
<br />
P / D: With Belle Refresh I do not see the number of 'Line 1' above. Good! Look at the pictures ... : D<br />
<br />
Greetings from Argentina.</p>

            Hi LiptomICEI,<br />
<br />
How do you manage to get 140MB free memory on C: Phone Memory of your Nokia N8-00? When you installed Nokia Belle Refresh did you install using FOTA (Firmware Over The Air) method or you used Nokia Suite? If you used Nokia Suite method how tell me the space
 of C: Phone Memory before and after the update and whether you got ColorizeIt application and Maps Suite 2.0 after the update via Nokia Suite. I updated mine using the Nokia Suite method and had Maps Suite 2.0 before so I cannot tell if it is included yet
 in the changelog it is said to be included. My update was 306MB in size
        </p>

<p>The following applications are installed on C:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>WhatsApp </li><li>Opera Mobile </li><li>Smart Office </li><li>Nokia Internet Radio </li><li>Shazam </li><li>FastTube </li><li>ScreenSnap </li><li>X-Plore </li><li>Mr. AppLock </li></ul>
<p><br />
Right now I have 124.3 MB free memory on C and 11 GB mass memory. The team goes perfectly, except for video playback. The menu is fluid and open applications quickly. Updating the REALIZE through Nokia Suite. The application ColorizeIt uninstalled it because
 I did not like and Nokia Maps 2.0 works correctly with the map of Argentina.<br />

            Hi LiptonICEI,<br />
<br />
Concerning sending you a private message, some users here do not prefer private messages and as well may not respond, so you cannot know which one does or which one doesn't so as to avoid that the best way to communicate is through the forums as this forum
 is mainly a user to user experience and helping one another to solve their problems so no hard feelings for that.<br />
<br />
About the problem that you have addressed, I was able to reproduce it when I played a video that I recorded with my Nokia N8-00 camera and it said loading only once for a 5 min video. I am also using Nokia Belle Refresh firmware so may someone from Nokia or
 those more knowledgeable than us try and see if they can reproduce this and tell us whether it is normal or not?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

                    <p>Which version is the OneNote that opens full screen (non resizable window) and which has no menu ?
</p>
<p>As there is no menu there is no "save as" option and no means to find where the file is stored (if it is stored locally ?)</p>
<p>I can find my notes online with OneDrive but I would like to export them to / open them in One Note 2013.
</p>
<p>I can only "print" them in One Note 2013 which is not what I want to do.</p>
<p>Any idea please ?</p>

<p>This is the Onenote <strong>App</strong> from the Windows Store, <strong>not</strong> part of MS Office.</p>
<p>It stores notebooks on Onedrive, nowhere else.</p>

    <title>How do I Customize the Office Fluent Ribbon by Using an Open XML - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I Customize the Office Fluent Ribbon by Using an Open XML Formats File</h2>
                    <p>We have several corporate wide Word templates developed in Word 2007/2010 in which the Fluent Ribbon was customized with a Tab with specific functions to a Word template. The customization is not carrying forward to Word 2016 / Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find the below article, however it references Word 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customize the Office Fluent Ribbon by Using an Open XML Formats File</p>
<p>(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/office-shared-vba/articles/customize-the-office-fluent-ribbon-by-using-an-open-xml-formats-file)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outstanding questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't customized Fluent Ribbons carry forward?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to recreate the customized Fluent Ribbon in Word 2016 / Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find documentation on how to customize the Fluent Ribbon in Word 2016 / Windows 10?</p>

<p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm updating this thread with what has happened since you sent me the template and I've returned it privately to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I did was to use the <a href="http://openxmldeveloper.org/blog/b/openxmldeveloper/archive/2009/08/06/7293.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CustomUI Editor</a>, which is available free from OpenXMLDeveloper.org. It is a better tool and method to use versus opening the DOTM file as a ZIP because it is safer and give a bit more flexibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening your template using the CustomUI Editor I was able to validate that your XML code for Word 2007 and the editor also allowed me to save a second version of the XML using the Word 2010 XML namespace. Now your template is able to run on ALL Windows
 versions of Office from 2007 thru 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are loading this custom template as a global add-in, meaning you are placing it into the Startup folder of Word then if you are still not seeing the custom tab when you start Word... that means Word has disabled it. You will have to clear that disablement
 before Word will allow the add-in to run again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two types of disablement... Soft and Hard. To remove a Soft disable... Word cannot be running at all in the system. Then start Word and goto File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins and check if your add-in is listed in the Inactive list. Assuming it is, then at the
 bottom of the Add-ins dialog is a pull-down menu, which should say Com Add-ins and click the Go button. A new window will open, your Add-in should be listed and you need to Enable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Word has performed a Hard disable... From the Add-ins/Manage pull-down menu select the Disabled Items and then click go. Removed the disabled checkmark by your Add-in name. After clicking OK you should go back to the Manage: Com Add-in menu and make sure
 your Add-in is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final action in either case is to quit Word and restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office365 Start Screen Slow &#40;Not Responding&#41; -- Loading templates&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever I open word/excel/powerpoint/etc, it takes approximately 30seconds+ to load (on a SSD). &nbsp;The application will not respond during this period, but I can see spinning loading indicators on the templates screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can bypass this by setting Office to skip load screen and start a new blank document instead, however the loading pause will occur the first time I press File.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Office never used to do this, but has started doing it recently. &nbsp;Possibly ever since upgrading to Windows 8.1, but that may be coincidence. &nbsp;I have tried re-installing as well as doing an online repair.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is anyone else having this issue? &nbsp;Does anyone know of a fix?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            FIX:
<div><br />
<div>I was able to fix this issue, though my "fix" may not be recommended.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since it was a single user account issue, I explored the CURRENT_USER folder of Windows8 registry and found Software-&gt;Microsoft-&gt;Office.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then backed-up this registry (as a precaution) before deleting it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first time launching Word was slow as it re-configured, but now it opens speedy again.</div>

            Additional Details: (I wish I could simply edit my old posts, but I don't see an edit tool).
<div><br />
<div>Deleting the suggested registry will cause Office to become unstable. &nbsp;However, the issue is caused by something in it (localizing the exact registry key/setting is not realistic).</div>
<div><br />

<p>Yes, on the feedback app page, just select the wording that says sign to each App individually (not recommended)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will allow you to sign&nbsp;to into just the feedback app.</p>

            <p>Hi Anula,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>firstly, thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to answer: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have an outlook account with 4 email addresses. One of these, 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, which is the default account, from yesteday morning started showing the number of incoming unread mails in the blue, but nothing showed on the preview space, only old mails.</p>
<p>On clicking the "inbox" nothing further happens. If I double-click it then the "inbox" expands and&nbsp; collapses the constituent sub-folders. I do not receive any error messages.</p>
<p>I have run all the usual diagnostics from within Outlook and all show ok.</p>
<p>All the other folders are also ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have referred to the link you sent me. However, the <span>OFFICE14 folder does not have Scanpst.exe, therefore I cannot peroform this action</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas??</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>thanks again </span></p>

            <p>As Arshad said there is no way to to adjust cell Height in Mac OneNote. You can adjust width. But In &nbsp;can insert space two ways one is simply while in a cell hit return and height will increase by one Line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use Method I show in this screenshot, if you read and follow annotations in the screenshot.</p>

            <p>Thanks. Inside a container it's no problem. The problem is if the container grows and starts overlapping containers below it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no way of shifting the other containers down you might as well not have containers at all it seems.</p>

            <p>As you add information The height grows to accommodate information inputted. So if you start out with line Height the size of one line. The entire Row grows by height of another line, and repeats each time a Line is added.</p>

    <title>I will get copy of email in my Sent folder from someone sending out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredpoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            I will get copy of email in my Sent folder from someone sending out emails when &#91;Send As&#93; me is set in his&#47;her Mail Delegation setting.</h2>
                    <p>In my organization we use an ERP (accounting) software package and&nbsp;almost every person&nbsp;uses it.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a timer service running on the&nbsp;server together with the software.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this&nbsp;timer service, there is&nbsp;SMTP email connection set up&nbsp;using my&nbsp;email account
 to send out workflows, invoice&nbsp;past due&nbsp;notices,&nbsp; or when an user sends out email (such as invoices to customer) from the ERP program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See screenshots below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for the users to send out&nbsp;emails from the program,&nbsp; I have set up in each user's Office 365 mail delegation settings to be&nbsp;able to [Send As] me.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that since 9/18/18, I will get a copy of all these kind of emails (sending through the ERP software) in my Outlook's [Sent] box.&nbsp; There would be almost a&nbsp;hundred of such emails every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp; I never get such mail copies before 9/18/18 and I am wondering if Microsoft has changed some settings over at Office 365 on the night of 9/17/18.&nbsp; Or if there some settings I can set/change so that I won't get a copy in the Sent folder?&nbsp; Since
 this would fill up my email storage space really quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any feedback or comments.</p>

            Hi FredPoon,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. However, this is new improvements that are being made to the SMTP Authenticated Submission client protocol that will be rolled out beginning September 1, 2018. Email messages that are sent out will be
 stored in the Sent Item folder of the mailbox that is used. This behavior lets the user determine which email messages are sent by a multifunction device, and makes it easier to troubleshoot issues.<br />
<br />
 policy for the Sent Items folder should be set to empty the folder before the mailbox becomes full.<br />
<br />
For detailed information, please refer to the article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4458479/improvements-in-smtp-authenticated-submission-client-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Improvements to the SMTP Authenticated Submission client protocol</a><br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

    <title>Different results copying a page&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webbrewers3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Different results copying a page&#58; explorer&#47;content&#38;structure&#47;SPD</h2>
                    
<p>Copying a publishing site page to a different directory (folder)&nbsp; using either windows explorer or content and structure makes an incomplete copy of the page. Most web parts are missing (but not all). Copying using SPD works properly. Rhetorical question
 (because real questions about everyday use of O365 never get rational answers here):</p>
<p>WHY?</p>

<p>Hi Mchv2.0,</p>
<p>I did a test of copying a publishing page in the Pages library of publishing site to another folder within the library using Open with Explorer, but I didn't see any web part missing on the copy of the page. To narrow down this issue, could you let us know
 the following information?<br />
1. Is the site based on the publishing portal template? Did you move the page to a folder within the Pages library?<br />
2. Please share some screenshot indicating the symptom of "incomplete copy" for comparing the available web parts in the original page and the copy.<br />
Note: To insert a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select the Insert Image icon.</p>
<p>3. What is the page's content type? Does this issue happen to other pages in the Pages library or other publishing site? Try to create a new one to see if it works.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>hi mchv2.0,</p>
<p>because i can't reproduce this issue, i need to know the detailed information in order to narrow down for proceeding further. besides, based on my test, when i try to move pages in the pages library, the copy/move button is greyed out.</p>

<p>I don't see the options if a page is checked out. I do if I check the page in.</p>
<p>I said in the first post it was a publishing site, yes.</p>
<p>The page has quite a few web parts - it looks like only the page layout is getting copied unless I use SPD. Try it out using content query and content editor web parts and let me know what happens.</p>

</p><p>To&nbsp;assist you with the issue could you please confirm a couple of things:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>How do you access Outlook.com? Is it through a Web Browser or an Email Client?</span></li><li><span>Has your Account migrated to Outlook Mail?</span></li><li><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I suggest you to access your Account through a different Web Browser and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply Andria, here are the answers for your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I access Outlook.com through google chrome (browser)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I didn't do anything to migrate it... at least i don't remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The issue started a couple days ago, when trying to access outlook.com through my browser (after making no big changes to my PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Is there any possibility that i got infected with a virus that, while i try to access my email through my browser, redirects me to a fake page and therefor steals my account's information? Or rather, is there any known virus that disables people's access
 to their email?</p>

            <p>I have been having same issues since last week when I tried to open hotmail as per usual.</p>
<p>I access hotmail.com through google chrome.</p>
<p>All of my hotmail accounts have auto migrated on their own to Outlook a while back, without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting, enabling, blocking, emptying cookies and cache galore following directions on forum.</p>
<p>I have even run a malware bytes scan through the system.</p>
<p>I have run a full scan with Windows Defender.</p>
<p>I have tried using different browsers- IE, Mozilla</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it my computer? Is it Outlook? Is it a virus? How to I fix it please?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have "Keep me signed in" active, but somehow I'm still logged at this point in and I'm immediately taken to my inbox.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. It started yesterday, May 29. I have two outlook accounts, one works fine and the other exhibits this problem. The one that works fine has the upgraded GUI athough the one that fails is a migrated outlook account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Chrome, and have followed the usual suggestions of clearing caches, cookies etc.</p>
<p>When I follow suggestions from another poster in this thread, close the tab that failed and open and new, and navigate to hotmail.com, I am already logged in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems to me like a potential security hole if I was on a shared computer: there is no indication that I successfully logged into the failing tab so I would walk away, and the next person to check their hotmail would in fact be checking mine.</p>

<h2>            Location Tagger</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I found the Location Tagger on Betalabs Page (here: <a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/betas/view/location-tagger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://betalabs.nokia.com/betas/view/location-tagger</a>)</p>
<p>I have N96 and Location Tagger is implemented allready but&nbsp;if the phone fails to tagg the picture for some reason is it posible to install Location Tagger from Betalabs to be able to add locationtagg after the picture is taken?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another situation it could be nice with sepparate locationtagger is when you have taken indoorpictures, when you leave the building later&nbsp;you could just mark some pictures just outside&nbsp;and add the locationtaggs to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Location Tagger from betalabs does not work, does another equal application exsist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>

In order to resolve this please try to do the following:<br />1. Check for System updates for your phone<br />2. Remove the account from Outlook app<br />3. Delete Outlook app<br />4. Go to store and check for updates<br />5. Download and install Outlook app and set up your account using this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-the-outlook-for-android-app-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a><br /><br />Please share the results.

            Dear Kevin,
<br />
<br />As a matter of fact this makes a difference. Since you are trying to add business account, you need to contact your IT administrator to check if you have group policy restrictions or you require 2step verification. Maybe you nee to set up account manually and change encryption, but that information you can obtain only from your IT administrator.

    <title>Office 2010 Professional Plus on multiple computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thaboozz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 Professional Plus on multiple computers</h2>
                    So I purchased a product key and a backup CD of Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus which had the license to install it on three computers. So I installed it to my three family computers (my old laptop, my PC and my father's laptop). Then we got these
 laptops from our school and I tried to install it on that but when I had entered my product key to the installer and installed the Office again, I went to activate the Office on my school laptop (at this point I had already removed the entire Office from my
 old laptop) and it said that I can't install it because the product key had already been used as many times as possible. So I went to do a little research and then I got into the Microsoft forums. There were some threads about installing Office on multiple
 PC's. And on one thread someone said "it can be installed again if you remove it from an old computer you have it on."
<br />
So please if you have anything to help my problem, please do help. <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have already removed Office 2010 Professional Plus from the old computer, you will be able to install it on the new computers.</p>
<p>However you may face some issues with activation as you have already used the 3 licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may contact the Microsoft Product Activation and then activate Office 2010 Professional Plus. Refer to the following link for more information:</p>

<h2>            Having problems setting up Yahoo mail&#33; HELP&#33;</h2>
                    I purchased the Samsung Focus as an upgrade to the Captivate (I don't like Android). I went to SETTINGS to setup my e-mail and noticed an entry for Yahoo mail. It asked me for my e-mail address and password and I entered them in. The phone and this point
 displays "Yahoo! Mail account info is incorrect" and displays as space for me to reenter my e-mail address and password. I had the SAME problem with my Captivate and its driving me crazy. Setting up Yahoo e-mail on my iPhone 3G was a breeze. By the way, I
 followed the instructions to the letter on the Windows Phone 7 site. Could this be a Yahoo or Samsung issue?

<p>RESOLVED!!!</p>
<p>The issue was with special character in yahoo password. Have done several testing with different yahoo accounts.</p>
<p>Special character that doesn't work in yahoo&nbsp;password from WP7 is: % (Note, this same special password character works if you sign-in from WP7 using IE). Change your password so that it does not contains this % (or any) special character requiring you to
 press SHIFT key in your keyboard. This sould fix the issue.</p>
<p>hotmail, gmail and outlook works with this special character. May be a bug in yahoo's code that verifies SMTP forwarding. Anyways, I am filing a bug with WP7 team.</p>

<p>It isn't straightforward. Broadly speaking, you have to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. ensure that your server allows the database to be opened from the IP address(es) you want to use. Everything after this is on the client machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. ensure that the MySQL ODBC driver is installed on the client machine. (There was a MySQL OLE DB provider at one time, but AIUI it is no longer supported, so I'm not going to go there)</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. create an ODBC DSN (e.g. in Control Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools-&gt;ODBC Administrator). You can probably use a Machine DSN (User DSN or System DSN - these are stored in the Registry; the System one should be available to all users on the machine) or a
 File DSN with a .dsn extension (using a file dsn can make it a bit more obvious what is in the DSN)</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. Use Word VBA to make the connection. You can try manually, going via MSQuery (the old method) but I have never got it to work with Word 2007/Vista, even though it works OK with Excel). Once you have made the connection and saved the Mail Merge Main Document,
 you should be able to repen it and click through the usual security question to reconnect. However, because it seems to be impossible to connect without using VBA, you're then in trouble if for some reason the reconnection fails.</p>
<p>The VBA needs to look something like this for a Machine DSN. Putting the database name etc. in the Connection string should override the equivalent values in the DSN, and you will also have to put a password in the Connection string (or you could consider
 putting it in the File DSN). However you do it, it's probably a security risk that you will need to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub connectToMySQLViaODBCMachineDSN()</p>
<p>With ActiveDocument.MailMerge</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' lose the existing source, filters and sorts</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.MainDocumentType = wdNotAMergeDocument</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' specify the merge type</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.MainDocumentType = wdDirectory</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' For a machine DSN, use an empty name. You</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' used to have to specify the Subtype</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' wdMergeSubTypeWord2000 in that case</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' Recently, Word has begun to expect</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' delimiters such as quotes around the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' table name in the SELECT. If you have to</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' add them, I don't know what to use in MySQL</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' Server needs to specify the IP address</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.OpenDataSource _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Name:="", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Connection:="DSN=mydsnname;Server=192.168.1.29;Database=mydatabasename;" &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"User=myusername;Password=mypassword;", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sqlstatement:="SELECT * FROM user", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SubType:=wdMergeSubTypeWord2000</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a File DSN, you try the following (notice that you have to use FILEDSN instead of DSN in the connection string)</p>
<p>Sub connectToMySQLViaODBCMachineDSN()</p>
<p>With ActiveDocument.MailMerge</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' lose the existing source, filters and sorts</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.MainDocumentType = wdNotAMergeDocument</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;' specify the merge type</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.MainDocumentType = wdDirectory</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.OpenDataSource _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Name:="c:\mydsns\myfiledsnname.dsn", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Connection:="FILEDSN=<span>c:\mydsns\myfiledsnname.dsn</span>;Server=192.168.1.29;Database=mydatabasename;" &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"User=myusername;Password=mypassword;", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;sqlstatement:="SELECT * FROM user", _</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SubType:=wdMergeSubTypeWord2000</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<div><br />
<div>FWIW if you connect using Excel, it's usually a lot easier. But Excel then saves a .odc file that Word does not appear to be able to use.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Time zone options in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srinivasan b k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time zone options in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need following options in Outlook mail client:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Configuring email accounts in different time zones and it should not disturb system time zone. In other words, Outlook should allow user to follow their own time zone instead system time zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Configuring time zones for email accounts as it is in MS Exchange. In other words, time zone details should be imported from MS Exchange instead of using system time zone or setting their own time zone.<br />
</p>
<p>It seems there is no such options in Outlook as of now.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; Regards<br />
Srinivasan B K<br />

    <title>Lumia 1520 Feature Confirmation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> furiyon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 1520 Feature Confirmation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm really despo to get a Lumia 1520 I jus LOVE the beauty of it but recently at build 2014 Nokia announced Lumia 930 which is almost similar to 1520 in small size but there is something else named SensorCore which is included with 930. So. I am curious
 will 1520 have that too or is it only for the new wave of devices to come. After lot of surfing for this confirmation I got nowhere so people here might be of some help. Can anyone confirm whether 1520 will have SensorCore or not it maybe the new Green version
 but I just want to know will it have that extra added hardware or not ?</p>

            Sensors Core is a SDK tool for developers which give them direct access to sensors of all Lumia smartphones. So it's a developers feature. I think both Lumia 1520 and Lumia 930 are same in terms of hardware so if you're ok with extreme phablet size then
 you should buy 1520.

            Hey donofworld first of all thanx for the reply but I'm aware that its a developer SDK but there is something related to hardware as well known as something like motion sensor I wanna know whether that is available or not ?

<p><strong>Earlier this week at Build Nokia announced the Nokia SensorCore including an SDK for developers.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I get from this sentence is, sensorcore is a hardware and it also has a SDK for developers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: After a bit research on snapdragon website, i can say that sensor core is a part of the CPU and Nokia is providing a SDK for it</p>

<p>Yeah after a bit of refernce on Qualcomm website SensorCore is already on Snapdragon 800 processors so I think its already present inside 1520 but they did not really use it until Nokia releasing its SensorCore SDK. But once that is out i think 1520 would
 have apps that are going to be more awesome</p>

<p>&nbsp;I believe the os, firmware and some built in apps already uses the sensorcore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But now, with the SensorCore SDK, third party app developers will have direct access to the sensor core, reducing the CPU usage and resulting better battery performance</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity can anyone tell me there are any downsides of buying 1520 other than the screen size coz I'm game with that size but other than that I've read the quality of build is not so good on this model coz there are many cases where screen got
 cracks by falling from low heights there are many of those complaints so can anyone comment on this</p>

<h2>            Odd macro issue with Word. Permission denied - SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>NOTE: SEE MY 2ND REPLY. I FOUND A AMAZING SOLUTION ON ANOTHER WEBSITE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with Word (old 2003) version that I've never seen before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to run macros, some run fine. For others I get a "Runtime error 70: Permission denied." Also, if I try to record a macro, the option is greyed out. I tried changing&nbsp;macro security set to low, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>I found the answer from this website </p>

<p>
</p><p>This worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>replace the sendkeys command this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim wshshell As Variant </p>
<p>
</p><p>Set wshshell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") </p>
<p>
</p><p>wshshell.SendKeys "{FX}" X being the nubmer of the function key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution was for the same question involving Access. I don't know if the affects other versions of Office and other operating systems</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a keeper. Very nice.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Sync Error 0xE000002E</h2>
                    <p>This error is persisting after a full sync. It was originally referencing an issue with one specific section (Tab) under one notebook. I copied the section/tab in question to another notebook that sync's without issue. I then deleted it from the troublesome
 notebook but I'm still getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later. (Error code: 0xE000002E)"</p>

<p>Hi Joey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re seeing the 0xE000002E error code, OneNote needs to refresh but can't do so automatically. This is typically a temporary issue and should resolve itself the next time a full sync occurs. If you don’t want to wait for the next automatic sync, you
 can force a full sync by pressing Shift+F9 while OneNote is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reference</strong>: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-the-0xE000002E-Out-of-Sync-with-Store-error-in-OneNote-51ccc0f3-4568-426b-bec9-ea2e4d17e951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Resolve the 0xE000002E (Out of Sync with Store) error in OneNote</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, try the following suggestion: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In OneNote, click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Info</strong> &gt; <strong>View Sync Status</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Shared Notebook Synchronization</strong> dialog box, click the notebook icon with a yellow triangle warning over it to see the name of any section that’s causing sync problems.</li><li>Click the <strong>Sync Now</strong> button next to the notebook containing the section.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Individual notebook sections can occasionally stop syncing properly. If you have a single section that isn’t syncing with the rest of an otherwise up-to-date notebook, you can copy the problematic section in to a new notebook and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps don't work, section sync errors or problems can also be caused by a corrupted section located in the
<strong>Notebook Recycle Bin</strong>. If you no longer want that section, you can delete it from the Recycle Bin to stop the error.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the OneNote notebook, open the affected notebook and click the <strong>History</strong> tab, and then click the
<strong>Notebook Recycle Bin.</strong></li><li>If there’s any section or page which you do not need, delete the section or page.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, try the suggestion from the following article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-issues-when-you-can-t-sync-OneNote-299495ef-66d1-448f-90c1-b785a6968d45?ver=16&amp;app=onenote.exe&amp;CorrelationId=0274a457-281f-41c0-857f-f1d82c1f2636&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;ocmsassetID=HA102774369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix issues when you can't sync OneNote</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Provide the screenshot of Office 2016 <strong>Product Information</strong>. To get this screenshot, open OneNote 2016 on your system, click&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account</strong>, capture the screenshot of all the information mentioned under&nbsp;<strong>Product
 Information</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Check if you are getting this error with a specific notebook.</span></li><li><span>Where do you store your notebooks?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Neha</span></p>
