    <title>OneNote recording problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote recording problem</h2>
                    <p>I've been using many years OneNote2013 (yes, this is our University program version which I can't change) for making my notes so that I have text and audio files included to the same note. It's very handy and the only reason that I'm using OneNote. I use
 it in PC, iPhone and iPad. Everything is updated properly. But now, two days ago this audio recording stopped working in all of my devices. When I start the audio recording with microphone icon just an empty audio file shortcut symbol appears to the file with
 the time stamp but no recording starts like normally it should do. Any idea what's going on with this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like the cause of this issue is related to some updates or programs installed on your devices. We would like to ask some questions to know the best possible resolution to offer:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you received any error messages when you tried to record an audio?</li><li>Have you tried checking if there are available updates for your OneNote 2013?</li><li>Have you tried reinstalling your OneNote 2013?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done on your end?</li></ul>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <p>No error message. Only a new empty file appears immediately.</p>
<p>No I haven't. Iphone na iPad has every now and then new system updates and pc is updated by University's own system admins.</p>
<p>So I haven't done any separate reinstallation, but perhaps I should try now.</p>
<p>I have just checked that microphone works ok in other programs. It was surprise that this malfunction was in all devices and systems same time.</p>

            There is actually an error message if I try to play this empty file that appears. It says that there is trouble in playback and that I should close other programs and if it doesn't help I should reboot the system. This is what I have also tried but it
 doesn't help. To reinstall the program to iPad it says that all the data will be deleted. This would be a catastrophe, allthough it syncronized with my pc and iPhone, but still, can I be sure that my files are not swept away.

            The (not so) funny thing is that this problem apply to all of my devices (so I have OneNote in iPad, iPhone and PC all in sync but now not able to make audio recording). So if you can solve the problem to my PC (running our Windows 7 enterprise and all
 the legal Office packages etc.) it would probably tell something about the whole system. One funny thing I noticed after Apple device updates and I don't know if this has been before: when using Spotify I was suddenly able to choose from PC to playback my
 iPad or iPhone i.e. choose in my PC Spotify's user that instead of playing a song from PC loudspeakers it started to playback the song in iPad although the control panel was running in PC. Any connections to this behavior with OneNote 2013 malfunction?&nbsp;

            Now I noticed that recording actually works in PC without any reparation&nbsp;(the behavior looks similar to iPad (or iPhone) behavior but recording runs ok in the background). But in Apple devices it doesn't work anymore which is pity because this has been
 very handy to use notes across both user systems. I've sent an error message via my iPad OneNote user interface, but it looks it goes to Microsoft so I don't know how to make a note/complaint about it to Apple?

            I was in phone contact to Apple today. The reason for the problem is new apple update (audio file resolution difference), but nothing can be done at the moment until Microsoft makes an update to OneNote in which this issue is resolved. So I'm waiting for
 an OneNote update for Apple iOS

 as record has different amount of address, some has a Billing Address, other one Billing Address and one or two address for their warehouses and some has one billing address and four different address each one for their warehouses. In this situation if I create
 a column for BillingAddress, City, State, ZipCode and Warehouse1Address, Warehouse1City, Warehouse1State, Warehouse1ZipCode; Warehouse2Address, Warehouse2City, Warehouse2State, Warehouse2ZipCode, etc. etc. I think I will be ending with many empty fields because,
 no all of the records or customer will have the same amount of address. In the other case if I make a customerAddress table related to customer in a one to many relationship then in the CustomerAddress of this related table I will be repeating the customer
 many times. Please I need help. Could somebody gives me some advice, I appreciate and I am Thanks ahead for any idea.</font></span>

            <p><span>For this you need three tables at least.<span>&nbsp; </span>In database terms the customer addresses are a many-to-many relationship type between the Customers and AddressTypes entity types, so in broad outline you'd have tables like this, where PK = primary
 key and FK = foreign key:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Customers</span></p>
<p><span>....CustomerID<span>&nbsp; </span>(PK)</span></p>
<p><span>....CustomerName</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AddressTypes</span></p>
<p><span>....AddressTypeID (PK)</span></p>
<p><span>....AddressType</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>and to model the relationship type between them:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>CustomerAddresses</span></p>
<p><span>....CustomerAddressID (PK)</span></p>
<p><span>....CustomerID<span>&nbsp; </span>(FK)</span></p>
<p><span>....AddressTypeID (FK)</span></p>
<p><span>....AddressLine1</span></p>
<p><span>....AddressLine2</span></p>
<p><span>....etc</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The primary keys can for convenience be autonumbers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a simple illustration of such a many-to-many relationship type and how to enter data via a form/subform see ParentActivities.zip in my public databases folder at:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this little demo parents are analogous to your customers and activities to your address types (billing, warehouse etc).<span>&nbsp;
</span>While the activities subform has only a combo box in which to select an activity, in your case you'd also have text boxes in which to enter the address lines etc.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Firstly, ignore the basConcat module; it is not relevant to your situation, and you don't need it unless you want to concatenate the address into a single string in a report as in my demo.<br />
<br />
My ParentActivities demo is just a simple illustration of a basic binary (2-way) many-to-many relationship type and how to represent it in a form, subform.&nbsp; A many-to-many relationship type is modelled by a table which resolves it into two one-to-many relationship
 types.&nbsp; So in my demo the model is:<br />
<br />
Prarents----&lt;ParentActivities&gt;----Activities<br />
<br />
In your case the CustomerAddresses table models a many-to-many relationship type between Customers and AddressTypes, so the model is:<br />
<br />
Customers----&lt;CustomerAddresses&gt;----AddressTypes<br />
<br />
The columns CustomerID and AddressTypeID in CustomerAddresses are each a foreign key, referencing the primary keys of Customers and AddressTypes respectively, i.e. the table has resolved the many-to-many relationship type between Customers and AddressTypes
 into two one-to-many relationship types.<br />
<br />
The Customers table would have columns for the basic customer data such as the customer name etc.&nbsp; The AddressTypes table would have, in addition to the AddressTypeID primary key column, a column of text data type for the address type, e.g. billing, warehouse
 etc.&nbsp; The CustomerAddresses table, in addition to the AddressTypeID and CustomerID foreign key columns would have columns for the various address lines.<br />
<br />
For data entry you would have a form in single form view based on Customers, and within this a subform based on CustomerAddresses, as in my demo.&nbsp; The form and subform would be linked on CustomerID.&nbsp; Whereas my demo has only the one combo box in the subform
 in which to enter data, yours would have text boxes for all the address lines, along with a combo box in which to select the address type.&nbsp; The subform can be in continuous forms view (as in my demo) or in single form view if preferred.&nbsp; The address type combo
 box would be set up as follows:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT AddressTypeID, AddressType FROM AddressType ORDER BY AddressType;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
To enter a new address type not currently listed via the combo box you can put code in its NotInList event procedure, as with the activities combo box in the subform in my demo.&nbsp; In your case the code would be:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String, strMessage As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "Add " &amp; NewData &amp; " to list?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO AddressTypes(AddressType) VALUES(""" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NewData &amp; """)"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMessage, vbYesNo + vbQuestion) = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrAdded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrContinue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ctrl.Undo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
You can now enter as many or as few addresses per customer in the subform as desired.&nbsp; Selecting the address type for each in the combo box.<br />
<br />
A few general points:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Do not include spaces or other special characters in table or column names.&nbsp; Either use CamelCase, e.g. AddressTypes or represent a space by an underscore character Address_Types.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Use plural or collective nouns as table names, e.g. Customers rather than Customer.&nbsp; This reflects the fact that a table is a set.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Use singular nouns as column names, e.g.&nbsp; AddressType.&nbsp; This reflects the fact that a column represents a single attribute type.<br />
<br />

<p><font>Dear Mr. Ken</font></p>
<p><font>I want to express my gratitude for your help. I do not know how it works, but I imagine that you offer help in this Access Microsoft Community thru Microsoft umbrella in some way. Please
 let me know how I can write at least a note to let them know how efficiently you are doing this. It is really a very good feeling ask for something and in a very short time have someone like you, (maybe in the other side of this world) with a friendly answer.
</font></p>
<p><font>I have carefully read your response and I have understood it correctly until you explain to me the tables structure; even so, if I change tables according to what you said, I will have
 columns for each client's address in particular but in that case I will need to repeat for each address column a city ID column and another column of State ID for each address. Of course, these columns (City and State) would be FK from parent’s tables City
 and parents table States respectively. Is it correct? If it is, I have the first part done, the part more easy.</font></p>
<p><font>Now, in the data entry area I am lost; however, I open the form Parent Activities in your demo, and I copy and paste them here to make sure we are talking about the same. That should be
 analogues to my Customer Form, as you said. </font></p>
<p><span><font>.*</font></span></p>
<span>And when I open Parent Activities Form in Design View, I don’t see similarity with my Customer Form which is base in my customer table. In my customer table there are not column
 for addresses.<font><span>&nbsp; </span>In your demo form Parent Activities (on the detail area) you have text boxes for first name, last name,
<span>addressLine1</span>, <span>
addressLine2</span> and <span>AddressLine3</span>, plus a combo box which bring the City (CityID) from the City Table and also a text box for Post Code. I am also confused because I see that you put in the
<span>address line2</span>: Walton, which is not an address but a Liverpool area. I don’t know if we are thinking on the same stage, because what I am looking for is to have a form that allow me to do data entry and see addresses of
 the same customer (customer that has billing address, and warehouses addresses) and because the customer table has a column CityID and another column StateID with lookup, with this relationship, bring the city and the state for each address. I don’t know if
 it makes sense to you or if it can be done this way. I understood your explanation about setting the address type combo box even if I am not really sure how to do or put the code in its NotInList event procedure but I will rather define to you in more detail
 what I will like to end with. Please be patient with me, I don't know if I'm making this too complicated. I am looking forward to hear from you…. Thanks……</font></span></font>

            <p>First, most of the people who answer questions in the Answers community are volunteers. You can "reward" helpful answers by voting them as helpful and/or marking them as an answer.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Second. The table structure that Ken is (correctly) advising is based on a one to many relationship. One customer can have many addresses. The problem occurs because an address can also belong to multiple customers. So you cannot directly identify the addresses
 a customer has in the customer table, nor can you directly identify the customer an address belongs to in the address table. You need to use what's called a join or junction table to model the relationship. So your customer form should have a subform bound
 to this junction table that can list all the addresses assigned to a customer. You would then use another form (either a subform or popup) to enter new addresses.</p>

<br />
1.&nbsp; No, you do not need to do that.&nbsp; There should be a bound control in the subform for the CityID, not for StateID as the CustomerAddresses table should not have a StateID column in it as this is determined by CityID.&nbsp; You should have tables like this:<br />
<br />
Cities<br />
....CityID (PK)<br />
....City<br />
....StateID (FK)<br />
<br />
States<br />
....StateID<br />
....State<br />

If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the dimensions to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the first dimension of the ColumnWidths property is zero hide the first column.&nbsp; Experiment with the other
 two dimensions to get the best fit.&nbsp; The ListWidth should be the sum of the ColumnWidths dimensions.<br />
<br />
In the subform the state will be shown in an unbound text box with a ControlSource property which references the third column of the combo box:<br />
<br />
=cboCity.Column(2)<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; You won't of course as my demo uses completely different types of data.&nbsp; All it is intended to do is show the structure of a binary many-to-many relationship type and how to represent it in a form/subform.&nbsp; In this it is a basic paradigm for any binary
 relationship type.<br />
<br />
The Column property is zero-based, so Column(2) is the third column, State.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; I know it well, I lived there from the age of 5 onwards.&nbsp; If you are including areas of a city like this in the address, strictly speaking you should have a column AreaID in the CustomerAddresses table and no CityID column.&nbsp; An Areas table would reference
 the Cities table via an Area ID foreign key.&nbsp; Unbound text boxes in the form would then show the city and state for the selected area.&nbsp; However, you might not want to go this far as, if this argument is taken further you would only store the SteeetID or similar,
 and this would determine all other elements of the address.&nbsp; In fact this is regularly done in large databases in the UK by storing the post-code only, as a UK post-code determines a very limited location; mine for instance determines one side of my street,
 so all that is needed in a table to define my address is my house number and post-code.&nbsp; Most databases of the type for which Access would be used would not do this, however, so you might want to have both Area (as a text column) and CityID (as a long integer
 number column) in CustomerAddresses.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; I should put that on the back burner until you have the basic model/interface set up correctly.<br />

</p><p>I would like to setup a DGs representing managers of a function for example Accounts Payable Manager (US) and another for Accounts Payable (ZA), and so forth. &nbsp;the reason is because of the inability for an organization of over 20 000 staff to communicate

    <title>How to INSERT a footnote separator in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tanyafraser  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to INSERT a footnote separator in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have found ample articles and explanations for the multitude of people who want to get rid of footnote separators in Word 2013. However, I have no line in my footnote separator, and I want it to be there. What do I have to do? I view in draft, select the
 references tab, show notes, select the footnote separator from the drop down list in the notes pane, and there it is--a line in a big, empty box. Ok, so it looks like I have the line, so I close the pane and go to print mode--now I am back to the original
 problem, with no line to separate my text and my footnote. What do I do? I would post screen shots, but I don't know how to get them into this window.</p>

            <p>Note that the footnotes pane has a Reset button which should revert to the default separator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it is worth, files saved in Word 2013 format do not support a separate footnote
<strong>continuation</strong> separator; instead, the separator for a continued note would be identical to the "ordinary" footnote separator. Only if you save to an older format would you be able to create a specific continuation separator.</p>

            Nokia N73 accepts Mini SD cards, that are bigger than micro SD ones, but smaller than SD ones. You need an Mini SD adaptor to your Micro, because it may not accept a Micro without any adaptor.

            robroy, whatever card you have and whatever phone you have, you ONLY enter the memory card to your phone. The adapter is used when you connect the card to a computer, card reader etc. NEVER insert the adapter to the phone's slot, it'll harm both the phone
 and the adapter. And N73 supports miniSD cards, not the microSD ones.

            Rules in Outlook are triggered two ways:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>As messages arrive.</li>
      <li>Manually, by you selecting messages and applying rules.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I suggest rather than trying to move messages to a folder that
      you simply create a rule for each folder and then disable each
      rule. Disabling prevents the rule from running when you receive
      messages but it still allows you to run the rule manually. When
      you've read a message you can manually run your rule and move the
      message according to whatever criteria you choose.<br />
    </p>
    <p>Hope this helps!<br />

                    <p>In OneNote 2013, I would like to be able to 'pan, scroll, zoom' using touch and leave the rest of the function to the pen. I was able to do this easily in OneNote 2010.</p>
<p>In OneNote2013, if I select the 'Automatically switch between inking, selecting, typing, panning.' option then&nbsp;the pen can't do selection, and&nbsp;if I don't select this option the touch begins to draw rather than stay just as a 'pan, scroll or zoom' tool. Does
 anyone have a fix for this? Or should I just revert back to OneNote 2010?</p>

            Check if there are any updates for Onenote as well as for your tablet. <br />
You need to check the option "Automatically switch between inking, selecting, typing, panning".
<br />
<br />
Make sure you use two fingers when you touch the screen after using pen. <br />
Also make sure you are not in draw mode.<br />

<li>win10</li><li>same network printer, model: HP LaserJet P1505n</li><li>word, pdf can print</li><li>excel, outlook can not print</li></ul>
<p>excel error says possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>there may not be enough memory available. Try closing files and programs you aren't using</li><li>if you use a network for printing, there may be a problem with the network connection or the printer driver</li><li>there may be loose cables or a bad connection between your computer and printer</li></ul>
<p>Outlook error says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printer not ready</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone meet the same situation as mine?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance? Thanks,</p>

            <p>As the problem is with Excel rather than Word, it would be best to ask in the Excel forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, usually the problem is the opposite to yours, in that it is in Word that there is the problem and in most cases the issue is that the printer driver needs to be updated for the printer to work correctly in Word.&nbsp; That is particularly the case with
 HP printers</p>

<h2>            When phishing scams are reported to Outlook what happens to them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I reported two phishing scams to Outlook by clicking on the drop down "report phishing scam" in the Outlook mail app. Where does the phish e-mail go and is it reported to the genuine company, in this case a bank? Also, why can't a suspicious e-mail be forwarded
 to a reporting agency without opening it and exposing my computer and possibly my contact list to the bad guys?</p>

            The only way to figure out the CPU speed is to measure it, using benchmark apps dont do this correct so there is nothing to worry about i think it runs at 430 ish and has the capability of hitting 600MHZ

<p>hey Jim, I did try opening about 6 applications including browser, images and videos, nimbuzz, contacts and a couple more and then tried to check the speed of the processor but it still says 192 MHz... please advice me wat can be done about this, I think
 this is the reason most of em complain about freezing up.</p>

            It would depend on what app you are using. Basically, most apps that are said to check for processor speed isnt giving correct values, as it only shows a predefined value. Trying the same apps on different Nokia phones gives only 192Mhz. You should use
 an app called benchmark ace instead of others.

<p>i did use benchmark ace and the first time i ran a test it showed 605 MHz and the second time it showed 617 MHz and the processed results haven't been updated yet online. I'll post it once i find out. There does seem to be a lil lag in the phone.</p>

            The phone's clock rate isnt locked. AFAIK the phone software allows for a little self overclocking when running intensely, hence the heat produced. However when all things are considered, it will not run as fast as other 600mhz phones because the processor
 is doing the double work of processing info and processing graphics due to the absence of a GPU.

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently been set up a gmail server account from which I access my work emails. &nbsp;Can I add this account to my entourage email client so that I can view my messages from there instead of having to view them on a browser?</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks in advance</div>

            In addition to the link Girish provided, see this link for additional info. It was written for Entourage but the setup is the same for Outlook. You no longer need to enable "Advanced IMAP Controls" in Labs. It has been made a default setting.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Connect Entourage 2004 to Gmail’s IMAP service<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/2007/11/connect_entourage_2004_to_gmails_imap_service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.officeformachelp.com/2007/11/connect_entourage_2004_to_gmails_imap_service/</a><br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Use root folder [Gmail]/</li><li>Do not select to sync All Mail folder</li></ul>
<br />
GMAIL'S RECOMMENDED IMAP CLIENT SETTINGS<br />
<br />
<br />
Do NOT save sent messages on the server. If your client is sending mail<br />
through Gmail's SMTP2 server, your sent messages will be automatically<br />
copied to the [Gmail]/Sent Mail folder.<br />
<br />
DO save draft messages on the server. If you want your drafts in your mail<br />
client to sync correctly with Gmail's web interface, set your client to save<br />
drafts to the [Gmail]/Drafts folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do NOT save deleted messages on the server. Messages that are deleted from<br />
an IMAP folder (except for those in [Gmail]/Spam or [Gmail]/Trash) only have<br />
that label removed and still exist in All Mail. Hence, your client doesn't<br />
need to store an extra copy of a deleted message.<br />
<br />
Do NOT save deleted messages to your [Gmail]/Trash folder because this will<br />
delete a message in all folders.<br />
<br />
Do NOT save deleted messages to your [Gmail]/All Mail folder as some clients<br />
will try to empty this folder and ultimately fail. This can lead to delayed<br />
mail access or excessive battery consumption on a mobile device.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do NOT enable your client's junk mail filters. Gmail's spam filters also<br />
work in your IMAP client, and we recommend turning off any additional<br />
anti-spam or junk mail filters within your client. Your client's filter will<br />
attempt to download and classify all of your existing messages, which may<br />
slow down your client until the process is complete.<br />

I have skype for windows 10 on my new laptop. Just recently I was trying to change the name for my profile along with with my picture. I was able to easily change the picture and my mood but I can't click on my profile name to try and change it, it just doesn't
 do anything and when I go to my profile online rather than the skype app I can change my name for the account but it doesn't actually change anything???</p>

<h2>            Samsung Omnia 7 Mango update - Reboot loop</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to do the forced Mango update on my Omnia 7. The installation of the Pre-Mango Update starts properly, but on Step 6 the phone stays in a reboot loop (only the Samsung Omnia 7 logo is shown again and again). So I cannot even finish the Pre-Mango
 update, since rebooting the phone doesn't complete.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently I have following versions on the phone:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- OS: 7.0.7392.0</div>
<div>- Firmware: 2424.11.2.3</div>
<div>- Bootloader: 5.2.1.4</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Furthermore:</div>
<div>- Hutchison 3 Austria (Branded)<br />
- Enough free space&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Latest zune version (Windows 7)</div>
<div>- Enough battery energy</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
I already HAD the Samsung update installed as described here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2547687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2547687</a>&nbsp;(Altough I never had update issues in the past - may that be the problem?).</div>
<div>I guess that I also will have the problem when I officially get the update notification.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whats the matter?</div>
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            <p>Hi acenetat,</p>
<p>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers forums for your inquiries.</p>
<p>With the official release and rollout of the full Mango (7720) update for Windows Phone, we do not recommend or suggest to anyone to attempt a forced update to Mango, regardless of whether it is the Pre-Mango version or the current version.&nbsp; These versions
 are not supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>If you have not been prompted to update to Mango&nbsp;yet, please be patient.&nbsp; The update is being rolled out in batches to ensure that it is installing and operating properly.&nbsp; Any bugs discovered during the update rollout are being addressed and as the updates
 continue rolling out, those bugs are addressed and fixed in those updates.&nbsp; You will receive a notification on your phone about updating your phone when it's available to you.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your patience.</p>
<p>-Annie T.</p>

            Hi Annie T.,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
Is Microsoft/Samsung able to comprehend this behavior and its cause? Is it really just the force trick, that breaks it? &nbsp;Or are you currently &nbsp;working on that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should it really work when I get the official update notification? I heard from other people with Omnia 7 that they have the same issue, altought they _already got_ the official update notification (no force update trick), which makes me wonder..<br />
<div><br />
<div>Already hoping for a soon and working update.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best Regards</div>

            Hi Troels,
<div><br />
Unfortunately I didn't get the official update notification yet. Still waiting. And I guess that it also wouldn't work if I get it now (as you have the same issue). So I think it won't work (official or forced - doesn't matter) till Microsoft/Samsung have fixed
 the problem. Really annoying, isn't it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>@Microsoft: Since several Omnia 7 owners are having these reboot loops with _official_ update (by notification) - are you actually taking care of this problem? What's the status here?
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Best regards<br />

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Today I got the official update notification on my phone. As expected, it still doesn't work!! Reboot loop on Step 6 of the first update (Pre-Mango)..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>@MSFT: What's the matter? Why are you rolling out these updates to Omnia 7 devices although some customers reported installation problems some weeks ago? When is a fix to be expected?</div>
<div><br />

<p>In regards to the the reboot issue on your Samsung Omnia 7 at step 6, you'll want to check out

            Hi Annie T.,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your post. As I mentioned earlier (please see my first post for details), I _already_ had the KB patch from Samsung installed. But it also doesn't help either! Furthermore I just tried on a different PC with a fresh Zune installation, but still
 no chance to get the update installed!</div>
<div><br />
Samsung technical support just told me to contact Microsoft for support. Great job, Samsung!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now waiting for a whole month, and still no mango in sight :-(</div>
<div><br />
<div>What's next??</div>

I call Samsung service center again and still told me can update through their service center, then I pass the phone to the Samsung service center staff, let them talk to each other, at the end the answer is not ready, ask me to uninstall and reinstall the
 Zune (I confirmed my Zune is latest version)<br />
I go back and uninstall and reinstall the Zune, rerun the Samsung patch as mentioned in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2547687, still having reboot problem.<br />
I call the service center again, told me can be done in service center again, then I told the whole story again, after their internal discussion and told me the mango / software not ready yet and I ask for a date, sorry can't confirm, can call in 2 weeks time.<br />
<br />
Today experience really make me angry, it seems Samsung staff donno what to do, I can't just keep waiting while MS announce mango 100% release but Samsung told not ready, which one is true??<br />
I'm just wonder can I get any Mango ready phone as replacement to my Omnia7 since seems like I won't get real solution.<br />
Any suggestion to update Omnia 7 to Mango? I'm really tired with this.<br />

    <title>WMDC constantly corrupting modified dates of every file in the sync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WMDC constantly corrupting modified dates of every file in the sync folder.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Win 7 Pro install along with the latest WMDC off the MS website.<br />
The Windows mobile device is an IPAQ212</p>
<p>The first sync went without any difficulty. But I noted that the second sync the next day sync'd every file in the&nbsp; sync folder. After several days of this behaviour I investigated more thoroughly and found that during the sync the modified date of every
 file (not folder) in the sync library on both PC and IPAQ&nbsp; is being updated to the time of the sync.<br />
It appears that the problem is only with files. Calendar entries and so on are syncing quite normally.</p>
<p>I have deleted the partnership, renamed the IPAQ, soft reset and reestablished a new partnership.&nbsp; But the problem remains.</p>
<p>Have trawled the forums but have not found this problem described before.<br />
Thank you to anyone who can provide some wisdom on this one please.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
Is the file synchronization completing?&nbsp; If it is not completing WMDC will leave partial files behind and they will have the current date and time.&nbsp; Then the next time you sync you will replace the files on the iPAQ with the ones from the PC.</p>

            Thanks Chris, I was having another problem well after the file sync process. Didn't even consider that it would have this impact.

<p>I jumped the gun too early.</p>
<p>I removed the offending sync option and all was well...... for one day. The problem is back again. And the sync is definitely finishing correctly, well it says "Last Sync sucessful".<br />
I have found that a second resync on the same day is OK. But one on the following day will have the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
