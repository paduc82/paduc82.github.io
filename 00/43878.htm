    <title>All Apps list is blank. Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobcat_ahs  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Apps list is blank. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I click on the Windows button on the screen (where the "Start" button was) I recently noticed that although the Recents on the top left are there and the tiles on the right are there as are the settings (lower left) are all there and seem to work fine
 Except "All Apps"</p>
<p>This has worked fine for the last year or so since I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the "All Apps (bottom left), the popup goes blank and then disappears. Normally I would expect to see all of my Apps starting with Adobe Apps and a scroll to see the rest. Now there's nothing there and the window will close after about 1.5
 seconds. If I want to open an app, I have to do a search on it (and remember the right name. This is a pain because sometimes I remember apps by their company name rather than the app name, and sometimes I want to scan through the apps to see which one I want
 to use without knowing the name. Since my work requires a large number of apps, this is a huge waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I get the list back?</strong> (...and if possible, what would make&nbsp;it go away?)</p>

            <p>Do the real Maths, Richard</p>
<p>500+megs a day....for 30 days. that's roughly 10+ gigs a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A bit over, perhaps, but, what is your Internet Usage plan, anyway?</p>
<p>12 GIG a month???</p>
<p>If it is roughly that, you're still 'under budget', crying about 'spilt milk'....when there is none!
</p>
<p>When you are left with something OVER, at the end of each month!</p>
<p>I use a 50 GIG a month plan, and, I don't whinge about the FIFTY DOLLARS I have to pay......for that privilege.
</p>
<p>And, I do it all...on a pension, too!</p>
<p>I need&nbsp;a few extra GIG (it's there , if I need it!)....................to help someone, with a REINSTALL, I&nbsp; can very safely do all the necessary&nbsp; downloading required!
</p>
<p>For their computer repairs! </p>
<p>Think of me, going out to fix a computer somewhere and ....I only have 500 Mbs..left in in my monthly plan?</p>
<p>That's gross stupidity.</p>
<p>And,&nbsp;I thoroughly ENJOY the full use of my computer....In my own time my way, to boot!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Now, where's your head at, Richard?</p>
<p>And, anyone lese who wants to whinge ......about&nbsp; the excessive use of the Internet plan they are running on?</p>
<p>You know what the AMOUNT you do use every month......so, tailor the plan ....to aptly suit your needs.</p>
<p>How much more simpler can one make it really appealing, to all?</p>
<p>You won't ever have the urge...to ever whinge about the Internet plan you're on, ever again.</p>

            Hi Qayum,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that when you try to open the pen drive you receive error message “There Was a Problem Starting -SWDL.USDrv. The specified module could not be found"</div>
<div><br />
Could you please answer the following questions so that I can help you in a better way.<br />
1. What is the make and model of the pen drive?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you try connecting the pendrive in different USB ports and check.</div>
<div><br />
I also want you to use a different pen drive and check if you get the same error.</div>
<div>Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue, which I have described as methods given below.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1-</strong><br />
I would suggest you to follow the link and instructions mentioned in the link.<br />
<strong>What to do when a device isn't installed properly</strong><br />

<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After performing clean boot refer to the article How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot to boot to normal mode.</div>
<div><strong>Method 3-<br />
</strong>I would have you run an online virus scan.<br />
Refer the link-<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />

<p>If you are seeing this, but able to access Live services, then we are currently looking into this. The packet loss is not affecting the ability to play your games, so keep an eye out for when it no longer says that.</p>
<p>If you are unable to sign in and you are getting 100% packet loss, please post up a new thread so that we may help you out individually. If you are getting this and I moved you in here, I apologize for the confusion. Once you post up a new thread, our community will be able to get you the support you're looking for.</p>
<p>We thank you all for your ongoing patience while we resolve this for you! Keep an eye on this thread for further updates. :D</p>

    <title>Win 7 Media Center lost connection to analog tuner &#47; tv signal, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernardoholland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Media Center lost connection to analog tuner &#47; tv signal, therefore no tv play</h2>
                    <p>Since two weeks, WMC lost functionality. There are no system restore point to go back to.</p>
<p>Problems finding tv tuner, tv setup works endlessly without result. "TV-signal couldn't be configured becaus no tv-tuner was found. Check if tuner was installed correctly if you have a tv-tuner." (translated from Dutch) &nbsp;Hauppauge PVR 150 MCE tv card shows
 up without problems in Device list.</p>
<p>Removed tv-card from pci slot and put it back. Installed latest drivers from Hauppauge.com. Removed hardware from device list, auto-detect worked but problem not solved.&nbsp;Removed MCE from Windows Software tab, rebooted and installed again. No result.</p>
<p>Concluded that TV-card must be broken. However: </p>
<p>I installed trial version of ChrisTV and what do you think: it found the tv-card, connected to it without any problems and gives me full use of tv-signal!!</p>
<p>So now my question is clear: when TV-card and drivers have turned out to function flawlessly, how can Windows Media Center be repaired?</p>
<p>ChrisTV costs &gt;50 bucks whereas MCE is free in win 7. So I am eager to find a solution free of costs....</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice!</p>

            <p>This problem has not been solved with help from the web.</p>
<p>However I found a solution that others might be interested in. Found an old backup and was able to check WMC functioning after each update or software install I did to bring PC up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things went wrong with Nokia Ovi update from this spring. Especially Nokia multimedia common components_2_5. Once this was removed, I could install any drivers, windows updates or software without any problems to my media center. Tuner is found, playback
 and recording works well.</p>
<p>Hope some of you get help by this. </p>

<h2>            No Search in Windows 10 File Explorer</h2>
                    I just upgraded Win 7 to Win 10. File Explorer is showing up but where the Search box normally is shows only an empty rectangle that will not accept focus by keyboard or mouse. Seems to work as expected from within a File-Open sequence in an App (tested
 from Excel) but not stand alone. Am I missing something here?

            <p>I think that this issue was patched up. When I first wrote about the issue, the space where the search term input happens was just a blank rectangle. Since then the search area is displaying normally, i.e. it says "Search" and actually lets you type stuff
 in there. I do like the detailed Search Tools in 10 better than the drop-down in previous (7 and earlier incarnations). It would be nice if the search tab was available even if focus is not in the search term entry dialog, that would allow a user to do searches
 that do not have a search term input without having to click the search box simply to bring up the search tool tab.</p>

            Here we are on 28th September 2016 and I have just completed the latest update and I am still experiencing the blank rectangle symptom and no search facility in explorer.<br />
Were there any other steps required other than adding the patches for the bugs in Windows 10?

    <title>Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 slow reaction and lagging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wernherstoltz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 slow reaction and lagging</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 from 8,1 Update, I am experiencing a very irritating issue with my Bluetooth mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware is an HP Envy Touch 15 as well as&nbsp;a Synaptics click pad. The click-pad functions faultlessly although I have to set up a profile every time I start the notebook from scratch du to its settings reverting to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bluetooth mouse however is just plain unusable. When I click on either the left or right cursor, it waits for me to move the cursor before it acts on the click. It also lags when I use the scroll wheel. When I for example scroll down and stop, then scroll
 up again, it will first scroll up and then scroll down and vice versa. Also if I click in a text box or document that I am editing it will stop me from typing until I move the cursor. This doesn't however happen all the time and seems to be worse in Edge browser
 and Metro Apps and set-up screen. Also if the spelling checker shows an option to replace a word, I can select but it will just sit on it until I move the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems from other posts that this issue in some form or other is quite a general bad experience and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency as it makes it impossible to do any serious work with the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a number of different options to resolve the issue. This included all the standard options of removing the drivers and let Windows re-install it, searching for other drivers, loading older drivers etc. Nothing changes the behaviour of the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, I have now disabled the click-pad to se if the laggy nature of the bluetooth mouse will improve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was also not working. I have just tested that as well and no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then tested the buil-in mouse set-up function where there is a typing delay built in for the click-pad (Not the Bluetooth mouse). That was on medium delay and I changed it to no delay (Always on). That also made no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue therefore seems to be driver related and it is a Microsoft Mouse and driver, so I will appreciate an urgent fix on this.</p>

            <p>This issue may have been caused due to power-saving feature of Windows 10 for bluetooth devices and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Device Manager</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Open properties of bluetooth devices power tab. There may be more than one device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncheck Turn this device off </p>

</p><p>You should be well now.</p>

            @suatcini, thanks for the suggestion. There were no power settings at the top level, but on one of the devices. MEDIATEK BLUETOOTH ENUMERATOR there was a power tab and it allowed power saving. I have now switched it off and will test and let you know if
 it worked. It is sometimes quite difficult to isolate something like this because it is not always clear how the devices interact with each other 😃.

            @suatcini, I have been called a genius at times and I didn't think I deserved it, but today, I will call you a genius 😝. I have tested and it works. I must say there is no real logic as it is not related to a time delay or anything, but just happens from
 the start. Anyway it works and it&nbsp;massively improves the experience.

            <p>I have been experiencing the same problem with my bluetooth mouse since upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I even bought a new bluetooth mouse thinking the old was was not functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried moving to a different area thinking perhaps there was some interference.</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled the mouse; drivers; and turned bluetooth on and off without success.</p>
<p>I was hopeful the solutions suggested here would help - they did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suatcini suggests:</p>
<p>
Open Device Manager<br />
Find Bluetooth devices
</p><p>Open properties of bluetooth devices power tab.&nbsp;</p>
There may be more than one device.<br />
Uncheck Turn this device off
<p>
</p><p>However, in Device Manager the only device that had a Power Management tab is Qualcomm Atheros AR3012 Bluetooth 4.0.</p>
<p>I unchecked "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".</p>
<p>I hoped I would have success as WernherStoltz did. &nbsp;However that did not fix my problem.</p>
<p>The bluetooth mouse is still lagging so horribly it is not usable.</p>

            <p>Fire up Services.msc and check if Bluetooth service is on Automatic. If not, put it on automatic. Windows normally comes with this service on manual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then unpair your bluetooth mouse, restart your computer and pair your mouse again and wait until pairing and device loading complete fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check batteries voltage, if you can or renew batteries in the mouse.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks again for the advice but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>There were two bluetooth services - Bluetooth Handsfree Service and Bluetooth Support service.</p>
<p>They were both set to manual so I changed them both to Automatic per your advice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that did resolve my bluetooth mouse problem.</p>
<p>FYI in the Startup Type column, both services now indicate Automatic (Trigger Start).</p>
<p>Not sure if that makes a difference.</p>

    <title>How to solve Bose Soundlink Mini II connection &#47; stuttering issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gpb-90  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to solve Bose Soundlink Mini II connection &#47; stuttering issue when Bluetooth paired with Windows 10 Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Having not found any online, Microsoft or Bose Support answer to the&nbsp;stuttering problem I encountered, after connecting&nbsp;my shiny new Surface Pro 4 and Bose Soundlink mini 2, I thought I'd post what I think to be the answer to the issue which makes the speaker
 produce&nbsp;inaudible sound, no matter what kind of content you attempt to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(presumably the same issue is experienced&nbsp;with the rest of windows 10 devices when connected to any iteration of the Bose Soundlink range that have the same extra Bose feature)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be with the with the Bose' extra feature of its 'Hands-free Telephony', which causes the issue. Once turned off, the speaker resumes to its normal function of producing exceptional sound no matter what content you're listening to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how I went about fixing this issue:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Ensure your speaker is connected and paired to your Surface by Bluetooth. You can check to make sure this is the case by going to Bluetooth settings.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eef5c350-7d6f-4faa-8dfe-27f1ca0a0fc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eef5c350-7d6f-4faa-8dfe-27f1ca0a0fc5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Devices and Printers<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbde1272-8013-496e-b7ac-177dddc7a7ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbde1272-8013-496e-b7ac-177dddc7a7ea" /></a></p>
<p><br />
3. <strong>Right click </strong>your Bose Soundlink Icon and click<strong> '</strong><strong>Properties'</strong>. Click the
<strong>'Ser</strong><strong>vices'</strong> tab and then de-select the <em>'Hands-free Telephony'
</em>option. Click apply and then Ok. <br />
Restart whichever software you were using to play audio content - this should now play without issue :)<br />
</p>

            <p>This also works for bluetooth stereo headsets which support hands free; but there is an easier way.</p>
<p>Right click the speaker icon on the right side of the task bar, select Playback devices.&nbsp; From this menu you can easily disable or enable hands free playback devices by right clicking.</p>

            The one that plugs into the laptop and is plugged into the power cord has an AC Adapter on it.&nbsp; This may be the bad part.<br />
1803 is not the build.&nbsp; See number 4.

<p>would have thought Mister Gwyther would know what this was. Clearing the cache is always a good idea of course, but this error can also occur if your account is not in good order. Go to the Microsoft Billing website and check your billing and address info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also as Mister Gwyther said, try another browser, if you have the same error, it's not your end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that seems to be ok, then you need to call support and check your account is in good order. If you have any old Debit cards on the system, support will remove them, then you should be able to redeem codes and purchase content again.&nbsp; Make sure you go
 through to the billing team when you call.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware it happens because there is an issue with the users billing.&nbsp; If they owe money on their account,&nbsp;the system&nbsp;doesn't allow a user&nbsp;to redeem a points card, until the user pays the&nbsp;outstanding debt.&nbsp; I think it can happen if they have an
 old invalid Credit/debit&nbsp;card too, not too sure.&nbsp; If they had a Live suspension then they wouldn't be able to log in in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had a few of these questions on the Xperts Chat. Also a google seach seems to show the error occuring when some users try to redeem a code or renew a membership.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the answers. Well, its not the browser or the cache because it still happens in different computers.</p>
<p>About the billing info, it seems everything is correct and i've already called support but they honestly dont have a clue of what im talking about.</p>
<p>But yes, the error did appear after i had to change my billing address to match the one i had for my credit card because otherwise it wouldnt let me buy anything in the marketplace (it kept sending me an error) i fixed that error by matching both addresses
 and after that i renewed my membership without any problem besides the fact that in the website the Account page stopped working. It definitely have something to do with the billing but again support is not helping me at all (i dont know if it has anything
 to do with the fact that i dont live in the US and maybe the support center is not that good in my country). I dont know what else to do -.-

<p>Im also having the same issue. I cannot purchase any points, or "repurchase xbox live gold". But here's the strange thing, I'm still listed as a gold member for some reason.... Puzzled the support i talked to as well. I have no idea what to do. I've been

<p>This looks like it will need to be escalated to the customer advocacy team. call customer support. Explain that you have called before and that you also messaged about this issue on the forums and that it was recommened that you called support again so that
 the case could be escalated to the xbox customer advocacy team. they will take some of your details and send it on to a higher support tier for resolution.</p>

You have to use the Outlook Connector in order to use these type of free mail accounts

<h2>            Samsung laptop bluetooth not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Samsung laptop NP3530EC-A0LDX.&nbsp; After a minor glitch with Bluetooth - solved over the air by support - I got a bit of malware, and had to refresh the machine.&nbsp; Lots of update and reinstalling!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since, Bluetooth will not install - Qualcomm Atheros - despite many attempts.&nbsp; The machine keeps on telling me that it ought to be updated!&nbsp; The Bluetooth switch options have disappeared from the settings screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice from anyone, before I take it back to the store?</p>
