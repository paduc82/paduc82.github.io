<h2>            Redesigning the Start Menu version&#58;2</h2>
                    <p>This is the updated "version 2" of "Redesigning the Start Menu" after the feedbacks and reconsiderations to my previous posts:</p>

 10: new design for desktop &amp; Start</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>-more customisation and legacy options, users can customise with the legacy (windows 7) start menu functionalities and modern look options.</p>
<p>-desktop &amp; tablet modes for consistency and easy navigation. These modes should not feel as two different operating system.</p>
<p>-all Store Apps (metro) and classic desktop applications are both available in desktop &amp; tablet modes in a more unified user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please add your comments for what other customisation options you would like to see and how the user experience can be improved in windows 10.</p>

            <p>Start8 does all this too, at least on the my fleet of PC's, including W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your efforts are appreciated.&nbsp; As of right now, W10 really offers very little to me.&nbsp; I am now 1 click away from everything I need.&nbsp; W10 does offer goodies under the hood but nothing at the start.&nbsp; W10 just seems more complicated and a different way of doing
 the same thing.&nbsp; I am also 1 click away from the new interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of right now, I plan to move my fleet to W10 upon release, since it is free.&nbsp; If I was paying, not so much.&nbsp; Let the games begin.</p>

            <p>Nice that you've thought so much about this, but why bother to put all that effort into something that just displays flat rectangles of pixels without any style?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiles are of little use to anyone no matter how you arrange them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned there are already 3rd party start menu replacements that get it right.&nbsp; Microsoft is never going to be able to equal the likes of Classic Shell, for example, for those who use the desktop.</p>

            <p>This is all well and good, but for those of us whose first action was to unpin everything on the right side of the start menu, none of them work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF the size gadgets shown in a couple of your examples are indeed stretch and shrink buttons &nbsp;and will have sticktion when user-set, all well and good, but you have not indicated that is the case.</p>
<p>In fact, fig 02 would be ideal if only we could remove the "active user" part altogther.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the tech preview installed on a fairly typical 15.6 inch laptop and when I hit the start button OVER 50% of my desktop is obliterated by the start window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with all of the cute squares unpinned all I get is a nice neat narrow strip on the left with the bits I actually need to see and a large blank area for the rest of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE consider the ramifications of keeping that window the same size all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely if it is beyond MS to make the window scalable to fit what IS displayed, we could at least have a gadget on the side so we can manually reduce the amount of width it takes up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only alternative at present is to pin everything I actually need to access on a regular basis to the task bar and hope I don't need any other programmes to open while I am working on the desktop.</p>

            Personally, I like this, but then again, I like v1 as well.&nbsp; I'm not hard to please and I actually see nothing wrong with v1.&nbsp; I have been able to use every bit of it without any troubles.&nbsp; There is nothing I can not get to and if I want fast access to
 something, well I can either make a group for them or add them to fast access...&nbsp;&nbsp; But, hey that is just my 2 cents and I can not speak for everyone and never will imply that I am....

            <p>Good job Microsoft.&nbsp; You are really trying to respond to the customers suggestions.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can't please everyone, so third party add-ins will always have a&nbsp; place.&nbsp; &nbsp;Noel likes his...I use Start 8....etc.&nbsp; The key is to provide a user interface that users can customize the way they want it...either using the capabilities provided by MS
 or from&nbsp;others.</p>

            <p>This still feels like the Win 8.1 interface, the only real change is I access Metro/Desktop by clicking the Win icon and not the Tile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think that you need to focus on the customer experience, and this one is not great either in terms of layout or how it looks (sorry guys a screen or window full of dull coloured squares or rectangles just doesn't have enough eye-candy).&nbsp; So,
 what would work for me would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;A desktop that&nbsp;would allow live wallpapers;</p>
<p>2) Removal of the static tiles and replacement with Icons/shortcuts&nbsp;whose backgrounds I&nbsp;could set to transparent and which I could pin to either the taskbar or desktop (oh, and no shortcut arrows on the icons);
</p>
<p>3) Live tiles that I can pin onto the desktop;</p>
<p>4) Apps that run in windows that I can scale to my liking and place anywhere on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would allow me to configure the desktop however I like, with commonly used Progs/Apps, and the start menu would only be used to gain access to recent docs/files and&nbsp;those Progs/Apps that I need to access occasionally.</p>

            Hopefully no matter what we end up with will be able to get rid of the tiles completely! They work great for people with touchscreens but the majority of us don't have nor want one of those. It's much easier to work through closer spaced menu items into
 chase through all of your on-screen real estate to click the item you want! I'm assuming you are thinking of the lifestyle panels to operate something like Gadgets like we had previously. If so I like that idea as long as we can turn them off or minimize how
 many we have.<br />

            <p>It may be that Live Tiles are of no use to you. But, they are&nbsp;of great&nbsp;use to others, including myself. I think the above concept gets&nbsp;a lot of things right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What people must understand is that the way we use a computer and the interface that goes along with that
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">will</span></em> change. The UI that's been around for&nbsp;over 20 years now will eventually be supplanted by something else. Unless, of course, people believe that this&nbsp;form of computing will be around in ten years.

<h2>            Pivot table does not recognize date field in a table as dates</h2>
                    I have a pivot table based on a table and I want to group the dates by month in the pivot table.&nbsp; However the pivot table does not seem to be recognizing the date field as dates no matter how I format the data.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all the entries in the data column of your source data and are non date entries.&nbsp; Try this to solve the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Select range A1:E520 and sort the Data column in ascending order.&nbsp; In the message box that appears, if any, select the second radio button which says sort the numbers and number and text as text seperately</p>
<p>2. With the range selected, filter the Data column on Filter icon &gt; Text filters &gt; Custom Filter.&nbsp; In the left hand side box, select Equals and in the right hand side box, select *</p>
<p>3. Now select a5;A520 and go to Data &gt; Text to columns &gt; Delimited &gt; next &gt; Ensure all boxes are unchecked&nbsp;&gt; Next &gt; MDY &gt; Finish</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process above will convert all text entries in the date column to actual date entries.&nbsp; you may cross check this by clicking on the Filter drop down of the date column - all dates will be neatly organised into Years and months</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now refesh the pivot table (Alt+F5).&nbsp; Right click on the first date under the data column of the pivot table and select Group &gt; Months</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Data Validation-drop down list in Excell</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have received an excel sheet having several formulas. One of them is a drop down list in one of the columns but interestingly I can not locate the reference list in the Data Validation tab. On the Data Validation tab, the following formula is given but
 the date range it refers to (ie. K3 to K20) is not found in the sheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>='Drop Down'!$K$3:$K$20<br />
</p>
<p>Could some one help me to understand how this is working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word&#58; Table of Contents keeps bolding itself when I update it. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word&#58; Table of Contents keeps bolding itself when I update it.</h2>
                    <p>I basically want to stop my ToC from copying the formatting of the font it is linked to. For my ToC level 1, I have set it up to bold itself within the "custom table of contents" options. ToC level 2 was set to not be bolded, but it copies the formatting
 of the text I link it to. If each level of a ToC copies its source, why isn't my ToC level 1 bold? See the following photos:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my table of contents:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ac3c0d5-ab53-4726-bebe-d2676dd37645?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ac3c0d5-ab53-4726-bebe-d2676dd37645?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the text that "about the game" is linked to. Keep in mind that it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
NOT</span> bold in the document.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd9c360e-d9f1-4458-82d7-b5ceb270a52d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd9c360e-d9f1-4458-82d7-b5ceb270a52d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's my problem. "Player Etiquette" is bold in the text, but I don't want it to be bold in the ToC.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d199c93-2f09-4804-945a-9b5ff3e3d9be?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d199c93-2f09-4804-945a-9b5ff3e3d9be?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I want my ToC to look like, but what happens when I update it. I don't want to have to unbold everything that I want unbolded whenever I make a change.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1897ad88-30f4-416e-bca3-11f9fda34ba6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1897ad88-30f4-416e-bca3-11f9fda34ba6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what the "modify" section looks like for my ToC levels 1 &amp; 2:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d11a955-9313-4c34-b4ad-dc897a0a9646?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d11a955-9313-4c34-b4ad-dc897a0a9646?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>This can be very confusing because if the Bold in your headings reflected in the TOC is based on the style for your headings, then it will not show up in your TOC unless the TOC style is bold. Take another look at the two links I provided.

            As Charles wrote, most likely what you are seeing has been caused by the presence of direct bold formatting in the headings in your document. Font formatting applied as direct formatting to heading text will be repeated in the table of contents.<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 not syncing Shared Mailbox</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">Hi guys!</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">We have migrated from Exchange 2010 to 2013 and have noticed, that Outlook 2016 clients have issues with the synchronication of shared
 mailboxes. Those issues won't appear with the very same user and shared mailbox if Outlook 2013 is used.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">When the checkbox "Download Shared Folders" in the Exchange-Cache-Mode settings is unchecked, the mails in the shared mailbox are displayed
 and synced. Anyway if it is checked, you just see the folders on root level of the shared mailbox (Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items, also you can see manually created Folders) if you create a subfolder with Outlook 2016 in one of those folders you can see, it'll
 be created but you can't see it in Outlook 2016 right away but in 2013 you do. If you manually refresh the shared mailbox via send/receive, the mails are loaded.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">Have anyone had similar issues with Outlook 2016 and Exchange 2013 so far?</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">The shared Mailbox has the following sizes:</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">TotalDeletedItemSize : 183.4 MB (192,265,665 bytes)</span><br />

<p>
</p><p>Were you ever able to determine the issue/resoluton? &nbsp;I am having a similar issue after upgrading exchange from 2010 to 2013. &nbsp;Additional mailboxes assigned to users are not syncing and are requiring them to send/receive folder to get current on email. &nbsp;These
 are all cached email users so hoping we don't need to create new .ost files for everyone.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using Outlook application or Outlook through a web browser?</li><li>Can you successfully log in to your Outlook account? </li><li>Are you able to receive other emails?</li><li>How many message are you trying to send?

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if you are using Outlook on a web browser, kindly try to use other available browsers in in-private mode. On the other hand, if you are using Outlook application, kindly try to access Outlook in safe mode. You may check out this

    <title>Visio display on taskbar and Format Painter issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wwoods  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio display on taskbar and Format Painter issues</h2>
                    Visio 2010 Professional 32 bit<br />
Windows 7 Professional<br />
<br />
I have two questions:<br />
<br />
1) When I pass the cursor over the Visio icon my Windows 7 taskbar, instead of revealing just the drawings, it lists out all the stencils that are open.&nbsp; If I have multiple drawings open using the same stencil, it is listed multiple times.&nbsp; The drawing name
 is listed there but in a list of 20 or 30 stencils its nearly impossible to find.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need to see the stencils list at all. &nbsp; I can;t find any settings that speak to this.
<br />
Has anyone encountered this?<br />
<br />
2) Having used Visio since even before it became a Microsoft Office product and one of the most useful tools is the Format Painter.&nbsp; But ever since I installed Visio 2010, the Format Painter has never worked.&nbsp; As soon as I click on a shape, I get an error:&nbsp;
 "An error (1) occurred during the action Format Painter.&nbsp; Unexpected end of file."&nbsp;
<br />
Has anyone else had this trouble?

            These are just recently opened items. The stencils probably shouldn't be there anyway, even if they are opened from the taskbar they don't open attached to a document!<br />
Anyway, the lists can be cleared by right-click on the toolbar -&gt; Properties<br />
then select Start menu (not Toolbar as one would expect!) and untick<br />
Store and display recently opened items and the task bar<br />
<br />
The list of drawings is just a most recently opened list, some of them may not even exist any more (that's 90% of the time for me!), a list of currently opne documents would be slightly more useful.<br />

<p>You'll need to provide more information about your situation:</p>
<p>What phone (make/model) of phone did you have and what version of windows mobile was running on it?</p>
<p>What OS was running on the computer that crashed?&nbsp; Had you synced the phone to Outlook on your computerj?</p>
<p>There is no such thing as microsoft mobile.&nbsp; Did you ever use a service called "My Phone" to backup the data on your phone to a website?</p>

            Ciao Mehmet, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, unfortunately Microsoft Stream does not actually support external anonymous sharing.

            You may well have a problem here if you have used autonumbers as keys.&nbsp; You can append rows from a referenced table (i.e. the table on the 'one-side' of a one-to-many relationship) to the corresponding referenced table in the other database provided that
 you omit the autonumber key column, in which case new values will automatically assigned to the autonumber key column in the rows inserted.&nbsp; However, if you then append rows from a referencing ('many-side') table these will retain the values of the foreign
 key column which reference the autonumber key of the first table.&nbsp; As the rows inserted into the referenced table in the other database will now have new values in these rows, the foreign key values in the referencing table will no longer map to the correct
 row of the referenced table.<br />
<br />
There are a number of ways you can handle this.&nbsp; Probably the simplest is to create new primary and foreign key columns in the tables in the first database, and fill these with values which will not match be duplicated in the second database.&nbsp; You can do this
 by means of update queries to add a fixed number to the&nbsp; values of the current primary and foreign key columns.&nbsp; The fixed number should be such that the lowest resulting number will be greater than the highest value in the autoumber key column in the second
<br />
UPDATE MyTable<br />
SET NewColumn = OldColumn+12345;<br />
<br />
You can then append rows from a table in the first database to the corresponding table in the second database, but you must append the NewColumn&nbsp; to the OldColumn.&nbsp; Its sometimes not realised that you can assign a literal value to an autonumber column in this
 way when inserting a new row, but it is in fact perfectly feasible.&nbsp; When inserting a value into the corresponding foreign key column in a referencing table there is no problem of course.<br />
<br />
You need to bear in mind a couple of things:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; You cannot make a column the primary key of a table until it contains values, so you must fill the NewColumn column in a referenced table with an&nbsp; update query as above before you can make the column the primary key.&nbsp; In fact there is no real necessity
 to make the column the primary key at all as it's only being used to provide values which can be appended to the other table, so whether it's defined as a key or not is immaterial.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; When appending the data you must append rows from and to a referenced table before you can append rows from and to a referencing table.&nbsp; Otherwise referential integrity would be violated.<br />
<br />
Another way of doing this is to allow new values to be assigned to a referenced table's primary key when appending the new rows.&nbsp; The assign the relevant value to the corresponding foreign key column in a referencing table by joining multiple tables, using
 another column, or more usually combination of columns as a a 'candidate key'.&nbsp; The following is an example, which inserts rows into a Cities table and assigns values to its foreign key RegionID column by joining the MasterTable (in this case a table derived
 from an Excel worksheet from which the data is being imported) to the Countries and Regions tables on the Region, Country, RegionID and CountryID columns:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Cities (City, RegionID)<br />
SELECT DISTINCT MasterTable.City, Regions.RegionID<br />
FROM Countries INNER JOIN (MasterTable INNER JOIN Regions <br />
ON MasterTable.Region=Regions.Region) <br />
ON (MasterTable.Country=Countries.Country) <br />
AND (Countries.CountryID=Regions.CountryID);<br />
<br />
This is not too difficult once you get your teeth around the logic, but needs a little more thought than the cruder, but nevertheless effective, approach outlined above.

            Append queries is the only viable way to do this. Link the tables from db2 to db1, then in db1 write the queries. Look at the relatioships between the tables to determine which tables to do first, which next. Parent tables first, Child tables next.

<p>We have deployed office 2010, and preconfigured outlook using the customization tool. This has created a file custom14.prf in the program files\microsoft office folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we are migrated to another exchange (2003) server. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have rerun the customization tool. For new deployments this is working, but all the existing computers still have the old custom.prf file.</p>
<p>As we are changing a lot of users each month, I need to update the old custom.prf files on the existing workstations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to delete and copy the file, but are getting the error "access is denied". Even when I run the command as the domain administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I easily replace the old custom14.prf with the new one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Panjo</p>

            <p>Ran into the same problem - turned out the custom.prf file flag was set to read only.
</p>
<p>delete the old file first - use the /f flag to force the delete</p>
<p>if /i exist "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\custom14.prf" del "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\custom14.prf" /f</p>

<h2>            Xbox Video lag issues</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded, The Interview through Xbox Video and this is the first movie I have downloaded through the Xbox Marketplace. When I try to watch it, it keeps lagging and eventually stops playing. I can watch other movies and TV shows from other websites
 just fine. Is there anything that I can do to fix this issue? Thank you</p>

            <p>Hello TOMSCHSchafenacker:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; I can understand your issues with the Xbox One not supporting video download.&nbsp; To this point I have not found any details related to when or if this will change.&nbsp; I also was not able to find any clear reason on why the console
 does not currently support the feature.&nbsp; What I do know about the console is that features are being added all the time and we are working to improve the overall customer experience.&nbsp; One case in point is the recently added media player that allows you to
 play local music and video content via an external device.&nbsp; I am hoping that support of downloaded vides is something that is added in the near future.&nbsp; To help expedite the process I would suggest you make your voice heard here,
<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.uservoice.com</a> .&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might consider trying is using the play to feature to stream content from your computer to your Xbox One,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/playto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/playto</a>.&nbsp; This will require you have a Windows 8 or 8.1 computer and download the movie via the Xbox Video application.&nbsp;
 This may be able to help you avoid some of the connection issues you have run into related to streaming from the cloud.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to switching the video from HD to SD, this is a feature that is not available with rentals.&nbsp; If you purchase a video you should have the option to switch between HD and SD from the start menu of that particular movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2010 Shared Notebook opens as read only to other users</h2>
                    I have created a network shared OneNote notebook in the 2010 format.&nbsp; During the setup of this notebook I sent emails to the colleagues I wanted to share it with.&nbsp; They have been able to access the notebook but it opens as a "Read Only" for them.&nbsp; How
 do I make it so they can also edit and contribute to this notebook?<br />

<h2>            OneNote - opening a link in a new window</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When clicking on a link to another OneNote page I get redirected to this page. I would like instead a new window to this oneNote page to open.</p>
<p>If there is no native solution, can this be accomplished by using some macro or VB?<br />
