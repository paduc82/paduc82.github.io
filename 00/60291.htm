            Hi Karen
<br />
<br />There are many different models of the HP pavilion, what is the exact Model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom underneath casing . . .
<br />
<br />On most HP Pavilions, double tapping the upper left corner of the touchpad disables the touchpad

<p>Unfortunately, the model no. underneath is too small to read. I checked on my HP app and found the model number listed as 15 cs0xxx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the double tap you suggested and will let you know if it doesn't work.</p>

    <title>Disc vs. Digital - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mooby geenk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc vs. Digital</h2>
                    
<p>Before Microsoft reversed its policies on DRM and online checks there really wasn't much of a difference with disc based games and the digital games besides being able to trade the disc once. &nbsp;Since the reversal of their policies I feel like there is a big
 difference in the pros and cons of going completely with digital games or disc based games. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I'm torn on what I want to do if I just want to go digital so I can have a floating library of games without needing a disc or getting a disc so I can lend it to my brother without having to give him my Xbox Live account. &nbsp;So I wanted to see what
 everyone's thoughts are on the pros and cons of both sides of gaming. &nbsp;Are you leaning more to disc based games or digital games?</p>

<p>I'm torn as well as I like trading in games to purchase a NEW game. However, with the X1, I really want to go all digital to be able to swap between games on the fly whenever I want, but at the same time, if I ever do want to trade a game in down the road,
 I won't be able to. I think the majority of my games will be digital with a few being disc based that I can see trading in, especially games like Madden and FIFA.</p>

<p>For me it would depend on the price. A disc has greater value than a digital copy because you actually have physical control over it. If the disc drive can read it, you can play it, any time any place. You can also lend or sell it just like any other property.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Digital has convenience in that you don't have to carry discs, or even go to the store. You can download it straight to your home immediately when it gets released. However, you have no actual control over the digital copy, and it convenience is somewhat
 diminished if it takes you a while to download things. Because it doesn't have the same amount of value that a physical copy does, it would need to be cheaper before I would buy it. I highly doubt they are going to reduce digital prices below retail, though.

<p>I would love to see the price of digital games be cheaper than the disc based games, but I don't think MS can undercut like that on release. Maybe later down the road they will start doing something like that, but can't see it happening at release. Although,
 with the amount of complaining people had about not being able to "own" their games, MS might be able to get away with it seeing as though a lot of people would be willing to pay more to "own" their game.</p>

<p>I agree I don't think the price of either of them are going to be any different at least not for a while. &nbsp;I can see the value in actually having property, or disc, but I think the physical property is more likely to get ruined before the digital especially
 with all the saving to the cloud stuff. &nbsp;I'm kind of paranoid about keeping my discs in good shape so I doubt anything would happen to mine but its still a factor to consider</p>

<h2>            Print chat history from new Skype on PC</h2>
                    Hi, I've got the newest version of Skype installed on my laptop, running on Win7. When I click on a contact, it loads the conversation, but there's no function to extract the chat. Cant "select all" and copy, as it worked in the old version. I would need
 my chat history printed. How can I extract that from this new Skype including the date with the actual conversation together?

            I would guess you have a Laptop or desktop with integrated graphics from Intel?<br />
Have you installed any drivers using MSUpdate? - a v.bad idea<br />
<br />
If you own a large oem brand PC eg Dell / HP or laptop visit that makers site for updates specific to your model

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 options that control this behavior. If you always want to return to the Start Screen, both of these options must be disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Right Click the Taskbar on the Desktop and select Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> In the Taskbar Tab, remove the check mark from the <strong>
Taskbar" </span></strong>option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Click the Navigation Tab and remove the check mark from the<strong>"When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the Desktop instead of Start"</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Apply/OK</strong>.</p>

<p>Do you mean the calendar program&nbsp;itself or do you mean the contents of the calendar you were using? How did you delete it (and from what location)?&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began (if it was the program and not the data)?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem
 began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span>If it is the data, proceed as follows:</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow
 Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with

<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />

<p><span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp;
 If you decide to try these recovery programs, you should stop using your hard drive<strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently
 lost some of them if you're using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter
 of luck).<br />
<br />
Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></p>

            <p>Thanks very much LaurenzB. I tried refreshing and relogged in. The problem is solved, though I had to reinstall many applications which were removed in the process. Thanks very much for your immediate response.</p>

    <title>Want to place Desktop shortcut for frequently used Web sites using Win - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leestiehl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to place Desktop shortcut for frequently  used Web sites using Win 10 and Edget&#63;</h2>
                    I've upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows&nbsp;8.1 on my HP bit laptop. In Windows&nbsp;8 &nbsp;I was able to pin regularly used websites to my desktop to create a shortcut. I simply right clicked--the menu said create shortcut. I don't seem to be able to do that now.
 I want to use Edge as my main browser whereas previously I used Internet Explorer. Could that have anything to do with it? If not, is there a way in which I can create these shortcuts which I found very convenient with Explorer now using Edge?

            <p>If you want the shortcut to have the website-specific icon, you'll need to create it by clicking the
<strong>. . .</strong> icon in Edge &amp; selecting <strong>Open in Internet Explorer</strong> and then use one of the familiar methods there to create your shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though created via IE, it will still open in Edge if that is set as your default browser.</p>

<p>Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please tell your boss and your boss's boss that the target customer base for the 2017 Surface Pro and Pen have been pleading with Microsoft, for about a year now, to give us some idea of when and how this problem will be resolved. We've suggested
 many workarounds in the thread noted above, some that we can do (use a two-finger artist glove and the 2H tip) and some that Microsoft could have done months ago (provide a setting that allows the user to enable OR DISABLE pen tilt detection and associated
 features), but essentially nothing has happened. Go be a champion within Microsoft to get this flaw (in an otherwise great product) solved. Please.</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem with a new Surface Pro and new pen. It makes the pen completely unusable for note taking - and I would assume for drawing thought I'm not an artist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is mind-boggling that Microsoft has been knowingly shipping a defective and unusable product for over a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately there's a really simple solution - use an iPad. The basic iPad supports a pen, comes in at&nbsp; a fraction of the price, and (unlike Microsoft's "premium" product) actually works for the purpose it's intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this really the best Microsoft can do?</p>

<br />Try the following process to correct problems with Windows system files
<br />
<br />SIMPLE WINDOWS SYSTEM FILES REPAIR – CHKDSK / DISM / SFC
<br />
<br />******CHKDSK – Check Disk state **********
<br /><a href="https://windowsinstructed.com/run-chkdsk-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsinstructed.com/run-chkdsk-windows/</a> 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/command-line-check-disk-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/command-line-chec...</a> (and 8 and 10) – There are a number of “paramters” you can pass to ChkDsk to ontrol wht it does.- 
<br />
<br />There could be a small problem with your Window installation. The Check disk command cleans up small sections of the disk that may have been “orphaned” / corrupted when Windows is not shut down normally. The SFC command will check and repair Windows system files, then the DISM commands will repair any other minor problems with Windows. 
<br />
<br />In start menu type “PowerShell”
<br />Right Click on the result and select “Run as Administrator”
<br />
<br />run next command to schedule a check and fix the disk the next time the computer is restarted. At the end of the run it will display a status report.
<br />
<br />    Chkdsk c: /F
<br />
<br />
<br />You will have to restart the computer for that check to work. 
<br />
<br />********DISM - DISM - Deployment Image Servicing and Management   ************
<br />
<br />After ChkDsk is done go back to the admin prompt and run following commands, one at a time to Repair The Installed Windows Image
<br />
<br />this command checks whether the image has been flagged as corrupted by a failed process and whether the corruption can be repaired:
<br />
<br />    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth 
<br />
<br />
<br />this command scans the installed windows for component store corruption:
<br />
<br />     DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth 
<br />
<br />
<br />this command performs Window repair operations automatically:
<br />
<br />      DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.

    <title>Question Regarding the legitimacy of svchost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ba boracus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question Regarding the legitimacy of svchost</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I read in this&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-performance/svchost-svchostexe-k-netsvcs-uses-90-cpu-usage/41ba79ae-5e92-44d2-91ba-0de886061b4f">forum post</a>&nbsp;that any file named svchost that was found outside of
 c\Windows\system32 is malware and should be removed. But seeing as how that post was written 4 years ago and relates to windows xp, i figured i would ask here and see if anyone knew if they were legitimate before i deleted &nbsp;necessary files. i found the files
 at these locations</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft-windows-s..s-svchost.resources_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7600.16385_en-us_511f46fd08cd38e1</p>

<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\winsxs\amd64_microsoft-windows-services-svchost_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7600.16385_none_11b04b481efec48c</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are these legitimate locations for any file named svchost to exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also when I use the resource monitor I have 13 different programs with the name svchost.exe taking up varying amounts of memory. All but one have a short description in parenthesis after their name. &nbsp;I will list them here and ask that someone can verify
 these are legitimate non-malicious programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>svchost.exe (SDRSVC)</p>
<p>svchost.exe (RPCSS)</p>
<p>svchost.exe (NetworkServiceNetworkRestricted)</p>
<p>svchost.exe (NetworkService)</p>
<p>svchost.exe (netsvcs)</p>

<p>svchost.exe (imgsvc)</p>
<p>svchost.exe (DcomLaunch)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I Have Already run 3 scans of Super anti spyware, Microsoft Security essentials, and tdsskiller</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am running windows 7 Home Premium on an Asus X53E laptop. I Only use Google Chrome for browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am asking about the legitimacy of these programs because i have several different programs with the name svchost.exe taking up varying amounts of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm not a full explanation as to what these programs do, because thats quite a lot of information to give, but a point in the direction of where I could get that information would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>The reason to be suspicious is if you have an instance of svchost.exe running&nbsp;that has not been loaded from C:\Windows\System32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The majority of examples you give are folders in <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askcore/archive/2008/09/17/what-is-the-winsxs-directory-in-windows-2008-and-windows-vista-and-why-is-it-so-large.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
C:\Windows\winsxs </a>which have svchost in their name. C:\Windows\winsxs is used for servicing Windows. There are copies or hard links for all the Operating System files in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would guess the en-US folder contains svchost.exe.mui. That is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingual_User_Interface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Multilingual User Interface </a>file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>svchost = Service Host. </p>
<p>Rather than having each Windows service running as a separate process, they&nbsp;are grouped into somewhat related categories and&nbsp; each group is run in a single process.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 will NOT update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richarddlugosz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 will NOT update.</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP laptop with Win 8.1 PRO. Been working just fine. Used Windows Update 8 Nov to install two updates. On restart, it did not. Would only say "diagnosing problems" then presents a message "cannot repair problem".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried repair disk. Nothing works. Tried to reset using repair disk. Error: drive locked, try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried everything I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, used image disks to restore computer to original condition, Win 7 Home Premium. Took 4 hours. Worked fine. Upgraded to Win 8 Pro. Again, all worked fine. Ran Checkdisk and also System Mechanic deep scan on hard drive. NO problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not upgrade to Win 8.1 PRO until I installed all the Win 8 updates. Over 130, took several hours. Installed all updates until none left and again, all worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Store for the update to Win 8.1 PRO. Downloaded and continued to install. Asked for my MS account number, etc, verified Internet connection and set up personal settings. All that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it got to the final settings the word "HI" comes up (this is the tutorial part) and it crashes. NOTHING will allow me to fix it. Not the repair disk, no way to reset anything. Again, drive locked. Tried all the advanced options. The only consistent
 message is Windows did not install correctly, try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this 6 times. I had MS contact me each time. They have been NO HELP. They tell me it is my computer, take it to the shop or replace the hard drive. Twice they said hold and they would get an expert to help. Each time the line went dead. Call
 back, another person and explain it all over again. Finally I got fed up and told them where to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly do not know if there is some hardware problem or not. Logically, if I cannot find any hard drive error, can reinstall Win 7 to factory condition, upgrade to Win 8 Pro, and EVERYTHING works just fine, I cannot see how the drive is the problem.
 Support offers no other solution than to buy the full disk at $199 to replace the digital upgrade I already purchased when Win 8 was first released (the special discount period).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tired of dealing with this. I am now running Win 8 PRO with NO problems. Obviously, I want 8.1 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 other computers currently running Win 8.1 PRO. I purchased with Win 8 repair disk. I also have Office 365. SO, I use MS products a lot and expect more from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome any suggestions from the community because it is obvious MS is NOT going to help in any way.</p>

            This kind of thing happens sometimes when there is a driver conflict.&nbsp; Before attempting the update again, disconnect all hardware devices--printers, cameras, microphones, speakers, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the update then concludes successfully, reattach devices one
 at a time, allow drivers to load and see if there's a problem.&nbsp; You might also want to check your hardware manufacturers' websites to see if there are drivers for 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there aren't, it doesn't mean that the latest driver available won't work.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks JinWynne. I tried with nothing installed other than the mouse. Still does not work. I got as far as Win 8 Pro and checked all drivers. Could not find anything newer through Windows Update and also HP. Even checked AMD for the ATI graphics drivers.
 One program that has called me trouble in the past is the Catalyst App installed. I even tried and install with that removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Andre. I will try this over the upcoming weekend when I have 5 or 6 hours to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it crashes, I have to reinstall either Win 7 or Win 8. I can do both, but they take hours. If I have to reinstall Win 8 it takes more the 3 hours just to download and reinstall the updates required before I can upgrade to Win 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I used my Win 7 Home Premium image disks and restored the laptop to the Original state, then added all the updates (nearly 200). Took several hours. It has been working just fine. I then installed Office 365 and several other apps. Still works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran several in depth disk checks and no errors. That is why I was so frustrated with the Windows help people kept saying just go get another hard drive. There does not seem to be anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it crashes, it is at the point where the Win 8.1 tutorial begins to run. The word HI shows up then crash and NOTHING will repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may just stay with Win 7 for a while simply because it is working fine and the frustration level is really high. I tried 6 complete installs taking several hours for each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys for the info. I just need to decide how many more hours to put into it.</p>

            Try downloading the GWX control panel.&nbsp; Microsoft is up to their old tricks again loading Win 10 updates to 7 and 8.1.&nbsp; The GWX control panel that is a free download (donation would be nice) found over 800 MB of Windows 10 clutter that was crashing my
 8.1.&nbsp; I still can't download some programs because MS is blocking the download of the 'locale.dll".&nbsp; This is yet another dishonest&nbsp; way to get you to install that miserable Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; I had it, installed a new hard drive and purchased 8.1.&nbsp; Windows 7
 is better, but MS pulled the plug on that one.&nbsp; I might have to migrate to one of the Linux programs ~sigh.&nbsp; I heard that Google is looking at creating a new OS.&nbsp; Hopefully they won't make it a quirky smartphone OS-like program like Windows 10.&nbsp; Good luck.

    <title>Windows 10 disables network card on start-up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 disables network card on start-up</h2>
                    <p>I've browsed these forums and other sites but I have not yet found a resolution to my issue. I'm hoping that this post will lead to something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded my HP m7183c mini-tower to Windows 10 (32-bit) &nbsp;but my built-in NIC is always disabled upon startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdf1e1e9-d77b-46db-98dd-e7226f0d1357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdf1e1e9-d77b-46db-98dd-e7226f0d1357" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Intel, my driver is the most current one for the POR/100 VE.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4cb2f376-3d0f-485b-b111-687dea0bf521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4cb2f376-3d0f-485b-b111-687dea0bf521" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The NIC cannot be enabled from Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can start the PC with NIC enabled is to <strong>delete </strong>
it from Device Manager before powering-down or restarting. It will be enabled upon startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that the problem might be with my onboard NIC, I tried installing a Windows 10 compatible PCI gigabit ethernet card. Interestingly, Windows 10 disables the PCI NIC as well upon startup. I've tried it with the onboard NIC enabled and disabled in
 the BIOS and gotten the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My VPN software is current and compatible with Windows 10. I had uninstalled both before the upgrade and installed the latest versions after a successful upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only anti-virus is Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

 are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some third party programs conflict. The word Safe mode appears in the concern of your monitor to identify which windows mode you are using.</span></p>

                    <p>Original title: Error 0xc0000185 -</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn my pc on, it immediately says "Preparing automatic repair" and goes to a blue screen with the following text:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0xc0000185</p>
<p>
</p><p>Youll need to use the recovery tools in your installation media. If you don't have any installation media(like a disk or USB device), contact your system administrator or PC manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Enter to try again&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press F8 for Start-up Settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press Esc for UEFI Firmware Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried F8 and tried all the options it gives me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried loading it in safe mode I get the following blue screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \\Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000185&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have looked on other forums but couldn't find the same problem that matched the same file problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any lo would be appreciated. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> If you don’t have Windows disc, try to create Windows 8.1 bootable media:<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to run the disc and use the recovery environment and try the below command and check if it helps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In recovery option go to the Command Prompt and try the below commands:<br />
•&nbsp;Bootrec /scanos<br />
It scans for Windows installations on the hard drive. This is useful when the boot manager does not list all available Windows installations.<br />
•&nbsp;Bootrec /fixmbr<br />
It writes the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the system partition without rewriting the partition table.<br />
•&nbsp;Bootrec /fixboot<br />
It writes a new boot sector on the system partition to replace a corrupt boot sector which might be causing startup problems.<br />
•&nbsp;Bootrec /RebuildBcd<br />
It also replaces boot files to fix errors caused by corrupt files.<br />

            <p>Hello, I created a Windows 8.1 bootable USB and tried using the Bootrec/scanos command. The result I got said "Total identified Windows installations: 0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried &nbsp;"chkdsk/r c:" and although it's executing it, I am getting the error "The disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in file..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently still running the chkdsk command.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the below information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you try the system restore in the advance option?<br />
2. Did you try all the commands in the previous post?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to do the system refresh:<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you upgraded your PC from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and your PC has a Windows 8 recovery partition, refreshing your PC will restore Windows 8. You’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after the refresh has finished.<br />
Warning: Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.<br />
