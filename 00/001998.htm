    <title>Outlook 2010 - &#34;Invalid profile&#34; message after every reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fots  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 - &#34;Invalid profile&#34; message after every reboot</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
One of my users is having an issue with Outlook 2010 in that at the start of each day he's getting the "Invalid profile" message from Outlook whenever he tries starting it up.<br />
<br />
A quick thing to note about our setup: we have the Microsoft Online Services client installed on all of our user's machines and this is what they use to launch Outlook with.<br />
<br />
Each time this has happened, I've gone through the MS Online Services client to Reconfigure Outlook, which would fix the problem, but lose all of the emails it had downloaded and stored on his PC... causing it to take forever to pull everything back in for
 him.&nbsp; So, in troubleshooting this, I took his PC and shut it down and turned it back on 5 or 6 times, each time logging back in and opening his email via MS Online Services... each time was fine for me.&nbsp; Yet again, at the start of the next day, it was giving
 him the Invalid profile message.&nbsp; I did note this time, however, that when going through Control Panel -&gt; Mail, it was not showing his profile there.&nbsp; Only "Backups".<br />
<br />
This last time I got my hands on his PC, I went to shut it down and noticed one of those "End Now" messages come up regarding one of Outlook's processes.&nbsp; I let it run it's course and the PC finished shutting down on it's own.&nbsp; I asked him if he lets those
 run their course or if he merely hits End Now.&nbsp; He said he couldn't remember but believes in most cases lets them run their course.<br />
<br />
Looking through his event viewer, I've found the following entry that corresponds to each time he's shut it down on a day before he has an issue with it:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warning</p>
<p>Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Userenv</p>
<p>Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None</p>
<p>Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1517</p>
<p>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2/27/2012</p>
<p>Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:27:38 PM</p>
<p>User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM</p>
<p>Computer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *censored*</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>Windows saved user *censored* registry while an application or service was still using the registry during log off. The memory used by the user's registry has not been freed. The registry will be unloaded when it is no longer in use.
</p>
<p>This is often caused by services running as a user account, try configuring the services to run in either the LocalService or NetworkService account.</p>
<p>For more information, see Help and Support Center at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.</p>
</div>
<br />
<br />
So, my big question is this: could his hitting "End Now" on Outlook be causing the problem?&nbsp; Is that what is causing the message above?&nbsp; If not, is the message above related?&nbsp; Regardless, how the heck do I solve this?<br />

            Been a while since anything has gone up on here, but wanted to give a little more info.<br />
<br />
I've been able to determine now that this is happening for multiple users, most with 2010 but some of them are using Outlook 2007.&nbsp; This problem has not once happened for any of our 2003 users.&nbsp; While I'm sure the mail file size plays a role, it is a specific
 issue with 2007 and 2010.&nbsp; The user that I mentioned in the OP that was having this issue started having the issue the day after I switched him from 2003 to 2010.<br />
<br />
In addition, I've determined that the issue arises for these users when they attempt to shut down their PC BEFORE Outlook has fully closed out.&nbsp; They exit Outlook and as soon as the window disappears, they go to the Start menu and choose Shut Down, but Outlook
 hasn't actually finished closing yet.&nbsp; It still has it's icon over by the clock.<br />
<br />
As a work around for these users, I have instructed each of them to keep an eye on that icon after they close Outlook.&nbsp; Once the icon has actually disappeared, only then can they go and actually shut down.<br />
<br />
Unless someone else has more information regarding this, I'm going to raise it up as a bug to Microsoft.<br />

            As I have noted, the problem does not occur to 2003 users.&nbsp; It does to 2007 and 2010 users.&nbsp; Thus, I'm sorry, I highly doubt it is related to exchange.&nbsp; If we had the licenses and the time to mess around with it, I bet you I can get it to do this with
 my personal yahoo account.&nbsp; The one thing I can note, is that this seems to happen more so with those that heavily utilize their PCs (ie, have a lot of memory hogging applications open for most of the day then close out everything at once and shut down) and
 Outlook seems to take a lot longer (one I have noted a minute) to fully close out.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, what users we have on 2007 and 2010 that experience the issue on a regular basis are not willing to subject themselves to the safe mode testing.&nbsp; I really wish I had one that would.&nbsp; I'm not even running one of those versions (I'm on 2003), so
 I cannot test.<br />
<br />
As for add-ons, guarantee that isn't it.&nbsp; Some of these are fresh installs on newly built machines.<br />

            No, unfortunately that doesn't solve it.&nbsp; Each time I'm getting the invalid profile message from these people I am wiping out their old profile information and starting anew.&nbsp; For one in particular, he's actually been through 3 PCs (completely unrelated
 reasons), two of them having clean/fresh images put on, one of which being brand new.<br />
<br />
I can say through all that I've looked into this, I can tell that the system log entry I had found and posted in the OP doesn't have anything to do with it.&nbsp; That almost seems to happen to everyone, regardless of email version or use.<br />
<br />
It really seems to be related to when 2007 and 2010 are, for lack of a better explanation, shut down improperly.&nbsp; In some of the cases where this has happened, users report having seen a "End Now" message dialog regarding Outlook.exe while trying to shut down.&nbsp;
 The rest of the time they are "unsure" or "can't remember".<br />
<br />
Is it possible this is causing some sort of corruption to the profile?&nbsp; I just don't understand why it never happened under 2003....<br />
<br />
The only lead I have in that direction is that I have noticed that with 2007 and 2010, they have extra files in the %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook folder that are not present with 2003.&nbsp; There's even a .tmp file that 2007/2010
 creates and deletes in this directory that corresponds to starting and exiting Outlook.&nbsp; 2003 does not have this.<br />
<br />
I did managed to see that when this occurs, if you open Control Panel -&gt; Mail, and look at what profiles it shows as being stored on that PC, the user's email account no longer shows there.<br />

            <p>Checking into your event error, you can read more here to see if anything applies because you'll see that many of the entries apply to Windows XP:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not be Outlook having the issue but something that integrates with Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this problem happen if you open Outlook in safe mode? </p>

                    <p>I'm using OneNote for Windows 10 / app.&nbsp; I would like to change the default location for notebooks to a specific folder on my OneDrive and can't find any option to do so.&nbsp; As it currently works, all notebooks are stored to my OneDrive "Documents" folder

            Unfortunately its not an option for the OneNote app. You can however change the location with OneNote 2016 that comes with Office 365.

<h2>            Excel Chart - problems with margins &#38; printing</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Excel 2007.&nbsp; My charts from 2003 came over/up looking just fine.&nbsp; I updated the chart information and printed the charts.&nbsp; But the charts appears to be printing like it is centered on the page.&nbsp; I went to Page Layout - margins and selected the
 last custom setting which was set at 1/2" margins on 3 sides and 3/4" margin on the bottom.&nbsp; That is what I want.&nbsp; I like my charts to be at the top of the paper with a larger margin at the bottom because I use a footed to print the date the chart is printed.&nbsp;
 The Chart still prints like it is centerd on the page.&nbsp; I went back to Print Preview and looked at the lines on the page that indicate the margins and header and footer.&nbsp; I pulled the header like up to the margin line.&nbsp; When I did the same thing to the footer
 line, I lost my footer, so I put the footer line back to where it was.&nbsp; When I printed the chart again the top of the chart barely move up just a little.&nbsp; But it still looks like it is centered.&nbsp; I can not find out where the chart could be formatted to be
 centered on the page.&nbsp; Can anyone help me - or tell me what I am doing wrong?&nbsp; Since I print approximately 25 charts a month, I would like them all to be consistent and right.</p>

            <p>The scaling and print area might need to be reset. First, change the scaling (page setup&gt; adjust to 100%). Next, clear the print area (page setup&gt; sheet &gt; print area&gt; clear&nbsp;data). Then try to format again.</p>
<p>Sometime when you're making formatting adjustments, it bases the most recent change on a previous change instead of the original layout.

<p>Hi Darshan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the picture you sent us, your organization deployed Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). For ADFS, the keep me signed in prompt will show up after successful authentication. If the stay signed in prompt doesn‚Äôt show up after successful
 authentication, you need to confirm with you admin if they hide the ‚Äústay signed in‚Äù option as I mentioned in my previous post.</p>

<h2>            Installing Internet Explorer 8 - Error &#34;newer version already installed&#34; how do I remove IE8</h2>
                    
<p>My Internet Explorer stopped working (will not load when I double click icon). I downloaded Internet Explorer 8, but when I tried to install it, a pop up stated that I had a newer version installed so it stopped. I tried to uninstall the current version,
 but I cannot find it. When I go to "Computer" and click Change/Uninstall Programs, Internet Explorer does not show up on the list.</p>
<p>How do I uninstall it?</p>
<p>Is there a newer version available that I can go somewhere and download?</p>

Well, that certain explains a lot.</p>
<p>Back-up any personal data (none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the HDD &amp; do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;
<strong>Please note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) will NOT fix this!</strong></p>
<p>HOW TO do a clean install of Vista: See the "If you want to reinstall Windows Vista by performing a clean installation..." section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista</a></p>
<p>After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of everything on the following page before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet or a local network (i.e., other computers) and before using a flash drive or
 SDCard that isn't brand-new or hasn't been freshly formatted:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 steps to help protect your new computer before you go online<br />

<p>Tip: After getting the computer fully-patched, download/install KB971029 manually:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029</a></p>
<p>NB: Any Norton or McAfee free-trial that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it will be reinstalled (but invalid) when Windows is reinstalled. You MUST uninstall the free-trial
<strong>and</strong> download/run the appropriate removal tool <strong>before</strong> installing any updates, Windows Service Packs or IE upgrades
<strong>and before</strong> installing your new anti-virus application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norton Removal Tool<br />

http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</a></p>
<p>If these procedures look too complex - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a local, reputable and independent (i.e., not BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Restore HP backup file</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to restore a backup from a iPaq to another PDA?&nbsp; The file is in a format described a "mobile device backup file" but when I check proeprties it has a .stg extension.&nbsp; HP say that it can only be restored
 by the device thatbacked it up.&nbsp; Does anyone know what software might be able to open the file so I can retrieve my backup?&nbsp; I no longer have the iPaq.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, HP's response is likely correct. If the backup is all-inclusive and contains device-specific data and registry settings, a restore to another device would likely have bad results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, this is no different than a lot of PC backup solutions that are also all-inclusive. Restoring a full backup from one PC to another can lead to a lot of problems if the hardware between the two devices is not identical.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; If the backup cannot be recovered then do you think that there may be products out there that can at least open up the ackup file to recover some of the data files?&nbsp; As you can imagine there is a bit of info in a backup
 of a PDA (7MB of data).&nbsp; HP claim that the same device is needed for the restore.&nbsp; I am not sure whether this means the device that performed the backup or just another HP iPaq.&nbsp; If the latter then perhaps there is an iPaq out there to perform an intermediate
 restore and then extract the files to another device.&nbsp; Do you think this would work?</p>

<p>Unfortunately,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would most likely would need an iPaq in the same family (2710/2715) to make things work, but even then hardware differences might cause problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This whole discussion serves as the answer to the question "Why are there 3rd party WIndows Mobile backup solutions when my device comes with a solution?" Both Sprite and Spb offer backup solutions that allow for more flexible backup and restore
 functionality.Unfortunately, I do not know of any solutions out there that open up backups other than their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best and safest bet would be to seek out a device&nbsp;that matches your old iPaq, perform&nbsp;the restore and then copy the data you need.</p>

            <p>Pam has suggested a simple F&amp;R operation that is likely to cause as many problems as it solves (and it doesn't address sentences ending in question marks or exclamation points). Since you're going to have to examine the document closely for incorrect replacements
 (two spaces after initials, for example, as Pam mentioned), it might be easier to take a different approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you are not using the grammar checker for anything else, you can enable it for one single issue: number of spaces between sentences. Go to File | Options | Proofing and check the appropriate boxes for checking grammar either with spelling (explicitly)
 or checking it as you type. Then click Settings. Under Require, select 2 for "Spaces required between sentences." You can then uncheck every other box in the dialog, if desired, so that the grammar checker won't bother with anything except the spaces. If you
 enabled "Check grammar as you type,"&nbsp; you'll be able to scan the document visually for marked instances of a single space between sentences and correct them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, though, that I'm surprised that APA 6 requires two spaces between sentences, as modern typographical practice prefers just one (unless a&nbsp;monospace font is being used).</p>

            Use&nbsp; find and replace.<br />
<br />
Find: period space <br />
Replace&nbsp; with: period space space<br />
<br />
<br />
If you already have&nbsp; some double spaces after a period, you can search for three spaces and replace them with two.&nbsp; You'll also need to check for too many spaces&nbsp; after initials and such.<br />

<h2>            Excel - Filter being applied only to a few columns and not all</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using Excel 2016 through office 365. I have seen this problem with multiple excel files on my laptop. Currently I'm trying to enable filter across all columns (A to U are filled up on my excel), however, excel only applies to a few columns (A to K)
 and there is no filter available on the remaining columns....Does anyone know on how I can apply filter across all columns? I have tried selecting all columns but it does not....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Rahul</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel Bracho,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also encountered the issue that Outlook crashes after clicking the Signature button, please check whether there are pre-installed Microsoft Office Desktop Apps exist on your computer. If so, please uninstall it and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Windows Start button and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apps</strong>, and then click <strong>Apps</strong> <strong>and</strong>
<strong>Features</strong>.</li><li>Choose Microsoft Office Desktop Apps and click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-freezes-clicking-the-signature-button-c70b36c2-66ca-401c-ab45-f29a46495d02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have tried EVERYTHING that has been suggested and nothing works.&nbsp; The last things I tried were the SCANPST.EXE and it found errors and repaired but still unable to get the Signature button to work at all.&nbsp; In fact, none of the 4 buttons at the top of the
 File...Options...Mail function at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, besides SCANPST I ran a Microsoft tool that is suppose to "wipe out" Office and that ran and I re-installed Office 2016 Pro and tried both old and new profiles (.pst) files and still nothing works.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail to Outlook 2013 Connectivity Broken&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am an Office 365 subscriber, and I primarily use my old @hotmail.com for sending and receiving emails. I want to connect my Outlook 2013 client to my @hotmail.com account, but there's a problem - the connectivity is broken I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on add a new account, and try to add my @hotmail.com account, it asks my account credentials 3-4 times. Then it starts searching for "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** settings". After a couple minutes, it shows this message;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available. Click Next to attempt using an unencrypted connection"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I click on Next to attempt an unencrypted connection, it again starts searching and takes a couple minutes, after which it says;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e2b212a-fa71-4232-8465-47fd7917c46a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried again and again, but to no avail. Even tried manual settings with "Outlook.com or Exchange ActiveSync compatible service" (with m.hotmail.com as mailbox address) and "POP or iMAP" options, but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me set up my @hotmail.com account with Outlook 2013? I know it's not an Outlook 2013 problem, because I can easily add gmail and yahoo accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick Edit: I have an @outlook.com alias for my account. I tried that too, no effect. Either there's a problem with my account, or Microsoft's email service is broken. Helppp :/</p>

            <p>I just figured out the problem! Microsoft's 2-step authentication was the problem. I disabled it, and was able to get Outlook 2013 to work with my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned the 2-step authentication back on, let's see if it keeps in sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should address this problem - functionality must not come at the price of security.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned in title i need to run a slideshow of multiple excel document in a folder and update excel docs in realtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my office, 3 department want to display a slideshow of excel documents about inventory and other things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every department has TV. They want to connect the TV to computer and run slides of multiple excel document.</p>
<p>Any user from any department doing changes to document should be updated realtime in the excel sheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If there is a way make multiple sheet within single excel sheet and make a slideshow that is also ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any other solution also, it is welcome. Thank you.</p>

            Depends on what you mean by "reset".&nbsp; If you want to start Outlook with a clean set of folders, create a new PST.&nbsp; If you want to start Outlook over with not only clean folders but with having to add accounts again, create a new mail profile and PST.&nbsp;
 If you want Outlook to behave as if it's running for the first time, start it using the /firstrun command switch (it's not listed in Outlook's Help, but it was there for Outlook 2007, so I assume it's there for Outlook 2010 as well.&nbsp; I can't check right now).&nbsp;
 Finally, you can completely uninstall Outlook, delete all mail profiles, and reiinstall Outlook if you want to start completely fresh.

                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to update my E50 from 6.27 to 7.13.<br />
<br />
Installed the latest Nokia Software Updater but when searching for my mobile it does not find it. The mobile is connected via the USB cable and shown in the Nokia PC Suite as connected. The moment I start searching with the Updater tool I get the message that
 it has been disconnected.<br />
<br />
Any idea what's wrong?<br />
<br />

            Had the same problem. I plugged the USB cable to another USB port and it worked instantly. It was connected to the PC's front panel and now it's connected directly to my motherboard USB port in the back. Maybe not the perfect solution but it worked.

            Hello:<br />
<br />
It seems like there's no keyboard shortcut for "Enable Editing/Content". But if you want to get rid of this message every time you open an workbook from Internet/Email then you can disable it.<br />
<br />
Go to:<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Unchecked the "...from Internet" or "...for Outlook attachments".<br />
<br />
Then press OK and another OK...<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks and hope it helps,<br />

<br />
Click on File &gt; Options<br />
<br />
Click on 'Quick Access Toolbar'<br />
<br />
Choose commands from:<br />
<br />
Select - 'All Commands'<br />
<br />
Scroll down to 'Enable Editing'<br />
<br />
Select it and Click on 'Add'<br />
<br />
An icon will appear at the very top left of Excel/Word/Powerpoint.<br />
<br />
Open a document that has the message 'Protected View This file originated from an Internet location and might be unsafe.....'<br />
<br />
Press Alt button a maximum of 4 times. This enables you to access the main menu items by typing a letter - but also allows you to access the 'Quick Access Toolbar' using numbers.<br />
<br />
The 'Enable Editing' icon looks like a notepad with a pencil, it should have a 2 next to it.<br />
<br />
Therefore the full command is Alt x 4 then press '2' for the pop up to go away.<br />

<p>I'm experiencing problems with my phone battery life. When I charge the phone it tells me that the&nbsp;battery is full but after 10-15 min it tells me it's empty again. This is strange as I bought two other new batteries&nbsp;and it's the same issue. I'm suspecting
 that it has nothing to do with the battery. &nbsp;My software version is 081.003. model E72-1</p>

<blockquote>Lots of power problems since the upgrade to firmware 081.003 on my E72. Battery life suddenly a lot shorter, and sometimes jumps from 4-segments to one, then powers off within minutes. I tried buying a new battery, but this is just as bad, and a
 USB charger in case there's a problem with the charging socket, but still no good. Also, have hard-reset three times since the firmware upgrade and that's not helped either.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I think it's clear there is a serious power management problem with this firmware, but it's not possible to return to the previous version without a visit to a Nokia Service Centre and risk of bricking the handset, so I guess we're stuck with it.</blockquote>

<p>Mine was fine too when I was on 071.004 (and all previous versions back to May 2010). It was updating to 081.003 that caused the problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the link to Energy Profiler. I've got it installed and running now, will see if it can highlight anything that's draining the power. However, I have a suspicion that the problem is either that the new firmware doesn't permit the battery to reach
 full charge, or misreports remaining charge and forces the handset into power save and shutdown when there is actually plenty of power left.</p>

its interesting that you got 081 on the upgrade. I just plugged mine into ovi suite and accepted the latest upgrades and got 071 ... sounds like I was lucky.<br />
<br />
Predictive text also dreadful on E72 compared to E71 and E63. Its only the camera that keeps me keeping this phone

            So Energy Profiler showed a normal drain of around 60mA, spiking up to 200 or so when email syncing or over a few minutes of web browsing. It initially predicted 30 hours of battery remaining. I left it running for eight hours and it was predicting 22
 hours remaining - makes sense. The battery meter was still showing all bars at this point. 15 minutes after the last check the battery meter was showing one bar and the handset had gone into power save mode, but Energy profiler was still predicting just under
 22 hours remaining life. A few minutes after that the handset had powered itself off and wouldn't respond to the power button until I plugged in the charger.<br />
<br />
If Energy Profiler is to be believed, the battery is fine and there are no rogue apps draining excessive power, but the handset is getting it wrong and going into power save then shutting down because it believes the battery charge is close to exhaustion. A
 bug, hopefully one that will be fixed soon.

<p>Having the exact same issue here, running 071.004. It started about 4 weeks ago. Suddenly instead of 2 days of heavy usage, I barely make it through 1 day with limited usage. There is absolutely no explanation I can think of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 3 batteries, the problem occurs with all three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reason I am holding on to my E72 instead of switching to Android is the amazing battery life of the E72. If I don't find a solution for this, it's bye-bye Nokia and welcome Android.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have Energy Profiler installed but didn't yet get it to run anything useful - I'll try this again. However it seems like maybe some strange hardware issue, how come we're all suddenly experiencing this issue - running both 071 and 081?</p>

<p>I've got same problem here both on E72 and E73, one of my friend called me and make same complaint. The battery life is terribly shorter now. Is there any way to make it known as a general problem?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t find the mails which are saved to my draft folder.</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Desperately need help with an e-mail issue. Yesterday I typed out an e-mail through a websites contact details. At the end of the e-mail I saved to draft. A few minutes later I went into the drafts folder and tapped on the saved email at this moment
 the email disappeared. It didn't open it just vanished. I can't find it in any other folder, not even deleted, and I have entered search details and nothing appears. Is this bcause it was through the websites contact details? I'm at a loss and hoping someone
 can help me recover it. It may be relevant to add that I was doing this through my e-mail app on kindle fire.</p>

<p>You can use the IIf function to check for 0 values.&nbsp; The general idea might be something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =IIf(value1=0 Or value2=0, Null, {put your calculation here})</p>
