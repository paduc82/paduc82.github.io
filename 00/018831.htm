<h2>            Office 365 Folder Permissions - Powershell</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with Office 365 permissions. I am trying to give UserA access to limited folders of UserB's mailbox, and (possibly) have it auto-map to UserA's Outlook Left-hand Folder Bar. I have given the user Top of Information Store folder access
 and Inbox access using the following two commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity [UserB]:\ -user [UserA] -AccessRights Reviewer
</p>
<p>add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity [UserB]:\inbox -user [UserA] -AccessRights Reviewer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed both permissions were successful by running Get-MailboxFolderPermission on UserB's folders, and UserA shows up as having "reviewer" access to both "Top of Information Store" and "Inbox", however, UserA still cannot open UserB's mailbox in Outlook
 nor through OWA. Is there a way to give the user a way to open just those two folders and have them show up in that user's left-hand side-bar in Outlook? Also, is their a way to auto-map it, so that when the user opens Outlook, the Top of Information Store
 and Inbox show up automatically on the left as if I had given them Add-MailboxPermission FullAccess rights?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ultimate goal of this is in the long run to be able to have certain users be able to open mailboxes in either OWA or Outlook, and then be restricted to being able to navigate only to specific folders that I deem necessary. Ideally, this would auto-map,
 just like Add-MailboxPermissions -AccessRights FullAccess does in Outlook, but with limited actual access. The other approach I tried was giving FullAccess, then trying to RemoveMailboxFolderPermissions on specific folders, but, as I've come to realize (or
 at least I believe), that you cannot do it this way, as Add-MailboxPermissions -AccessRights FullAccess doesn't actually create individual folder permissions, therefore, Remove-MailboxFolderPermissions won't work because the individual controls are not in
 place at that point (at least, this is how I've come to understand it through research of the topic).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>

            Hi Syed,
<p>#1 this new email form is a disaster!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see no setting in Outlook.com. "if" I do? I have no clue or idea what I am looking or seeing.</p>
<p>I know nothing about an "upgraded Outlook Mail web based interface"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not "trying" &nbsp;to access "Outlook.com". </p>
<p>I&nbsp;know nothing about through "Web or App"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know nothing about account upgrade to the "new Outlook.com" interface,</p>
<p>Outlook Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do know is this: I had this Hotmail account for over 10 years.</p>
<p>The last 3 years my "Hotmail" account has been blocked by Microsoft over ten times starting in 2013.</p>
<p>Three times that year.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;April 2014 until July 2014. and several times after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have 2 accounts and the second account has been blocked 3 times since June 2015.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Dec 2015 I received an email from Microsoft about what I thought about the "new Outlook.com?</p>
<p>I wrote 16 items that were wrong with the "new Outlook.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;wrote that since the "new Outlook.com, &nbsp;that is the&nbsp;page shows when I go to "Sign In".</p>
<p>After I "sign in" the email page show up. I get 5 to 10 Garbage emails a day and have since Last October 2015 &nbsp;with different&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft email addresses.
</p>
<p>From 20 to 50 Garbage emails a day from from many others with there Garbage Dump email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what I am wanting to stop! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I read about stopping Garbage emails about "Subject" </p>
<p>I have a list of 30 or more with Subject I want to stop!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big money system, 2016 solar panels. harp mortage, healt tips, ultra trim 350, reminder, dr oz, vydox plus,</p>

<p>Hope you get the idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When&nbsp;I get Garbage Dump emails with the same email address 2 times I block that email address.

            <p>Hi Syed.</p>
<p>Microsoft Community Answers,</p>
<p>I don't know if you got my last reply about how to block /stop what ever it is called doesnt really matter the name when you get several emails a day like the examples I showed you. I just want them stopped.</p>
<p>What ever the "Subject".</p>
<p>Just send the instructions to me in this form and I will follow your instructions as best I can and "hope" that will stop the onslot of "Garbage" emails with Microsoft email addresses, I get several every day from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the many "Garbage" emails I get every day from the examples I sent about 4-19-16 to you listing several "Garbage" Subject" emails
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I last wrote about 4-19-16 I have sent over 100 emails to:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp; </p>
<p>All I get back from them is Go to "Microsoft Community Answer Desk", where I am now typing this message to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I send emails to the above, they send a website back to me which is the same no-nothing website, As in the movie "Forest Gump" if you get my drift?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, please send the instrutctions in this form about how to "block" the <br />
"Subject" emails like the examples I gave before or as Now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5 "Congratulation" emails from Senders like Microsoft.com and many others with different emails and Different Domains in one day is more than enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise,</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Each time you reply it is about something different?</p>
<p>The Question was about "Blocking" Emails with the "SubJect" such as I&nbsp;wrote</p>
<p>before I have 5 emails Sender is Barbara:&nbsp; different email address, different Domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this email Program worked?</p>
<p>I would copy and paste each of them in this box for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your "copy" reply&nbsp; #4 there is no "Peventing" Junk Emails and Safe and Block Senders. It is Block Senders and 2 different "Safe Lists". I am there about everyday "Blocking" Domains etc.

<p>Please advise about "Blocking" "Subject" emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please review my question about "Blocking" "Subject" emails.</p>
<p>The example I gave about "Barbara" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last couple days I have sent over 50 emails to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and Hotlook.com, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** andOutlook.com, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,</p>
<p>and cert@microsoft about the many "Garbage Dump" "Spam" emails I get every day and from Microsoft email addresses. Also, the eamils I get from the "Same" "Subject"</p>
<p>which was my original question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote before I "Block" email addressess and "Domains".</p>

<p>Mine is made in finland and I live in UK.</p>

<p>I know there are quality issues with the phones made in china. Moreover the chinese ones have a slower processor (I believe is 300 instead of 600).</p>

<p>MIne is finnish too (bought by nokia store online) but the light leackages behind the not perfecly centered keyboard and home key, battery cover lag and lower plastic rim lag are there too. It's an E 72 , (1st serie at least) feature...(I don't speak of
 the processor speed..but...technical fatures declared by nokia can't be disproved by the production ountry) and, to me, it's it's it's charm...</p>

<p>My E72 is Made in China and I don't really have any complaint regarding the build nor processor speed.&nbsp; I believe that nokia won't build E72 in china if they can't deliver the same quality as made in finland or other country.&nbsp; If puasho's claims that his
 E72 Made in Finland has that leak light, I believe that every E72 has the same build whether it is made in china or finland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, that's my opinion and I still love my E72 better than my N95 and N82.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, handsets made in China as opposed to Finland are manufactured using the exact same methods as in Finland, with the same standards.</p>
<p>I'd bet plenty of money that if you had two of the same model phones in your hand, one made in China, one made in Finland, you would not be able to tell the difference!</p>
<p><br />
I work with many Nokias every day, being made in Finland/China/Hungary and I think there's a few more. There is certainly no difference in craftsmenship.</p>

<p>I have 2x E72, one is a Vodafone UK one, made in Finland, the other is a generic Malaysia one, made in China.</p>
<p>Performance and build quality are identical - the only differance is the label and addtional icons on some of the keys of the Malaysian one.</p>

<h2>            How to run Windows offline defender</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows defender</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear all. Not a big expert and wld appreciate some help. On my laptop, Microsoft security essentials show me as being potentially at risk and that I should download and run windows defender offline. I did. But the message is still there. It was quite a process
 to get the windows defender to run, but it did eventually when I ran it from a USB drive. I had to change the. Boot order in the BIOS set up facility. However, it was not entirely clear how to get out of it after it had finished scanning. The screen was all
 gray and no options. . I had to shut down the computer by holding down the power key.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, first, should I worry about the potentially at risk message? And second, does it seem as if I ran windows defender offline wrongly.</div>

            MSE sometimes generates a message to use WDO when malware is encountered that MSE cannot address.
<div><br />
<div>Were you told what malware MSE had identified?</div>
<div><br />
<div>It sounds like you <b>probably</b> ran it correctly but here's the most important question: &nbsp;Did your computer boot up okay after the hard shutdown? &nbsp;How is the computer running? &nbsp;Tell us more details about your issue, please.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On occasion we receive "complaints" in the MS Community forum that computers will not boot after WDO was used to remove some variants of Alureon and because of that I don't often recommend that WDO be employed if there are alternative malware scanners
 that might address the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards...</div>

            Thank you for the quick reply. &nbsp;I did not have a problem booting up after the hard shutdown. &nbsp;The computer seems to be running fine. &nbsp;I just did a full scan with WDO and had to do a hard shutdown. The computer is now booting up fine. MSE still says I might
 be potentially at risk and that I should download and run WDO. So I see only three possibilities: (1) MSE for some reason does not recognize that I have run WDO; (2) I did not run WDO properly; or (3) I don't &nbsp;understand the message from MSE correctly. &nbsp;I
 think a ran WDO properly, despite having to do a hard shutdown. So that leaves 1 and 3. Or?

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things â€“ because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<div>Current recommendations for minimizing junk mail<span>&nbsp;</span><b>in Outlook.com.</b></div>
<div>1. Sign in to&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072C6">Outlook.com</font></a></strong>.<br />
<div>2. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<strong><br />
More mail settings</strong>.<br />
3. Under&nbsp;<strong>Preventing junk mail</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.<br />
4. Under the&nbsp;<strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>, click on&nbsp;<strong>Blocked senders</strong>.<br />
5. In the Blocked senders list, add the name or domain (the part of an e-mail address that follows the @ sign, such as outlook.com) that you don't want to receive mail from, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Add to list &gt;&gt;</strong>.<br />
<br />
You can create rules to delete incoming junk mails.<br />
1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click the&nbsp;<strong>Cog</strong>&nbsp;icon, and then click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>More mail settings</strong>.<br />
2. Under&nbsp;<strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong>.<br />
3. Click&nbsp;<strong>New</strong>&nbsp;and then under&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong>, click the drop down arrow on the first box and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sender's address</strong>.<br />
4. Under&nbsp;<strong>Step 1</strong>, type in on the third box the email address.<br />
5. Under&nbsp;<strong>Step 2</strong>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Delete these messagesâ€”don't even put them in my Deleted folder</strong>.<br />
6. Click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>&nbsp;at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
<font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font color="#000000">You may also</font>&nbsp;set your Junk email filter to&nbsp;<b>Exclusive</b>.<br />
If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe senders lists will be sent to the Junk folder.<br />
By default, the Junk folder will automatically delete messages after 10 days.<br />
This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address.</span></font></div>

<p>Hi dcuasquer,</p>
<p>I did some research and found that besides the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200746(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reasonable limits</a> in the article mentioned in your post, there is no official document stating the specific message limits regarding SMTP reply. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lists maximum limits for the entire platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's quite strange.. because the page above says it's the maximum for Office365 platform in general, but then "smtp relays do not need to adhere to this limit"</p>
<p>Be interesting to try I suppose and see how far you get</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies, actually the decision to move to Office 365 of one of our customers depends on this limit as they need this capability for they daily operation, hope someone knows what "reasonable limits" means. Thanks again.</p>

    <title>Microsoft family feature - no limit on apps downloaded from Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> almin ibrahimovic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft family feature - no limit on apps downloaded from Store</h2>
                    <p>In previous versions of Microsoft Windows, excluding 8.0; 8.1; and current version 10. Adult users such as parents and guardians could limit child's activities not just by blocking websites, but also creating a whitelist of applications that can be used
 by the child. This is a feature not available on current Windows 10 builds, at the time of writing; or if available it is not obvious to an adult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered that despite limiting access to websites, using the current family feature in Windows 10, there is no limit on the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Apps shown in Store</p>
<p>2. Installation of Store apps without admin rights. To clarify a parent, adult, receives a notification about the install but&nbsp;child can install the app. By the time parents realise it may be&nbsp;few hours, depending on the frequency of email checks.</p>
<p>3. The apps in Store access internet, say&nbsp;iptv apps, nasa apps, etc. all have video playback, or access to internet, through the app which is not limited. A child can install such apps despite setting correct age group in Family account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that Microsoft takes charge of this issue, as it is a feature many parents, adults, will look towards to better control and&nbsp;not just to be informed about child's activities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that Microsoft &nbsp;provides a check box next to each app on Store for adults to allow sharing in Microsoft Family, then it is parent, adult who decides with default being deny access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 mail disappeared from inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shannontucson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 mail disappeared from inbox</h2>
                    I use Outlook 365 (2013) Home Premium to access my two IMAP e-mail accounts on GoDaddy, as well has my hotmail account on Outlook.com. &nbsp;Several times now the contents of the main IMAP inbox (about 16000 emails) have disappeared from Outlook (but not from
 GoDaddy). &nbsp;It happened again today. &nbsp;As I write this, there are only 5 messages in my inbox. &nbsp;3 of them unread, &nbsp;4 are from today, 1 is from 2 months ago. &nbsp;All previous and intervening messages are missing.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been able to get all messages back in the past by deleting and recreating the account profile. &nbsp;Over time, the messages are downloaded from the server and everything appears all right. &nbsp;Then it happens again. &nbsp;I have tried limiting the "Mail to
 keep offline" to 12 or 24 months, but this seems to do no good. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't keep deleting and recreating the account profile over and over. &nbsp;Is there any other solution for this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: If I type a common word in the search box at the top of the message list ("look", for example) then dozens of messages will suddenly appear in the message list. &nbsp;When I clear the search box, all those messages disappear again. &nbsp;It seems that the
 messages are actually there in the message store, but "clearing" the filter does something that hides them from view. &nbsp;Not exactly intuitive...</div>

<div>Of course, now that I've said that, they'll probably disappear tomorrow.&nbsp;</div>

</p><p>First, when I turn on the phone it won't go beyond lock screen, it gives me the "Enter PIN" text instead of "Enter password" as it was before, but all of a sudden it gives no keypad so logically i can't type in the required &nbsp;"PIN", so i can't do or access
 anything on my phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, phone restarts itself every 10 minutes and heats up like it is being fried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help. Thankful in advance.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is it possible for pivot filters to be stacked or dependent on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikecro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible for pivot filters to be stacked or dependent on eachother</h2>
                    
<p>I have a lot of data to be summarised. If I filter on one column in the table then I am offered less choices when I filter in another. The filters are stacked or dependent on eachother.</p>
<p>But if I filter using one Pivot page field and then move to filter on another, I am still offered all teh possible values of that field. Not just the ones which a re possible given the value of the 1st filter.</p>
<p>I have seen several articles on internet saying that this is not possible "out of box".</p>
<p>1) is there any solution with 2010 or foreseeable future&nbsp;releases</p>
<p>2) is there a way of obtaining the functionality - even if it requires some VBA</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Sorry - I don't think I was clear enough.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true that "<span>Pivot table filter options completely depend on your data</span>". In fact that is my problem.</p>
<p>I want some filters to depend on my data AND the state of other filters. I hav heard the terms cascading or dependent filters.</p>
<p>It looks to be solved in Excel 2010 (see <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excelchart/thread/5a073c44-ffa4-4a85-8d95-9a7b3e992488?prof=required" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Anyone?</p>

            <p>To which update are you referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try a soft reset if not contact to your place of purchase to check your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to soft reset your phone: </p>
<p><span>On the phone&gt;go to settings&gt;date+time&gt;and switch the date+time to manual if it is on automatic</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Press and hold the Volume Down button and Power button buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10â€“15 seconds). Your phone will restart automatically.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>â€¢ Sometimes your phone will vibrate right away when you press the Volume Down button and Power button buttonsâ€”this is probably due to your ringer changing to Vibrate. Wait to release the buttons
 until a second vibration after 10â€“15 seconds. </span></p>
<p><span>â€¢ If you don't let go of the Volume down and Power buttons right after the vibration at 10â€“15 seconds, your phone may show a black startup screen and not restart normally. If this happens, just repeat
 the button combo to try again. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(The date and time may be incorrect after soft resetting your phone, which can cause issues when you try to sign in with your Microsoft account. To set the time correctly, go to Settings Settings
 icon &gt; Date + time.) </span></p>

<h2>            Receiving Constant Message on IE 9-- they blocked the website from displaying content with security certificate errors</h2>
                    <p>Every time I open Internet Explorer 9 (including the MSN home page)&nbsp;and&nbsp;every other&nbsp;website after that,&nbsp;I get this message:&nbsp; "INTERNET EXPLORER BLOCKED</p>
<p>&nbsp;THIS WEBSITE FROM DISPLAYING CONTENT WITH SECURITY CERTIFICATE ERRORS."&nbsp;&nbsp; It even does this to Microsoft webpages like this one.</p>
<p>I've been using IE 9 without problems since it first came out.&nbsp; I have Kaspersky Internet Security program for protection and it does a great job. I need help.</p>
<p>I've spent two days trying to troubleshoot this.&nbsp; Anyone have a&nbsp;clue?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Certificate errors occur when there is a problem with a certificate or the server's use of the certificate. Internet Explorer can help keep your information more secure by warning
 you about certificate errors.</p>

<p>To resolve this issue, an organization that hosts the secure Web site can purchase a certificate for each Web server from a third-party provider. Or, the organization can install a Microsoft Enterprise certification authority in the Active Directory forest.
 Then, the organization can use this certification authority to generate a certificate for each Web server.<br />
</p>
<p><em><strong>I don't understand who the "organization" is that hosts the secure Web site or how they can purchase a certificate for each Web server from a third party or how they can install a Microsoft Enterprise certificate authority in the Active Directory

            <p>Hi Gmadeb,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem can occur if you have a website in the Trusted sites list. If the complete cycle of websites used in the log in process arenâ€™t in the same security zone (Internet,
 Trusted Sites, etc.). Try removing all websites related to the website you are logging into from the Trusted/Restricted sites list and resetting your security zone settings back to default:</p>

            <p><span>This error occurs when there is a problem with a website certificate. First of all, check the date on your computer. Most common reason for such security certificate error is that the certificates are valid for a certain period of time, and if your
 computerâ€™s date is set to other than the correct date, there are high chances that you will get this warning. If you see the Security Certificate error even after you correct the date, then either the certificate of the website has really expired as it had
 to be renewed from time to time, or the site is not trustable.</span></p>
