<h2>            Microsoft will not let me turn off two factor authentication</h2>
                    I opted out of two factor some time ago&nbsp; I recently, when setting up my new Outlook program, noticed that by default, it had once again turned on two factor verification.&nbsp; I tried to turn it off but found that the button to turn it off was no longer there.&nbsp;
 Being unable to figure out a solution, I contacted support and was told that Microsoft just made a policy change.&nbsp; It appears that if you have opted out of two factor verification once, you can't do it a second time.&nbsp; In my case, after accidentally turning
 it on, I fell in the category of never being able to turn off.&nbsp; I'm upset.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I have a business that requires me to travel in remote areas where there is little or no cell phone service.&nbsp; I need to use my laptop in many of these remote areas and if I need
 internet connection, can usually find a Wi-Fi connection somewhere that I can use.&nbsp; But, I may not have cell service.&nbsp; This is not an unusual situation for me.&nbsp; With

<h2>            Modern news web part  - pin news from followed sites to top</h2>
                    <p>This was requested in a uservoice and though Msft responded "Boom it's done", it actually isn't:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>A specific request was to "<span>have the ability to surface featured articles to the top.". This doesn't exist at least in a useful way. Yes you can sort news posts but why should we have to manually sort content in this day and age? The obvious
 solution would be to allow us to pin certain content (eg from followed site) but that isn't an option. Is Msft's interpretation of "personalization" ever going to reflect the rest of the world's?</span></p>

<p>Sorry but this answer reflects the complete lack of understanding that Msft has of basic ux and content management systems, not to mention the way the real world works. I have 8500 users who will be posting things everyday.&nbsp; You're suggesting someone goes
 in to this web part everyday and resorts the content that's displayed? I'm using the "recommended for current user" option so maybe you think I can have all 8500 users go and resort the news items?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recommended for current user option worked the way Msft claims and truly personalized content, I wouldn't have this issue but since it doesn't, I'm asking if there's a way to pin content from followed sites which was what the uselessvoice topic I
 referenced was asking for. Thanks for trying but you don't seem to understand the way web sites work these days so maybe you can refer me to someone at Msft who does? I've engaged a Premier support/FastTrack team, but they are pretty clueless too. &nbsp;

            Thank you for your response. However, I am looking for a similar solution as in your ExportToExcel file, where it is possible to transfer one record to another Access database. Maybe you know where I can find such an example, or similar codes?

<p>
</p><p>The two are not comparable.&nbsp; That was achieved through file operations, but Access tables are not files.&nbsp; In any case it would be overcomplicating what can be done very simply.&nbsp; All you need to do is create a link to the target table, then create an append
 query which appends data from the form's table to the linked target table, referencing a control, which can be hidden, bound to the primary key of the form's current record as a parameter.&nbsp; This will restrict the result table of the query to a single row,
 so executing the query in the form's AfterInsert event procedure will insert the newly inserted row into the target table.

            To export data from multiple tables you have two options.&nbsp; One would be to append the result table of a query which joins the tables into a single non-normalized table in the target database.&nbsp; Using the tables in my ExportToExcel demo as an example the
 following query would append a row for the current contact in the frmContacts form to a linked table named Contacts_bak with columns ContactID, FirstName, LastName, LastName, City, Region, and Country:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Contacts_bak (ContactID, FirstName, <br />
LastName, LastName, City, Region, Country)<br />
SELECT Contacts.ContactID, Contacts.FirstName, Contacts.LastName, <br />
Contacts.Address, Cities.City, Regions.Region, Countries.Country<br />
FROM (Regions INNER JOIN (Cities INNER JOIN Contacts <br />
ON Cities.CityID = Contacts.CityID) <br />
ON Regions.RegionID = Cities.RegionID) INNER JOIN Countries <br />
ON Regions.CountryID = Countries.CountryID<br />
WHERE Contacts.ContactID = Forms!frmContacts!ContactID;<br />
<br />
The other option would be to export the rows into separate Contacts_bak, Cities_bak, Regions_bak, and Countries_bak linked tables, by executing separate append queries:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Countries_bak (CountryID, Country)<br />
SELECT Countries.CountryID, Countries.Country<br />
FROM ((Regions INNER JOIN Countries <br />
ON Regions.CountryID = Countries.CountryID) <br />
INNER JOIN Cities ON Regions.RegionID = Cities.RegionID) <br />
INNER JOIN Contacts ON Cities.CityID = Contacts.CityID<br />
WHERE Contacts.ContactID = Forms!frmContacts!ContactID;<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Regions_bak (RegionID, Region, CountryID )<br />
SELECT Regions.RegionID, Regions.Region, Regions.CountryID<br />
FROM (Regions INNER JOIN Cities ON Regions.RegionID = Cities.RegionID) <br />
INNER JOIN Contacts ON Cities.CityID = Contacts.CityID <br />
WHERE Contacts.ContactID = Forms!frmContacts!ContactID;<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Cities_bak (CityID, City, RegionID)<br />
SELECT Regions.RegionID, Regions.Region, Regions.CountryID<br />
FROM Cities INNER JOIN Contacts ON Cities.CityID = Contacts.CityID<br />
WHERE Contacts.ContactID = Forms!frmContacts!ContactID;<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Contacts_bak (ContactID, FirstName, <br />
LastName, LastName, CityID)<br />
SELECT ContactID, FirstName, LastName, Address,CityID<br />
FROM Contacts<br />
WHERE ContactID = Forms!frmContacts!ContactID;<br />
<br />
In this example the queries must be executed in the above order, i.e. a row must be inserted into the referenced table in each relationship, before inserting rows into the referencing table.&nbsp; If the relevant row already exists in any of the referenced tables
 Countries_bak and/or Regions_bak and/or Cities_bak then the query would fail due to the key violation in each case.&nbsp; The final query would succeed, however, and would reference the existing rows in the referenced tables.<br />

            You can do a number of things. e.g.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Split the database if it is not already split, and distribute the database's front end to users as a .accde file to prevent users having access to code or modifying objects.&nbsp; Regardless of this any operational database should in any case be split into front
 and back ends.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Hide the linked table(s) in the navigation pane.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Hide the navigation pane itself.&nbsp; If you do this either the use of special keys should be disabled in the database options , or the F11 key's normal behaviour should be disabled by means of a SetKeys macro which assigns some other action to it, e.g. opening
 an 'Illegal Operation' message box.&nbsp; But note that if any code in the database selects an object in the navigation pane, this will make it visible again.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Disable the by-pass key so that a user cannot open the database while holding down the Shift key to by-pass the database's opening routines.&nbsp; For a means of doing this from outside the database see Bypass.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
However, whatever you do, Access can never be a truly secure environment, and measures like the above can be subverted relatively easily by a knowledgeable user.<br />

    <title>Saving Visio Files on SharePoint Online loses Metadata - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Saving Visio Files on SharePoint Online loses Metadata</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>We are trying to save vsdx files to a SP Online library with a few columns. For some reason, when we make changes to the column data, it does not save the information correctly (all the time). There are sporadic moments when it works fine. The library is
 not using Content Types and is using list columns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found 
a thread that said there might be something special happening with visio files. Can someone from MS let me know if this is a known bug or something else?</p>

<p>Hi Krishant,</p>
<p>Thanks for your effort.</p>
<p>From the information, current situation is that:<br />
1. Other libraries works well.<br />
2. A new library created with the problematic library template has the same issue.<br />
3. New-created columns in the library works without any problems.</p>
<p>If other users encounter the same issue using the same library you mentioned, as you said, the issue seems related to the columns or the library.</p>
<p>Given the situation, you can take the options below:<br />
Option 1. Delete the problematic columns and recreate new ones.<br />
Option 2. Backup all files and save them to other libraries.</p>
<p>If it is not your case, feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Hale</p>

<h2>            Unable to print formulas properly &#40;MS Excel 2010&#41; - formulas cut off</h2>
                    
<p>I have a data sheet with very long formulas. I have turned on the "Show Formulas" button to show the formulas rather than the values. I have expanded the cells to the correct length to view the formulas. When printing (to pdf), the cells are cut shorter
 and then&nbsp;the entire formula does not show. Specifically, it is showing 557 of my total 996 characters. I cannot get the cells to wrap (as an alternate way to show the entire cell), and cannot explain why the cells are being truncated. If I print with a smaller
 scaling, the cells fit well within the page (with lots of room to spare), but are still truncated.</p>
<p>How can I get the full formulas to print? This is required to document my data sheet's validity.</p>

<p>You've done better than i have.<br />
I can't get the formula column wider than 127 (1788 pixels) which gives me just 266 characters of my formula visible.</p>
<p>I would suggest you use an alternative approach and put the formulas into a new worksheet as text and print that worksheet:<br />
<br />
Sub GetFormulasToPrint()<br />
Dim wsToShow As Worksheet<br />
Dim wsToPrint As Worksheet<br />
Dim lRow as Long<br />
Dim&nbsp;lCol as Long&nbsp;<br />
Set wsToShow = ActiveSheet<br />
Workbooks.Add xlWorksheet <br />
Set wsToPrint = ActiveSheet<br />
wsToPrint.Cells.WrapText = True<br />
wsToPrint.Columns.ColumnWidth = 32<br />
For lRow=1 To wsToShow.UsedRange.Rows.Count<br />
&nbsp; For lCol = 1 To wsToShow.UsedRange.Columns.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If wsToShow.Cells(lRow, lCol).Formula&lt;&gt;"" Then&nbsp;wsToPrint.Cells(lRow, lCol) = "'" &amp; wsToShow.Cells(lRow, lCol).Formula<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>You might want only to include formulas in which case the test would be <br />
&nbsp; If wsToShow.Cells(lRow, lCol).HasFormula<br />
<br />
Or you might prefer to make a table of address and formula so that it fits better on a page.<br />
Up to you...</p>

How can I create additional colors for MS Word's Highlight Feature?&nbsp;Of the dozen that exist, too many are too dark to be used and don't match the colors in the choices. Short of new, less saturated colors, is there some way to tweek the ones there to lighten
 them up?</p>

            Not intended to dissuade you from using Jim's toolbar :-) but unless it holds other interest for you, it really isn't needed for this specific workaround. You can get the same effect by using the
<b>Shading Color</b> button on the <b>Tables &amp; Borders</b> Toolbar or by using the
<b>Fill Color</b> button in the <b>Borders &amp; Shading </b>group of the <b>Formatting Palette</b>. Also, the button can be added to other built-in or custom toolbars of your own.<br />
<br />
I seldom recommend that workaround because it really isn't the same, although it may well satisfy your need. Some differences to consider:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>You must first select the text before choosing a color</li><li>It doesn't stay turned on the way the Highlight Tool does... It has to be explicitly applied separately to each passage</li><li>Unlike Highlighting, it cannot be toggled Off by clearing the check in Word&gt; Preferences - View - Highlight then simply turned On again later by restoring the check. Shading has to be removed, then reapplied as if for the first time</li><li>It's a bit more complicated to search the document based on Shading -- there isn't a specific option such as there is for Highlight. A Style has to be defined for each Shading Color used so the document can be searched based on the Style.</li></ul>

<h2>            How do I add narration that is timed to the right slides&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Powerpoint narration&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to make a powerpoint presentation that is completely narrated and about 15 minutes long. &nbsp;I may have a video embedded in the middle of it, which would not be narrated by me. &nbsp;I know how to add audio to individual slides where the user has to click
 on the speaker button on each slide to hear it. This needs to flow more like a video. It's actually a documentary. Pretty much over my head, but it's for a class so I have to figure it out. &nbsp;How do I add narration that is timed to the right slides? I've tried
 this before, but the problem I ran into was that I would make a mistake with my audio several slides in (like mispronouncing something, or hesitating too long) and then I'd have to start the audio recording over from the beginning. I didn't see a way to stop
 and start to correct. I know I won't be able to deliver the 15 minute audio flawlessly.</p>

            <p>If the flow of your presentation allows it, think in terms of adding a single slide's worth of audio file to each slide that requires it.&nbsp; In other words, you want time the slides to the audio rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use a program like Audacity to record the audio.&nbsp; Edit out the bloopers then export each slide's audio to a single file, then embed that into a PPT slide.&nbsp; A few add'l settings and the slide can advance automatically after the audio completes but not before.</p>

    <title>Installing Office 365 on Windows Server 2012 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Office 365 on Windows Server 2012</h2>
                    
<p>Hello fellow Microsoft users,</p>
<p>I want to install Office 365 (Enterprise E3) on a server with Windows Server 2012 as OS.<br />
The installation completes normally without any warnings or popups, but when I start one of the applications e.g. Word, I get an error message telling me that this version of Microsoft Office 2013 cannot be used on a computer with Terminal Services and the
 volume-licensing edition is recommended.</p>
<p>We want to install Office locally, only on the server (if the administrator needs to open a spreadsheet by coincidence and so that he can use OneDrive for business for example), not in the user accounts. The respective users have their own Office 365 account
 installed on their computers. So there is no use for a volume-licensing edition. How do we fix this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Samir,</p>
<p>After reading your posts, I fully understand your concerns. </p>
<p>For your terminal services enabled server, using shared computer activation for Office 365 Pro Plus deployment is the only way based on your situation. You can still keep just the admin access the Office installed on this server, and the users can just use
 the Office applications downloaded from the Office 365 portal in their own computer. that is to say, administrator and users all use their own Office suites separately. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>April</p>

<h2>            Aligning equation captions to the right without using tables impossible</h2>
                    I am an engineering student and find it rather frustrating that i cannot set equation captions aligned to the right without using tables to manipulate the outcome. Can someone give a clue to resolving this issue or do i have to live with the help of tables?<br />
<br />
By the way i am new to posing question in forums so please excuse my problem formulation if it doesn't sound understandable.<br />

            You can use tab stops for this. Set a centered tab stop for the equation and a right-aligned tab stop for the caption. Note, however, that a table is a more satisfactory approach if you plan to cross-reference the caption. When the caption is in the same
 paragraph with the equation, then a cross-reference to the caption will include the entire equation as well.

<h2>            Spell checking not working right</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spell check in PP is playing up.&nbsp; If I have a word with a capitalized first letter it ignores the first letter and spell checks the rest of the word.&nbsp; For example (real world one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Communications: it ignores the 'C' and then flags the 'ommunications' as an incorrect spelling.&nbsp; If I add a lower case 'c' and delte the 'C' its fine.&nbsp; Once I change the lower case 'c' to a 'C' it flags the same spell check problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can offer if we have people in the office who speak French and English and set the spell checking to their mother tongue.&nbsp; So the PP pack I am looking at may have started life as a English slide deck but with the spell checker set to French&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Welcome to Quebec Canada!&nbsp; Not sure if this would make any difference or explain the issue?</p>

<p><span>Hi Richard,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Recent changes made on the computer may affect the application's functionality. Just to verify, are there any changes made prior to this concern? Is this also happening
 in other Office applications? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you perform an
<strong>online repair</strong> for your Office program to fix corrupted components of the application. To do this, check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for the procedures. Once it’s finished, restart your computer and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, we recommend installing Office Update on your computer. Here’s how:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open <strong><span>Word</span></strong>, click on
<strong><span>File </span></strong>and select
<strong><span>Account</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Under <strong><span>Product Information</span></strong>, choose
<strong><span>Update Options </span></strong>and select
<strong><span>Update Now</span></strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Once the application is updated, check if the issue resolves.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’ll keep an eye out for your response.

<p>The spell checker in PowerPoint will automatically use dictionaries of the selected language, if available in the application. If you change the default language of the app, this will become the language for the current presentation and all future presentations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate your concern, we suggest that you change the language pack of the Office application to English (United States). Here's the

article </a>on how to do it. Additionally, we recommend that you change the language of your Windows computer as well to English (United States) to utilize the application. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's something I did initially but I did go back and make sure all the defaults were set to the right language.&nbsp; It did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest issue here is not the language issues.&nbsp; They are fairly obvious and solvable when you are used to dealing with them as we are.&nbsp; The issue I have never seen before is spellchecker ignoring the first capitalised letter of a word.&nbsp; That's why the
 spell checker is not working.&nbsp; Its not that the spell checker language is wrong its because the first letter is ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear If I write 'Ignored' then spell checker is highlighting the 'gnored' and saying its wrong.&nbsp; If I replace the 'I' with the 'i' it ten sees the first letter and tells me the spelling is correct.&nbsp; Change it back to 'I' and it gets ignored and flags
 it as misspelt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any ideas!</p>

<p>It’s possible that the PowerPoint spell check isn't working correctly due to its corrupted components. To further isolate your concern, we suggest that you manually uninstall and reinstall
 Microsoft Office program on your computer. To do the manually uninstall, follow the step-by-step instructions provided in this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manually-uninstall-office-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The solution will modify the registry. Serious problems may occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Prior to attempting these steps, you should
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
back up</a> the registry for restoration in case problems will occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install your Office, click <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> and log in to your Microsoft account that’s associated with your Office program. Once you logged in, click the
<strong>Install</strong> button in order to get back the program on your computer. Then, check if the issue resolves.

<p>I have this exact same problem.&nbsp; I have repaired Office, uninstalled and reinstalled Office and the problem persists.</p>
<p>I'm running Office 365 ProPlus Build 8431.2215.&nbsp; It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does start happening, it always happens until I reboot the machine, then it sometimes resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is as Richard described.&nbsp; PowerPoint ignores the first letter of the word (which is capitalised), and checks the spelling on the rest of the word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the same file on another machine, I don't get the issue, so it is something environmental on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is running Windows 10 and has had all updates applied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been happening since I first started using this machine in October last year, so it's not a new problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<h2>            Streamline The Process of Linking Excel Workbooks</h2>
                    <p>In the past, when I linked workbooks, I would be able to reference one of the open workbooks on my pc and complete the task. Now, for some reason, when I want to link a workbook to another one, windows explorer opens and have to manually navigate to the
 workbook even though it's already open. Can anyone assist me with the setting that would allow me to streamline this process and link open workbooks without having to use the windows explorer to manually navigate to the other workbook?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to do it in the past and it may seem silly but having to manually navigate to the second workbook, when I didn't have to do it before is very annoying. I'm not sure what changed but I'd like to know how to change it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi UTaylor,<br />
<br />
To clarify the situation, I would like to confirm the following information:<br />
<br />
1. The detailed steps you did to link the workbook, some screenshots would be highly appreciated.<br />
2. A screenshot of the Office version you are using. To check it, open <strong>Excel</strong>, click
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt; under <strong>Office Updates</strong>.<br />
</p>

            <p>Screenshots would show privileged information but the formulas in the spreadsheets correspond with other
 spreadsheets. When we want to change that formula and make a link to a different spreadsheet, we get the windows explorer pop up and we have to manually navigate to a spreadsheet. We didn't always have to do that. It used to automatically bring up the spreadsheets
 that are already open.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi UTaylor,<br />
<br />
We need to navigate to the file location manually in the following situation:<br />
1. When we change the link to a workbook that is not open.<br />
2. When we change the link to a workbook that is not exist or missing.<br />
<br />
I noticed that you link a <strong>.xls</strong> workbook, which is an old extension from 97-2003 Office version.
<strong>.xls</strong> and<strong> .xlsx</strong> are different. Please make sure you change the whole name correctly including the extension name.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you want to change the link to Book2<strong>.xlsx</strong> workbook, but you change the formula to =[Book2<strong>.xls</strong>]Sheet1!$C$4, but the Book2<strong>.xls</strong> workbook is not exist or missing<strong>[2]</strong>, windows
 explorer will pop up and ask you to navigate the workbook which you want. <br />
<br />
If both are not your situation, please share more detailed information with us.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Linda <br />

<p>If a Windows Explorer dialog pops out and request you to navigate, then either the link target is missing/broken, or it stems from a potential Excel bug with external link.</p>

<h2>            HTTP Tunnel and VOIP</h2>
                    <span><span>Hi
                    <span><span>Hi
 All,<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I am developing a VOIP Application, that uses PJSip to communicate over SIP channel. This application is working fine until the user is behind the proxy blocking my communication. I have searched from the different forums that there is a way called HTTP Tunneling.
 I want to ask you about:<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
- Can we achieve this through HTTP Tunneling, i.e. VOIP through HTTP Tunnel<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
- If yes then how?<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I have looked at one of the forum there was some sample code to communicate through HTTP Tunneling, in which he first make the connection with the proxy server and passes the destination address and port in the headers of the request to the proxy, the proxy
 in returns establishes the connection and return 200 code. Then there was mentioned to communicate as you want as the proxy will then act as a tunnel and doesn't filters the packet being transfered.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
Link:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.voipuser.org/ship_to.php?url=http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/i-n/internet/http/article.php/c6209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/i-n/interne
 ... php/c6209/</a><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I am bit confused about this approach, as lets suppose we have created the connection with the proxy that internally has connected with my desired destination. I am using PJSip for SIP based communication and this library takes the SIPServer address and User
 Credentials to register with the SIP server through SIP protocol. Now after response from proxy server will all the communication performed by PJSip that i.e. SIP communication will be through this HTTP Tunnel? (In my openion i dont think so, as PJSip uses
 SIP protocol to communicate with SIP Server, it creates its own connection with the SIP Server. What do you say?)&nbsp;If not the how can i tell the PJSip to use the tunnel for communication.<br />
<br />
Is there some other way to acheive this, Please guide me in this regard. Thanking in advance.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />

            <p>am having same problem--about ready to move on. spend 3x more time waiting on a response than actually using. the circle either sits there and spins or I get the message that Outlook is having a problem, try later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't use other browse--are you recommending that I use Safari or something else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>happens on 3 windows computers--not on Wife's Ipad</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have multiple Hotmail accounts--can't get satisfactory response with any of them--problem is continually getting worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have done all the restarts, cleanups, etc that I have learned to use over the last 25 yrs. any new suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have been using MSFT since IBM PS-1, but this can't go on.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem in the last few days, with more than one server. Google Chrome does the same thing with emails as Internet Explorer. I've been having it off and on since Outlook got put in- Outlook was never nessecary, and just proves itself to be
 a bloody nuisance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm having issues sending messages. Nothing will go out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night I kept sending messages out. It took forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that does is waste valuable time.</p>

<h3> voyage8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Curses with 9300 &#38;amp&#59; 9500  connection &#40;PC Suite&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time I’ve made a backup for my 9500 was probably 2 years ago. I make all transfers via BT and IRDA when needed. Mostly simple file exchange and update between phones. I remember that PC Suite was always quirky in relation to connected Communicators,
 but this what I’m experiencing at the moment is simply too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve installed completely fresh XP because my main OS is not compatible with PC Suite and there is nothing but PC suite presently on my desktop. I installed connectivity manger and after that PC Suite… but alas, 9300 and 9500 ( when each individually alone
 connected) keep jumping with dialog of looking for drivers. Even when they find them, this comes again and again. As if I am installing advanced SCSI controller in w3x environment. Just annoying. After wizard "finds" those drivers (both 9300/9500); another,
 after another sadistic "Found new hardware wizard" comes in the same fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if I stall this process for the short moment; PC Suite never can use my phones in any useful manner, which makes all of this, completely useless. All I want to do is to make 2009. Backups of both 9300 and 9500. Is that so much to ask? Please remind
 me what is that I’m clearly doing wrong here</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you configured the MSN account in Outlook or does the issue occurs on webmail?</p>
<p>If the issue occurs within the Outlook program then how it the email account configured?
</p>
<p>What happens when you try to ‘Reply/forward’ the emails?</p>
<p>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue occurs on webmail, then then it would be best if you post your query in the MSN forum link mentioned below:</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Not entirely clear as to what exactly you're asking so will take a shot based on what I think it is which in essence is - You want to use your Shaw account in the Outlook desktop program - correct?
<br />
<br />- No need to import anything 
<br />- Configure the Shaw email account in the Outlook desktop program using the 
<br /> IMAP settings found on the following page (don't believe the references to using Exchange ActiveSync are applicable anymore but don't have a Shaw account to test anything
<br />
<br />An Imap account will sync all your email folders but will not sync contact/calendar data.
<br />
<br />Setup your Phone, Tablet, or Computer with your Shaw Email Address
