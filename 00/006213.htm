<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sick of topping&nbsp;up my sons 2610 PAYG after he has been on the T-zones areas, is it possible to block his access to these facilities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm here, can&nbsp;I limit his calls/messages to the names I've added as contacts?&nbsp; Or to set&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;to make calls and text only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry new to nokia, I was hoping the user guide/instructions would cover it, no such luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just had a quick look at the 2610 manual. It is a very basic phone and doesn't seem to have any call barring functions. You could however check with your network to see if there are any network barring functions available to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I would take it back and give him one of these phones.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 and .ost and .pst files cannot be opened</h2>
                    I'm running Outlook 365 on Windows 10 along with Norton add-in.&nbsp; Since a few days ago, I cannot start Outlook due to the .pst file cannot be opened. I've read the sections on this issue and hate to think the files are corrupted. I have two .pst files and
 one .ost file. I downloaded the recovery tool and it said I've enabled the Norton tool.&nbsp; When I go into the "disable COM add-ins" I see the Norton add-ins have been disabled. And yes I have tried to enable these Norton add-ins because it does allow me to do
 so.&nbsp; Seems to me, if these add-ins cause corruption of the files, it would be advantageous for the message to pop up and say so.&nbsp; Corruption is not a nice thing to have happen. I have tried repairing and re-adding new files to no avail. Do I now uninstall
 and reinstall Outlook, delete/rename my datafiles and start over?<br />

            Hello sherryamb I'm an independent advisor willing to help
<br />
<br />you can try renaming the ost folder in 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook 
<br />
<br />rename the Outlook folder adding .old 
<br />
<br />It will create a new Outlook folder with a new Ost file 
<br />
<br />start Outlook again 
<br />

<p>I am new to Office 365 so this may sound strange, but I assume you have the Norton add-in because you run the Norton anti-Virus?&nbsp; If so, have you tried repairing that installation or removing the add-on and setting that up again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any logs that go with the Norton add-in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still learning and also just swapped over to IMAP accounts.&nbsp; Currently I have no .pst files to use, but something I have noticed on my install is if you check the Account settings, Account name and Sync settings, there is a
<em>Folder </em><em>settings - Root folder path&nbsp;</em> option.&nbsp; Even though the DATA files showed the correct path, there was no entry in this section.&nbsp; I had been having problems with unnecessary folders being added to my accounts but entering the path to the
 .ost file seems to have cleared that up.&nbsp; I do not know why, if this entry is necessary, the install did not perform this action.</p>

            Thank you for answering me. So I renamed the file by adding "old" only to now find I have to enter the password for the profile and I don't seem to have that password. so it appears I am stuck. I have used outlook forever and in the last few months I have
 been having so many issues.&nbsp; maybe its time to give up on my old friend outlook and look for a simpler email program. My email is thru ATT/Yahoo and I hate using Yahoo! &nbsp;

<p>Interestingly enough, I started working on the above two suggestions, when I was notified of an Office update. so I closed all my files and started the update, rebooted my machine and guess what, Outlook opened and began downloading my emails for both pst
 and ost files.&nbsp; so I am good to go.&nbsp; however, this was an excruciating experience. I appreciate your proposed solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say, when I renamed my files, I got a message that by doing so, I could corrupt my files. Fortunately, that did not happen.&nbsp; But it was scary&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Troubles to edit access points on headset with Symbian 9</h2>
                    I have a Nokia E61i with a last firmware. Right now I have a troubles to edit (manage) my list of access points in Connection Settings. I have a message every time when I try to load access points list from menu "Access points" like "Memory is full. Please
 close some applications and try again", but friendly speaking there's no application launched at the same time &amp; I've a batch of memory free. I did restart headset &amp; I did have access to the list, but I cannot edit/delete any od access points. After that I
 closed this menu &amp; try to open again, the result is the message above :( Any suggestion to solve this bug? Do I have a chance to manage my access points in PC Suite?

<h3> tam222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 - Navigation Pane is floating around my document and anywhere else</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My navigation pane which is normally pinned to the left hand side of any word document has suddenly become a floating pane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Navigation pane can put itself off my page outside the word document. I cannot get it to pin itself to the normal left hand position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change the viewing size of my word document I have to resize the navigation pane, this is extremely frustrating when I'm moving my laptop from an external screen on my desk to out of the office. The navigation can end up off the page and I can't locate
 it till i'm back on my laptop with the external screen attached. I'm constanly manually changing the size of my navigation pane, since it will no longer attach itself permanently inside word along the left hand side of my document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched forums and i can't find anyone reporting this problem. It started around October 16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Tamm</p>

    <title>SEQ field switch in figure caption numbering reverts back on its own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allenhudspeth  say:</h3>
<h2>            SEQ field switch in figure caption numbering reverts back on its own</h2>
                    <p>I am using automatic&nbsp;figure caption numbering in a Chapter. However, I have situations where 2 figures have the same number (Figure 1-1. &nbsp;Sheet 1 and Figure 1-1.&nbsp; Sheet 2, for example).&nbsp; So I go into the SEQ field and change the /s 1 switch to /r 1 to restart
 figure numbering at 1, then update the fields. This works well for a while, but then after I insert a few more figure captions Word (rudely without my asking) changes my /r 1 switch back to an /s 1 switch and my figure numbering is messed up. I don't know
 what is causing this behavior or how to prevent it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not acceptable. Can someone tell me how to keep this from happening? Do I have to use the /r 1 switch on all the figure captions downstream from the initial use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Allen</p>

            As I wrote, Word will enforce the settings in the Caption dialog box. What you can do is insert a cross-reference to the label and number of the caption that should be repeated.

<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions/input is appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Home Media Server software for Windows Vista</h2>
                    I have tried to install Home Media Server under Windows Vista OS so far it is installed perfectly but when I try to connect my NOkia ( N80IE ) via wlan it is not connected. Is there any specific Home Media Sever software for Windows Vista?... When checked
 in the Windows vista I found that Home Media Server software is indicated as "not classified sofware". Is that the reason why it is not connected or the Home Media Server software that is provided with the Nokia software CD is not compatible with Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Any body has some ideas of this problem???.......<br />

            Hello!<br />
<br />
I just manage to run Home Media Server Software in Windows Vista when I update Windows Vista recently. But still I have some comments to Home Media Server Software that it does not support MP4 and 3GP which are the only formats available to capture video(movies)in
 Nokia N80ie. Therefore either Home Media software has to add additional format MP4 and 3GP to execute video or Movies capture by the Nokia or Nokia has to add other formats of video formats in the cell phone which is supported by the Home Media server software
 to make it compatible.<br />

<p>Hi MisterJuice1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One possible problem is that the file that you converted is on HD quality that has resolutions - 1080p (1920x1080) or 720p (1280x720) which the X6 does not support for playback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The maximum is 640 x 480 (30 fps) on the following formats - 3GPP (H.263), Flash Video, H.264/AVC, MPEG-4, RealVideo 7,8, WMV 9.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are you sure above file types can play on X6? on my 5800 doesn't play H.264/AVC, RealVideo 7,8 and WMV9. can play only MPEF-4 and 3GPP</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the spec sheet says, I stand by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H.264 AVC is under MPEG-4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RealVideo is an .RSTP file which is mainly used in streaming using the RealVideo player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newer S60 3rd (post N82) and S60 5th phones have both capability for WMV9 playback - with Native codec only.</p>

<p>@Milesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only native H264/AVC codec will work with the 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.RMV are files which are viewed via streaming over network.</p>

<h2>            Macros and ctrl&#43;s</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I created some macros in Word 2007 and lost ctrl+s and ctrl+c. I deleted all the macros, and ctrl+s and ctrl+c still don't work. They do work in all my other Office applications and anywhere else I want to use them.</p>
<p>How can I get them back into Word?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>There is probably no relation between the macros and the loss of the<br />
shortcuts, unless the macro was programmed to change keybindings --<br />
and there is no way to record that.</p>
<p>You can put back the shortcuts the same way you would create new ones,<br />
through the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog:</p>
<p>- Click the Office button, click Word Options, click the Customize tab<br />
of the options dialog, and click the Keyboard Shortcuts Customize<br />
button at the bottom. <br />
- Click "Office Menu" in the Categories list. Then click FileSave in<br />
the Commsnds list. Click in the "Press new shortcut key" box and type<br />
Ctrl+S. Then click the Assign button at the bottom left.</p>
<p>- Click "Home Tab" in the Categories list. Then click EditCopy in the<br />
Commands list. Click in the "Press new shortcut key" box and type<br />
Ctrl+C. Then click the Assign button at the bottom left.</p>
<p>- Click the Close button.</p>

</p><p>Hello Dominique,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay in response.<br />
<br />
In order to further isolate the issue I would request you to please perform the below steps for users who cannot upload files in yammer.<br />
<br />
1) Type and Size of the file which there are trying to upload in yammer.<br />
2) Error message when the user uploads a file in yammer<br />
3) Step by step screenshots while adding the file to a yammer group.<br />
4) Did the user try to upload a file in yammer outside company network or using a mobile data or Wifi connection<br />
5) Temporary turn off the Firewall settings on the end user machine and check if the user is able to upload the file<br />
6) Please add the filescdn.yammer.com to firewall settings and trusted sites in Internet explorer.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.<br />
</p>
<p><br />

            I think Power Query is a Windows only feature and is not available for the Mac. Macros and add-ins do not run in the cloud environment and only run on the desk top versions of Excel.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;November 2015 release&#41; shows two OneDrive clients -- very confusing&#59; how to get rid of one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 (November 2015 release) shows two OneDrive clients -- very confusing. One is the retail "personal aka Sky Drive" and the other is the business class One Drive for Business client which integrates with our Office 365 cloud deployment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to get rid of the retail one? Is it possible? This gets really confusing for the end user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Boyan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’d like to explain that the "retail one " you mentioned is OneDrive Next Generation Sync client which is separate app built in Windows 10 system. It’s the newest OneDrive
 Sync client which is more stable and reliable than OneDrive for business. Please refer to this article:
</span><span style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Get
 started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Windows</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is no need to uninstall one of them since the two OneDrive sync client could co-exist in one computer. You could use OneDrive Next Generation Sync Client to sync OneDrive
 library which is faster and more powerful and use the previous OneDrive for business client to sync SharePoint library. Here is an article for your reference:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Transition-from-the-previous-OneDrive-for-Business-sync-client-4100df3a-0c96-464f-b0a8-c20de34da6fa?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Transition from the previous OneDrive for Business sync
 client</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more details, please refer to:

            <p>Hi Boyan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About which OneDrive sync client is newer, it depends. (For example: The Win 10 OS version, Office 2016 Pro Plus version etc.) In most cases, it will be the one with Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, we can check the OneDrive version via right click the cloud icon from taskbar and choose Settings &gt; About</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c8f89a2-6ee8-49fd-9329-74dfe850e41d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c8f89a2-6ee8-49fd-9329-74dfe850e41d" /></a></p>

            <p>While this solution may not work for your situation, I simply 'hid' the one with significantly less storage space leaving only OneDrive for Business&nbsp;to easily save to.&nbsp; After countless hours, I found it impossible to actually remove the non-business drive
 because it is linked to the PC itself and the&nbsp;particular sign-in used, while Drive for Business&nbsp;is created apart from the PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, drive for business cannot become the primary so my PC views it as an add-on; which seems to describe your case as well since it views as an additional Drive Storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the one you want to remove, 'properties', hidden.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17fa6330-52d5-4ec7-89fa-33f388101024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17fa6330-52d5-4ec7-89fa-33f388101024" height="264" width="288" /></a></p>
<p>(more information to hopefully save someone else the headache and confusion)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After days of tinkering, I ended up with 11 different sources for both Drives before just reformatting the PC.&nbsp; My issues started with incompatibility between Unix/Windows during FTP with same named files and spin-balled once I installed Google's Drive desktop
 client&nbsp;for PC as well.&nbsp; I only realized later that my @university.edu (where I get my TB OneDrive for Business) had also been created as a personal account (an identical @university.edu with identical password), but is set to the current 5GB (I think) limit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a choice is given between 5GB and 1TB, it seems obvious- but the account that provides the terabyte for me (OneDrive for Business) cannot be used solo- meaning I MUST use an additional Microsoft account to log in (OneDrive) before ever accessing the Business
 OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Permissions set by the Administrator became an issue as well in OneDrive for Business because it is set to NOT be shareable/viewable by anyone outside the organization.&nbsp; What good is a terabyte of data if you have to download a file then re-upload it (resulting
 in multiple versions if collaborating) to share?&nbsp; I tried manually changing the authorized users via x86 properties, so now while viewing a folder in OneDrive Business&nbsp;is says "shared with ___" but they cannot actually access it still because they are outside
 the organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another caveat I found is&nbsp;OneDrive automatically begins a structure for auto uploading&nbsp;documents, music,&nbsp;and pictures; which is helpful especially if you just have one OneDrive account, but gets overly complicated in these situations.&nbsp; The personal OneDrive
 (which only says 'OneDrive') follows you from device to device so you don't lose pictures or music- the media player uses and pulls automatically from here (Groove via Microsoft).&nbsp; OneDrive for Business does not- it's more of a USB storage in the sense that
 if I want&nbsp;access to anything in my terabyte cloud I&nbsp;have to manually access it, and open&nbsp;the file that way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive for Business is secondary storage to OneDrive- because everyone can have OneDrive, but not all have a OneDrive for Business.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution to this Microsoft mess is to keep music only in OneDrive (about 450 song limit-&nbsp;I rotate around) and for files I don't want to keep like the above screenshot.&nbsp; Anything permanent I move to OneDrive for Business which doubles as my music master
 storage (and master storage for any/all data, because its a terabyte after all) and pictures I keep in Google photos for&nbsp;easy access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After December&nbsp;I plan on giving Microsoft the permanent boot because its 'universal for everyone' platform causes headaches for those who have to have more fluidity, multiple accounts, or more personalization.

            <p>Hi Boyan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get rid of the “OneDrive”, you can make it through <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-off-or-uninstall-OneDrive-f32a17ce-3336-40fe-9c38-6efb09f944b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article</a>. And I suggest you do <strong>Hide OneDrive in Windows 10</strong> first and then follow the steps in
<strong>Disable OneDrive in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Vinson<br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />
<br />How to insert a picture in the header or the footer
<br />To insert a picture into the header or the footer of a worksheet, use one of the following methods.
<br />Method 1: Microsoft Office Excel 2007
<br />Start Excel.
<br />Click the Insert tab.
<br />Click Header &amp; Footer in the Text group.
<br />Click the area inside the header or footer where you want to add the picture.
<br />On the Design tab, click Picture under Header &amp; Footer Tools in the Header &amp; Footer Elements group.
<br />Locate and select the picture that you want to insert, and then click Insert. The text &amp;[Picture] will appear where the picture is positioned.
<br />Method 2: Microsoft Office Excel 2003
<br />Start Excel.
<br />On the Viewmenu, click Head and Footer.
<br />Click Custom Header or Custom Footer (depending on where you want to add the picture).
<br />Click anywhere in the Left section box, the Center section box, or the Right section box.
<br />On the row of buttons in the Header or the Footer dialog boxes, click Insert Picture, and then find the graphic that you want to insert.
<br />Double-click the graphic.
<br />Click OK two times.
<br />How to improve the appearance of a worksheet that contains a picture in the header or in the footer
<br />Use one of the following methods to improve the appearance of the worksheet and to make sure that all the data is displayed:
<br />Increase the header margin by dragging the margin indicators that appear on the screen.
<br />Change the size of the picture.
<br />How to change the size of the picture
<br />To change the size of the picture, use one of the following methods:
<br />Method 1: Microsoft Office Excel 2007
<br />Click the header or the footer that contains the picture that you want to adjust.
<br />Click any location inside the &amp;[Picture] text.
<br />Click the Design tab under Header &amp; Footer Tools.
<br />Click Format Picture in the Header &amp; Footer Elements group.
<br />Type .5in the Height box.
<br />
<br />Note Because both the Lock aspect ratio and the Relative to original picture size check boxes are selected, the width changes in proportion to the change that you make in the Height box.
<br />Click OK to close the Format Picture dialog box.
<br />Method 2: Microsoft Office Excel 2003
<br />On the Viewmenu, click Head and Footer.
<br />Click Custom Header or Custom Footer.
<br />Click any where in the &amp;[Picture] text.
<br />Click the Format Picture button.
<br />Click to clear the Height check box, and then type .5in the Height box.
<br />
<br />Because both the Lock aspect ratio and the Relative to original picture size check boxes are selected, the width changes in proportion to the change that you make in the Height box.
<br />Click OK three times.
<br />Note If you decide to move the picture to another section of the header or the footer after you have positioned and formatted it, you can copy and paste the code &amp;[Picture], but you must select the picture again and reformat it if you do so.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />

    <title>MS Project can&#39;t load level after resources are less than 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisholl  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project can&#39;t load level after resources are less than 100&#37; available</h2>
                    <p>Project load leveling is not doing what I think it should do.&nbsp; I create a new project and add a single task.&nbsp; I assign resource "A" and set work to 8 hours.&nbsp; The duration of the fixed-work, effort-driven task&nbsp;is a day.&nbsp; I can load level.&nbsp; No problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I find out that I only have A half-time.&nbsp; I go into the resource sheet and change A's max percent available to 50%.&nbsp; Of course, A is now over allocated.&nbsp; I load level.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I expect is that the duration doubles from 1 day to 2 days.&nbsp; Instead I get an error that "This overallocation cannot be resolved."&nbsp;&nbsp;Are my expectations completely wrong?&nbsp; Changing the task to Fixed Units does nothing for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I consider a workaround is to go the task and change A's allocation to 50%, but shouldn't&nbsp;Project automatically do that?&nbsp; Actually, just clicking on the task Resource Name&nbsp;cell and hitting return sets the resource to 50%.&nbsp; But imagine doing this with
 a large project of hundreds of tasks and dozens of resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <p>Where you say "I can load level", what exactly do you mean by that?</p>
<p>If you only have one task with a resource assigned at 100%, and max units is 100%, then there is no over-allocation, so no reason to level, and no change occurs if you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSP will not change the assignment of the resource just because you change the max units.</p>
<p>The reason is that the software cannot know that is what you want to do, having already been told that you want the resource assigned at 100% (of availability).</p>
<p>The default assignment is always max units if max units is less than 100%, and 100% if max units is greater than 100%. If you set max units to 50% before you assign the resource, the assignment will be 50%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Max units is just a threshold setting so MSP can know if the resource is over-allocated (or not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Max units plays no part in the Work = effort x duration calculation involving the task type and effort driven settings. Whatever the task type and effort driven combination, if you change work, or effort (ie assignment units), or duration you will see a
 change in one of the other two variables but not both.</p>
<p>But you are not changing any of those three variable, only max units, but max units is not involved in W = E x D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that the over-allocation cannot be resolved is because there is only one task with a resource assigned at more than its max units, so MSP has no tasks to delay, which is all levelling does.</p>
<p>Levelling does not change assignments.</p>
<p>If I have any of this incorrect, we can be sure that John, Julie or Rod will be onto it straightaway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Regarding your last para, I can see that you are dropping the resource cell drop down list and selecting the resource and hitting enter, but this is the same as using the assign resources dialog, removing the assignment and re-making the assignment as a
 new assignment, rather than an edit to an existing assignment, so naturally the new default assignment is at max units.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It it not hard to imagine fixing numerous assignments, and not much of a problem since I have done it many times, and there are fast ways to do it, but your method is probably the slowest and hardest.</p>
