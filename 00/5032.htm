<h2>            Mail merging emails in Office 2016 for MAC</h2>
                    When mail merging email using Office 2016 for MAC emails are not sending and are being stored in the Drafts folder in Outlook.&nbsp; We have attempted to use the solutions for sending that have previously been posted however they do not work for us.&nbsp; At this
 time we are unable to send them from the Drafts folder as well.&nbsp; We have also followed all of the appropriate steps for the mail merge process and are using the same version of word, excel and outlook - 2016 for MAC.&nbsp; Has anyone found a resolution to this?

    <title>17063&#58; Recovery Drive Creator App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            17063&#58; Recovery Drive Creator App</h2>
                    <p>It seems nonsensical to me in this day and age of multi-Terabyte hard drives, Terabyte SSD's, and 128 Gigabyte plus USB Thumb drives to have a Recovery Drive creator that cannot limit itself to a reasonable sized partition on any of the afore mentioned drives,
 but must instead wipe the entire host drive, then eke out and format it's own tiny partition and leave the rest of the entire drive unallocated...partitions intact, but wiped and unallocated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Case in point...my testbed has a 750GB System SATA3 Drive for the build of the week and docs, Apps, etc.&nbsp; There is a second 150GB SATA2 drive also.&nbsp; It is used for organized storage of MS software, ISO's, 3rd party software etc. needed to rebuild in the
 case of a needed wipe and clean install of the system drive and recreating the OS again as was. &nbsp; Anyway, my little geek angel whispered in my ear that it might be a good idea to copy the Storage folders from the second partition to a 128GB Thumb Drive I have,
 so I did....BEFORE I ran Recovery Drive Creator.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; They warn the drive will be erased...BUT...the creator popped right up with both partitions to choose from, I highlighted the Recovery partition.&nbsp; All looked good and I felt a little better thinking maybe
 the Tech Writer used drive and meant partition after all.&nbsp; I hit next.&nbsp; It took forever.&nbsp; It completed successfully.&nbsp; My Recovery Drive (partition) was listed in 'This PC' at 32GB just as I created it for Recovery Drive and named 'Recovery'.&nbsp; My Storage Drive
 (partition) was missing from 'This PC'.&nbsp; I found it in Computer Management, partition intact as originally sized, but now marked unallocated....toast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted a suggestion in FBH to re-write the program to target partitions instead of whole drives.&nbsp; I can't imagine how PO'ed someone is going to get when they blithely use the program and format a whole hard drive, SSD, or a large multi partitioned USB
 thumb drive or external drive.&nbsp; Am I mad?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I took a chance.&nbsp; I have a whole rice bowl full of USB thumb drives, 4, 8, and 16GB in size, but they're all tied up with installers, ISO's and bootable tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one that thinks the Recovery Drive creator should be made more realistic and flexible?&nbsp; I like the idea it can see and write to hard drives as well as USB drives and thumb drives.&nbsp; I DON"T like that it demands the entire drive, no matter which.&nbsp;
 Seems half-baked.&nbsp; The FBH post is at&nbsp;https://aka.ms/Gloait.&nbsp; What do you folks think?</p>

            Somebody needs to seriously go through Windows 10 and remove the still resident but deprecated back up options and no longer working system image utilities.&nbsp; All that will be left are the bootable thumb drive with current or last versions burnt to them
 or 3rd party repair tools.&nbsp; The "Restore Drive" creator is like using a 4 pound maul on a finishing nail.&nbsp; If it is to remain viable, it will have to be refined IMHO.&nbsp; I am so tired of having to fetch thumb drives for this, that, and the other thing.&nbsp; I have
 a bowl full of them tied up with one thing or another on them.&nbsp; Too bad we can't duct tape them together and get a SSD out of the deal.&nbsp; 😉

<h2>            Saving pics on my lumina 1020phone.</h2>
                    When I take a pic&lt; everything seems fine. flash works. shutter clicks. when it goes to save the pic, saving just keeps blinking for a bit. then the camera freezes. I have to reboot the phone to get back to normal. The selfie front camera works just great,
 My question is.&nbsp; could there be a fix, or should I replace the camera?

<h2>            OOTB Blog Archive not working, data not listing properly</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently migrated a site (using Blog site template) to new SPO tenant. We've noticed that blog archive web part displaying incomplete data (i.e months from the date of migration).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, Source Site was created 5-6 months ago, and the Blog Archive Web PArt showing last 5-6 months. BUT the target site showing only 2 months (current and previous month) it was created last month)</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the images attached. Kindly help.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1d7d7de-4085-49c5-9270-d85a46ff85be?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1d7d7de-4085-49c5-9270-d85a46ff85be?upload=true" /></a></p>

<span>Hi Kannan,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Did you migrate the blog site from SharePoint on-prem to SharePoint online?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>On the migrated blog post, if you go to <strong>Posts</strong> list in
<strong>Site</strong> <strong>content</strong>, you’ll see all your older posts.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Neha</span></p>

            The obvious answer would be when you migrated the blog, posts acquired new created/published dates. Have you checked that?<br />

<p>The SPO blog functionality is very poorly made and easy to break. When you click a month, does the filtering work or do you see all posts? It could be the web part is broken........</p>
<p>If you want to rebuild the archive web part see this:</p>

            I dont think there is a need to share tenant details, as it was reported similar error in a trial site. OOTB Blog WEb Part is not considering the date of posts for listing, instead it is referring the list creation date i guess. Can you please confirm
 it?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Event id 141, NTFS - Need to figure out which hard drive is causing these errors</h2>
                    <p>For the last few builds (now on 14295), I have been getting a bunch of these errors in the Event log. The description says:</p>
<p>{Delayed Write Failed} Windows was unable to save all the data for the file \Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy<strong>65</strong>\$BitMap; the data has been lost. This error may be caused if the device has been removed or the media is write-protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The number in bold changes each time. Is there a way to figure out which hard drive is causing these errors? I don't see any other errors that look to be related to those. None of my drives are write protected and I haven't removed any of them for awhile
 now.</p>
<p>This hasn't been causing any problem that I can see, but, I like to have a fairly clean event log so that real problems can be spotted easily.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled this error, but none of the posts I see match my situation and there really aren't that many hits for that event id. Any ideas would be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>These errors come at all times of the day, usually there is a bunch of them, then I may not have any more for a few hours. It is not affecting any system operations that I can see and they are coded as Warning messages, not errors. I routinely look at the
 event viewer to see if there are any new problems that I might be able to fix. It isn't my C: drive (Samsung 850 EVO). It's firmware is the latest and I have run chkdsk c: /r to check for bad sectors and there were none. Here is my disk management screen.

Primary or test build 14295 is still Beta and with that many hard drives it just might be tasking the system, but it's worth noting in Feedback. I've been using the Preview build on my everyday system since day one and it has had very few hiccups, except for
 to-day as I've lost all of the tiles on the start and settings, have done anything with it yet, what I have found that works the best when problems pop up that can't be fixed using what I find on here or the Web, is a "clean" install.

            <p>Hay...that's a monster machine...thanks for sharing the pictures...I just expanded a 'Recovery partition' to make it another primary partition and it worked and I installed another version of Windows 8.1...I already have five different Windows 10&nbsp; ...all
 have no errors...but the new system which I just installed ran into a start up problem after a restart...so I am going to figure out what's happened there...anyways ..each system is separate from the other so when one is running and receives an error of some
 sort then that would come from the current system in use and not any other drive,,,so you got to look into the drive being used @ the time of the error occurring...?...that's what I think...sorry I only have two hard drives heh...say if you believe it's build
 14295 then re-install it...if you did not make any ISO's then the latest <a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=12&amp;ct=1459645476&amp;rver=6.5.6509.0&amp;wp=MBI&amp;wreply=https:%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindowsinsiderpreviewiso&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=74335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            This may only be repeating what you already know, but the folder is most likely to be one inside the System Volume Information for one of the drives, which is where System Restore hides its magic.&nbsp; The changing number probably refers to a restore point.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The SVI folder is protected to such an extent that I have so far declined to force W10 to let me see inside.&nbsp; Without seeing any such log entries on my PC, I can't help with which drive it refers to, but you could try a disk cleanup on all drives, perhaps
 turning off Sys Restore, then turning it on again, which should clear all old data.<br />

            <p>had this problem back with 98 (a lot).</p>
<p>I defragged all my drives&nbsp;to fixed it. but it keeps popping up. but after a re-install it went away.</p>
<p>so it can be a couple of things like config errors or a virus. sometimes it can be something simple like security, mcafee can cause this as well, one reason i don't use it..&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Trying to create a wireframe from Template in Visio 2016 according to this article:</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/use-wireframe-templates-to-design-websites-and-mobile-apps-2d54dc55-f5c4-49a2-85da-d649eb7fc281</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, after selecting the Wireframe - Website option there are no starter diagrams.</p>
<p>When creating a new Blank Diagram the stencils don't appear either</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your help and support on the following situation.</p>
<p>My mother passed away recently and i found her selfie as a background picture on Samsung Ativ S &nbsp;GT-i8750 model run on Windows Phone 8.0.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my mother didn't save the picture on the phone storage, but i really need to download it as i want to print it out on photo paper and put it in the frame as a memory of her.</p>
<p>I tried to browse the picture through the folders of the phone and i can't find it, so i believe this picture is saved somewhere in the phone restricted or isolated location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care about the phone, but this picture is really important to me, as Samsung Service center in Latvia couldn't help me, maybe you can help me on my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Edgars</p>

<h2>            All my text disappeared in Word 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    Please help. &nbsp;I have put together a newsletter using a Microsoft template (the original template was in XP for PC then 2 months ago I got a mac and converted it over). &nbsp;Most of the layout has been done in text boxes. &nbsp;I save diligently and did so last
 night before bed. &nbsp;This morning, I restarted my computer just to freshen it up a bit and every single word of text in my 25 page document (but for the 2 pages I added right before bed last night) were gone. &nbsp;Almost all the pictures were gone as well, with
 the exception of 2 ads at the end of the doc. &nbsp;Where did my text/pics go and is there a way to recover them?

            Hey Erin,
<div><br />
<div>
<div>If text is randomly disappearing, you might have some duplicate fonts causing issues. One of our awesome Office for Mac MVPs, John McGhie, wrote the following steps that explain how to "weed your fonts":</div>

<div><br />
<div>I'd highly recommend trying the steps there and then see if your issue still occurs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            <p>The phone has to have Miracast support to work with the HD-10.</p>
<p>The 1020 does not have this. I think the only phone that shipped with 8.0 that does is the 1520.</p>
<p>Most of the new 8.1 phones support Miracast.</p>

<h3> martijn de vrieze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2016 on Win10 crashes the moment I go to the &#34;File&#34; tab</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 32 bit (virtual) machine, connected to Azure AD. Office 2016 clean installed as part of an Office365 business package. OneDrive for Business is installed and synced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a powerpoint presentation, change things, hit the "save and sync" button. Everything works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The moment I hit the File tab however the following happens (and no, I do not get a clearer message telling me what happened).&nbsp;<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85c46ef8-c1a3-4526-8489-f55b78869b1f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it "collects" info, this info than disappears into /dev/null I suspect.&nbsp;<br />
Once it is done with this dialogue I get the following:&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Any tips on how to resolve this are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things tried already: Reset Win10 and reinstall Office. Reinstall office without reset. Uninstall and then reinstall. non of them made a different.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Linking Outlook Appointment to OneNote</h2>
                    .....When I schedule an Outlook meeting in Office 2010 and link it to "Onenote" I have several problems. 1) If I save and close the appointment then go back and add notes in the calendar, then click "Onenote", the additional notes don't show in OneNote.
 2) And, If I set &nbsp;a reminder in the calendar, then click on "OneNote", then go back to my calendar, it turns it into a weekly series reminder instead of a single reminder. Can you help please?

                    I have stuff saved on a separate drive, Drive D so for example pictures are in D\Pictures now for some reason when saving a picture though still in drive D it's in D\username\Pictures which I don't want. Checking storage settings still has pictures saved
 to drive D\Pictures but now wants to save in D\username\Pictures instead. Didn't ask for a user folder in my D drive to begin with. Just ended up deleting the user folder on my D drive as there was no other way to properly get the stuff to save correctly as
 it has been before this update

            Hi. sassy.gal
<br />My name is Ben
<br />Independent Advisor
<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	Before you start troubleshooting, determine if you can connect to the Internet.
<br />
<br />	There opens the Mail Settings dialog:
<br />
<br />1. Click Start, click Run, type Control in the Open box, and then click OK.
<br />
<br />2. Depending on the version of Windows running on your computer, follow one of these procedures:
<br />
<br />• Windows 10: If you are in the category view, click User Accounts, and then click mail. If you are not in the category view, double-click on mail.
<br />
<br />• Windows Vista, Xp, or earlier versions: Click User Accounts, and then click Mail.
<br />3. Open the Mail Settings dialog box.
<br />
<br />	After this, set the default profile:
<br />
<br />1. In the mail dialog box, in the When starting Microsoft Outlook box, use this profile, click to select the new profile.
<br />
<br />2. Click on OK.
<br />
<br />3. Use Outlook to send you an email.

            Dear sassy.gal, 
<br />
<br />So which Outlook you are using? Or which email client?
<br />
<br />From your title I had a feeling that you are using Office Outlook 2013.
<br />
<br />If you are using Outlook.com, you can find lots of suggestions for sending and receiving issues and fixes in this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-outlook-com-email-sync-issues-d39e3341-8d79-4bf1-b3c7-ded602233642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-ou...</a>
<br />
<br />If you set up rules for those emails, they might be moved to a different folder. You may use built in search and try to find them by using AQS (Advanced Query Search) <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search-mail-and-people-in-outlook-com-88108edf-028e-4306-b87e-7400bbb40aa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/search...</a>

            Dear sassy.gal, 
<br />
<br />By credentials they mean your valid email address and password.
<br />
<br />However, I am confused about the version of your Outlook. Please share the screenshot of that pop up. This will help to identify the correct product. In this thread you will find tips on how to insert screenshot into message <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            You must have Office. You said you're using Outlook 2013. That's part of Office. Please state your Windows version and who provides your mail service. Tell us what type of account (POP, IMAP, or Exchange) you have configured.

            Dear sassy.gal, 
<br />
<br />Your screenshot looks like for Microsoft Office Outlook and says about the profile. You say that you do not have Office installed ? I am confused
<br />
<br />In order to help you with your problem please provide answers to those questions
<br />1. What is your device and OS 
<br />2. What Office are you using. You can check it using this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-...</a> for guidance 
<br />3. How exactly was account set up (IMAP or POP)
<br />4. Who is your mail provider ? Please write the domain, domain comes after @, for example @outlook.com
<br />5. Can you access your account in webmail and see/send emails ?

<h2>            s0.2mdn.net</h2>
                    <p>Spam is being auto sent from my MSN account in Outlook 2010. I've run Microsoft Security Essentials and Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p>
<p>They find nothing. (I'm running a Dell PC with Windows 7&nbsp;Ultimate and Office 2010.)&nbsp;I updated MSE each time before running it, and downloaded MS Safety Scanner before each use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got this message when opened&nbsp;an HMTML file in IE9 this morning:</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Adobe Flash Player has stopped a potentially unsafe operation.
</p>
<p>The following local application of your computer or network:</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>mhtm…\5448462b374c454v48556f414278416e?;pc=OAS_12201135;ord=265333237?</p>
<p>Is trying to communicate with this Internet-enabled location:</p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>s0.2mdn.net</p>
<p>To let this application communicate with the internet, click Settings. You must restart the application after changing your settings.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>I clicked Settings but nothing happened. Nothing opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next Problem: When I registered IE10 later today, I had to change my MSN password because of an unknown-to-me entry--"work-something", which I deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to register IE10 Clipboard but when I entered my MSN email address, got message: "Somebody is already using that email address" and could NOT register.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More spam email&nbsp;was being sent from Outlook after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd very much appreciate help with this.</p>
