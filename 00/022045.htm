<h2>            Relative Links in Onenote 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am using One Note 2007 to save my computer&nbsp;lessons that I teach. I save the entire notebook onto a portable drive that I can carry with me and put into a computer in any room. This is great for portablilty and I don't have to rely on a network connection
 to get my lessons going. Each page in the notebook&nbsp;has a number of hyperlinks to other files (pictures,movies, sound,etc) on the portable drive.</p>
<p>I am having troubles with the hyperlinks because I seem to only be able to put in aboslute hyperlinks to these media objects. When the drive plugged into various machines, the drive letter changes depending on the number of internal disks the machine has.
 This renders the links useless. &nbsp;I would like to change all of the absolute hyperlinks to relative based&nbsp;on the active notebook directory. Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found a trick that works in 2010, so I'd imagine this also works in 2007.&nbsp; On the page, type<strong>"file:</strong><em>relativepath</em><strong>"</strong> and it should automatically create a hyperlink to the file.&nbsp; Do include quotes around the&nbsp;link or
 else files with spaces in their name won't work.&nbsp; Remember to use&nbsp;<strong>..\</strong> to go up one folder (notebooks&nbsp;and section groups are folders).&nbsp; In Vista and Windows 7 if you hold the Shift key and right-click a file in Windows Explorer, a hidden command
 "Copy as path" will appear: select this and Paste it into OneNote to get you started.&nbsp; Then prepend
<strong>file:</strong> to this path (inside the quotes) and fix the relative path with<strong>..\</strong> as needed.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to link to&nbsp;"D:\Pictures\image.jpg" and your notebook is "D:\Notebooks\Lessons".&nbsp; Your relative link will be "file:..\..\Pictures\image.jpg".&nbsp;&nbsp;The first<strong>..\</strong> gets out of Lessons, the second gets out of Notebooks.&nbsp;
 If your Lessons notebook has a section group named "CSE 101" and you want your link in here, you'll need a third<strong>..\</strong> to also&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;the section group.&nbsp; That means these links will break if you move pages into section groups of different
 hierarchical levels.</p>
<p><strong>Do not use the hyperlink dialog!&nbsp; Do not use Ctrl+K!</strong>&nbsp; As soon as you use the hyperlink dialog, OneNote will try to be "smart" and convert it to a UNC server or&nbsp;http path, which of course won't work.&nbsp; That means you can't assign friendly
 names to these links - you're stuck with the filepath, but hey, it works.</p>

Maybe this is an ignorant question, but won't you have to do this on each machine you plug the drive into?&nbsp; And don't you need Administrator priveledges to use Computer Management?

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have a similar but somewhat different issue relating to Onenote and Windows 7 (and from my reading this seems to have been the case with Vista as well). Actually, this problem affects both myself and my partner. It relates to the relative path name and
 manual naming as a link rather than the CTRL-K dialogue box (and BTW, thanks for the info on that - it always annoyed my that once gone in through the box I couldn't edit the path it seemed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can imagine the problem that I am going to describe as soon as I mention that my partner in particular has<strong>hundreds</strong> (if not thousands) of absolute links to documents that are located beneath "My Documents" - from XP!! Uh-oh ... Windows
 7 has reorganised and renamed the path to there, as well as changing "My Documents" to "Documents" (which has screwed up my backups across machines, so any hot tips on how to get around that one would be appreciated as well - same problem really). Therefore,
 this is what I face with hyperlinks in Onenote 2007:</p>
<p>Under XP: &lt;file://C:\Documents and Settings\(Insert Account Name here)\My Documents\Folder\Folder\Folder\file.pdf&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Windows 7: &lt;file://C:\Users\(Insert Account Name here)\Documents\Folder\Folder\Folder\file.pdf&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp; <em><strong>none of the old hyperlinks work!!!!</strong> </em>Surely we can't be the only suckers who have encountered this problem. We can't feasibly go around manually changing every link to a relative path (and damn into eternity M$ for not
 having a "make path relative" checkbox/default option in the dialogue), and do we all need to dust off our VB hats and whip up some global search and replace script? I think not!</p>
<p>I have scoured the web to find some clues about this renaming malarkey, but have found very little. Some of it can't even have been prevented with a "forewarned" element. I know about the old "renaming folders" and "changing the location of My Documents
 (etc)", none of which deals with backups across OS's (ie having Win7 and XP machines), and the backup software detecting "changes" in files - specifically, the "newer" version of a OneNote workbook, whose references will be necessarily different under each
 OS.</p>
<p>Oh do please have the knowledge to make upgrading OS's a dream rather than the apparent nightmare it is becoming...!</p>
<p>Thanks so much,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B-)</p>

<h2>            Multiple alert tones</h2>
                    
<p>I converted from an old samsung i600 to a Motorola Q. The samsung would periodically beep if I had an email, voice mail, or text message. The Q only beeps, (alerts) once just after the message is left. The samsung
 on the other hand would beep (alert) about every 15-30 seconds until the message was acknowledged. Does anyone know if a similar setting or "sound" is available to send such an alert on the Q.</p>
<p>Any help or ideas would be awesome&gt;</p>

<h2>            Creating mailboxpolicy from existing one and some parameters are not found</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm just trying to clone our default mailbox policy by comparing the parameters and setting them up in a blank policy (simply to tweak one or two setting for staff that I don't want students to have) however there are three parameters I cannot setup:</p>
<p>UNCAccessOnPublicComputersEnabled,</p>
<p>UNCAccessOnPrivateComputersEnabled,</p>
<p>SMimeEnabled</p>
<p>They are all set to False in my default policy but to True in my blank one that I'm tweaking but I don't seem to be able to change these. When I use Set-OWAMailBoxPolicy -Identity
<em>newpolicy </em>-SMimeEnabled for example I get an error saying 'A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'SMimeEnabled' But I know it exists as I exported the list of owamailbox policies into a csv and they are there.</p>
<p>My main question is do I have to worry about these? - If they are false in our default policy but true in the new one?</p>
<p>Any advice or a little lesson what these three parameters do and why I cannot change them would be gratefully received,</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            <p>Another Reply apparently is from someone using a Windows version of the program... and I have no idea why there's any reason to bring the use of Tables into the picture :-) In order to restore the
<strong>A,B,C</strong>... column headings in <em>Mac Excel 2011</em>, go to <strong>
Excel&gt; Preferences&gt; General</strong>, then clear the check on <em><strong>Use R1C1 reference style</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: You can write the formulas with either method in use. It's just that with the
<strong>R1C1</strong> style you need to write the cell reference using both the Row &amp; Column number [such as
<strong>R1C1</strong>] rather than as <strong>A1</strong>, or as an <em>offset</em> from the cell containing the formula. If you later change the Preference the program automatically updates the display of formulas accordingly.</p>

<h2>            Cannot call or receive calls in all of my devices</h2>
                    I face an issue with Skype calls and the issue appears on my Mac device as well as my iPhone. When I call it seems that it connects and the other party receives the call only for 1'' and then disappears. In my device it keeps connecting. Also I do not
 receive calls and then I get a missed call notification. Please help me because I need it for my job ASAP!!

<h2>            cover for Nokia 920 is a BAD design</h2>
                    Every time I close the top 'flap' of my Nokia cover it pushes my sound to 0, and some times resets my phone because it pushes down on the sound button and the on/off button at the same time. It is a real frustration because it is a Nokia original and I
 paid a fortune for it at the Nokia store

            <p>To get a space between paragraphs, you should format the paragraph to have the space after it, rather than using the Enter key twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot explain why the font is being changed, however press Ctrl+Shift+s to display the Apply Styles dialog and observe the name of the style before you use the Enter key twice.&nbsp; Then after pressing the Enter key twice move the select back into the text
 and see if the Style has changed in the Apply Styles dialog?</p>

            The font change is caused by a setting in the AutoFormat As You Type options. To turn it off, click the Office button and click Word Options. On the left side of the Options dialog, click Proofing, and then click the AutoCorrect Options button. In the
 next dialog, click the AutoFormat As You Type tab (note: <strong>not </strong>the AutoFormat tab).<br />
<br />
In this page, uncheck at least the option "Built-in Heading styles". This option, when turned on, causes Word to assume that a single line with a paragraph mark at the end is a heading, and it applies a built-in Heading style to the paragraph.<br />
<br />
In fact, all of the entries in the "Apply as you type" section are troublemakers, guessing wrong more often than right, and you should leave all of them unchecked. Some of the others in this page are also more trouble than they're worth unless you know what
 they do and are prepared for them; see <a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/TameAutoFormat.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you Jay! You are a true star! I was having the same problem in Word for Mac 2011 and it was driving me crazy, but now it is sorted. It is the same issue in both Word versions, but the path one has to take to reach the settings in Word for Mac 2011
 is slightly different. For anyone using this version of Word, this is what you need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>With a Word document open as your current active application, click <strong>Word</strong>&nbsp;at the left of the toolbar at the top of the Mac screen and select
<strong>Preferences</strong>. This will open the Word Preferences dialogue box.</li><li>Under the heading <strong>Authoring and Proofing Tools</strong>&nbsp;click on <strong>
Autocorrect</strong>.</li><li>In the Autocorrect dialogue box select the <strong>AutoFormat as You Type</strong> button.</li><li>Under the <strong>Apply as you type</strong> heading there is a check box titled
<strong>Headings</strong>. Un-tick this.</li></ol>
<p>Done. Bosh. Sorted. No more annoying change of style after hitting enter twice.</p>

                    <p>Original title: This page is having a problem loading - Same problem </p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Microsoft is ignoring this problem ... so I guess I`ll ignore them and go to Chrome.&nbsp; I`m not too impressed with Windows 10 - I have this problem; My colour printer prints in black and white; My computer crashed to a BSOD when I ``upgraded``and
 cost me $200 to get the Geek Squad to fix; I`ve lost much of my eMail; and finally I can`t figure out how to connect my computers so I can use my printer from my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the number of people just on this website who are having this problem I`d say that Microsoft is building up a pretty poor reputation.</p>

            <p>Hi Barrie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced upon upgrade to Windows 10 and I regrets the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most printers require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, it's possible that the current printer driver is for the previous version of Windows. If you've had recent power outages, viruses, or
 other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become damaged. Downloading and installing the latest driver for your printer can resolve these types of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the below article for troubleshooting steps:</p>

<p>I have ran though all the popular setting configurations posted by users trying to make Outlook for Mac and gmail play well together.&nbsp; Thanks to those people who took the time to post the fixes...we were able to get this far.&nbsp; However, no combination of
 settings seems to fix this last problem.</p>

<p>She can create new folders in gmail apps and they sync with Outlook, but not the other way around.</p>

            Gmail IMAP is confusing. It started out as web email then adapted to download. It's certainly not a true IMAP account but it's free and has a great spam filter.
<br />
<br />
<br />
GMAIL'S RECOMMENDED IMAP CLIENT SETTINGS<br />
<br />
Sending:<br />
<br />
Do NOT save sent messages on the server. If your client is sending mail<br />
through Gmail's SMTP2 server, your sent messages will be automatically<br />
copied to the [Gmail]/Sent Mail folder.<br />
<br />
DO save draft messages on the server. If you want your drafts in your mail<br />
client to sync correctly with Gmail's web interface, set your client to save<br />
drafts to the [Gmail]/Drafts folder.<br />
<br />
Deleting:<br />
<br />
Do NOT save deleted messages on the server. Messages that are deleted from<br />
an IMAP folder (except for those in [Gmail]/Spam or [Gmail]/Trash) only have<br />
that label removed and still exist in All Mail. Hence, your client doesn't<br />
need to store an extra copy of a deleted message.<br />
<br />
Do NOT save deleted messages to your [Gmail]/Trash folder because this will<br />
delete a message in all folders.<br />
<br />
Do NOT save deleted messages to your [Gmail]/All Mail folder as some clients<br />
will try to empty this folder and ultimately fail. This can lead to delayed<br />
mail access or excessive battery consumption on a mobile device.<br />
<br />
Junk mail and spam:<br />
<br />
Do NOT enable your client's junk mail filters. Gmail's spam filters also<br />
work in your IMAP client, and we recommend turning off any additional<br />
anti-spam or junk mail filters within your client. Your client's filter will<br />
attempt to download and classify all of your existing messages, which may<br />
slow down your client until the process is complete.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In PowerPoint 2010 and later, you can insert an embedded video (the default behavior) or link to a video file stored on your PC. Linking a video file would keep your presentation file smaller, but links can break. We recommend that you store the presentation
 and the linked videos in the same folder. Here's how to embed or insert a link to a video stored on your PC:</p>
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Normal </strong>View, click the slide you where you want the link to the video to be in.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c25c92d-c381-4af8-805c-0a1f512bc15a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c25c92d-c381-4af8-805c-0a1f512bc15a?upload=true" /></a></li><li>On the <strong>Insert </strong>tab, click the arrow under <strong>Video</strong>, and then click
<strong>Video on my PC</strong>.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c05d24f-4356-4417-8720-6882686346aa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c05d24f-4356-4417-8720-6882686346aa?upload=true" /></a></li><li>In the <strong>Insert Video </strong>box, click the file you want to link to, click the down arrow next to the
<strong>Insert </strong>button, and then select <strong>Insert</strong> or <strong>
Link to File</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3744fef0-653a-4b91-9d50-1dffa565f305?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3744fef0-653a-4b91-9d50-1dffa565f305?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After inserting the video, you may set the video to play automatically or when clicked. By default, the video plays as part of the click sequence. That means that when you click anywhere on the slide to advance to the next step, the video plays. This
<strong>Start </strong>option is called <strong>In Click Sequence</strong>. If you want to play it automatically as soon as it appears on-screen, you may follow the steps below:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79f43718-bea6-406f-9853-e7b51aa1947f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79f43718-bea6-406f-9853-e7b51aa1947f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the video frame.</li><li>On the PowerPoint 2016 ribbon, on the <strong>Video Tools Playback</strong> tab, open the
<strong>Start </strong>list and choose the option you prefer:
<ul>
<li><strong>In Click Sequence</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is the default behavior. When you click anywhere, the video plays.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Automatically</strong>
<ul>
<li>The video starts automatically. If there are animation steps before it, the animation would play first before the video.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>When Clicked On</strong>
<ul>
<li>The video starts only when it has been clicked.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>If you have further questions about inserting a video to PowerPoint, feel free to ask us.</p>

Sounds like you have more than one sheet selected.</p>

            <p>I don't see nor can I find a group tab or determine&nbsp;how to enact it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am&nbsp;only opening&nbsp;one&nbsp;workbook at a time. It has&nbsp;7 worksheets and&nbsp;I&nbsp;only work with one of these worksheets&nbsp;at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&nbsp;confirm its&nbsp;only&nbsp;one&nbsp;worksheet that's&nbsp;locked up in this read only format.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can add, change,&nbsp;&amp; update fields,&nbsp;etc in all the other
 worksheets.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thought my&nbsp;enabling workgroups and homepages between household computers might have something to do with it&nbsp;but I have disabled all this now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still baffled how this was&nbsp;caused, and at a loss to eliminate&nbsp;it if it should happen again. I don't use&nbsp; passwords in&nbsp;excel,&nbsp;&nbsp;and can see its pretty involved to understand. &nbsp;</p>

            <strong>How do you add multiple cells in different worksheets together in another worksheet?</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one possible way depending upon what, exactly, it is you want to do:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUM(Sheet1!A1:A3,Sheet2!A1:A3,Sheet3!A1:A3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above placed in Sheet 4 cell A1 will sum the stated ranges from the stated Worksheets.

<p>Hello. When did you notice the problem? After installing some software? Unfortunately, if you are having other problems with the phone as well, you might be better off doing a hard reset back to factory conditions. This will delete all info you have put
 on the phone so you will have to backup your contacts/calendar and any .cab program installers to a storage card and rebuild your device. A good way to backup PIM info is with this free program PIMBackup:</p>

    <title>Office 365 Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smokey0007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Subscription</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I recently bought Office 365 Personal subscription 1 user-1year in my local shop.</p>
<p>They gave me another subscription free as part of a deal.</p>
<p>I now have 2 of these cards each one for a year.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how I can activate them to have 2 years Office 365??</p>
<p>or do I just activate one of them and after a year activate the second one.</p>
<p>I'm worried that if I wait too long there might be an expiry date or something.</p>
<p>any help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>No problem. You can activate both of them now and not worry about anything. You will get the 2 years automatically.

 my remaining subscription time if I renew early?</span></strong></a></span>
<p><span>Yes. When you renew early to the same Office 365 plan that you already have, the additional time is added to your existing subscription. For example, if you have two months left on your current
 subscription to Office 365 Home and you renew for one year (12 months), your subscription will run for 14 months.</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Will I get credit for unused time on my current subscription?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Yes, you will be credited for the amount of time you had remaining on your previous subscription. For example, letâ€™s say that you have 6 months remaining on your current Office 365 Personal subscription
 and you pay for 12 months of Office 365 Home. In this case, youâ€™ll have 18 months of time credited to your new Office 365 Home subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>Subscriptions can be extended up to a maximum of 5 years.
