<h2>            All-in-One-Media Keyboard</h2>
                    I don't know where to go for help for this. There is no category to discuss accessories like keyboard malfunctions. I got my keyboard yesterday and it's been very buggy. I have installed the drivers and solution center and neither have been helpful. The
 booklets it comes with might as well not have they're so useless. There is nothing that explains what the button on the top left is for or how to use it. There is nothing explaining why my cursor disappears or freezes for no reason. Why the trackpad won't
 receive my contact or how to possibly resolve it. I am very disappointed in this lack of clarity on MS's part. I bought this through Amazon and if I don't get the help to fix this I will end up returning it to them under "defective product". Someone please
 assist. (if this is miscategorized than please move it where it should be.) Thank you.

<p>If so, read on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved your question to a Hardware and Drivers&nbsp;Forum.</p>
<p>And it is always better to post what your operating system is too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to this link &gt; select your product &gt; which takes you to a webpage specifically for that product.</p>
<p>There&nbsp;you can download the Drivers and the Manual for it.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 7000 &#38; mouse screen magnification problems</h2>
                    
<p>I started experiencing strange behavior with my mouse &amp; keyboard... using any program, the screen would magnify to the maximum. I changed the batteries to no avail, behavior continued.</p>
<p>I checked devices and Win7 had reverted me to the driver for my older keyboard, the MS entertainment keyboard 7000. I changed the drivers back, but I'm still getting the same thing.</p>
<p>About the same time that this started, my mouse started blinking its' ref light constantly, so I changed the batteries in it, too, with no effect.</p>
<p>Any ideas? This keyboard is now useless. A standard keyboard (wired) works fine, but I can't sit 5' from a 65" monitor comfortably....</p>

            I had the magnification problem with my keyboard. I believe it is a malfunction of the zoom key in the middle of the keyboard. I went into the intellitype pro software preferences and was able to disable the zoom function and this solved my problem.
<br />
<br />
8 months later I have another problem now though. Whenever I try to press any key it adds "aaaa88" to whatever key I press! It has been a great keyboard ergonomic and wireless wise, but at this point I am pretty tired of troubleshooting it.<br />

<h2>            Keyboard Doesn&#39;t Work After Wakeup from Sleep</h2>
                    <p>This happens 50% of the time</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer: Dell XPS 13 i7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new laptop , only 3 days old and this happens 50% of the time after waking from sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use the keyboard to type the password or pin. Touch-pad and touchscreen works fine but i can't enter the password. The Fn keys work too because i can adjust the brightness, volume, and airplane mode from the keyboard. I have to restart the laptop
 to fix this every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please Help!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only happens after sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed this. When i turn on the narrator and press any key on the keyboard, it says something weird that i can not understand when this problem is happening. If &nbsp;press the wifi button and a sidebar opens, then when i press the key, the narrator
 repeats the correct key.</p>

<p>What wrong with the OSK?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, create a Picture password to use for this contingency.</p>
<p>

<p>Supposedly Fn keys can be used for numbers (for Bitlocker keys, at least.)&nbsp; Try that for your PIN?</p>

<p>"Make your computer easier to use"?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I didn't understand the procedure used to get Narrator working but it reminds me that occasionally modifier keys such as Ctrl- and Alt- can get "stuck" which causes unexpected results when supposedly one is typing normally.&nbsp; The workaround is to toggle
 the opposite modifier to the one that is stuck.&nbsp; E.g. usually Right Ctrl- is the one that is stuck, so toggling Left Ctrl- frees that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get signed in while your keyboard is non-functional you could get more clues from the OSK.exe&nbsp; since it will show you how it perceives your typing (including in particular whether any modifier keys are already down).&nbsp; Also, I would check to see
 if Dell have a keyboard diagnostic which would help in a similar way or better.&nbsp; If you have a Microsoft keyboard as well you could have its&nbsp; mskey.exe&nbsp; diagnostic tool installed with any of its software, such as Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center.</p>
<p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
Error code 0x80072F30 is associated with the Windows Store and is an error that basically inhibits the Windows Store from launching successfully. Error code 0x80072F30 can be caused by anything from a stopped Windows Update service to a corrupted Windows Store
 cache or anything in between. Here are some of the most effective solutions that you should try in order to resolve error code 0x80072F30 and regain your ability to successfully open the Windows Store.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution 1: Make sure that the Windows Update service starts automatically</strong><br />
<br />
1. Press the Windows Logo key + R to open a Run. Type services.msc into the Run dialog and press Enter.<br />
2. Scroll down the list of services until you locate the Windows Update. If the Windows Update service is not already running, right-click on it and click on start to actually start the service.<br />
3. Right-click on the Windows Update service again. This time, click on Properties. Open the drop down menu in front of the Startup type option and select Automatic. Click on Apply and OK on your way out. Restart your computer and the Windows Store should launch
 successfully once your computer boots up. If it still won’t work after the Reboot, repeat the same steps for the Windows Store service.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution 2: Reset the Windows Store’s cache</strong><br />
<br />
1. Press the Windows Logo key + R to open a Run. Type wsreset.exe into the Run dialog and press Enter. OR Click OK.
<br />
2. Restart your computer, and the issue should no longer persist when your computer boots up.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution 3: Set the right time, date and time zone on your</strong> <strong>
computer</strong><br />
<br />
1. Open the Start Menu. Click on Settings.<br />
2. Click on Time &amp; Language. Disable the Set time automatically. Go on and set the right time and date.<br />
3. Don’t forget to configure the right time zone on your computer on your way out. Save all of your new settings.<br />
4. Restart your computer, and Windows Store should launch successfully once it boots up.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<h3> sco907  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck CPU Frequency - Win10x64 intel i5 2500k</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows10 from 7, though I don't honestly know if this issue was caused by the upgrade, I noticed in task manager that CPU frequency was constantly being reported as 1.6GHz, despite the official 2500k speed being 3.3Ghz, and my motherboard
 having overclocked it to 4.2GHz.</p>
<p>Further testing has confirmed that this seems to be the case using the asus tools, open hardware monitor and cpuz.</p>
<p>I have tried un-overclocking the system, rebooting, changing the power seetings to high performance, nothing has changed this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I boot into linux with the same settings (using a different hard drive) the cpu speed scales up to 4.GHz and down just fine, so I do not think it is a hardware issue. And the temp never exceeds ~62C, with a max of 99C and the fans not even all the way
 reved up I don't think heat is a concern.</p>
<p>I have no stability issues. I am seeing slowdowns from having my processor run at almost 1/4 speed in Windows though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All driver updates, windows updates, bios updates done</p>
<p>My system:</p>
<p>desktop</p>
<p>processor: intel i5 2500k</p>
<p>motherboard: &nbsp;asus P868-Z</p>

    <title>New version of Skype will NOT let me go into camera settings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonl5  say:</h3>
<h2>            New version of Skype will NOT let me go into camera settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm on Windows 7.&nbsp; Have newest version of skype installed and did before too.&nbsp; I go into Settings, then Audio/Video, underneath "Camera" there is a link to go to "Webcam Settings", which I sometimes need to change in order to get camera to work.&nbsp; When
 I click, NOTHING HAPPENS.&nbsp; I can NOT get into the Camera settings at all, and then of course my camera does not work.&nbsp; I can see other's, but they can't see me.&nbsp; The camera is on my phone, and I sometimes have to change the IP addy in Skype to get it to work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this issue a long time ago, and discovered the "Solution" was to unistall, and install an OLD version of Skype, 7.4...&nbsp; and then I CAN get into the settings, weird,
<strong>and then my camera works.&nbsp;</strong> Unfortunately the Skype forced me to update it to log in after a few months for some reason, and now of course the issue is still there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas why I can't not get into those settings?&nbsp; Is it java enabled on the new version or something like that?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might also be the camera has to be accessible and working before it will go into the settings on the new version, which would be REALLY dumb. Again I have no trouble with the old version of Skype, and honestly like it better overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/66c6d64d-cfad-426e-98f8-53ac9a7a212e" title="JasonL5">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify first what is the version of Skype you are currently using and if you are using an older model of the webcam. Older webcams are likely not compatible anymore using the newer version of Skype which you can find more information on
 this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2998316/windows-7-webcam-does-not-work-in-windows-store-apps-in-windows-8-or-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ</a>. You might want to try on installing the preview version using the download on this link:
<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.preview.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.preview.download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try on using the Skype for Web through this link: <a href="https://preview.web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://preview.web.skype.com</a> and see if the same issue would persist. </p>
<p>

            Hi JasonL5,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing
<br />
<br />I'd make sure all of your camera drivers are upto date:-
<br />
<br />Updating Drivers 
<br />1. Search "Device Manager" in the search box, near the Windows Start Button, and select it. 
<br />2. Locate your camera, right click and select "Update Drivers". 
<br />3. Restart your PC.       
        </p>

<p>Hi all thank you for all the replies.&nbsp;&nbsp; So as stated, I am using my PHONE as the camera, not a webcam, so drivers, old webcams etc are irrelevant.&nbsp; I also stated I am using the newest version of Skype, like as of today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also as stated, I already downloaded
 an old version of Skype, which worked perfect and frankly is a better version, THEN SKYPE FORCED ME TO UPDATE IT AGAIN OR I COULD NOT LOGIN.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other clarifications:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using IP webcam to connect phone to PC/Skype.&nbsp; It works perfect on an old Skype version, nothing newer than 7.4___ though.&nbsp; This is the one thing mentioned in replies that might be pointing to my actual issue but not sure, as see below:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>------</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Remember, the MAIN PROBLEM IS</strong> when I go into Settings in new Skype, then Audio/Video, underneath "Camera" there is a link to go to "Webcam Settings", when I click it, NOTHING HAPPENS.&nbsp; I can NOT get into the Camera settings at all, and then
 of course my camera does not work.&nbsp; I am pretty sure on an older version of Skype, I can get into these settings EVEN WHEN THE PHONE IS NOT TRYING TO CONNECT.&nbsp; So no phone/camera connected at all, and I can go in the settings on old Skype and change settings
 the way I need them.&nbsp; In new Skype, no go phone or not, can't access settings to change anything. &nbsp;

<p>Yes that is the one I think but note I am using a version for an Android Phone.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>I am thinking you are on the right track (and maybe I need to update that app?), but still baffled why I can not just get into settings on New Skype even with no camera at all connected, where I can on old version
</p>

<p>Hmmm I just found this note in the reviews in the google store:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Problem just came up! Recently I've updated Skype, and it doesn't work anymore. In the Skype audio and video settings actual webcam settings window doesn't open.~ Edit: Got it to work with the help from the developer!</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Developer said:&nbsp;&nbsp; IP Camera Adapter doesn't support UWP Skype. Try using a native Win32/Win64 Skype manually downloaded from skype.com as a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RATS.&nbsp; So it seems he is saying use an old version of Skype?&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what I did, then the dumb thing FORCED me to update it or I could not login.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I can prevent that forced update hogwash, like disable skype updater in services maybe (not sure if it will just overide that, though)&nbsp;

<p>IP Webcam software might work with the desktop version of Skype. That type of software is generally not compatible with UWP Apps, only desktop applications. A developer would have to specifically make a version compatible with UWP Apps, otherwise that virtual
 software will not be seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to your issue: If you are using IP Webcam software and it functions in an older version of Skype but it is incompatible or unstable with the latest versions, some type of compatibility is lacking in that IP Webcam software. It is more than likely
 utilizing older, unsupported protocols/filters or is missing a newer protocol. You would need to contact the maker of that software to see if they could provide a more up to date and compatible software. You could try locating other software that might work,
 work daisy chained, or utilize software supporting Newtek NDI, and enable NDI support in Skype. NDI support is built into both Skype for Desktop and the Skype for Windows 10 UWP App for just this reason. It is the compatibility added to Skype to support such
 configurations. I do not know if there are free 3rd party implementations out there.</p>

<h2>            wireless interface name</h2>
                    i came with this problem when i am learning on a wep cracking. i am quite evil, but i just wanted to revenge my neighbour that always uses my internet even i set it up with a wpa2 enterprise.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i was trying to use a command of a aircrack-ng program. it needed a interface name which i tried to search but lastly nothing found.&nbsp;</div>
<div>it said that on other os (like ubuntu, linux) can use a command to find out the interface name. as a windows user, interface name is not shown (or even don't have).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i hope someone can answer me. i won't be minded if anyone report this as a spam or abuse.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>answer are appreciated, (even when he/she/... said that such operation cannot be done on windows)</div>

<p>I'm not usually one to give up easily. Maybe next year when this game is a bit older and hopefully a bit more stable I'll do it again.</p>
<p>Microsoft! Your as guilty as the folks who are advertising this as a GOTY edition. It hardly comes close to that. It is unstable and quite annoying at best.</p>
<p>You really should look into it as the latest update does more harm than good and you refuse to allow me to play my game on my X-box without the update. I pay you good money to insure I'll have a trouble free gaming experience. Your not exactly living up
 to your end of the bargain. I look forward to you examining this experience and possibly doing something to correct this huge failure.</p>
<p>Why should I be forced to abandon many hours of game play and have to "Start Over" to fix this problem. I feel it is pretty lame on Bethesdas part to make this my only option.</p>
<p>Rate this Game? Obviously the rating is not really taking into account the numerous problems this game has. I won't give it more than 1 star at this point.</p>

<p>LMAO! That is funny. When I start over, if I start over, I'll see your raise. lol</p>
<p>It'll be awhile before I get over my frustration with this dilema. I really did try about everything that was suggested to get it to work without freezing up. I saved only the very last bit of progress which is probably the real reason it won't fix.</p>
<p>I re-installed in the order that was suggested by the youtubes and wiki's and none of those suggestions did anything. I'll wait till after the Kinect update and try again. As of the last so called fix, I still cannot go more than 2 seconds down a path towards
 the icon before it freezes. If I can't reach my objective, what's the sense? The very last freeze was a dragon in mid air getting ready to attack while I was on my way to join the men at Dunwall. I'm just tired of getting up to reset my X-box.</p>
<p>Third level of Halo Reach and no lockups yet.</p>

<p>Again, the variability is what puzzles me. With the same game, how can some people go "glitch free" while others have to give up in despair? &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe you're right about it being dependent on the sequence of quests. &nbsp;The game is so vast that it might not
 have been possible to beta test every conceivable sequence. Maybe you (and others) coincidentally hit a fatal sequence whereas I (and others) did not. &nbsp;Anyway, good luck to you. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Third level of Halo Reach? You understand how linear and how easy it is to remove glitches on that?</p>
<p>P.S. I haven't played Skyrim in weeks, pretty much finished it, no reply value in my eyes, but the game was still fun. I can understand how frustrated you are.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Did you only have one save? Cause that's the dumbest thing anyone can do in an RPG. As I told you I only have one playthrough but I have 250+ saves. If one part crashes, I'll reload an old save until I reach a save that stops glitching me out.</p>

<p>An open letter that will never get read by Microsoft or Bethesda. Interesting.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) Reach is a linear shooter (that is that it goes from points A to B to C to D.... then finishes) with a short storyline and a few triggered events. It's a pretty simple affair to make, and to make it without any bugs.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2) Skyrim is one of the biggest, most detailed RPGs out there, if not the most, and is relatively clean as well. Understand that it is about 34, 900, 450, 375, 725 times as big and expansive than Reach is and much more complicated to put together.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that you're severely exaggerating how badly it's going for you, but that's your prerogative. If something freezes every time to try approach it, try going a different way... so on. Start a new game if your current one really is bad.</p>

<p>finished the game, probably a couple hundred hours?? (estimating)... and maybe had 3 freeze ups. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;only got stuck twice in places that were impossible to get out of. &nbsp; and only "unfinishible" quest i can find is the Stones of Berintha(sp?).... i have
 21 and can NOT find the other 3. &nbsp; have been to all of the locations twice and they just ARENT there. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, i guess i'm one of the lucky ones. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Defend them all you want. The letter was really to my friends and folks like you that I see in this forum regularly. A little sympathy if you will. I know how big this game is and maybe my comparison was a tad weak. Fact is the game locks up my X-Box and
 Bethesda claims I'm the one at fault because I won't start the game over. How lame is that really?</p>
<p>Exaggerating? I have over 588 hours of game play with more than 1000 saves&nbsp;and before I let the update/patch download everything was fine. I cannot walk, run, fast travel or ride the horse to my next objective without the game freezing. I have to get up
 and turn my X-box off and back on again to continue. This has been going on for days now as I have tried everything except "New" with this game. That's unacceptable no matter how big or complicated you want to make this game out to be.</p>
<p>I know Bethesda wouldn't give a rats butt what I think, and now I know you don't either. That's okay too. I'll still visit and read threads in this forum until maybe I see one that has a fix for my game. Until then I'll play something thats not quite so
 complicated.</p>

<p>If it was the patch that ruined it then clear your cache and don't download them. Play offline. It's not like you have to play with your friends.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I have not had the severity of your problems, though. I have been locked in one room, I have one Faction that can't progress, and I have had about five freezes. This is over the course of many characters and over 250 hours.
</p>

<p>Take a break. Play some other games. If you want to play again, make a new character. It is so much fun to start over.

<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,

<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />MAKING A BOOTABLE COPY USING RUFUS:
<br />
<br />You can download Rufus, for free.
<br /><a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading Rufus, connect your thumb drive, launch Rufus application, click in the Device list box then choose your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click in the list box then choose your partition scheme. If you select the ISO, Rufus will automatically select the appropriate options for you. Next, click in the File system list box, then choose FAT32. If your thumb drive is larger than 32 GBs, choose exFAT.
<br />
<br />Leave the default Cluster size then enter a label for your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click the choose disk image icon, browse to where the ISO file is located, select it then click Open.
<br />
<br />Click Start to copy the files to the thumb drive.
<br />
<br />If you have any files on the thumb drive, they will be deleted.
<br />
<br />Wait while the files are copied to your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Close when complete
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, then launch setup to begin the installation. 
<br />
<br />STILL NOT ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE ISO FILE?
<br />
<br />Download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>

<p>Greetings, Lord Dj 007. If your gamertag does not match the region in which you currently reside you will encounter problems such as the one you are describing. In addition, if you do not reside in a LIVE supported region you may encounter this issue. Check
 out this page to see a full list of LIVE supported regions: <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com/.../countries</a>. With that said, the best solution would be to create a new gamertag. Thanks! Let me know if you have any further questions.</p>

    <title>Recent update prevents Surface Book from entering DRIPS or Low Power - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recent update prevents Surface Book from entering DRIPS or Low Power State</h2>
                    <p><a href="http://imgur.com/vtz6ZXW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is my recent sleep study</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what has happened. My surface book was sleeping fine before this last update, as of the most recent update the USB Root Hub -- Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter has been active 100% of the time, and completely preventing the laptop from
 going into low power state or DRIPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above study is with NOTHING open -- 4% drain. If I simply close my lid, with a few apps open, it drains 12%+ of the battery in the course of the 2 hours it takes to go into hibernate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions??&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After testing for a while, it seems to be related to the new pen battery level display in the Surface app. In Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Other Devices, if I toggle the Surface app setting beneath "Let these apps use my Surface Pen" from On to Off (see image below),
 my device sleeps properly, at least insofar as the bluetooth adapter. When I toggle it back On, the Bluetooth adapter keeps the Surface active for nearly 100% of the time. As far as I can tell, this setting has no impact other than allowing the Surface app
 to access the pen battery level.</p>

<h2>            Windows update error 0x80072EFD</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
cant use windows update cause of 80072efd<br />
<br />
from what i found the problem is with network proxy,<br />
but i tried to reset the IE and the proxy even without automatic detection, also used netsh command to reset proxy but still the problem persists.<br />
<br />
but whenever i run a local proxy like Psiphon i can use windows update (proxy is not required for downloads only for update check)<br />
<br />
Here is the Windows Update.log"<br />

    <title>So slow &#43; lag and stutter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            So slow &#43; lag and stutter</h2>
                    <p>Hey. Recently, my pc 'Alienware 17' have been running very slow on windows 10. I have so many problems now, I dont know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Lag and stutter. It have started to lag and stutter so often, espesially when playing games.</p>
<p>2. Its slower than before, lets say I used 20 seconds to start it up before, now it takes 1 min. not that much, but enough to slow the pc down, loading anything such as internet or just the task manager takes so long time, if I click or press something,
 it comes slow/slower.</p>
<p>3. 100% disk useage 24/7 the main reason must be that the disk gets to 100% for doing almost nothing, ofcourse, it affect my gameplay way to much, and the game's support cant seem to help me either.</p>
<p>I have done so much research, asked for so much help, nothing/noone have helped me with my problem. If ANYONE could help me to just get this lag and stutter away, I would be so great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check for Virus, no virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diffrent ways to clean the disk, nothing works.</p>

            I have very similar problems. Typically at its worst after startup for about an hour or more. Keyboard lags, disk usage at 100% programs slow. Seems to me like maybe too much is going on. I have 12g of ram too so at a loss to know what the cause its. Have
 tried the usual scan registry, disable startup programs etc to no avail. Short of getting a new laptop, or getting this one looked at by a professional i have no solutions. You are not alone!

<h2>            Game updates&#47;downloads keep stopping. </h2>
                    <p>Whenever I download or updated a game, the download starts and is all good for a moment, and then it will randomly stop. It still says 'downloading' or 'updating' as if it's trying to do something but there isn't any progress. My xbox says I am connected to the internet fine. And no other devices are having an issue.</p>

<p>Whenever I try and pause an update or download when it's stuck and not progressing it takes about 5 minutes for it to actually pause. I'm thinking it could be something to do with the xbox as it's an original day one console but I am honestly not sure. I have tried all troubleshooting apart from a full factory reset.</p>

<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
