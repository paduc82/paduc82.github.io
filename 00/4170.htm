<h2>            Unfamiliar IP Address in Recent Activity</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I decided to check the recent activity of my email address today and was shocked to discover an IP address I didn't recognize on the list. Immediately I changed my password and made sure my security settings were up to date. Out of curiosity I checked another
 email of mine and one of a relative's that&nbsp;is associated with the same IP,&nbsp;and&nbsp;discovered that both accounts were logged in by the same unfamiliar IP address. Like with my first email, I had the passwords changed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A few hours later I checked the recent activity of one account, and again discovered the same unknown IP address had&nbsp;signed on! I took a look at the browser/app associated with the unknown IP address and noticed it came from the&nbsp;Exchange ActiveSync on our
 respective phones. I looked up the unfamiliar IP address online and discovered it could belong to my&nbsp;phone provider.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When using Exchange ActiveSync App,&nbsp;is it normal to see an unfamiliar IP address (that could be) associated with the internet or phone provider appear on the Outlook&nbsp;recent activities list? If not what steps should&nbsp;be taken to resolve it?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If this isn't the proper place to have asked this question, please, let me know so I can look else where.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>THANK YOU in advance.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;noticed the same thing&nbsp;- I'm in Florida yet&nbsp;I see that an IP address from near Seattle has been regularly signing into my&nbsp;account&nbsp;through&nbsp;Internet Explorer and Exchange ActiveSync. The IP is&nbsp;listed as being owned by my mobile provider (T-Mobile) and nothing
 (else) odd seems to be going on, so I'm hoping that it's nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile,&nbsp;it had been a while since I changed my password,&nbsp;so I did that just in case.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It was indeed my&nbsp;phone.&nbsp;I&nbsp;signed into my Microsoft account over&nbsp;cellular (not wifi) and then immediately refreshed the "recent activity" screen on my PC.&nbsp;Lo and behold, there was that same Washington state IP again. (Odd that T-Mobile&nbsp;routes
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, you might want to try the same technique to&nbsp;see if that's what's happening with your account as well.</p>

            <p>Thanks a million Steve!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was thinking that was the case. One would think our mobile providers would route data through something more local than a different city or state, but so long as nothing shifty is going happening it's all good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Good to know I'm not the only one that pondered this. I was starting to feel a bit overprotective. Ha!</p>

            <p>Hey!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I did what you said and I figured out why that IP address kept popping up. However, when I looked up the IP address, the best it could give me in terms of location was Edmonton (I live in Calgary).
</p>
<p>Then I found two different ones that aren't as frequent as the one with my carrier and they appear at really weird times like early hours of the morning while I'm for sure asleep. They have a more specific location and they all say Exchange Active Sync from
 a Windows platform even though I'm not using any. (Most of my work is on my iPhone). Does this mean I've been hacked? Should I be concerned?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are sure that there aren't any authorized Windows&nbsp;devices checking your email or otherwise benignly accessing your Microsoft account, I'd recommend immediate&nbsp;evasive action. If it was me, I'd change my password to something totally different and unique,
 set up 2-step verification, and contact Microsoft to ask about any other necessary actions.</p>

    <title>Why does my web site go dark when I click on the page in IE9 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my web site go dark when I click on the page in IE9</h2>
                    I'm developing a web site and when I view it in IE9 and click anywhere on the page the screen goes dark, but&nbsp; still functions.
<br />
What is the purpose of this behavior, and how do I change my code to prevent this.
<br />
<br />
I am using XHTML, Javascript(some third party), and PHP on all pages. I am using third party addons such as editors in my admin, but these are not the problem as it happens on every page. I am currently using a subdomain address, as the domain name isn't live
 yet, but I have other non live sites in the same hosting that work fine.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions. <br />
P.S. I don't want any work arounds like using compatability mode or turning off add-ons. This site must be usable by any surfer using their current settings, so it's my code that I need to change. I just need to know what can cause this.<br />

            Problem solved.<br />
I had an older version of lightbox viewer&nbsp; v2.04 which wasn't very friendly with IE9.<br />
There is a new version available at<br />
http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/<br />
<br />
which is now at 2.05 which solves this issue.<br />

<h2>            Outlook indexing no tworking</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>I am running windows 10 and Outlook 360 2016.</p>
<p>Couple of weeks ago, I started getting many missing results with while searching emails, so I followed recommendations and I rebuild the index but since then it has gone worse.
</p>
<p>- The index rebuilding is taking for ever, last rebuilt it indexed only 20000 items in 3 days and now stuck at 20000 items</p>
<p>- Outlook Contacts search always gets no results</p>
<p>- email search is missing many emails</p>
<p>I tried to run a fix to outlook, rebuild indexes, with no help</p>
<p>I tried to change the locations in the indexing menu, I thought if I remove outlook from indexing, I will be able to search but it will be slow. but when I stopped outlook indexing, I was still getting no results when searching&nbsp;contacts.</p>
<p>I am about to give up on Microsoft search and look for some other applications.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help solving my problem or should I go ahead and get a separate search tool? any suggestions????</p>
<p>RG</p>

            <p>JL</p>
<p>Many thanks for looking into this issue.</p>
<p>Here are answers to your questions.</p>
<p>- I started getting problems with missing items in search 2-3 weeks ago, that is when I decided to rebuild the indexing and it&nbsp;is a nightmare since then. I&nbsp;try to archive my emails every few month as I deal with a large number of email and my pst file size
 now is 790 Mega.</p>
<p>- I am using an <span><span>HP SPECTRE 13-4005DX X360 CONV,
</span></span><span><span>Product name: HP Spectre x360 Convertible 13. it is running I7 with 8G of memory</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- I just found out that I am using POP3 email protocol. in 2015 we had an issue with the email server and we had to change from IMAP to POP3 and I forgot to change back. I think I can get it to work
 back on IMAP if needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>thanks</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Dogulas,</p>
<p>Since every users in Office 365 need an individual license to work, it is not supported to create a shared development environment for the users in your organization if you don’t have enough licenses. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>We have approx. 50 users all running Office Professional Plus on Windows 7 Ent or Windows Multipoint Server 2012. They are all included in the All Staff Distribution Group. I have one user who occasionally has a delay in receiving messages sent to the All

<h2>            Search function in Outlook on my Mac stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search function in Outlook on my mac has stopped working. It used to work fine and then it just stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not so technical and so all of the fixes seem to be quite drastic or complicated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone has this problem recently? I'm wondering if Microsoft did an update behind the scenes that has caused the problem as my colleague has the same issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Nikki,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding “it finds some stuff but not all”, could you let us know how many emails can be searched now? Are those unsearchable emails stored in specific folder?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you still can’t search all the information, please try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-profiles-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-fed2a955-74df-4a24-bef6-78a426958c4c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> and create a new profile.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not remove the original profile.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. On your Mac, go to Finder &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Type "mdimport -L".
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. If you see more than one instance of " Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter," delete the Outlook application
 that you are NOT using, empty it from the Trash, restart your Mac, and go back to Step 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. In Terminal, re-index your Outlook database using the following command and substituting your own user name for &lt;user_name&gt;:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span>mdimport -g "/Applications/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/Library/Spotlight/Microsoft Outlook Spotlight Importer.mdimporter"
 -d1 /Users/&lt;user_name&gt;/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook\ 15\ Profiles/Main\ Profile</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 In the command above, the path after "-g" is the default path where your Outlook is installed. The path after "-d1" is the default path to your profile. You'll have to substitute your actual paths if you have renamed your profile or installed Outlook in a
 different location. </span></p>

            <p>Are you sure that the product is compatible with Windows 10? Is Defender telling you that it has blocked/removed the executable (check History in Defender)? Perhaps the exe is still there, but due to compatibility it won't run.</p>
<p>If Defender is deleting it as malicious, you can add an exclusion to see if it can be allowed.</p>

<h3> darrend7  say:</h3>
<h2>            formatting a cell</h2>
                    <p>I would like to run a code that fills a range of cells with different colors based on their value. I have the code for formatting one cell but I need to have three colors going, red, yell, green. I can get the numbers later once I know how to set up the
 IF statement</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub CellFill()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("G7:Q7").Select<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Selection.Interior<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Pattern = xlSolid<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .PatternColorIndex = xlAutomatic<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Color = 65280<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .PatternTintAndShade = 0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>So IF the cell value is 0-40, I would want one color, IF 41-59 another and then 60 to 100 another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please point me in the right direction with the IF statement?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 10041 Cortana utility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mesteele101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 10041 Cortana utility</h2>
                    <p>I installed 10041 on the slow track. After the install there was a utility running at the very top of the screen in the middle. It was a utility that was either listening, or sleeping for Cortana. It had a green sound level bar, and it stated something to
 the effect to "say something" in order to wake Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what this was. The PC was using around 50% of the CPU, and this was because the Cortana utility was using that amount. I killed the task and the CPU usage dropped from 50% to 3%. On reboot the utility that was showing in the middle is now not
 coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this utility is, anyone have a clue?</p>

    <title>Profile name won&#39;t capitalize - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholewillis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile name won&#39;t capitalize</h2>
                    I have tried resetting the name on my account and on just my email account, but it won't work. I need my last name to be capitalized so that the receiver of my email sees my name as it is grammatically supposed to appear. However, as it stands, my first
 name is capitalized and my last name is lowercase. I am NOT talking about all caps. I am talking about writing my name the way it should be. How do I get my last name to appear capitalized? It is not a problem on any of my other microsoft email accounts, just
 one certain one.

<p>Thank you for attempting to help. I am accessing my info on a Mac desktop through safari and firefox; I have gone through the steps you list in your reply, but nothing has worked. I am able to "change" my name, but no matter what, the second name does not
 cap when I send an email. My name appears capitalized on the profile, it's just when I email it does NOT show capitalized. The receiver of my emails sees my first name and last name in their inbox, with my first name being the only capitalized name. I'm not
 sure if this matters, but I'm using a hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nichole</p>

</p><p>I have a Microsoft exchange account, and since yesterday(16/11/2018) i can't send or receive emails. Some times when my Outlook is open, the icon on the task-bar has a yellow triangle with a exclamation mark.&nbsp;All other POP/IMAP accounts are working fine.
 When running Outlook&nbsp;<span>I get the little yellow triangle with the exclamation point over the Outlook icon in my task bar. So i did the following steps in trying to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Backed up my Outlook folder</span></p>
<p><span>2. Removed my Microsoft exchange account</span></p>
<p><span>3. Repaired Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus - installed in my PC</span></p>
<p><span>4. Tried to re-add my account, this message appeared "An encrypted connection to your mail server is not available".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks regards&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sanele Mnguni</span></p>

<h2>            Excel Data List - colour filling of targeted cell according to the fill colour as per the Data List</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In Excel, I've created a Data List for a Drop Down functionality. The Data List consists of a series of 6 cells and each with its own criteria and each cell is filled with a different colour.&nbsp; The Data List and Drop-down functionality works well, but to
 analyse the result I also need the "result" cell to be colour filled as per the filled colour selected for each cell in the Data List.&nbsp; Is this possible?</p>

 addresses.&nbsp; Is that the case?&nbsp; Has Hotmail allowed duplicate email addresses to be used by different individuals? I've been using my email account for the past 18 years and this is the first time&nbsp;I came across this.&nbsp; Have any of you came across with similar
 issues.&nbsp; I am concerned as if that is the case, other people are able to obtain a lot of our personal/private information.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We can assure you that<strong> every</strong> email address is unique. <br />
</span>No single Hotmail, Outlook.com or Windows Live ID can be available to two different users.
</p>
<p>It is by design that our system won't accept two identical email addresses with different owners.
</p>
<p><span><br />
Have you posted your personal information to internet forums, chat rooms, blogs, or social networking sites?
<br />
</span>One of the possible reason why you are receiving this kind of emails is that somebody took hold of&nbsp;your account name and email and&nbsp;was used for subscriptions or registrations.</p>
<p><span><br />
To rule out the&nbsp;possibility that your account has been hijacked, please&nbsp;check if the alternate email address of your account&nbsp;is familiar to you.
<br />
</span><span>Also verify if you there's any unusual activity&nbsp;on your account like spam messages being&nbsp;sent without your knowledge.</span></p>

<p>I don't see any way we could've broken the lists/forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users therefore cannot edit the list.</p>

<p><span>Hi Martin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that the issue only happens in a specific list in a specific site and all users in your company can’t edit the list items. Can you confirm it for our troubleshooting?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About the issue, could you upload some related screenshots for our reference?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you go to the classic SharePoint interface, can you edit the items? If you change a browser, what’s the result?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<p>Right, it's only a specific list and the users can't edit it in the default form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried other PCs, Anonymous window, MS Edge, doesn't work on any of those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a workaround by creating and switching to a PowerApps form, which works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching to Classic experience works, although I'd prefer not to confuse users by switching the design unless absolutely necessary. PowerApps works better in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on "0436" in the screenshot below, it doesn't become editable, even though it's a simple text field.</p>

<p>I have the same problem, but I found that if I switch to the "Return to classis SharePoint" in the lower left bottom corner it allows me to edit the data details. Then if I return back to the "Exit classic experience" it stops working again.</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What do you mean about “I went through logging in and everyting and I assume the issue where I clicked on the list was around lines 1100-1150.”? Does the issue only happen in the lines
 between 1100 and 1150 in the affected list? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you confirm whether you can edit on all lines in a newly created list in the site?</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the log captured. I just know what I did around some of the lines of log.</p>
<p>The log recorded the whole session from logging in and navigating to the attempted editing of the item.</p>
<p>Therefore I assume the important part of the log is near the end where I tried editing a list item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, when I create a new list, it's editable just fine.</p>

<p><span>@Leandro and Mauri, it seems that you are only unable to edit the items in a specific list in SharePoint Online and can edit the list in the classic SharePoint interface. If yes, I have sent you private

<h2>            OneDrive app on Samsung Galaxy S8 redirecting to my work company login - I want my personal account&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I've had the OneDrive app on my phone for months now, and at the same time I've had the Outlook app as well. I've been logged into Outlook for my work email and OneDrive, my personal account. Now, for some reason, when I try to open OneDrive, it asks me
 to login and redirects me to my company's portal (which even if I try to log in with that, it doesn't work. It's an endless loop of loading and asking me to log in again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is related, but Outlook isn't working for me either. It asks me to log in, I do so, it loads, then it asks me to log in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really frustrated. I've had 0 issues for months. I've tried clearing my browsing cache. I've tried "Force Stop" and uninstalling and re-installing OneDrive multiple times. I've uninstalled Outlook as well. And I can't figure out how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>I have already done that. However, when I hit "Force Stop" it does not ask me to clear data and cache. But I have hit "Force stop", uninstalled, and reinstalled to no avail.</p>

            Okay so I went into storage, found the OneDrive app, cleared all data and cache. Opened the app, and it asked me to log in, asked for access to my contacts which I approved (if I don't, it won't let me sign in), and it STILL took me to the directory for
 the company I work for....

<p>Hi Ton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a). To change notebook when creating notes, if you are not on Notebook page, please tap the backward arrow in the top left corner (you may tap 1, or 2 or 3 times)&nbsp; until OneNote shows up in the top
 left corner and backward arrow disappears &gt; the notebook you prefer &gt; create notes in a selected section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b). To&nbsp; move the notes that are created in the wrong notebook to another notebook, please go to the section where the notes are stored in the notebook &gt; tap each page for a while until a popup shows
 up &gt; tap Move page &gt; the backward arrow before the current notebook &gt; the notebook you prefer &gt; the section you prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above suggestions don’t meet your requirements, could you please provide the following information to help better understand your situation?</p>
<p>1. Detailed steps and related screenshots about how your notes get stored in the wrong notebook.</p>
<p>2. Or you may record a small video about , upload it in your&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft account OneDrive&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;</span></a>(***@outlook.com)

<h2>            Assign a number to a string.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to construct a spread sheet where the answers to 6 questions will be a text string to which I want to assign a number in a chosen cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance the string <br />
"<strong>Yes</strong>" in cell A1 will be given a value (number) of <strong>5</strong> in cell B1</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes but more effort</strong>" in cell A1 will be given a value (number) of
<strong>3</strong>&nbsp;in cell B1</p>
<p>"<strong>No</strong>" in cell A1 will be given a value (number) of <strong>1</strong>&nbsp;in cell B1</p>

            <p>The screen capture show the use of LOOKUP</p>
<p>Note the text must be in alphabetic order</p>
<p>If lots of text, use VLOOKUP with table somewhere else (another Sheet) in the Workbook.</p>
<p>Sorting not needed if you make last VLOOKUP argument as FALSE</p>
<p>best wishes</p>
