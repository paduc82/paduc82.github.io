<h2>            Can&#39;t print email from Draft folder in new Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the new Outlook.com web email as of 10/07/2016., but can't print email from the Draft folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old Outlook.com, I was able to print from the Draft folder by selecting the message then clicking on the ". . ." and selecting Print from the menu.&nbsp; The new Outlook.com does not allow you to print email from the Draft folder, as far as I can tell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you move the email from the Draft folder to the Inbox and select Print from the ". . ." menu, I get the message that printing a draft document is not allowed (at least from the Inbox).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one unsatisfactory method, while in the draft folder, click on the symbol in the upper right hand corner to load the selected document into a separate window, then press Ctrl-P, but a clean document is not produced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure miss the ability to print from the Draft folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The print function from <strong>Drafts</strong> is no longer available in the new Outlook.com. The rationale is that, since it is a draft or unfinished, there's no need for it to be printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to print your draft mail, we recommend that you sent it out to your alternate email and access your
<strong>Sent Items</strong>. From <strong>Sent Items</strong>, access the e-mail and click ". . .", then select<strong> Print</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 slow after Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danialmcgreevy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 slow after Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the creators update my 950 has become "laggy".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard will not appear on screen when required in Edge. &nbsp;The requires many screen refreshes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When toggling windows, the screen will freeze. &nbsp;This also stops all buttons on the phone from working during this period of freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone is now over heating regularly. &nbsp;I have to close all apps to cool it down and sometimes a restart is required. &nbsp;I have noticed this overheating is prevalent when using "location".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This maybe unrelated, but "whatsapp" will now crash at random moments. &nbsp;This never happened before, so worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a soft reset and still all these issues remain. &nbsp;It's a pain, and frankly it's ruining ,what was, a great UI experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Danny</p>

<p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you have provided on your post, we would suggest that you perform a hard reset. This process will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal
 settings, etc&nbsp;will be removed from the phone. To perform, go to <strong>Settings
</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong> Please create a

<p>No, a reset doesn't help at all. I have the same issues. The issues i experience are worse, the phone has gone to an almost impossible to use. I have already done a reset!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is so bad that it would freeze when reading a message or even oven whilst in Phone - unable to dial or even answer a call. I'll try to revert to a previous update and let you know if it helps. If you are experiencing the same issues, resetting the phone
 doesn't help, regardless of how many people tell you that it will resolve the issues.</p>

</p><p>didn't help unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is annoying and to the point where me and my partner (also on WP and experiencing the same issue) are ready to go android. Swore I wouldn't, but this update has ruined the best ui on the market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try and roll back to an old backup and turn off auto update. To me that seems like a rather shabby method.&nbsp; I was expecting a response that suggested accessing the logs to find out what is causing this. Or something a bit more technical than
 a glorified "turn it off and on".</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I experienced the same issues. Resetting, restarting, on/off whatever advice you get from Microsoft experts will not help, tried it all!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that improved performance was switching off Cortana, and pretty much limiting all permissions to OFF - this really did improve performance, however it did not stop overheating, did not stop stalling when writing a text message, did not stop disappearing
 keyboard and only improved phone freezing for 30sec-1minute, did not stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to resolve the issues with my phone was to revert back to 1511 update using the Windows Device Recovery Tool. Apart from reverting back to previous version, unfortunately I couldn't find a way to resolve the constant freezing, disappearing keyboard
 and the phone becoming very hot.&nbsp;I have been running the previous version for a day without any of the above issues, at all!</p>

<p>I face exactly the same issues. After over two weeks I start running out of patience. It's like Microsoft broke my phone remotely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It's laggy and unstable now. I switched from Android to Windows in 2012 in order to get a smooth and stable operating system. Now I have a phone with great hardware running an OS as unstable as Android 2.3 running on a low cost phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Since Microsoft broke it I think about a full refund for my device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please provide an update or at least a downgrade soon as long as the current version is in&nbsp; early alpha state.</p>

<p>It has been two days since reverting back to 1511 update. The phone has been running normally. obviously there is an issue with the latest update.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no way to stop updates. The phone has downloaded the new software and is planning to automatically update this evening, there isn't an option to stop this...&nbsp;</p>

            In that case Microsoft should revoke the current version at least for the Lumia 950 and work on an improved version afterwards. The current state is just unacceptable!

<p>I did the same. The device is working much more reliable now. Thanks!</p>
<p>I turned off Cortana, GPS and&nbsp;Bluetooth and closed all my Edge tabs. It's still slower than in previous versions but at least it's working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recap: With the latest <em>stable release</em> of Windows 10 Mobile I can't use Cortana or GPS anymore. If I try to use it the phone will freeze, overheat, run out of battery quickly and will just turn off from time to time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Microsoft: I'm a customer. Please treat me like that! Are you going to&nbsp;fix my phone by the end of this week? Are you going to give me my money back?
</p>
<p>I'm concerned nobody at Microsoft is interested in fixing these problems&nbsp;since it's now two weeks after @LexDel's have-you-tried-turning-it-off-and-on-again-posting.</p>

<p><span>Hi Briefs1,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, try importing bookmarks from Firefox to Internet Explorer in Safe mode with Networking</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> To boot the computer in Safe mode with Networking</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 while restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Advanced Boot Options, select Safe mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you login to Safe mode with networking, try to import bookmarks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re able to import in Safe mode with Networking, then I presume that this issue is caused due to an add-on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> What can I do if I think an add-on is causing trouble?</span></p>
<p><span>To isolate the specific browser add-on that is contributing to the issue, you can use IE’s Manage Add-onsfeature to
 pick specific add-ons to disable. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below for more information on how to disable an add-on that causes Internet Explorer to quit unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How do browser add-ons affect my computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/How-do-browser-add-ons-affect-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/How-do-browser-add-ons-affect-my-computer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: Reset Internet Explorer Settings</span></p>

    <title>OneDrive - Shared Link When Bookmarked Forces Login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clara &#40;work&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive - Shared Link When Bookmarked Forces Login</h2>
                    <p>I use OneDrive to share files with a client who do not have OneDrive for Business accounts. I have tried both the "Specific People" setting and the "Anyone with the link" setting, and both allow me to successfully share the files with the client. However,
 the client wants to bookmark the link for easy access. Whenever he does this, after a day, when he goes to open the bookmark, it forces him to log into Office 365 (he does not have an account). In order to access the files, he has to go into his email and
 click the link I sent him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can set the permissions to allow him to bookmark the link and access it without logging into Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Clara</p>

<p>Hi Clara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link will redirect the user to the file, where the URL will change. We suggest the user bookmark the initial link instead of the URL after it changes. To do this, don't directly bookmark the page, instead, create a new bookmark via the browser and copy
 then paste the "<strong>Anyone with this link</strong>" link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Megan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. If you can create a simple meeting without GoToMeeting add-in and other users who have the related permission can see the meeting correctly, calendars in Exchange Online should works fine. Since that add-in is a third party tool,
 I suggest you monitor their official news along with out Office news for comprehensive informations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>
<p>Alison</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Rules does not allow move a copy to Inbox</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook for as along as I can Remember - On all versions up to Outlook 2010 I have been able to set a rule that moves every email&nbsp;from the Sent Items to my Inbox.&nbsp; I uncheck the create a copy in Sent Items button in the options.&nbsp; Thjis
 si so I don't have to keep going to the sent items or cc myself on emails and keeps all the relevant emails in one folder - the Inbox.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have applied the&nbsp; same rule as I always did now in&nbsp;Outlook 2013 through Office 365 and it does not allow me to do this -
</p>
<p>When I send an email it comes up with rules error - unable move a copy to inbox and the items are still in sent items though!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Hotmail. com account and Inbox.</p>

<p>Just find it strange that I was bale to do it on all previous versions but not this - Thought maybe a tweak of the settings may do it - If only I knew how</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't do it anymore as Outlook.com connects as an EAS account in Outlook 2013. A limitation of EAS is that the message needs to exist in the mailbox first before it can be moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative, you could connect as&nbsp;an IMAP account but that has some limitations of its own. Wait a few weeks and you'll be able to connect to your Outlook.com mailbox as an actual Exchange account;<br />

http://www.howto-outlook.com/news/outlookcom-is-moving-to-office-365-exchange-online.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, a&nbsp;workaround would be to move the items after they are sent. You'd have to do it manually though. You might want to do this at the end of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better would be to simply leave them in the Sent Items folder and use Conversation View as Brian suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another approach would be to create an "All Mail" Search Folder.</p>

                    <p>I'm having an issue with YouTube rendering in IE11 under Windows 8.1. It doesn't seem to be a system-wide issue, with chrome able to render it fine. The issue is depicted here:

<p>If anyone could suggest why this might be happening I'd be grateful. I should add that when clicked the videos still play as expected, just that their thumbnails appear to be broken, along with images for all channels as you can see in the screenshot.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
SpyBot has issues with IE and Windows in general as it is very intrusive. Not sure how much if any it
<br />
will conflict with MSE since I only use it as an on-demand scanner.<br />
<br />
SpyBot causes issues with IE7, 8, 9 and Windows. Stop TeaTimer in its setup and set the
<br />
SBSD Service to STOP and MANUAL -&nbsp;then you can use SpyBot as an on-demand scanner.
<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.
<p>Set to MANUAL and STOPPED<br />
<br />
In SpyBot&nbsp;- Settings&nbsp;-&nbsp; set TeaTimer to Disabled&nbsp; (uncheck)<br />
<br />
Reboot and it will not load and can be run on demand<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running. <br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />

</p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

<p>Hi MalithFernando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the message trace error, it seems that the message has been deleted by transport rule, please check if there is any transport rule (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center
</a>&gt; mail flow &gt; rules) set up in your organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no transport rule set up in your organization, please try to check if the senders or domains have been added to block lists (Exchange admin center &gt; protection &gt; spam filter &gt; double click your policy &gt; block lists).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have checked as above and cannot find any setting related to your issue, I need to collect some information for further investigation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If the issue just happens to your account in your organization?</p>
<p>2. If you cannot receive any emails (including emails from internal users) or external emails, or just emails from Gmail?</p>
<p>3. Please check if the spam action in your organization is "Delete message". (Exchange admin center &gt; protection &gt; spam filter &gt; double click your policy &gt; spam and bulk actions &gt; spam and bulk actions).</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is usually caused by corrupted system files or software conflicts on your computer. For us to resolve the issue, we recommend that you run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and try installing build 17040.1 again. For your reference, check this
 article on where to download the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hi...maybe your Video settings....are you using a 'Video card'?....cause' mine gets set to 'Extend these displays'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then I can not see the installation procedure exept on the TV....then I have to wait for the complete download
 and go to the TV and go into 'Settings'&gt; Display'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and change the settings to 'Duplicate these displays' then I can see the picture on the Monitor' &nbsp; and then sign out.</p>

<p>I just tried it, and build 17046 won't install either. Is there a known cause? Or a work around?<br />

<h2>            Help with embedding OpenType &#40;Type1&#41; Fonts in Word Documents.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>can someone please tell me how to embedd professional Adobe Pro Open Type fonts (like Garamond Pro and Myriad Pro) in Word 2007 and/or 2010 documents? I am using those fonts (works fine) but I can't seem to be able to embedd them. I want to use those fonts
 I purchased in documents sent to third parties that do not have the fonts installed. Licesnse includes "embedding to edit/print/etc.".</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>ActiveSync wants to delete all contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdyxrolx  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync wants to delete all contacts</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I want to do is an actual "sync" of my contacts -- make my new HTC Touch and my PC mirror one another.&nbsp; I'm not running Exchange (only using one computer here).&nbsp; AS gives me only the option to overwrite one or the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So ... I decide to not sync contacts at all.&nbsp; If I unclick the "Contacts" box on either the computer or on the Touch, I get this:&nbsp; "To proceed, ActiveSync must remove all contacts synchronized to your device using ActiveSync.&nbsp; Select OK to continue."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why in the world would Microsoft write the app to delete my contacts?&nbsp; Does anyone at Microsoft actually have to USE the junk they write?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, better yet, is there some configuration I'm missing?&nbsp; I'm not an idiot (at least not in this particular regard), and I've been through every availabe menu (and there just aren't any).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typical Microsoft half-a**ed effort.&nbsp; My friends' i-Phones and their Macs sometimes look kinda nice ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any comment would be helpful.&nbsp; I'd like to keep my contacts ...</p>

<p>I've kept my PIM.VOL file copied, so I suppose I could recover the contacts that way, although that file contains all this other stuff that I've configured and maybe not backed up on the memory card since the last change.&nbsp; Besides, once I synched again,
 the contacts were restored from the PC to the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can't I just make changes after the partnership is set up?&nbsp; I'd love to see ActiveSync actually function the way we end users do -- PC and device look at each other and go with the newest versions of contacts.&nbsp; It seems to do that with every
 other parameter -- Calendar, Emails, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said -- Microsoft being typically cumbersome.&nbsp; In the next version, make it easy and straightforward.</p>

<p>I've never quite had the same situation so this is only a guess but I might expect that it will keep the most recent contact (or create a duplicate ... ugh!)</p>

<p>Since this is an MS sponsored forum, I'd hope that someone would take the suggestion to write a sync app that really functions.&nbsp; I know, I know ... get Vista and use the new tool that comes with that, but I've seen it as well, and it's fraught with problems,
 too.</p>

            <span>On first sync, with a new AS partnership, AS should recognize that there is data on both the computer and the windows mobile device and give you three choices:&nbsp; 1) Combine the data; 2) Overwrite the data on
 the mobile device with data from the computer; and 3) Do nothing.<br />
<br />
If you have some duplicate data on both devices and some unique data on both devices, if you choose the 1st option (Combine) you will get duplicate data on both devices; if you choose the 2nd option, you will lose any unique data you have on the pocket pc.&nbsp;
 When I have been in this situation, I usually spend some time adding the data I don't want to lose to my computer and then I select option 2 (Overwrite).<br />
<br />
Once you've gotten through the 1st sync with a new partnership, the data should be mirrored on both the computer and the mobile device.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The only time I've ever had the message from AS that my contacts would be removed from the device has been when I have decided to change an existing syncing relationship....when I have decided to stop syncing my contacts.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So I am a little confused by your issue.&nbsp; Have you been syncing for a while and then decided you did not want to sync your contact data any longer?&nbsp; Or are you just attempting to set up a new partnership and sync for the first time?<br />

<p>Thanks for your kind reply.&nbsp; I realize that AS establishes its relationship between the device and the computer on the first sync.&nbsp; And yes, I decided to not sync my contact data any longer, because once it's established, it's frustrating in
 its inflexibility.&nbsp; Why in the world wouldn't MS allow the user to change that relationship?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to decide along the way that I don't want to overwrite (and therefore delete) all my contacts on the device -- what if I've added contacts on the device but not to the computer yet?&nbsp; Next time I connect to the computer -- just to go
 PAM, for example -- I've lost those contacts.&nbsp; Sync software, one would think, would allow the option to sync in both directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the answer:&nbsp; "ActiveSync just doesn't do that ..."&nbsp;&nbsp; But someone much smarter than me could write a sync program that does and make alot of money.</p>

<p>Once you have the relationship established and you sync, the situation you described above will in fact sync the newly added contacts.&nbsp;

<p>I am facing similar situation. <br />
In reality, users are more likely to add new contact through their mobile device, not Outlook.
<br />
I tried to Sync my device to the PC and Outlook will not see the "NEW" contacts I have added.
<br />
Is there anyway for outlook to see and add these "NEW" contacts in PC? <br />
If it can't, how do I, so called, 'back up' my data as AS claimed it can help?</p>
<p>Please advice</p>
        </p>

            I had a palm for many years and been in the tech world for more than 20 years. With a palm, sync meant that all the new records on the device were copied to the computer and all the new records on the computer were copied to the device.<br />
<br />
Now I have a windows mobile device. Everytime I sync, it deletes everything on the mobile device that are not already on the computer. This is unacceptable. There does not seem to be a way to change this.<br />
<br />
So back to basics. Reset everything. I deleted all the contacts in my Outlook folder and deleted the sync settings for the mobile device. I looked but could not find a way to backup my contacts on my windows mobile device to the SIM without doing it one by
 one (too time consuming). <br />
<br />
Since I didn't believe it would actually delete everything, I took a chance and asked windows mobile to sync the data.
<br />
<br />
It deleted everything on my mobile device to match the empty address book in outlook. The only contacts that were not deleted are those on my SIM card. YIKES!!!!<br />
<br />
So there is the proof. Vista blows. I have all this new technology and my old palm from 10+ years ago (that I would be using but it doesn't hold a charge anymore) has more functionality.<br />
<br />
So, from reading the moderator above, it would seem this is not the expected functionality for the Vista sync tool. Please tell me how to change the set-up so it will sync (as per the old definition) not just delete the mobile device and replace it with whatever
 is or (or is not as the case may be) in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Yesterday's latest updates have seriously messed up my phone. As of now, it doesn't recognize my SIM card, I cannot use the keyboard for anything, it constantly restarts, rapidly overheats and is not recognizable by other devices. Whom should I try to contact
 about this issue? Microsoft has currently closed calls and chats with live agents... Please help<br />

            Your carrier is delaying the update in hopes you'll buy a new phone from them instead. Microsoft has no control over that end. Microsoft is already on Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1, with an Update 2 in the works.<br />

            Yes, I'd like to know where WP 8.1 is? I have a Verizon Nokia Lumia 822. Nokia says it's between MS and Verizon. Verizon says it hasn't been released to them. So who is lying? I have enjoyed my windowsphone despite the lack of apps; I have supported MS
 for years but now I feel betrayed. I am considering going Samsung with a different carrier.

<p>Verizon. Microsoft has been done with 8.1 for months now. Several non-Verizon phones have the Cyan firmware and Windows Phone 8.1 Those in the Developer Preview program are also already on WP8.1 Update 1. Verizon just wants you to buy a new phone.</p>

            Do a factory reset (type *#7780# at the standby screen) and try again. Also, update your firmware if you're not running the latest version. Use NSU from the Nokia website to check for updates. Backup your data before you proceed with the update. Bluetooth
 performance usually gets better with newer firmware versions.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same problem with my Nokia 6700 classic.&nbsp; it is on O2 and I have managed to fix this problem by reinstalling the same firmware using Nokia PC suite.</p>
<p>Just go through the whole update process and when it&nbsp;informs you that there is no firmware update available an option to reinstall the same firmware appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS.&nbsp; Turn off the pin code request feature as this causes problems with installation when phone restarts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;I have tried a factory reset but still can't switch Bluetooth on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I have tried to reinstall the firmware I get the message that it has the latest but do not get an option to reinstall. &nbsp;Whenever I have upgraded firmware on previous phones (N70, N95, N96) I am always able to reinstall. &nbsp;Why not now?</p>

<p>Has anyone made any progress on this? &nbsp;I have the exact same issue with bluetooth - it says 'Switching on Bluetooth' forever, and when I finally cancel the phone resets. &nbsp;This is a recent problem - I've had the phone for ~3 months and bluetooth always worked
 fine before. &nbsp;I didn't do anything unusual (ie: install any apps) but it just stopped working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to try reinstalling the firmware, but that option does not exist in the NSU. &nbsp;With previous Nokia's I've always been able to reinstall it. &nbsp;Anyway I wanted to check if anyone had figured this out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I am not from Europe but i also faced same problem within few months of purchase.</p>
<p>Infact, i gave to Nokia Care for repair, they updated the software version to 10.50, it worked fine for few weeks, but now, it has stopped working again. :(</p>
<p>So, it has nothing to do with software version. I guess there is a fault in bluetooth hardware.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware this is a hardware fault and the phone has to be replaced. I have two 6700 on my business account and - guess what? - these handsets are out of stock!</p>

<p>Nokia are just like all the other technology companies, great at taking your money, useless when you need help with a problem.</p>

<p>Had my Nokia 6700 since last year when it was released in the UK in the summer, and quite recently had problems with the Bluetooth not able to switch on from time to time...When I try to turn Bluetooth it would hang on the "Bluetooth is switching on" message
 and then the phone would crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated the firmware from version 7.60 to 10.50 to see if this solved the problem and looks like Bluetooth refuses to switch on and the problem has gotten worst...I managed to get Bluetooth to switch on but once I turn the phone off, the phone doesn't
 remember that the Bluetooth is switched on and I have to try again to get Bluetooth switched on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for now if I leave my phone on the Bluetooth can be switched on and off without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from my testing, it sounds like it might be just a software problem, although many have pointed out it's a hardware problem.</p>

<h2>            How to unlock a T-Mobile Nokia Lumina 635 phone.</h2>
                    I loaned a phone (Nokia Lumina 635) to a friend who put his Family T-Mobile sim in it. He had no issues other than carrier specific connectivity irregularities. Soon after he got his own phone he gave it back to me. I wanted to use Cricket wireless service,
 and so I went to cricket to get the sim and service activation started. They told me that they could not finish the job, because the phone was locked to another carrier. I had to get the phone unlocked, and after failing to find a solution, on my own online,
 I went back to the place of original purchase. They of course want to discourage my efforts, and sell me another phone at first. It was only here that I finally got a supposed unlock code issued to my email. The problem I have now is that they issued me a
 twenty digit unlocking code, but the phone refuses to accept all 20 digits! It only allows entry of ten digits. I noticed this development while entering in the number the first time. I had ignored the fact that it was excepting

            <p>When the phone is locked to a specific operator/carrier then you must insert a SIM from
<em>another</em> carrier to get the unlock option during start-up.<br />
That's the only gotcha' I'm aware of.</p>

<h2>            Restore back up on Windows 10 Mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just hard reset my Lumia 950, and on the restore phone feature, it doesn't show my Windows 10 Mobile back up that i did today (I can see it in Onedrive though). &nbsp;Instead, it shows Windows 8 phone backups from my old phones from 2 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, how do i restore the Windows 10 Mobile back up, and not the Windows 8 backups from two years ago? &nbsp;This seems absurd. &nbsp;Other forum posts and searching Microsoft help hasn't addressed this issue, from what I can see.</p>

                    I am a newbie with Excel 2013. &nbsp;I have Win 10 upgrade. &nbsp;Why is does it print so small when I use a size 14 font? &nbsp;Also, the size of the print area keeps changing. &nbsp;I have tried changing the margins, changing the size of font, changing the page breaks --
 it comes out either too huge or too small. &nbsp;In other words, how can I make my spreadsheet print area fit a normal-size copy paper?

            1. Follow the instructions given on this page to make older programs compatible with Windows 10 - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. Review the response of E. Harter at following link where sharing has solved the problem - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/2010-office-docs-all-open-as-read-only-after/31a64e6b-60e1-4d51-a897-9f8958660859<br />
<br />
3. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
5. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
6. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
7. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />
<br />
9. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
10. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.
