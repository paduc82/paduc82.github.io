<p>Hi Dominik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Improperly shutting down your PC or malware infections can corrupt kernelbase.dll thus leading to DLL errors. In this case, we can manually register affected DLL file. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the <strong>Start </strong>button.<br />
2. Type "<strong>command</strong>" in the search box.</p>
<p>3. Hold <strong>CTRL </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>on your keyboard and click on
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. This will open it with admin privileges.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Yes </strong>on the permission dialog box.</p>
<p>5. Type and enter this command: <strong>regsvr32 /u KernelBase.dll</strong>. This will
<strong>unregister </strong>the file.</p>
<p>6. Type and enter this command: <strong>regsvr32 /i KernelBase.dll</strong>. This will register the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, close Command Prompt and try uploading your videos to Sony Vegas Pro again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help.</p>
        </p>

</p><p>Hey Jairit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, many thanks for your replay! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Secoundly, it's a shame but your sollution didn't help ;/. When I type <strong>
regsvr32 /u KernelBase.dll </strong>it still pomp up an error: </p>
<p>"The module "kernelbase.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found.</p>
<div>
<p>Make sure that "kernelbase.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can agree that I had some improperly, shut downs of my PC but I have scaned my whole PC and it didn't shown any malware infections. So basicly I still have the same problem, cuz it hasn't been fixed at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for more help. Much thanks for any replay!</p>
<p>

<p>You're welcome and thanks for the information, Dominik. The error message tells us that the DLL file is no longer present in your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, we can try to re-register it by running this command on an elevated command prompt:
<strong>regsvr32 /i KernelBase.dll</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, kindly restart your computer and check. If it still persists, we would need to<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create

<h2>            .RDP files won&#39;t open &#40;remote desktop&#41; after Win10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    After the Windows 10 Anniversary Update was installed on my Windows 10 Pro, .RDP files won't open. Remote Desktop still works if you open it manually and enter in the server info. But my saved .RDP files won't open. Also, right clicking on them and selecting
 edit also does not work. Nothing happens. I even opened Remote Desktop connection, entered in the server info manually and clicked Save As. That shortcut also won't work. Any ideas on what's wrong? Thanks.

            <p>If you are experiencing this issue, you should be able to work around&nbsp;it by removing the custom scale factors you have set (a custom scale factor applies across all monitors).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hit the Windows key and then type "display".</p>
<p>2. Tap on the "display settings" link that is found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see the following text in red: "A custom scale factor is set". </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click on the text underneath which states "Turn off custom scaling and sign out".&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Sign back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSTSC should now work with an RDP file passed as a parameter.</p>

<p>Original title:- Please help Laptop Acer Aspire E1-572G</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My laptop screen is broken and I couldn't boot to windows, I disconnected the display from the 30pin ribbon cable and now I am using HDMI to connect to my Philips TV, but when I try to listen from the TV not the Laptop I can't, theres no option for that
 in sounds control panel even with show disabled/disconnected devices. I did go to device manager and saw this<br />

I even tried to install Intel Drivers (AMD Drivers work) but the intel one wont, it says that there is no system compatibility, tried manual install and intel driver update utility but I can see it in display adapter properties :<br />

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the television is not configured properly on the system. When a TV is connected, you will see the&nbsp;TV device under Sound settings. You can click on Set it as Default. I suggest you to try using&nbsp;a different HDMI cable and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have the right cable (HDMI Cable), follow these steps to connect your computer to your TV.
<span>Turn off your computer and position it within easy reach of your TV. Disconnect the monitor, but leave the mouse and keyboard connected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Connect the appropriate video cable from your computer's output to your TV.
</span><span>Turn on your TV and set it to the input that matches the output on your computer. You might need to refer to the user's guide included with your TV for instructions on how to do this.
</span><span>Turn on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should see Windows displayed on your TV. If the screen looks stretched, or part of the screen seems cut off, you probably need to adjust the screen resolution in Windows.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you can't see Windows on your TV, you might need to reconnect the computer to your monitor and adjust the screen resolution before you connect to your TV.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Do keep us updated.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Windows will only create dump files, if Windows crashes with a bluescreen error. If the system locks up and does not

<h2>            My Razer Synapse 2 doesnt open</h2>
                    <p>yeah, so basically i just finished decorating my new desk and stuff, got all my cable management and i have the Razer blackWidow Chroma, ultimate edition, so i wished to edit the colors of my keyboard so it would look good with my new desk. but i recently
 got windows 10, and for some reason i cant open the app at all, even if i go into the file location, i cant seem to get it to open, it refuses to. i'm getting pretty fed up with windows 10 because i've had similar bugs like this, like for some reason i cant
 directly quit skype on the task bar, i have to open task manager and force quit it. which is a little rediculous</p>

<h2>            Unable to read HDD</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is unable to read my hard drive. As i load the computer, it loads straight into bios and when i select boot menu, there is no option to boot from hard drive, only from dvd ram drive. I inserted my windows 8 disk into the system to try and repair
 the OS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic repair doesn't work, when i try to refresh PC, i am presented with the error, "The drive where windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again". Lastly, when I try to insert command prompt: chkdisk v: /f i am presented with the error
 "Cannot open volume for direct access" and similarly, when i enter, disk part -&gt; list disk, i get the error "There are no fixed disks to show".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried suggestions from other threads, such as unplugging the HDD and restarting the computer, I have tried solutions via command prompts but nothing seems to be working. If anyone has any other suggestions that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Let me just confirm that you're saying that you're unable to get past the title screen on this gamertag you're signed into via Xbox.com "NitricNightmare" but when you sign in using another account you can play the game just fine and get past the title screen?<br />
<br />
If that's the case, have you tried to delete your profile (profile only), clear your system cache (3 times in a row), restart your profile (important), and then finally download your profile again? This might help fix the issue if your other profiles on the
 same console are able to play the game just fine and get past the title screen.<br />
<br />
Information on how to delete the profile (profile only), and re-download the profile can be found
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />

<p>Do you have a 4Gb slim xbox? If so you will need to purchase an official xbox 360 hdd to install the content. For some reason EA made it so the content cannot be installed on the 4gb slims memory because it is flash memory</p>

<h2>            Rewards Program Quests bug</h2>
                    I have been trying to access Game Pass Quests in the achievement section of my Xbox One S console. When clicking on sign up for Microsoft Rewards to take part in the quests I clicked join now at which time I was given the enrolling prompt “Try again soon!
 Sorry, we cant enrol you just now... If you keep seeing this click help”. I clicked “help” and couldn’t find any resources to help me. I contacted microsoft support via web chat, after a lengthy discussion with a very helpful customer service agent I was directed
 to post this question hoping to find some answers to this bug.&nbsp;

<h2>            I can no longer download pictures from my Sony Cyber-shot camera</h2>
                    Worked with Sony Canada yesterday to download pictures from my camera. They discovered that I might need a upgrade of Windows Service pack 1. I tried that yesterday but I still cannot import the pictures.

            <p>OK...something to try...<br />
<br />
Connect the camera to the PC via USB cable and<br />
turn the camera on.<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Computer...<br />
<br />
Look at the drive letters and see if one of them<br />
represents the camera. It may say Removable Disk<br />
<br />
If the camera is recognized...right click the drive letter<br />
and from the menu choose...Open or Explore.<br />
<br />
The directory of the memory card in the camera should<br />
be displayed and if you navigate through the various<br />
folders you should find the photo files.<br />
<br />
Once found...you can copy/paste the photos to a folder<br />
on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
Simple and best solution IMHO is to use an internal<br />
or external USB Memory Card reader.<br />
<br />
It won't drain your camera batteries and may be faster.<br />
FWIW...downloading from the camera when batteries<br />
may be low after a long photo shoot could result in<br />
corrupted photos.<br />
<br />
Do you have an internal or external USB Media Reader?<br />
<br />
Insert the memory card in the correct slot on the Media Reader...<br />
if any windows open...close them.<br />
<br />
When the card is inserted...if you go to...Start / Computer...is<br />
the card reader listed as one or more Removable Disks?<br />
<br />
Removable Disk (E:)<br />
Removable Disk (F:)<br />
Removable Disk (G:)<br />
<br />
If_Yes_you can download the photos from there. Left clicking<br />
the drive letter that corresponds to the memory Card slot should<br />
display the directory of the card and you can copy/paste or<br />
drag/drop the photos of your choice to a folder on your hard<br />
drive.<br />
<br />
Just right click a selected group of photos and choose...Copy...<br />
then navigate to the folder you want them in and right click the<br />
folder and choose Paste. <br />

<h2>            Phone &#35; rings on Another Person&#39;s Line</h2>
                    Since a couple days ago, my calls to a phone # in my Contact that I call regularly keep ringing on an unknown person's phone. It is annoying for me to not be able to get in touch with my parent and also for that person to be caught up answering my calls
 due to a Skype technical error in linking both #s.&nbsp; What should I do to correct the problem?

<p>I've been calling the phone # via Skype for over a year without any issues until last Friday. I always use Skype that is installed on my desktop computer to make calls. I have the most updated version installed on the desktop computer. So, I haven't had
 any technical issues using Skype on my desk top to call other #s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since writing the above, I tried again on my desktop to call the same phone # and it worked! Don't know if it is because I deleted the # from the contact as seen from one of the responses. Let's see if this action continues to work.</p>

<h2>            How do I unload W10 and revert back to W8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Seriously, W10 is the worst ever. &nbsp;I hate it. &nbsp;8 was bad, but at least it sort of worked and did what you want. &nbsp;10 just does its own thing and mostly doesn't do what's needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong with MS that it just keeps screwing up this way? &nbsp;Is the entire organization incapable of getting this sort of thing right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does one do to escape MS? &nbsp;(I hate Apple even more!) &nbsp;Any suggestions for how to set up a PC minus out-of-control software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I just tried to submit this post without selecting a "windows topic". &nbsp;It doesn't really fit any of them so I left the options unticked. &nbsp;But the good people at MS insist that I select a topic that doesn't actually fit my issue. &nbsp;That, it seems to me, is
 indiciative of the entire screwed-up attitude of the developers: do it our way or get lost. Frankly, I'd love to get lost. &nbsp;After over 30 years of using MS products, I am so fed up. &nbsp;I really don't want to run my life according to how you think it should be
 run, nor do I want o have a relationship with my PC, or the cloud, or the internet or anything else. &nbsp;I just want my PC to do what I want it to do, when I want it to do it. &nbsp;Should be simple, but it doesn't seem to be anymore.)</p>

                    <p>Got a second hand lapton that's been reformatted. it works fine except until it sleeps. When it does, it gets a BSOD, sometimes an hour later, sometimes two. it happened three or four times so far, with fair consistency.<br />
The message in the blue screen said DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE.<br />
I would like some help figuring out what's wrong so I can get to enjoying the new computer.<br />

<p><br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck
 Allow computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />

Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or...... (and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :&nbsp;Run DriverView&nbsp;- set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually hows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm<br />

</p><p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then
 HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.</p>

<p>Your BSOD probably looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/650327df-d3df-4087-99c6-fa6cccb272ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/650327df-d3df-4087-99c6-fa6cccb272ea" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Analyzing your crash dump file implicates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>BugCheck 9F, {3, fffffa8004319b50, fffff8000411d3d8, fffffa8005c068e0}<br />
<br />
Probably caused by : vgapnp.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>That vgapnp.sys file is the generic video driver that comes with Windows and if/since you reformatted the system you need to visit the Lenovo download site and get the video driver specific to your Lenovo system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crashes when sleeping or coming out of sleep are also indications of the wrong video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit the Lenovo Support Driver site for your model which is here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-g-series-laptops/g50-80/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-g-series-laptops/g50-80/downloads</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with downloading and installing this driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae2568d3-b169-445b-bdcb-e175991a425d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae2568d3-b169-445b-bdcb-e175991a425d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may need other drivers from Lenovo too (Network, USB, Audio, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that same page is an Auto-Detect feature which when launched may suggest other drivers for your system and if so consider installing them (but start with the video driver first):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b034af61-40de-4b5a-b7bd-067967832a08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b034af61-40de-4b5a-b7bd-067967832a08" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After installing the video driver if you have more problems you need to do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Desktop right click Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings and make it look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1846c190-a123-4853-a2b2-6cc724851ae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22b98868-0174-4e0a-8e83-61fa07122aa2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to create the Minidump folder as Window will create one if it needs to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK enough times to close all the dialog boxes and restart your system for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; After rebooting you can go back and check the settings again to be sure the adjustments "stick".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your next reply you can supply more information that will reduce the number of question asking message cycles if you will do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
</p>
<p>In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do whatever you have to do get the system to crash again and you should have a crash dump file to upload for analysis.

            <p>I am the Administrator, I should have all privileges. The reason that folder is there is because the 8.1 Upgrade put it there, I didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have had nothing but trouble with 8.1. It took the tech&nbsp;guys at MS hours to get the product activated as none of the 3 keys I had worked; they had to generate a new one.</p>

            It may be the same driver as the one you downloaded from System Insight but if not, it might be worthwhile to uninstall the one you have and try downloading the Windows 7 64-bit driver from Mitsubishi (Downloads and Accessories tab):&nbsp;
