<h2>            windows 10 mobile, some apps fail to launch</h2>
                    <p>i have a lumia 640, windows 10 mobile, os build# 10.0.15063.1266</p>
<p>
</p><p>several apps will launch to their "splash screen" [the screen that displays the company logo right after you tap to open the app], but will go no further than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>apps that i've discovered in this state include:&nbsp; lastpass, google, b2x-smartapp, skymap free</p>
<p>
</p><p>i really need lastpass and the b2x-smartapp is allegedly the support app for windows 10 phones, so that's a real problem, especially since i just installed it at the direction of the tech support people at "get help" to connect to the right support people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my phone windows is up to date, i have rebooted several times, i have uninstalled some apps, one at a time, rebooted, then reinstalled, i have emptied the temp folder for "this device" in the storage app, rebooted, down to the lowest amount of 112 kb [suggestion
 for another similar question in the forum]&nbsp; ALL TO NO EFFECT, THESE APPS WILL NOT PROGRESS BEYOND "SPLASH SCREEN"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this is a very recent development, i successfully used lastpass within the last 7-10 days, i need that app above all others...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...what do i do? this is my last hope, since the automated guy at 1-800-642-7676, lets me give some inputs, then politely hangs up.</p>

<h2>            NOKIA LUMIA 520- FLIGHT MODE AUTOMATICALLY ON</h2>
                    <div>
I TRIED AS PER BELOW INSTRUCTION. BUT STILL THE ISSUES PERSISTS. KINDLY ADVICE ON THIS ISSUE.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue on your Lumia 520 flight mode automatically being enabled or is stuck to
<strong>On</strong>, is caused by a software bug and can be resolved by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/11688/windows-phone-back-up-my-stuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Back up my stuff"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Back up your stuff</span></a></strong>.</li><li>Hard reset your phone:
<ol>
<li>Power off your phone.</li><li>Next press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button until it vibrates. Then, hold down the
<strong>Volume down</strong> button until you see an <strong>Exclamation</strong> point.</li><li>Press the <strong>Volume Up</strong>, <strong>Volume Down</strong>, <strong>Power</strong>,
<strong>Volume Down</strong> buttons in consecutive order.</li><li>You will see an animated gear icon on the screen indicating that the phone is resetting.</li></ol>
</li><li>After hard resetting, use the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Device Recovery Tool FAQ"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows
 Device Recovery Tool</span></a></strong> to restore your phone.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The flight mode will no longer be automatically enabled or be stuck to <strong>
On</strong> after using the said tool.</p>

<h2>            file&#47;save as&#47;save database as functions in new Access 2016 installation do not work</h2>
                    
<p>Office 2016 applications were installed under a subscription yesterday</p>
<p>but I am unable to use any of the options under file/save as menu</p>
<p>cannot make ACCDE; cannot backup database, etc</p>
<p>issue persists with either new Access 2016 ACCDB file or with ACCDB files from Access 2007 [but the files otherwise seem to work correctly in Access 2016; they are well developed and use VBA]</p>
<p>the install PC also has Access 2007 Runtime installed</p>
<p>any ideas why file/save as stuff will not work?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>I finally got the file/save as functions to work; turns out that the UI requires you to make a selection [of type], then click on a save as button; was able to make an ACCDE, and to backup DB</p>
<p>to me, this layout/workflow was very non-intuitive, since the selections display looked like command buttons to me</p>

            <p>Its is fairly easy but will take some time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move all your Office Data Files to new machine (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)</li><li>Next go to this webpage:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Save these direction and open so you can refer to them.</li><li>Follow all the steps:</li><li>Next, on the new machine download from:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-2011-digital-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/mac/office-2011-digital-download</a></li><li>Install using you current License key and activate on new machine</li><li>Check to see which version installed<br />
Microsoft Menu &gt; About Word (or Excel or PowerPoint)</li><li>If version not 14.4.4 or later go to Help menu and choose check for updates.</li><li>Run updater installing oldest version first and repeat until most current version is installed</li><li>Go to Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utilities:<br />
Run Repair Permissions (don't bother with Verify if nothing repaired it is verified anyway.)</li><li>Next Run Font book and resolve any Duplicate or defective Fonts.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Now open and see if working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's fairly easy if you follow steps, but does take time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your using Student/ academic version then it can't be done. Once installed it permanently wedded to the machine its installed on it uses the serial number of the Logic board and Hard drive and if either does not match then will not install. They do this
 because they are almost giving away the software in these versions. Even though they don't take into consideration that Hard Drives and logic boards do go bad and not that everyone is switching to solid state Drives will be even more of an issue. Because even
 a power surge could possibly fry a Solid State Drive.</p>

I believe Nokia's support team are alive and well but I would suggest you contact them if you want to find out:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4144989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4144989</a><br />
<br />
This is a user to user support forum.<br />
<br />
To hear the voice tag for a contact go to Contacts, open a contact, scroll to the detail with the voice tag symbol on the right (likes like a pac man face), Options, Play voice tag.<br />
<br />
If the voice tags are not being created automatically or are not being used then there may be a problem with your phone.

            Thanks for the comments... one additional note -<br />
I have done some investigation and find out the voice tags<br />
successfully created for the contacts I have configured manualy... but most of my contacts were sinchronised from Outlook.. so some of them got voice tag.. some has not...<br />
seems like process which is responsible to tag creation too slow to manage it during more or less fast sincronisation..<br />
I guess there should be the way to refresh tags offline.. after syncronisation... and as far as i know voice dialing products from third parties can do it ( at least on WM platform)

            Just another idea: voice tags have to be re-created when you switch language? At least it helped me when I saw strange behaviour of my E70 - voice dialing was often not activated or gave unreliable results. I swiched language to something and back and
 voila it worked again!

            Just in case someone else is struggling with an E70 that doesn't do what it says in the manual.<br />
<br />
I found that I couldn't get the voice recognition to work, had tried recording a tag for a contact, but couldn't get the phone to (a) replace the phone generated with my one or (b) select a contact when I spoke a contacts name. Best I could get was a change
 in profile.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the suggestion of changing the language to another - Netherlands in my case, (Menu, Tools, Settings, Phone, General, Phone Language) &amp; back again fixed the problem and the phone works as suggested. Slight oddity in that the phone didn't recognise the
 menu button when after rebooting following the language change, but did if I opened it out...<br />
<br />
I can now press the voice button; speak the contacts name; the phone finds it and repeats it back to me - is accurate too!

            <p>Hi BeckyStone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description provided, it looks like you get the smart screen filter that comes in the Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we need some more information about the issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When you a say filter, is it smart screen filter?</p>
<p>2. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps which should help you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the&nbsp;internet explorer safety troubleshooter and&nbsp; try to download.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Turn off the smart screen filter and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why does multiplying a custom h&#58;mm formatted cell, by an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctor-who  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does multiplying a custom h&#58;mm formatted cell, by an rate&#47;hour, then that by 24 work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got a spreadsheet that I'm using to track my hourly work on a project for billing. I'm tracking the time worked by entering it in the custom format of h:mm in the cells of a column. The summation works fine at the bottom of the column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in another column I've got the hourly rate, let's say $30/hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another cell I was multiplying the first data in the summation cell, by the hourly rate in the cell containing the hourly rate. The answer was way off. So I Binged it trying to find how to fix it, and I found some answers on various websites that said
 what I had to do was&nbsp;include&nbsp;in the multiplication I'd already done another term of 24. So if the summation cell was C20, and the cell that had the hourly rate was&nbsp;D20, and I wanted the answer to be in a third cell, let's call it E20, then the formula I had
 to put into E20 is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C20*D20*24</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works perfectly. It gives me the answer I need. But I don't understand <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
why</span> it works. Why do you have to include multiplying by 24?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simply multiply the summed time by the rate you will get the wrong answer and to understand why you have to understand how times are stored in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time is stored as a decimal. For example put 12:00 in a cell and format as general and you will see it is .5 or 1/2 a day, 6 PM would be .75. Now if the sum of your cells was 12:00 hours then that's .5 and what we really want is a decimal 12 hours and that
 where the 24 comes on because 0.5 * 24 = 12. 24 is used because there are 24 hours in a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can take this a stage further, say your rate was paid by the second and the sum of our time was again 12:00. There are 86400 seconds in a day (24hrs*60mins*60seconds) so if we multiply our 12:00 * 86400 we convert that time to seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This site covers this in detail.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Am wondering about the detection logic of Hotmail as my company emails keep getting right into Hotmail's Junk Mail folder.</p>
<p>A quick check on&nbsp;SPF, PCL, SCL, BCL couple with mxtool did not yield any suspicious result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be much appreciated if the expert can shed some lights.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask a question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, our company has Portal admin access for Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>But a lot of time, we have users requesting access for individual Teams site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will there be a timeline on how we can discover the individual teams? ( I believe there's a project related to that? :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much,</p>

<p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your clarification. For the teams that created by your users, , there are two ways for the other users want to join the team as follow:</p>
<p>

    <title>Nokia 101 Sim card error modifying sim contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdayee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 101 Sim card error modifying sim contacts</h2>
                    
<p>just got the nokia 101, seems like a nice phone but already running into problems.<br />
<br />
I am only using one sim card by the way.<br />
<br />
When I try and edit, modify or delete contacts on the sim card it says "Sim Card Error".<br />
I did manage at one point to get it to apparently delete contacts not getting any errors messages but the contacts were still there.<br />
<br />
What gives?<br />
<br />
Firmware 6.65&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sim card dates back to 2005-06, has been used in multiple phones and I have never encountered this problem.</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem. Two sim cards, can not edit, delete or add new contacts on either sim card. I have tried switching sim slot, tried only one sim at a time etc, nothing works. Also worth noting that the reset code *#7780# does not work. The
 phone is two days old.</p>

<p>Hi both,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an old SIM-card, please go to your operator and ask for a new one. If the issue persists and you have tried using the instructions in the
<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/apac/phones/guides/Nokia_101_UG_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
user guide</a>, peage 15, and&nbsp;the issue is still there, please take it to the retailer or local
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Care point</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jampe</p>

<p>First of all *#7780# and *#7370# codes do not work on this phone. If you enter them nothing happens. I have already done a factory reset from inside the menu and it did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second of all there is no USB port so I don't know we are expected to back up or reinstall using the Nokia Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third of all, what do you consider old for a sim card. Is one year old, two years, one month? What difference does it make, please elaborate.</p>

            soft reset in the parameters menu does not resolve problem,<br />
the *#7780# and *#7370# codes do not work. Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I just called my operator, they are sending me a new sim card, and I should have it in 5 days ... my phone will be disconnected till I get my the new sim card apparently....<br />
<br />
I really want to like this phone, despite it's various bugs and not so well thought out menu planning, but this experience is not turning out well.<br />
My first Nokia .... I hope it won't be my last, as if this problem isn't resolved with new sim I will sadly return the phone to the store.

<p>There is no chance that I have two fautly sim cards, considering they were working in previous phones. It is not likely that I will get it resolved since no one at nokia can offer any advice that works other than "take it to a care center". The problem is
 not unique to our handsets, I have read other examples of this. It is a pain to have to take a three day old phone to a care center. I have also spoken directly to someone from support at nokia, they also didn't know how to reolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, nobody has a clue. That won't do.</p>

<p>If you think the device is faulty, and you have already done all you can to resolve the issue, that unfortunately leaves only 2 options: To take it to Care point or to the retailer and see what they think.<br />

<p>i don't think the device is faulty. I think the operating system itself is faulty. I have just tried both sim cards in the nokia C1 phone. Everything works as it should, deleteing contacts etc. I think that the Nokia 101 can not read and edit sim cards properly.
 Is there anyway this can be escalated to higher powers?</p>

                    Since Friday's Windows upgrade, Outlook credentials keeps asking me for my password.&nbsp; I type it in and check remember, but it keeps popping up again and again.&nbsp; Have not been able to receive or send any emails since then.

            I ran the repair and that did not change anything. &nbsp;I updated. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;Talked to our company IT person and he fixed the issue. &nbsp;However, there was an update after that which messed it all up again.

<p><span>Dear Joshua,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried what you suggested with Word 2008 and Word 2011 using safe mode on my Mac. The space is still added with both of them when I do a replace using the clipboard contents. I'm not interested in later versions of Word. I use Find &amp; Replace
 a lot, and it is much quicker to use that in Word 2008 than later versions. I'm not interested in Office 365 because I understand you have to be on the internet to use that. I spend a lot of time in Burma (or Myanmar, if you prefer), and I have to pay by the
 minute to be on the internet -- when it works -- so none of the Cloud business is of any interest.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So it doesn't look like there's anything to do about my problem in Word 2008. C'est la vie!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best wishes,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>William</span></p>

                    <p><span>Outlook 2013 - Auto text and Building blocks do not save.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>In Outlook 2013, I have created multiple Building Blocks and Autotext entries that do not appear the next time Outlook is opened.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>They work fine for that session, but when I come back the next day they are gone.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I copied over the template from Word to get the original Building Blocks and Autotext entries, which do remain, it is just the new ones that disappear.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>I have checked the NormalEmail.dotm, the only attribute set is "A".</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The save date however, seems to be the last time I copied over the Normal.dotm.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I would assume that the save date should update periodically.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Any ideas how to fix this?

            <p>Mystery Solved…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem, as it turns out, is that Outlook would not save the NormalEmail.dotm template.&nbsp; As such, any changes I made were simply lost the next time I started Outlook.&nbsp; After much investigation, I stumbled upon a discussion related
 to Word that talked about templates, and compatibility to previous versions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In office 2013, I had copied the Word Normal.dotm template to make the NormalEmail.dotm.&nbsp; This was to copy all of the Autotext entries over to Outlook (the recommended way to accomplish this).&nbsp; As I understand it, this is the only method
 to share the Autotext between Word and Outlook.&nbsp; (poor design, but not part of this discussion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the reason the NormalEmail.dotm would not save, is that when it was in Word as the Normal.dotm, I had it set to be compatible with previous versions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently, Outlook does not know what to do with the compatibility setting,
 so it simply does nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I solved the problem by saving the Word Normal.dotm template as a current version (Office 2013), then recopying it over to the NormalEmail.dotm file.&nbsp; As a result, Outlook now saves the template properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing all of this down in the hope that if any else has this problem, this solution may help.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business Stops&#59; Requires Manual Intervention</h2>
                    <p>I have a OneDrive installation with my library at&nbsp;&nbsp;E:\{20676961}\OneDrive - jp***\</p>
<p>I have updated the registry to reflect this location and it works.</p>
<p>The problem is that this PC is the main server and it is not usually manned but I log into it frequently.</p>
<p>For some reason, onedrive stops working and comes out with a "OneDrive requires reconfiguration" or "close" option.</p>
<p>Whichever option I chose, onedrive is going to close by signing me out.</p>
<p>Here is where it gets frustrating and I need help.</p>
<p>When I want to sign in, I have to reenter the the library location again because it defaults to the user/onedrive location instead of the E:\{20676961\... location.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled onedrive, reinstalled windows (2ce) and I am now looking for ideas as to how to automate the restarting option.</p>
<p>I have looked at task scheduler but it seems that when onedrive stops, it does not generate an event so I can't use an event to resign in.</p>
<p>Even though the library location is in the registry, onedrive does not seem to refer to that.</p>
<p>Is there any tool I can deploy that will sign me in to onedrive when it closes?</p>
<p>Or is there a way I can create a task to automatically sign me out and sign me back in say every 2 hours?</p>
<p>I am a tenant so I don't have the admin access to both Office 356 and onedrive for business.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi Msoft329,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the registry key you used and it indeed doesn't work when reconfiguring the sync client. Actually, to set the default location, we use the GPO to configure to DefaultRootDir. For details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-group-policy-to-control-onedrive-sync-client-settings-0ecb2cf5-8882-42b3-a6e9-be6bda30899c#defaultrootdir_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set
 the default location for the OneDrive folder</a>. For depth assistance, you can turn to
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sharepoint/en-US/home?forum=winserverGP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
GPO forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the issue on your side, we don't have some methods to keep you logged in automatically. We'd like to know if you set the OneDrive to a common location c:\users\yourname\OneDrive-companyname, do you get the same crash issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>No updates unfortunately. I have accepted that the OneDrive for Business app is not perfect yet.</p>
<p>I am approaching the anniversary of my acquisition. I will need to review where I go with this.</p>
<p>Is it not possible to create a task that closes and reopens the OneDrive app and this will ensure my files are uploaded regularly and the bugging of the app after crashing stops.&nbsp; It will be a more proactive solution.</p>
<p>Can anyone help with creating a task to do this?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Sean,</p>

</p><p>There is no such a task. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your situation, to check if the issue is related to the location E drive. You can do a test by

<p>Hi&nbsp;ColoradoWealth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email account in your screenshots, shows that you are using an Office 365 account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask what the error message you receive if you sign in to Portal:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">portal.office.com</a>? If you would like to change your password, you
 could change it when you sign in to Portal. If your company registered for self-service password reset, you can change it yourself. If not, you could contact your IT department to change the password for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to have Teams for personal use, we suggest you use your personal account, like Outlook, Gmail or Yahoo. You can try this link to sign in:&nbsp;<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://teams.microsoft.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Colorado,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The forum does not have phone service. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The images you shared previously, the first one shows you cannot sign up with a work or school email address, Is it from Portal:&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">portal.office.com</a>? It does not have a link
 which can lead you to the next image to reset the password. Where did you go to the next one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process I am guessing is when you sign in to Portal, you input your account address &gt; click Next &gt; Click Forgot my Password &gt; The it comes to this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b186ea84-e1b1-43cc-a890-ddcf2a49753d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b186ea84-e1b1-43cc-a890-ddcf2a49753d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>After you ent the characters and the error that the ID does not exist showed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, we suggest you contact the IT department of your company since that is the most efficient way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot reach out to your IT department, we will need collect some information from you for further assist, please check your PM:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>.</p>

            Hi Ronald,
<br />
<br />Let's try this, these are the steps for windows 10:
<br />
<br />1. Press your "windows" logo key
<br />2. Type in "default app settings"
<br />3. Under Email set your default mail client as Outlook
<br />4. Reboot computer
<br />5. Try to activate again
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know how that works out!
<br />
<br />Thanks       
        </p>

<h2>            On premise Exchange archive not vissible in Outlook ProPlus 2013 &#40;E3&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm in the middle of migrating a client to Office365 E3. First thing we agreed to do is migrate from Office 2010 to Office 2013. (Office 2016 is not an option due to some incompatible/not supported add-ins). The client is still working in an on premise Exchange
 2010 environment and all employees have a mailbox and an on-line archive. In the "old" Office 2010 version I see my mailbox and my on-line archive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my test system I only see my mailbox and not my on-line archive. When I logon to the OWA is see the on-line archive.</p>
<p>The subscription product is Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus, Outlook version is 2013 (15.0.4779.1001) 32 bits which is installed on a fully updated/patched Windows 7 Ultimate 64bits Dell laptop.</p>
<p>The on premise Exchange version is 2010 Enterprise (version 14.3 build 123.4)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've think i've searched till the end of the internet but perhaps i missed a spot with the right answer. Is there anyone out here who had the same problem or can help me solve this strange problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance, Oscar</p>

<p>Hi Oscar,</p>
<p>Firstly, please note that the Outlook 2013 ProPlus provided by E3 is one of the right versions of Outlook client to support online archive. On my test lab, my Outlook 2013 is also 15.0.4779.1001. It shows my online archive mailbox. And as the archive mailbox
 are correctly displayed in Outlook 2010 and OWA, it indicates the server is working healthy. The issue might be related with the Outlook client itself. To troubleshoot the issue, I would like to confirm the information below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Do all Outlook 2013 users in your organization encounter this issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you tried a different network environment such outside of corp network?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can you send us the test email autoconfiguration result via PM for further investigation? Here are the steps to obtain them.<br />
-Press and hold the <strong>Ctrl key</strong>, right-click the Outlook icon in the notification area, and then click
<strong>Test E-mail AutoConfiguration.</strong><br />
-Verify that the correct email address is in the E-mail Address box.<br />
-In the <strong>Test E-mail AutoConfiguration</strong> window, click to clear the
<strong>Use Guessmart</strong> check box and the<strong> Secure Guessmart Authentication</strong> check box.<br />
-Click to select the Use AutoDiscover check box, and then click Test.<br />
-Then send us the results under tab <strong>Log</strong> and tab <strong>XML</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have sent you a PM to request this information. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message.<br />

<p>So happy new year to all of you and a quick update. It seems there is a problem with autodiscover. i can't connect to https://......../autodiscover/autodiscover.xml. There is however an other server on which i can connect to the xml file. I am checking IIS

<p>And i started 2016 by removing a check in IIS admin at the autodiscovery virtual site. I don't know why but there was a redirection set.</p>
<p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>In IIS admin (on the CAS/HUB server in my case) go to autodiscover</p>
<p>double click http redirect</p>
<p>Removed check at Redirect requests to this destination:</p>

<h2>            Office 365 keeps disconnecting from exchange and using windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Dear anyone who is an absolute genius!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling my well, you know my fingers off trying to get this intermittent disconnection to exchange&nbsp;with outlook 365&nbsp;(2016) sorted.
</p>
<p>As yet I have not find a permanent solution.&nbsp; I have only 3 users having this problem for months and they start thinking I'm an idiot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting done so far: (Note that the users are on a domain)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I ran both online and quick repairs from control panel (uninstall - change - repair) - This did not work.</p>
<p>2. I completely removed the user profile, recreated the profile and still had the issue.</p>
<p>3. I re-installed windows, load a new copy of office 365 and no luck. </p>
<p>4. First I thought it might have been a network issue, I removed the device(s) from the domain and still had the same issue.
</p>
<p>5. I've tried on a different network, and guess what!!! No luck either...so I did an IP release, IP renew method even went as far as static, yet no luck!</p>
<p>6. I've changed licencing in the hopes it might work...yet again the annoying fly was zooming in my ear.</p>
<p>7. I've changed the account to 2 different stores on exchange and still no luck..by this time I could've been the next South - African exchange scientist!!
</p>
<p>8. Disabled cloud services within group policies to see if this might have any affect.. NOT AT ALL!! BTW&gt;&gt;&gt;Cloud services is quite awesome!!</p>
<p>9. I logged a call on tenant.&nbsp;A super well spoken Microsoft office 365 engineer called back and requested troubleshooting logs both on the network and off the network (Domain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in progress as this is a 2 day process...</p>
<p>Hopefully he can provide an answer or do we have any idea what can cause this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly provide feedback, this will be highly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>Then...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I'd be glad to assist you with your issue wherein the Search function in Outlook.com is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non-functionality of the Search function usually occurs when your account has POP or other account configured with your email address. Please be informed that using POP Aggregation or manage email accounts with large volumes of mail can hit their max quota
 very quickly. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>When the mailbox is very large, the Search index may stop working and require re-indexing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a workaround, you can use a mail application such as&nbsp;</span><span>Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;</span>An email client has different search feature and it will index all of the emails to help him/her search them quickly.&nbsp;Windows Live Mail is a part of the
 Essentials suite and can be downloaded on this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you run the downloaded Essentials installer, you may choose to install all the Essentials products, or just the Windows Live Mail by checking next to it.</span></li><li><span>The instructions for how to set up Windows Live Mail and to make it work with your account can &nbsp;be found here:</span></li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>To further investigate your issue, kindly provide us with the following information.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you receive any error message after using the Search function? If yes, please specify the exact error message.
</li><li>Search keyword.</li><li>Screenshot of the issue.</li><li>Affected email address.</li><li><span>Fiddler trace logs</span></li></ul>

<h2>            I get error messages when trying to start word, excel, powerpoint, or onenote.</h2>
                    I just got my new computer last night. &nbsp;From the small store I bought it from, they installed Microsoft Home and Student 2010.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was using OneNote earlier this morning. &nbsp;It worked fine. &nbsp;I started to convert notes on paper to it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Later this evening, I noticed that the icons degraded. &nbsp;No longer were they their pretty thumbnails. &nbsp;Now, they are the default icons for programs with no thumbnail for an icon. When I try clicking them, I get various error messages. &nbsp;<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One error message says C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ Microsoft Share\office14\mso.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original&nbsp;installation&nbsp;media or contact your system
 administrator or the software vendor for support.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and then after I hit OK for that, it says the same exact thing for:</div>
<div>C:\PROGRA~2\COMMON~1\MICROS~1\OFFICE14\mso.dll</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and then finally:</div>
<div>This operating system is not presently configured to run this application.</div>
                </div>
