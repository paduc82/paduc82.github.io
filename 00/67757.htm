    <title>How can I reset my password to log into my computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andymagdaleno  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I reset my password to log into my computer&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;I can still log in with my built-in finger scanner when I first boot up my laptop, I just cant remember my password and would like to reset it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The real problem is whenever my computer goes in and out of sleep mode. When it comes back from sleep mode, its not letting me scan my finger anymore, and since I don't remember my password, Im forced to completely hard reset my computer. Its a hassle
 because I would always have something open and are unable to save it since I cant get back in.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I figured I could use the "password reset disk" option thinking that it would reset it completely for me, but it still asks me for my current password....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would really appreciate help from anyone with a solution to my problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

            Here you go:<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start button.<br />
2. Type the three letters cmd<br />
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
4. Launch the Console session as an Administrator.<br />
5. Type this command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "%UserName%"&nbsp; 123456 {Enter}<br />
<br />
This command will set your password to 123456. Note also that you are taking a big risk when you run Windows with a single admin account. It's like having just one key for your car. One little glitch can cause a huge problem. You should at all times have two
 fully tested and documented admin accounts. Having a password reset disk is good practice but it becomes totally useless unless you update the disk each time you change the password.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Before ...&#34;you can do this&#34; you must remove any accounts created since the update.&#34; error message on trying to revert back to previous Windows version on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 recovery to previous version blocked by Administrator account activation</p>
<p>I have updated a desktop from Windows 7, and a tablet from Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both have suddenly lost access to Start. The first time on my tablet I was lucky, and advice found here restored it, and I continued - confident that all would go well in the future. A fluke happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night it happened again - and now even right click on Start failed, search (cortana) failed, and most "Windows key" ' something failed. All I had done was try to reactivate my camera - and then it hung. A reboot, and start etc, disfunctional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I took the only option left open - reset with save of files. That also seems to remove the option to recover to previous version. The tablet I will deal with - it never has anything vital so I can just restore the original 8.1 and be done with it for
 now - i.e., wait until cannot return is no longer trending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my desktop, also a scare with start, but quickly resolved because I was experienced. However, I did not not like that the date was 12 hour format on the opening login screen, and to change that I found an article that stated I needed to enable the administrator
 account to change the default date setting for all accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did that, disabled the account as all was well - I thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I do not want the same sort of bad experience I had the night before with my tablet I want to return to my old environment while I can - except the recovery option says I cannot because "Before ..."you can do this" you must remove any accounts created
 since the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove the Administrator account and come back</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I could enable the account again, but I could not/cannot delete it - default account :p at me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how is this chicken (me) to lay it's egg (go back to Windows 7 aka previous version)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your suggestions - the clock ticks (I work away from home, so I will not be able to try any suggestions for a few days - please keep making suggestions I shall reply as soon as I am able, one way or the other!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>

            <p><span>Hello Michael,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will be able to rollback to the previous version of Windows after deleting the additional user accounts created after upgrading to Windows 10 OS. The P cannot be restored to the previous
 Windows version unless the user accounts created after upgrading to Windows 10 is deleted/removed from the laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to delete the user accounts created (even if it is an administrator account) after upgrading to Windows 10 by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Follow the steps below to delete/remove the user accounts created after upgrading to Windows 10 OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Settings</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Accounts</strong> and select <strong>Family &amp; other users</strong> from the left side panel of the window.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>
Other users</strong> click on the user account and click on <strong>Remove</strong>. Do the same to other user account if there are more than one account created after upgrading to Windows 10.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if you are able to rollback to previous Windows version.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Transfer the important files &amp; folders present in the deleted user profiles to user profile which
 was initially present before upgrading to Windows 10 by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + E</strong> keys on the keyboard to open <strong>File explorer</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
This PC</strong> located at the left side panel of the window to open the drives of the PC.</span></li><li><span>Go to <strong>
users</strong> folder by opening the <strong>C:</strong> drive. </span></li><li><span>From <strong>users
</strong>folder, locate the user folder you want to move files from and copy the important files. After copying the files delete the user folder.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Step one - I had already tried. I would have to be blind to not have seen those steps before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, please note, it is not 'an' administrative account; rather, it is THE default administrator - which has description: "Built-in account for administering the computer/domain"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled the account, logged in to this account to change a global setting (time format login screen when system starts) - and then disabled it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Step 1: the account "Administrator" is not in the list of other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I shall try doing only step 2 and delete any files I find behind 'User': Administrator and see if that helps.</p>

            <p>Well, it started, but now things are MUCH MUCH worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting "Administrator" has ended in a near dead Windows 7 system,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It tries to boot, goes to auto repair, that is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The details are now:</p>
<p>Problem signature:</p>
<p>Problem Event Name: StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Problem signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385</p>

<p>Problem signature 05: Autofailover</p>
<p>Problem signature 06: 2</p>
<p>Problem signature 07: BadPatch</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as my W7 media is bad I am in process of downloading media and getting ready to burn it (except where shall I burn it - that is the computer that still has a DVD that can write!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very unhappy camper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not follow the instrcutions above if you have an issue with your administrator account. What I did not want to have to do was reinstall all my applications!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft&nbsp; - PLEASE improve W10 so that questions about recoivery to previous version is not trending (better fix start menu so it does not trend as help request #1 or #2!)</p>

            <p>Further update:</p>
<p>a) cannot download media because I cannot access computer to determine number</p>
<p>b) since I did an online update way back when to W7 Pro - can I access the number via my old live.com ID?</p>
<p>c) digging further into what Windows 7 says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Root cause found:</p>
<p>Unknown bug check: Bugcheck 7e: Parameters = 0xffffffff80000003,</p>
<p>0xfffff880046f10f5, 0xffffff880009a9328, 0xffffff880009a8b80</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repair action: System files integrity check and repair</p>
<p>Result: Failed: Error code = 0xa</p>
<p>Time taken 4446 ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for posterity - is this because I deleted the "Administrator" files while it was running as Windows 10 (and Windows 7 is missing something is expects). Or is this something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. A quick reply - even if to only say we see this and are studying - would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Just got an email asking me if this has been resolved - and if not, to provide extra info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extra info is that I have provided the extra info and not received any additional comments or suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did spend a long time on the phone discussing options.</p>
<p>a) as I did an online upgrade from Home to Pro, and no longer have the mail (computer down, recall) I cannot get a new Pro key.&nbsp;so I cannot download a new Pro DVD iso to see if I can repair it that way, before just doing a fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) recommendation - if you can still boot your original windows 7 (or 8) system, use a third party tool to extract your activation code and save/PRINY that elsewhere. If you are lacking media (that works, as I, DVD is Home version, not Pro) use that number
 to download the ISO now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) I have a second license, but that activation code is not recognized by the download application - that shall be my next call to MS support - to understand why an official - unused - pro code (but wrong language) is not recognized at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, MS whoever reads these forms - problem is not solved. I am thinking more and more about Ubuntu these days. I do not want Linux as a laptop, but being a mointh with a crashed compoter because I can not access boot media is also a major pain. MAJOR!!!</p>

                    I upgraded my computer from Vista Home Premium to 7 Ultimate and now it won't start, it goes to the system recovery screen. I go through the options, selecting language, operating system and then startup repair but it comes back saying it found nothing
 wrong but it still won't boot. I even tried by inserting Windows 7 disc and booting from cd rom. Any help would be much appreciated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have moved this to the appropriate category.&nbsp; If you browse through the Install, Upgrade and Activate forum you may find some other threads with this type of issue.&nbsp; One thing to try is to disconnect all external devices (except keyboard, mouse and monitor)
 and then try to run the repair.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could use some more information as well.&nbsp; When you upgraded, did it finish the upgrade?&nbsp; Did you ever get to the desktop?&nbsp; Are you able to press F8 at boot up and boot to Safe Mode?&nbsp; Do you have your data backed up so that you can do a custom install
 and format the drive?&nbsp; If not you can do custom install and it will move the current Windows directory to a Windows.old folder.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>What antispyware did you run and what anti-virus program are you using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run msconfig, disbable all in the Startup Tab, reboot, accepting the warning how does it then run?</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to also&nbsp;run the System File Checker Tool&nbsp;just to make sure everything is correct in the System Files.</p>

<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 7 &#38; Lexmark C500N</h2>
                    Hi ... I consciously elected to acquire a new laptop with Windows 7, the full version (not the startup version).&nbsp; I'm now seeing that my printer, a 4 year old Lexmark C500N (color laser) is not a supported printer (Lexmark defines as non compatible with
 Win7, i.e., they didn't spring the resources to fund the effort).<br />
<br />
Any ideas on an alternate printer type/model&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;get the printer to work?&nbsp; I've tried posting as a Lexmark C510, that didn't work.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Chris

 Netherlands Antilles or Caribbean Netherlands. I don't think I can use Skype for Windows 10 because my computer does not operate on Windows 10. Will it work even if I don't have Windows 10?

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<h2>            Take me through the steps of a Windows 10 Store purchase to make it available to family&#47;kids on other devices.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using my own admin Microsoft Account on Device A (PC).</li><li>Have my 'Family' set up with two children in it in my account settings.</li><li>Have all my devices showing (8 devices), these are all devices I and my children have accounts on.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>On master device A (PC) buy an app for $.99 Rabbids Invasion or similar from Windows Store.</li><li>Get charge notification.</li><li>Go to device B, login as child.</li><li>Go to Windows Store and Rabbids Invasion app.</li></ol>
<p>--</p>
<p>What should be expected to happen here at this next step?</p>
<p>Should the child be able to hit buy/install and have the app come down without an additional charge?</p>
<p>Can I then do this on every other device with every other user?</p>
<p>I should be able to install the app 10 times, but is that once per user per device or 10 times total mixing and matching (2 users, 4 devices for 8, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an up to date FAQ that deals with this?&nbsp; You used to have to change to the adults account in the store to use their payment options.</p>

            <p>No those didn't address the questions I asked as those articles are 8.1 specific.&nbsp; There is no logging in as another person's account in Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, here is what I found after experimentation.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On Master PC (A) with my own account as parent bought Minecraft for Windows 10.</li><li>Logged in to PC (B) as my daughter.</li><li>Went to store and found Minecraft.</li><li>It was listed w/ the option to buy.</li><li>Chose to buy.</li><li>Entered in her password.</li><li>It checked for license information and then downloaded the game and allowed her to play.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So basically you have to buy the game as the parent first, then you can install it on one of your 'devices' that your child has an account on and presumably the child must be in your family account.&nbsp; In app purchases at this point are unknown.</p>

<h2>            Money being taken from credit card, but nothing being added to my account.</h2>
                    
<p>My XBox Live expired a while back, and I have been trying to purchase Gold again. I constantly got error messages while it was loading and while I attempted to purchase a monthly subscription, so it was never added to my account. I finally got it to work
 with a different credit card, but I checked the other card's balance today, and it said that XBox Live had taken 19.98 (two months) and 12.49 (3 months @ 50% off) off of my card, but these items were never added to my membership. What do I do?</p>

<p>since you are gold 2 things. first</p>
<p>recover your gamertag if it is silver</p>
<p>however goto <a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://billing.microsoft.com</a> to make sure the transactions went thru on the account you are looking at</p>
<p>please check all your different accounts</p>
<p>also when you purchase and redeem multiple memberships it stacks ontop of your current membership and only show when they are used so as long as its in your billing.microsoft.com they are there but just haven't applied till your current membership is done
 the next purchase will apply and then the next after that but either way your expiray date should reflect&nbsp;time added</p>

<p>The only reason it would take two months is if it could not take payment for two months. Looks to me as if the card was being declined several times due to invalidity. &nbsp;This backed up the outstanding balance, which is why adding a new card cleared the balance.
</p>
<p>You should not receive the two one-months that backed up as I imagine they're expired. The three month however, you should sign out and sign back in, or delete and recover your account to reflect the true status.</p>

<p>After checking on your account, I only see one purchase for a discount on 3 months of LIVE time. It is possible that your payment method put a temporary hold on the funds associated with the failed transactions. If that is the case, you will need to contact
 your bank. If you have any further questions about your account, you can contact phone support for more in-depth billing information.</p>

                    <p>Voici la discussion que je viens d'avoir avec le service tchat d'aide de la xbox (en gras la réponse) :
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have a very poor internet connection, so I want to connect our xbox one s directly with the freebox plug of our tv</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I do not find something about that kind of connection on xbox site</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is it possible ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Just to check if I understand your issue properly<br />
You are having issues trying to connect your Xbox One S console to your TV ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">no, not with our TV but the TV "plug" of Free</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have this internet box :</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://www.free.fr/freebox/freebox-revolution</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and there are two freebox the main one and the TV one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And I want to link directly the xbox one to the TV Free box, to have a good internet connection, the best that we can have, and not with the wifi,because the wifi is not good in our home</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I understand completely what you wish to achieve</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">thanks Manuel</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Alright I have checked on this case right now </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>And currently our consoles are not compatible with the Freebox connections</strong><br />
What you can do is connect your console directly to your router to have a better access to internet</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>[Mod Removed - Inappropriate]</strong> I'm disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:(</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Actually the option to connect the console to the Freebox is something that we can take as feedback so in the future we can get our services better<br />
Please share this scenario on our community forums so our community and higher ranks can check on your situation and this is a detail that can be improved on the future

<p>Hello Annabelle!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! At this time, as our chat support agent has confirmed, you will not be able to connect the Freebox to the Xbox One console. If you are trying to connect the Xbox one to your Freebox as a WiFi source, you will not
 be able to do so as the two are not compatible with one another. I would suggest trying to find another source to connect to when trying to connect to a WiFi connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further questions please feel free to reply back letting us know, or reach out to
<a href="https://www.free.fr/freebox/freebox-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Freebox</a> and see if they have any further information to add or provide them with feedback regarding becoming compatible with the Xbox One console. Thank you again for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 4 удалилась сама. Снова начав загрузку игры, она дошла до 40ГБ и началась сначала. Не знаю, заняли ли эти скачивания место на диски, так как папка с играми Майкрософт недоступна. Сейчас качаю игру снова, не думаю, что заработает. Играл примерно
 неделю. Потом после перезагрузки ПК она внезапно пропала. И, еще раз напомню, при загрузке, дошла до 40 ГБ и началась сначала.</p>
<p><strong>[Translation-Forza Horizon 4 retired itself. Once again, starting to download the game, it reached 40GB and started again. I don't know if these downloads have taken up space for the discs, as the Microsoft game folder is not available. Now I'm rocking
 the game again, I don't think it's going to work. Played for about a week. Then, after the PC reboot, it suddenly disappeared. And, once again, when downloading, reached 40 GB and started again]</strong></p>

<p>Hi there! Hopefully I got this right as I had to use google translate, but I’d refer you to this thread about the Game Pass PC Beta. There have been some issues, but is is still in Beta, so if you can please make sure to report this through the error reporter
 so the team can fix it infuture releases. Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi Egor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. We understand your download has restarted. Please make sure that it is not the update, as the update for the game when you install is pretty big also. If it has restarted, wait until it installs see if it stays installed.
 If not, then power down your PC completely, wait a couple minutes to turn it back on. Once on then try to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall the game of whatever is there, then reinstall the game</a>. As mentioned there have been issues with this game. You can also try posting on the
<a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_forum18_Forza-Horizon-4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza forums</a>.</p>
<p>
