<p>I posted this in the general discussion but I didn't realise it wasn't the Australian general discussion. So posting it again.</p>
<div>
<p>Hey all, is there a currently operating Australian Xbox or general gaming guild devoted to grown ups with kids and jobs who can't play 8 hours a day?</p>
<p>I've become extremely disenchanted with online gaming and how poorly it caters to casual gamers who love games but through the passage of time have found their leisure allowance dwindle away to barely a dozen hours a week.</p>
<p>I'm tired off: <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-9.gif" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Never ever turning on my mic </li><li>Auto muting all the squealing voices in Halo matchmaking </li><li>Auto muting people playing Linkin Park/iron Maiden/metallica at 1000 decibals into their mic
</li><li>Getting spawn killed&nbsp;in objective based&nbsp;games by kids who just want to boost their stats
</li></ul>
<p>I'm looking for a guild for people in their late twenties or thirties who just want to get together online and play the latest MP games, Gears, Halo, CoD, Brink, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Monday Night Combat,&nbsp; Killzone 2/3, Bad Company, Shadowrun (come
 on, some one must still play it) and anything else people are keen to play. Bottom line I just want to enjoy games again. I haven't enjoyed a multiplayer game experience since Rainbow 6 Vegas.</p>
<p>If such a guild exists please direct me to it, if not drop some expressions of interest and we'll see about starting our own.
</p>

<p>A good friends list solves at least one of the problems you mentioned, but no clan is really going to solve the rest.</p>
<p>Squealing 12-16 year old idiots, playing music through their headsets and spawn-killing team mates, will always be there.</p>
<p>You could try clans like TOG (The Older Gamers) and I think there might be one or two more, but that'll only serve the same purpose as a good list of older friends and you'll still have to mute, or stay out of, public lobbies.</p>
<p>You can add me, if you like (over 40) and there are a few other regulars here who are of a similar age and should be happy to have you.</p>

<p>I am not into clans as such but am willing to play some online games. I think I have traded most of my big name MP games but the 2nd half of this year will see quite a few MP games added to the pile.</p>
<p>Not sure if Dad's Army is still going or if it has changed its name.</p>
<p>Actually I still have both Gears, Halo 3 and Reach but I think I traded Bad Company 2 and the CODs.</p>

<p>If you want a serious band of hardcore gamers that have l33t skills and the precision of a special forces squad then keep looking.</p>
<p>If you want a rag-tag collection of Aussie gamers with ages 25 and upwards - and the skills of the comatose - then Mojo gaming is exactly what you need.
</p>
<p>I stumbled upon Mojo care of a thread like this one about four years ago and I love it. It's relaxed, mature and not at all competitive.</p>
<p>We love console gaming, we're crap, at least mostly, and we don't care because it's all about having a good time and talking a great big barrow load of garbage.</p>
<p>And laughing. That most of all.</p>
<p>Come over, introduce yourself and try it out, but don't tell them I sent you or you'll never get in.

<p>Pretty small at the moment but we are trying to grow into a larger community. </p>
<p>We are an 18+ clan and &nbsp;we play a wide range of games. </p>
<p>We normally just play for a few laughs, but play the right way, so no cheating, glitching or talking rubbish in lobbies.

<p>I'm 22 and I have yet to face the problem with kids playing online, then again I have not had mine for very long.</p>
<p>I'm a definite casual gamer. The only time I get to play as of late is either after work whenever I decide to kick back and progress further in a game or when I decide to dedicate a day or two on the weekend to just gaming.</p>
<p>I have mic but I it has yet to leave its package. If anyone would like to add me then feel free, I'm always looking for those who also play games in common.</p>

<h2>            Fable...</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so I last night I decided to download the first Fable and spent 800 MS points on it.</p>
<p>The game downloaded fine but when I went to play it I got an error without an error code. So I deleted and re-downloaded it several more times as well as changing the location I downloaded it to. Switched between a 32GB USB Drive, the 4GB Internal Memory
 and the 320GB HDD.</p>
<p>Cleared the cache and re-updated as well. Still the game wouldn't work!</p>
<p>So, I went and searched the Xbox support forums and found out that the 4GB Slim Model can't play Original Xbox Games. Now... If I had known this prior to purchasing it I wouldn't have bothered wasting 800 points on it. I know in the Details section of the
 Game it says, "No Refunds." but WTF man? Nowhere does it say, "This game won't work with the 4GB S Model."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there nothing that can be done? I have absolutely no way of playing this game other than buying a different model of the Xbox 360. Screw that.</p>
<p>If I do decide to get a new console any time soon I doubt it'll be an Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Its not that the Xbox 360 S can not play original xbox games, its that the 4GB flash memory does not have the emulator required to play the original xbox games. Only official Xbox HDD hard drives have it, and it is hard coded into the hard drive. So it should
 work with your 320GB HDD. What you should do is download it to your hard drive, and then delete the system update.</p>
<p>This is how,</p>
<p>System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X, Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X &gt; Yes
</p>
<p>Then once you start your xbox and connect to xbox live, you will be prompted to re download the system update. If this does not help or if you have any questions, let us know.

<p>Xbox Originals like fable do work with an xbox 360 4GB model, but only with an official Microsoft Xbox hard drive installed. &nbsp;These come in sizes of 250GB and 320GB. &nbsp;You stated that you have a 320GB HDD, is this an official hard drive? &nbsp;if it is then your
 problem could just be that the Xbox software did not update properly. &nbsp;To fix it all you have to do is delete the update and redownload it again. &nbsp;To do this you follow these instructions: on the xbox go to settings - system - storage - then with the controller
 press LB - RB - X - LB - RB - X then select yes.</p>

<p>Some additional info that I just noticed. Every time I download the Game and then go to view it in the My Games section, the cover art doesn't render. Instead there's a pic of a white xbox controller on a grey background and when I go into Game Details,
 the overview page is blank. There's no Description, Screenshots, Additional Downloads, etc.</p>

<p>It's downloading right the to 320GB HDD. No where else for most games to go since there's less than 2GB of Internal left. Most of the time I don't get the option to choose where things are downloaded, the 320GB is usually the default.</p>

<p>Less than 2 G left? &nbsp;Storage is an issue here. &nbsp;What was the game downloaded to first? &nbsp;You mention a USB device.... Internal memory and a HDD. &nbsp; Have you tried to clear out any unused content for more space?? &nbsp;IMO- 320 GB HDD is a LOT of usable space. &nbsp;Only
 &nbsp;2 GB left is an issue &nbsp; GOOD LUCK!!!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 6 Marvell WiFi and Asus AIMESH - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 6 Marvell WiFi and Asus AIMESH</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased the Surface Pro 6 256gb and have an issue with my wifi at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Asus Aimesh system with a GT-AC5300 as the main router and a Blue Cave as a node. I have had no issues with over 35 devices,&nbsp; but the Surface Pro will&nbsp; not work with the node. If I am downstairs I have full service when connected to the router,
 but if I venture upstairs, I can no longer connect. SID Is the same for the router and node so that I have seamless access throughout the house. I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Changing the registry entry as per solution suggested here</p>
<p>2. Locking to 5ghz and/or 2.4ghz on the Marvell adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current workaround is to connect to my guest network, which is only served by the main router. This results in poor connection upstairs and requires me to open my network to the guest network which I would prefer not to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any known issues with aimesh or any suggestions to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
                </div>

<h2>            Arc Keyboard - 10 seconds LED light</h2>
                    <p>My Arc Keyboard is not responding anymore. When I put new batteries, the green led turns on, a high pitch noise starts, and after ten seconds the led fades away and anything works anymore.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10, it was working normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already installed Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center. It recognises the keyboard and transceiver.</p>
<p>Windows recognise it too. It even plays the sound of plugin the transceiver in and out and in different ports.</p>
<p>The Fn + Esc key doesn't work to turn it on.</p>
<p>There's no typing during the 10 seconds green light.</p>
<p>I have to remove the batteries and place it again to see the green led, and the 10 seconds of duration begin and fades away again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any hints?</p>

            The high pitched sound would indicate the keyboard has failed. It is often an indication of a heavily overloaded power supply.

<h2>            Reg.exe has stopped working on windows 7 64bit when I want to play an old game.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hello guys. I am using windows 7 Home premium 64bit in my laptop. I have just downloaded an old game (2005-2006 maybe) that I wanted to play so much. After I finished downloading it (no viruses, I have checked it), and I run the executable files, the message
 occurred: Reg.exe has stopped working. and the game won't start.</p>
<p>The game has a reg.exe application file inside, and I think I have to run it manually. but when I wanted to run it, the same message occurred.</p>
<p>This is the error log:</p>
<p><strong>Problem signature:</strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong>Problem Event Name: BEX</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Application Name: reg.exe</strong><strong><br />

<br />
I have ever asked in a computer forum, but they said it is the bit problem. and I have read in microsoft help, the reg.exe will not work in 64bit windows. I have read the conclusion, but this is for windows server 2003, not windows 7. it is said that I have
 to type <strong>reg query \\64server\HKLM\software /reg:64</strong> or if I &nbsp;want to change it to reg.exe 32bit, I have to replace the reg:64 with reg:32.</p>
<p>Is there any other conclusion of this problem instead of installing the 32bit operating system?</p>
<p>How about the XP mode for windows 7, will it work?</p>
<p>Help me please.. thank you very much.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

            <p>Hello Cata,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience and at the same time we appreciate the effort you have put in to resolve the issue. Let me assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to assess the issue better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC you are using?</li><li>What is the host operating system installed in your computer from which you are trying to upgrade to Windows 10?</li><li>Are you using Windows update settings or Media Creation tool to upgrade to Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Windows </strong><strong>7</strong> and <strong>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, refer to the below Microsoft Help Article on <strong>Troubleshoot common Setup and Stop Errors during Windows 10 Installation
</strong>and check if it helps to resolve the issue. </p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue and lets Windows to upgrade successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>The issue might not be necessarily dependent on the Windows update services/components. There might be scenarios, wherein&nbsp;it may be a combination of third party software and anti-virus/malware software might cause such issues.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So, place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A <strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also,&nbsp;verify that you have disabled any other&nbsp;third party real-time antimalware products that were installed on your PC, to check if any how incoming/outgoing connections to the PC are affected by the firewall.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue may also happen due to system file corruption. I suggest you to run System file checker. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly
 follow the below given steps:</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open Command Prompt in Windows.</span></p>

<h3> charlotterobinson-rocca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidently Shut Down ASUS Windows 10 Laptop While Updating, and Now All I See is a Loading Screen</h2>
                    My ASUS Windows 10 laptop was updating. It said it was 30% done, and around 5 seconds later it said "Restarting". I looked and I saw a white dotted loading icon at the bottom. I waited for around 10 minutes, and then got tired of it and turn off my computer.
 I turned it back on, it showed the ASUS symbol and stuff that would normally show up for a boot, but then it went back to the loading icon, spinning round, and round,&nbsp;and round, on the bottom of the screen. I've been sitting here looking for an answer for
 about 10 minutes now and I still have found nothing. Am I the first to encounter this problem? I tried pressing f8 because I saw people talking about that, so I pressed it repeatedly, but still nothing. I don't think I can take the battery flat out of the
 bottom because it's screwed in and I don't want to try to mess with that. I could always try to let the battery drain out, but I still don't think it'd work. Any help?

            F8 is not a function in Windows 10. If it still shows spinning dots you need to wait. It does depend which update it was doing. If it was the anniversary update then it could take 2 hours to complete. So the first thing is wait and see if it progresses.

    <title>TabletInputService, Cortana, &#38; Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taellosse  say:</h3>
<h2>            TabletInputService, Cortana, &#38; Games</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I'm running Windows 10, up to date. I'm aware that there are several games - Fable 3 and Skyrim are a couple examples - that crash to desktop every 15 minutes without warning or error message because there's some kind of back-end resource conflict
 with the Windows process TabletInputService, which I gather automatically checks (for some reason) for a touchscreen at that interval. The only solution to this problem of which I am aware is to disable the service. This seems like a stupid problem - I don't
 understand why Windows would do this to begin with and I know this resource conflict is at least as old as Windows 10, and possibly goes back as far as 8, so it really should have been fixed by now - but since I don't have a touchscreen connected to my desktop,
 I figured keeping this process off was no big deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except I've discovered that for reasons that make no sense to me this process is apparently necessary to type, using a perfectly ordinary external USB keyboard, in any of the Windows-10-specific search fields. This includes the Cortana search box on the
 Start bar, as well as any search fields in Control Panel or Settings. It does NOT include typing in Windows Explorer's search box OR any programs, ONLY search boxes in Windows-10 style windows. If TabletInputService is disabled, I cannot search for anything
 in the Start bar or for any Windows functions in Settings (whose locations I often forget, because more and more of them are moved to new places from where they've been for the last several iterations of Windows, or replaced with completely new ones).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, this is a pain. Is there a way to retain basic functions of Windows using an ordinary keyboard without this badly-written background process interfering with my normal use of my computer? And if there is not, can someone PLEASE address this
 resource conflict bug with TabletInputService already? I've personally been running into it for at least 2 years, and I'm sure it's been bothering others for even longer.</p>

            <p>Hi Brock,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 3 choices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) <strong>stay with 1511</strong>.&nbsp; Run the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Show/Hide Updates</a>.&nbsp; This will keep you going until M$ ends support for that build (and it's not like your machine's going to up and quit, afterwards).</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) <strong>install 1607</strong>.&nbsp; Do the upgrade manually (ie: download the ISO or .esd and run from there), or clean install (which, if 1607 works on your machine at all as it probably will, is the better choice of the two)
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[edit: sorry, I missed where you said you've clean installed a few times....
<strong>to clarify, a "clean install" means wiping your disk completely then starting fresh</strong>, just like it's a new computer.&nbsp; Obviously you want to save your personal files off to the side, then reintegrate them as well as reinstalling your programs,
 afterwards]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>c) <strong>go back to the previous OS</strong> - Once done, this option is the least amount of bother.&nbsp; If the added features available in Windows 10 aren't useful to you, then why upgrade in the first place ?&nbsp; This gives you probably longer support than
 1511.<br />

<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often
<br />
the total process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - <br />
Driver's Tab -&nbsp;click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK
<br />
the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>
Even <br />
if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue&nbsp;below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could <br />
have a loose cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and
<br />
other issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or <br />
other </strong><strong>programs </strong><br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check <br />
cables in both&nbsp;ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can <br />
often clean the power and&nbsp;data contacts with a pencil eraser.<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System <br />
maker and&nbsp;device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case
<br />
( CD &amp; DVD&nbsp;burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to <br />
not function while the others&nbsp;do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There
<br />
are some&nbsp;registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" <br />
be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware <br />
updates</strong> and the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-<br />
keys of course&nbsp;as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific
<br />
keys involved as well as&nbsp;the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<br />
Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore <br />
Point before changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p><br />
DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, <br />
which displays&nbsp;all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

    <title>Error code 0x80070035 on trying to access share - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sausagecreature  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 0x80070035 on trying to access share</h2>
                    <p>I have two Win7 machines. I use shares to pass files between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked well for a couple of years or more, but stopped working this week. I can ping the machines from each other, but cannot access network shares. I receive&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">Error
 code&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">0x80070035</span> and a message to the effect that the device is unreachable. Which it isnt, because I can ping it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Footnote</strong>, this seems a by product of the rather messy architecture that MS have propogated. Surely back in the pre-win Vista days, solving a network issue would be done in the net work properties area of the OS, these days it seems I have
 to consider policies, registry, network settings, firewall, av, stopping and starting myriad related services. What a mess MS has made of this kind of thing.

<p>Interesting, I ran the key manager from the command prompt :&nbsp;</p>
<p>rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then removed the share from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to reconnect, I was prompted to and supplied the login details for the other user. Same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly Windows can see the other machine, depsite saying it cannot. I can still ping it, and I am prompted for login info if I remove the cached login credentials. But still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas which machine I should restore? The one hosting the files, or the one accessing the files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            You can try the system file checker or DISM commands. If those don't work, you can perform a repair upgrade.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try repair upgrade:
