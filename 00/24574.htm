            Hi Avail,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft My Phone.&nbsp; I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble logging into the service.&nbsp; It sounds like there might be an issue with your data connection on the device.&nbsp; Can you load a web page in IE from your phone?&nbsp; If that works,
 could you reply back to this thread and let us know which phone you are using and who your mobile operator is?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Richie Weldon<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I am having the exact same problem. <br />
<br />
This is what I have done so far..&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I had myphone on a mogul phone and was working fine. I am upgraded to the touch pro 2 but did not have the application on there. I downloaded the application to my phone after the official release. My Carrier is Sprint<br />
<br />
I installed the myphone application on my Touch Pro 2 ..&nbsp; <br />
When I log in I am using a gmail account that is associated for my windows live id..&nbsp; I can log in absolutely fine into my windows live account and I can log into the myphone website with no issues whatsoever.
<br />
<br />
When I try to log into the myphone application on my phone I get a authentication error saying my password or username is incorrect.
<br />
<br />
I have re-downloaded, reinstalled, did a soft reset of the application.. Still will not work.
<br />
When I log in I type my email address and since there is not a option for the @ slide down menu for gmail , I choose other..<br />
Type in my password..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Can you please come up with a fix for this ..<br />
<br />
Alex<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Hi there -<br />
<br />
It seems this is an issue that a lot of people are running into.&nbsp; If you select the @other in the drop down when supplying your Live ID credentials, make sure you delete the @other text and only type in the information that relates to your email address' domain.&nbsp;
 For example, @gmail.com for GMail accounts would need to be typed in.&nbsp; I believe this should solve the issue, but if it doesn't please let me, or anyone else who worked on the My Phone product, know!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Richie Weldon<br />

<h2>            14965  and 14971 install issues</h2>
                    <p>I have tried many variations of installing these 2 builds . <br />
originally I created an iso using the decryption and iso tools .</p>
<p>I tried both wim and esd versions of the install iso's.</p>
<p>I also downloaded from Microsoft sight the latest (14965) iso.</p>
<p>I have used the diskpart to create the bootable media on multiple USB hard drives and have (up to these builds) had no problem installing to both dedicated and multi boot configurations.</p>
<p>the present issue happens after the Custom install screen .</p>
<p>The window dispays the target drive and respective partitions and/or unallocated spacebut fails with the following .</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one . For more information , see the setup log files ."</p>
<p>
</p><p>No log files are ceated because I booted from usb and as I can still do a successful install using the same media created with previous builds&nbsp; ie. up to 14959 , I am 99%sure the problem is in the builds.</p>
<p>I can use the same media as upbuild from 14393, 14931, 14959 and possibly 42 and 55.</p>
<p>I can also install 65 and&nbsp;71 by creating /nt60 bootsector/mbr on the target drive, but it's a dirty install.</p>
<p>The official 14965iso (wim version) is no different .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I wrong about this?</p>

            <p>I had the same problem once and never found a Microsoft fix. So I gave up and downloaded Paragons Rescue Kit 14 Free Edition at
<a href="https://www.paragon-software.com/home/rk-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rescue Kit 14</a>&nbsp;Read there Page and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to register it through email. It installs on a USB key . The windows version works very good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied one of my Insider installs from its own bootable partitions To a backup drive to&nbsp;use as what I wanted to start with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then used the Microsoft Disk Manager to format an SSD 256 drive into 3 partitions two&nbsp;of which were Logical Partitions not Primary like the 3rd one.</p>
<p>Rebooted with the Rescue Kit and restored the build that I had copied before to each new empty partitions&nbsp; added them to the master Boot record. and they all boot. left one on Release Preview, one on Slow Ring and one on Fast ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all have had normal updates 3 or 4 times with no problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think for Insider builds this the best way to make backups because it will make a good usable partition Image. It does not have to copy the whole drive. It runs while no OS is running I have not had a failure yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I used the win 7 Image backup supplied by win 10 every time I wanted to make a win 10 Image it would Image the whole drive so backup were very large when it had win7 and win 10 in the Image.</p>

            Page Borders are set just outside the margins of the document - necessary to avoid potential obliteration of text.<br />
<br />
As Rich suggested, most printers have minimum margin requirements even if they claim to do "borderless" or "edge-to-edge" printing. If you read the tiny footnote in the printer's user guide you'll find that the capability only applies if you're using one of
 the photo printing options - it doesn't apply to printing other types of documents.<br />
<br />
Often it's further limiting on a laser printer because they typically require a larger bottom margin than on the other 3 sides in order for the sheets to be drawn through the printer.<br />
<br />
Determine your printer's minimum margin requirements the calculate your margins large enough to accommodate the additional width of the style of Border you're using.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Bob J.<br />

<h2>            No Consistent Themes across O365 and Sites</h2>
                    
<p>I'm new to O365 and I'm trying to setup a common theme across all of our touch-points.&nbsp; I have tried for hours and it appears that themes in O365 are NOT available on individual sites.</p>
<p><br />
The opening site and the "Sites" site have the circuit board theme applied, but when I go to the Team Site under "sites", I can only apply generic different colored site themes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd apply screenshots, but this BBS doesn't appear to let you attache photos.&nbsp;
 (really lame Microsoft, lame)</p>
<p><br />
I really don't care which I use, but how do I get one theme that looks the same across all of the O365 touch-points?&nbsp; It's ridiculous that this isn't built in from the start.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>do you refer to the top navigation bar theme (e.g. circuit)? it applies to portal and my sites (domain-my.sharepoint.com/...), and should applies to the site collection domain.sharepoint.com&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>after a short delay, you should be able to see the theme launched throughout office 365 including outlook and sharepoint pages. could you can wait for some time (up to 24h) to see the results? we appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, please provide some information via private message:<br />

<p>I tried the rich formatting, but it just puts a big gray generic icon on the message, not image that I uploaded.&nbsp; It doesn't work.</p>
<p>As for the Theme, I can wait, but this seems to be an odd way to apply a theme. &nbsp;Either it updates or it doesn't, I don't understand why things need to wait 24 hours for.</p>

<p>Jim,</p>
<p>Also, none of the pages I'm trying to update are on &nbsp;domain.onmicrosoft.com. &nbsp;They are on either one of the following</p>
<p>Landing site is on &nbsp;portal.office.com/Home</p>
<p>the Sites app is on: &nbsp;domain-my.sharepoint.com</p>
<p>the individual sites are on: domain.sharepoint.com</p>
<p>You should know that the template options are different, so it isn't a problem of the template not applying, its a problem that the templates are not available on all sites.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Yes, I know the template options are different between portal and SharePoint sites. I'd like to explain the following information:<br />
1. The top navigation bar theme you changed in portal can be synced to SharePoint Online. It may take some time to take effort as we have discussed. You can reply to my PM if it takes for too long.</p>
<p>2. As you mentioned "the template options are different", I assume that you refer to the Change the look feature in Site settings in SharePoint Online. If so, the changes applies to all sites under a site collection. By saying "its a problem that the templates
 are not available on all sites", are you using different site collections? You can provide the problematic sites' URLs in PM.</p>
<p>3. You may also refer to this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3094430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3094430</a> <br />
"The Office 365 top navigation bar will still uses the theme that's configured for the organization, not the theme that's configured for the site."</p>
<p>If there's any misunderstanding, please send the screenshots to help us better understand your situation. If it is convenient you may also let us know the steps you did so that we can try to reproduce. You can upload the pictures to the workspace. I have
 sent you PM.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response. We have received your screenshots and thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>To summarize, the top navigation bar theme applies to My-site, Office 365 portal, and will be synced to&nbsp;the site collection&nbsp;<a href="https://domain.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domain.sharepoint.com</a> based on a&nbsp;previous release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, from&nbsp;an updated&nbsp;article I provided, the feature sync theme to SharePoint Online will not available. So currently it won't be synced to&nbsp;that site collection.&nbsp;We are working at letting you disable changing themes for the organization (E.g. Circuit),
 so that the top navigation bar will&nbsp;keep using the theme from the site collection (change the look). Once complete,&nbsp;more details&nbsp;will be updated to that article.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

            <p>Hi Veasna,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both OST and PST files are Outlook data files. OST file is a mirror image of your web-mail data file. The email account types like IMAP account, MAPI account Exchange Account create an OST file to save
</p>
<p>For more information on Outlook data files you may refer to the link mentioned and check:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/introduction-to-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-HA010354876.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/introduction-to-outlook-data-files-pst-and-ost-HA010354876.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q1: The Outlook data file ends with (1), (2) etc. because these are different data files. If you have configured the same email account multiple times to differentiate between the data files Outlook
 automatically adds the suffix (1) or (2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not need those data files then you may delete those data files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2: If you have a POP account or if you have created a PST data file then it should be saved on the system.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>PST file location for Outlook 2010:</font></span></p>
<p>If you had upgraded from earlier version of Office then the data file will be save din the location mentioned:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise by default the PST file will be saved in the location:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\Outlook Files</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also search for the PST files saved on the system from the explorer:
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-a-file-or-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-a-file-or-folder</font></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note</font></span>: In the search box you may type *.pst to find all the files with pst extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3: In Outlook 2010, when you configure an email account by default the OST and PST files will be saved in the same location (<font><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents\Outlook
 Files ) </span>which is the<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span></font>default location to save Outlook data file.
</p>
<p>If OST and PST files are not saved in the same location then open Outlook, check the location where the PST file is save, remove the PST file from Outlook, browse to the location where the PST file
 was saved, copy the PST file, save the PST file in the location where OST file is saved, open Outlook and open the PST file in Outlook from its new location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>To remove the PST file from Outlook:</font></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open Outlook.</span>

</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note</font></span>: To backup the OST file, you may export the OST file (the complete data file) in PST format.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q5: Ensure to backup the data file which contains all your data. If the data file is open in Outlook then to check the location of the data file:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open Outlook,</span>
</li><li><span>Click on File
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span><span>&lt;

<p>But it&nbsp;is ok when the database is used on other machines running different configurations of Windows and MS Office, so problem seems confined to just one machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have checked security settings and they are set at Medium.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe there are some other settings
 we are missing?</p>

<p>Are you trying ot import the folder or individual items? If you double click on one item, what do you see?</p>
<p>Outlook can't import a folder - you'll need to do it one at a time or drag them to the contacts folder.</p>

<p>It is possible that your computer has a trial version installed alongside your full version. Look on the Start menu for an entry called "Get Office"; if you find it, right-click it and choose Uninstall. After you have uninstalled any trial, you may have
 to repair your full version of Office.</p>

            <p>This method will be a little quicker, but requires the use of a "helper" column:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Insert a column to the right of the one of interest.</li><li>In the first row with a text hyperlink in the original column, enter the "=HYPERLINK()" formula in the cell next to it and hit ENTER.</li><li>Now drag that formula down all the way to the end of your data.</li><li>Right-click on the original column and delete it.</li></ul>
<p>If you can't delete the original column for some reason, do a copy-paste from the new column and then delete the new column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>

<h2>            excel and combo box</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys!&nbsp; Its me one last time! :op&nbsp; You've all been so very helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if I wanted to have a Combo box predict what a user is writing in several different cells (say, whenever a user enters data in cells A1 through A15000), do I need to make a combo box for each cell individually?&nbsp; I tried to resize a combo box to cover 1000
 cells, and it looks like it only writes to the very top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there isn't, is there another way to use predictive text with a list?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your hard work and quick answers!</p>

<p>Here is another option.</p>
<p>Activate the Developer tab of the ribbon.</p>
<p>Insert an ActiveX combo box on the sheet.</p>
<p>Its default name will be ComboBox1; I will use this in the code below. If you give it another name, modify the code accordingly.</p>
<p>Set the ListFillRange property of the combo box to the range of cells that contains the list to be displayed.</p>
<p>Right-click the sheet tab and select View Code from the popup menu.</p>
<p>Copy the following code into the worksheet module:</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; If Not Intersect(Range("A:A"), Target) Is Nothing And Target.Count = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.ComboBox1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .LinkedCell = Target.Address<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Top = Target.Top<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Left = Target.Left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Width = Target.Width<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Value = Target.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Visible = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.ComboBox1.Visible = False<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Switch back to Excel.</p>
<p>Turn off Design Mode on the Developer tab of the ribbon.</p>
<p>Important: since the workbook now contains VBA code, you should not save it as a .xlsx workbook - the code would be lost. Save it as a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm) or if you need to share it with users of older versions of Excel, as an Excel 97-2003 workbook
 (.xls).</p>

<h2>            Removing LF&#43;CR character after copying from Excel to Clipboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a quick question: without using a third-party program, is there an option in Excel that stop it from adding the LF+CR character after copying to Clipboard? I have a few hundreds row of names in Excel that I need to copy &amp; paste to another program,
 and I don't want to hit the the backspace every time, (there are other factors as well such that I can't simply copy to notepad and then copy &amp; paste again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

Note: If you access any ReFS volume with Windows 10 Build 16257 or newer, <br />
it converts it to ReFS version 3.3. This makes it unreadable by earlier <br />
Windows 10 versions, such as build 15063, and it shows as RAW in Diskpart. <br />
Access by the newer Insider builds still works, so the data is not gone.<br />
But any ReFS user who upgrades to the Fall Creators Update and for any <br />
reason rolls back to 15063 will see RAW ReFS volumes. <br />
I have only tested Simple Volumes and not Storage Spaces.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ivan C</strong><br />
Curious how many people here actually understand the difference between NTFS and ReFS.
<br />
For home users you're not going to notice any... <br />
No one likes to see a feature pulled <br />
but in this case home users haven't lost anything they were using anyway.<br />

            Ivan C is not correct.&nbsp; The impact of ReFS is different from features that differentiate Home and Pro.&nbsp; A file system is not a feature of Windows.&nbsp; Its import is much more than that.&nbsp; What both Home and Pro users alike will lose is the resiliency of data.&nbsp;
 That is not edition specific.&nbsp; Ultimately, ReFS is an all-Windows issue not related to the edition used.&nbsp;

<em>The thing is that at this point, there is no real benefit to ReFS in a consumer environment.
</em><br />
<em>It's not as well supported by backup, imaging and recovery tools. It has no support from other
</em><br />
<em>platforms AFAIK (as far as&nbsp;I know). </em><br />
<em>It is missing some rather essential NTFS features, and much of the performance benefits it has

</em><br />
<em>and ReFS offers little benefits for "Joe Bloggs" at this point in time. While they will probably

<p>What most folks don't get yet is that ReFS provides real-time file healing.&nbsp; There is no offline file repair and therefore no utilities like chkdsk are used.&nbsp; File healing goes on without any downtime.&nbsp; That makes for user-transparent file security.&nbsp; No
 user intervention means file safety is much more likely to get done.&nbsp; A study a couple of years ago showed less than 10% of Windows users have ever made even
<em>one </em>backup.&nbsp; That means that either an enforced cloud-oriented backup procedure built into Windows is needed or data safety features have to reach incredibly high reliability.&nbsp; I can't see users putting up with any automated collection of their data
 in Microsoft's cloud on that scale, not to mention the infrastructure considerations, so increased reliability is the answer and the reason MSFT started ReFS development in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that a large percentage of consumers don't even own a large thumb drive much less an external hard drive so reliance on users to use backup/restore solutions is fruitless.&nbsp; 90% of users simply refuse to be that pro-active so a passive approach
 is necessary.&nbsp; MSFT is on that track by making a file system that is much more resilient than is achievable with NTFS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the considerations that lead me to say that <strong>ReFS is as essential for consumers as it is for enterprises</strong>.&nbsp; People need to think about what consumers need for data security before they just assume that ReFS is not for consumers.&nbsp;
 MSFT learned what not providing anti-virus software in Windows led to and is taking a similar approach to data security. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What irritates me the most about the step back with ReFS for consumers is it is a Marketing Department move to add value to Windows 10 Pro for Workstations by removing something of value for consumers from Windows 10 Pro arbitrarily.&nbsp; This was a stated Marketing
 Dept. strategy a decade ago, unnecessarily fragmenting Home and creating Ultimate.&nbsp; Making feature inclusion/exclusion a marketing decision made a mess of Vista and 7 and threatens to make a mess of Windows 10.&nbsp; I rejoiced in getting marketing out of those
 decisions after Vista and Windows 7 and here it is creeping back in again.&nbsp; I have always believed in "one edition to rule them all" for precisely that reason.</p>

    <title>Incorrect number formatting in Excel and incorrect date formatting in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluebird215  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect number formatting in Excel and incorrect date formatting in Word</h2>
                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"Office 2011 bugs"</div>
Hi<br />
<br />
I am finding lots of bugs in Office 2011 and overall it's been a great disappointment. I find it hard to believe that Microsoft engineers have been using it for months and think it's okay.<br />
<br />
Excel number formatting does not work properly. For Numbers with zero decimals, I put in numbers like 215 and they are recorded as 2.15, but on 2 shows in the cell. Formatting seems to be messed up<br />
<br />
In Word, if I want to format dates to come out January 15, 2011,&nbsp;&nbsp; they always come out January 15, 11. So I must enter the 20 in front of the 11.
<br />
<br />
Intermittently, if I want a tab and on the first line of a paragraph, the whole document will be inset and I must use the Undo. Next time it will tab just the first line. It is unpredictable.<br />
<br />
Outlook worked okay for awhile but after loading Lion it has gone nuts a couple times. One time when I opened outlook, all my email folders were dumped into the Inbox and Deleted items. Then all the folders disappeared. What a frigging mess this was.<br />
<br />
For the time being I am going to have to remove Lion and hope things improve. <br />
<br />

            I can't comment on the Outlook issues - you'd do best to post separately in the Outlook forum with complete details.<br />
<br />
None of the other issues you mentioned in Word or Excel, however are bugs in the software. Most are a matter of local settings in your software;<br />
<br />
In Excel go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Excel&gt; Preferences - Edit</span> &amp; clear the check on
<br />
As for the "tab" issue in Word, its quite predictable :-) You've altered the settings that pertain to your Normal paragraph style. See the information here on how to correct it [It's written based on the PC version, but the issue is the same.]:<br />
<br />
http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Formatting/WholeDocumentReformatted.htm<br />
<br />
The date issue in Word is a known conflict introduced by changes Apple made in OS X 10.7 (Lion), not a Word "bug". The rest of the Lion-using world is awaiting a fix from Apple just as you are. Meanwhile, those of us who continue to not adopt Lion have been
 &amp; continue to be having no such issues :-)<br />
<br />

            I believe it's because the table is treated as a whole object, layout and all. Just one of those quirks I guess.

            Hi Jo,
<br />
<br />Sorry, you cannot do that individually in Excel, what you can do is make everything on your screen bigger, this will affect all applications on your PC . . .
<br />
<br />Close all open applications
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop and choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Click Custom Scale
<br />
<br />Increase the set amount by say, 10%
<br />
<br />Log out and back into your PC
<br />
<br />Then open Excel and see if that feels comfortable
<br />
<br />If not, repeat the process, adding 10% each time and logging out and back in
<br />
<br />Using that method, you should find a Scale factor that feels comfortable to view . . .
<br />
<br />Then once you have the Ribbon looking as you like, you can zoom out on the worksheet area . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 pictures in mail body not showing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a day or 2 I have the issue that all the images inside all of my mails in Outlook are just showing as a white blank space with a black border.</p>
<p>If I copy the mail into Word I can see the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable all the add-ins</li><li>Repaired (fast repair and online repair) Office</li><li>Update Outlook 2016 (at the moment I'm at the latest version: 16.0.6001.1078)</li><li>Made a new Outlook profile while I also cleared the following location of data:&nbsp;C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook</li><li>Update my graphics driver</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When I start my outlook in safemode it works normal. If I use my account on another pc I'm also able to see the images...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know where the problem can be. I hope someone can help me with this.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Internal Failure. Error number 0X80040707</h2>
                    I can't believe the stress this is causing me. Firstly, I can't even establish a connection with my phone and PC using PC Suite and now I tried to reinstall the PC suite, when it copies and installs the files midway through its saying:<br />
<br />
Internal Failure. Error number 0X80040707<br />
<br />
then it asks me to say "ok" which I press and it installs as normal but what is all this?<br />
<br />
You dotn expect Nokia to come up with this with new stuff.

            before anyone asks yes I have googled it and I have followed the information in the other thread on this topic. It still wont work. Looks like Nokia will need to bring a new patch to fix this bug.

    <title>Can&#39;t turn off the filters in Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off the filters in Access 2010</h2>
                    My 2003 DB has a subform populated by a query. When I try to run the DB using 2010, the subform appears with filters on each data column, obscuring some of the very short headings. I can't find a way to turn the filters off.
                </div>

<p>One alternative would be to open the subform in design view, and change it to Continuous Form (in the Form properties.)</p>
<p>Then show the Form Header/Footer, and put labels in the Form Header.</p>
<p>Rearrange the text boxes side by side (deleting any attached labels.)</p>
<p>The result is similar to a datasheet view, but doesn't have the datasheet problems (filter options obscuring headings, columns that the user can hide or make zero-width, etc.)</p>

            Thanks, Allen. Does this mean you know of others with this problem? This seems like a major glitch for compatibility with previous versions. I'm hoping I can at least redo the DB starting with Access 2010. It's clunky, but it's new...?

<p>Access 2007 had the same situation. Naturally enough, it does take a bit more screen space when MS adds a new feature like that.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't use datasheets, mostly because I don't want the support calls from people who lose/freeze/stretch their columns, and because Continuous forms are more powerful (headers/footers, command buttons, ...)</p>

            <p>I realize that this is a positively ancient thread, but no one seems to have published the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try turning setting the property Form.ShortcutMenu to "No".&nbsp;(The property is found under the "Other" tab when you edit the form's properties.) Note that it also turns off the right-click shortcut menu, effectively disabling all filtering.</p>
