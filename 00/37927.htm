<p>I know this may be a little late in coming seeing this post was several months ago, but I had the same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up powering off the machine and opening up printer and checking the ink cartridges (which I had just viewed to find the part number for a new cartridge). &nbsp;I found that the blue cover that snaps in place over the ink cartridges was not completely
 snapped shut. &nbsp;This caused the printer to continously try to go into maintenance mode, yet it could never align the cartridges. &nbsp;It also kept telling me there was a paper jam, sometimes even when there was no paper in the machine. &nbsp;I even let the maintenance
 run over night to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the cartridges were snapped in place and the blue cover was completely secured the printer worked.</p>

</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It really shouldn't be this difficult.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do the following just on general principles:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Download, install, and run Malwarebytes:&nbsp;
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As with all downloaded programs, pay attention during the installation process so that you only install the program you think you're installing;
 use "custom" install if that option is presented and decline all offers to install browser add-ons and the like.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that you will be installing a free 14-day trial of Malwarebytes "Premium" antimalware product.&nbsp; This provides real-time protection from
 viruses and malware.&nbsp; Malwarebytes says that you don't need another antivirus product but if you already have one, Malwarebytes is compatible with most antivirus products.&nbsp; You can either uninstall Malwarebytes immediately after your first scan or you can
 keep it.&nbsp; If you keep it past 14 days and elect to not pay for it, the product reverts to an "on-demand only" scanner (that is, no real-time protection).</span></p>
<p>Download and run AdwCleaner (it doesn't require installation):&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did either of the two programs find any malware?&nbsp; If so, was it successfully removed or quarantined?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were not able to temporarily disable your antivirus software before attempting to install PSP, make sure that you have the serial number or other information required to reinstall that software and then
 uninstall it using the appropriate removal tool from here:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.eset.com/kb146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.eset.com/kb146/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the instructions here to restart the computer in "clean boot" mode:&nbsp;
<a href="https://support.logitech.com/en_hk/article/228#win7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.logitech.com/en_hk/article/228#win7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't uninstall your antivirus program, disable it.&nbsp; Then follow the steps in 2B (copied below):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>put the CD in the drive</li><li>If&nbsp; the installer starts to run automatically, cancel it.</li><li>If rather than starting automatically, the AutoPlay window opens, select "Open folder to view files"</li><li>If nothing happens when you put the CD in the drive, or if you cancelled the install program, press the "Windows Logo" key and the E key simultaneously.&nbsp; Right-click on the icon for your CD drive and select "Open"</li><li>Once you're looking at the contents of the CD, right-click on setup.exe, select "Run as administrator" and respond as needed to the UAC prompt</li></ul>
<p>Whether the installation was successful or not, don't forget to </p>
<ul>
<li>restore your system to "normal boot" using the directions here:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.logitech.com/en_hk/article/228#win7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.logitech.com/en_hk/article/228#win7</a></li><li>either re-enable or reinstall your antivirus program</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any other ideas if PSP still doesn't install.&nbsp; Get in touch with Corel support and tell them what you have already done:&nbsp;

<p>If all of the above didn't work for you , I suggest that you contact Cleverbridge (the company that handles the delivery of your Corel products) and ask them for a new copy/link for installing your 2019, sometimes the links come with a glitch and nothing
 you do helps.&nbsp; The other main thing is to be sure and run your install as Administrator, I had the same exact problem as you had and after I received a new link (be sure and explain to Cleverbridge the problem you have and make sure they give you a new link,
 it should come in your email not in your Corel account), I ran the install as Admin and it installed.&nbsp; And yes be sure you have your Antivirus and your firewall turned off during install.
</p>
<p>Good luck to you, there is nothing more frustrating than trying to get your PSP installed.</p>

<p>I should have also mentioned that if you bought the box aka cd, Cleverbridge will send you a new cd. When contacting them, use the reference number you will find in your Corel account area.&nbsp; They are really nice people and respond quickly to your emails.</p>

<br />
<br />Right click the current driver that is installed, then click uninstall.
<br />Restart, then make sure you download the latest driver for your specific model Dell, see link:

<br />
<br />If that driver does not work, Dell list an older version of the driver from September 2016 you can try using instead:

            Okay. The next step would be to try installing the Sound drivers from the manufacturer's website. If that doesn't work, you can also try the stock one from here:
<br />www.realtek.com.tw/
<br />The only disadvantage downloading from Realtek offers is that it  wouldn't be able to provide you sound customisations Dell made.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. We using Android Lync 2013 mobile apps&nbsp;to login , it can't get calendar information.</p>

<p>Hi Jo,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the information. As when IOS with Skype apps are used, the calendar information is fine. It indicates that users EWS are healthy. The issue could be related to the specific Android devices. To confirm with that, can you try another Android
 device which is working fine for other users and check the results? Meanwhile, please re-install the app for the problematic Android device to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran</p>

<h2>            Skype shows online even when I log out</h2>
                    I tried to solve the subject I created by reading other threads and their was no solution for me. Every time I log out my friends tell me that I show as online. I assume someone hacked my account since I've tried changing my password, re-installing Skype,
 and many other tricks. Would appreciate some advice on how I can resolve this issue.

Hi</p>
<p>This file is a Microsoft Visual Basic runtime file that is used by programs&nbsp;written in older versions of Visual Basic&nbsp;for Windows. These runtime files are normally included with the third party program as part of their distribution.</p>

<h2>            Mail keeps freezing and throwing me out</h2>
                    I am experiencing the system blipping when I am in Mail. It throws me out of the email and I have to keep going back into the body of the message to start retyping. I have just downloaded the latest version, checked for virus's etc. Nothing. Mail also
 likes to put in letters from the keyboard that I haven't typed. Any ideas? This is a new issue as up until a month ago it was fine. It arrived with a new installation / update.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could occur due to corrupted system files. We suggest you to run the Windows App troubleshooter from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persists, we recommend you to remove and add your email account back by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click the
<strong>Start </strong>button, and go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>Accounts</strong>, and choose <strong>Email &amp; app accounts.</strong></span></li><li><span>Remove your account, and add it back.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you will still have the same issue, we suggest you to create a new user account to isolate if it’s due to corrupted user profile. You can
 refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>Sadly it didn't work. I removed accounts, ran a though corrupt file check, troubleshooted the system and still today, I am having problems. When I use the keyboard and attempting to send an email, it throws me out of the screen or puts in letters which I
 haven't typed. Really annoying as it takes me ages to send an email. IT has also done it whilst typing this reply to you! As you can see the word 'it' is in capital letters when the system automatically puts the capital letter in after a full stop but not
 the second letter. Also spell check is very sporadic and doesn't always appear on top off keyboard. Any ideas would be warmly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi anitaad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're following your post and we noticed that its been idle for more than 48 hours now. We'd like to know if the issue still persists and an assistance is still needed. If yes, I'd recommend that you reset Mail by uninstalling and reinstalling it. To do
 this, follow the steps provided by <strong>Ruth Buruga</strong> in this <strong>

            Thanks for reply. I have already completed this task as you will see by reading my post (15/4). Not only have I deleted my account but that of my child too. I have performed a through clean of my system but no errors were detected (according to troubleshooter).&nbsp;

<p>I'm using Windows&nbsp; 10 on my surface pro 3.</p>
<p>No, I have made any changes to my account.</p>
<p>No, I did not encounter any problems /error messages when trying to launch the application.</p>
<p>I have deleted the account and re-created accounts.</p>
<p>This all started when I had an update and started playing up thereafter. It also keeps putting letters from the keyboard on the screen but I haven't entered them. The cursor also jumps from typing on one line to another in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In this case, we suggest that you perform clean boot to further isolate the issue. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program
 or an update or when you run a program. Once you're done troubleshooting, check the
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> section to revert your device to normal boot.</p>

<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>

            Hi condee,<br />
<br />
Thasnk for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
If this is happening to their accounts and no one elses on the computer, it's probably some piece of software that's been downloaded either resetting the setting or preventing them from being saved.<br />
<br />
I suggest performing a clean boot, not starting any programs after it boots up clean, then restart to see if the setting change.<br />
<br />

<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to
 reset the computer so that it starts as usual.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend
 that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>OK</span> </strong>, and then click

<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.

</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong><span>Services</span> </strong>
tab, and then click to select the <strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span>

<p><strong><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the <strong><span>Service</span> </strong>
list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong><span>Service</span> </strong>
list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the <strong><span>Service</span>
</strong>list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong><span>Startup</span> </strong>
tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span>
</strong>list. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>OK</span> </strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Restart</span> </strong>
.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span>
</strong>list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong><span>Startup Item</span> </strong>
list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span>
</strong>list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span>
</strong>check box in either step. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether
 the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></p>
<p>

<p>1. This happens only when i play Diablo III.</p>
<p>2. No.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My CPU/GPU temps are below 60C, all my drivers are up-to-date. No errors with memory diagnostic tool, My Pc can pass a stability test longer than 24h.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried a lot of things to solve the issue but i couldnt. I think my GFX card making this error but im not sure it is hardware or software related.</p>

            Hi
<br />It can be any hardware or even just a minor voltage fluctuation. Does the PC reboot unexpectedly before as well?

            I'm not sure if it rebooted as I wasn't there when the error did happen. I think it did restart. Also, my GPU is overclocked; is that the problem? My processor is the i5-4440, by the way and the GPU is a Radeon R7 240.

<h2>            Settings window is invisible</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Settings launches when I click it (it appears in the taskbar with a blue line and all), and if I hover over it, it shows the thumbnail of the window, but nothing appears on screen when I click it. It's essentially invisible.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I had this exact same problem with Chrome (twice)--the problem was a corrupted file (I replaced it, and it was fine). I'm assuming this is a similar problem; unfortunately, if that's the case, I don't know what file has gone wrong.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I've run various checks (such as sfc scannow and system diagnostics) and found nothing. I've tried to get into it in different ways. I've tried to move the window, in case it was off screen.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">This is a brand-new computer. I did have some issues with the OS not booting initially and had to reinstall, but since then, it's been running fine apart from this.</p>

            Solved the same problem by clicking on the Settings appearing on the Taskbar then pressing "Alt+Spacebar" followed by pressing "M" (shortcut to move window) and then pressing the "Right-Arrow" key.&nbsp; In short, the Settings window had moved off the screen
 to one side, and all&nbsp;I had to do was to move it back.&nbsp; Hope this helps you too! &nbsp; (note that in case the&nbsp;Settings window was maximized after it moved off the screen, then you would need to press "R" first to restore the window size to less than screen size,
 before the&nbsp;"M" to move it)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Passwords are designed to protect your PC from unauthorized intrusion.&nbsp; If you do not know your password, it will treat you like an intruder.&nbsp; This happens to too many people.&nbsp; Big lessons to be learned here.&nbsp; Write it down somewhere, or better yet, maybe
 you don't need a password anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are offerings on the web that say they will help you with this, but they may or may not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely, you will need to re-build your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.canadiantech.info/for-techies/re-build-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.canadiantech.info/for-techies/re-build-windows-7/</a>
</p>
<p>
Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reverting program just does not do the job correctly, and will leave your system
 in a state that you will not find satisfactory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>

<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose

<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
Clean Install tip
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

    <title>Cyrillic characters appearing as question marks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragan hadji - kotarov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cyrillic characters appearing as question marks</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody, my name is Dragan</p>
<p>Because I come from Macedonia, my name is displayed in the local keyboard layout - which is Macedonian/Cyrillic (Драган Хаџи-Котаров).</p>
<p>Recently (about a month ago), my old live.com mail account got upgraded to outlook.com. Now, it must be mentioned that I had no prior problems with the old one...
</p>
<p>Since the upgrade, my contacts reacted that my name started appearing as ?????? ????-??????? (which is the exact same number of characters in my name).
<strong>Now this is the problem No1</strong> (the main issue of my topic), for which I contacted Microsoft Support a 100 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody at the company (at least the lower level tech-support) seem to understand the gravity of my problem, and they just keep on forwarding my problem to the next in kin (or the one with higher know-how). They have logged into my computer 3 times now, they
 collected all the data that was necessary, we chatted more than 1 hour and I have been on the phone with them for over 2 hours. They even opened up an entire new mail account and added it to my @hotmail.com, but it didn't work. Yesterday a guy named Richard
 B has restarted my computer and that is where I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a partial solution to my problem, and that is to change the characters in Latin, so my name is displayed like Dragan Hadji-Kotarov. The thing is, I don't want to appear to others like that, I just want it to be how it was before - in Cyrillic.
 Then, <strong>there is the second problem</strong> - which is when I change my account name, the system propagates the change for about 6 hours. Meaning, if I change my account name now (8:27 AM CET), the changes will reflect in about (2:27 PM CET).</p>
<p><br />
Does anybody here had the same problem, or at least does anybody know what I am talking about and maybe... just maybe point me to the right direction or give me right answer?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Dragan</p>

            The thing is, I don't want anyone to access my account anymore.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but too many times has somebody from Microsoft already accessed my account in the past month. I have a fiddlercap file, so where should I upload it?

            <p>Hey there xXProGamer077Xx.<br /><br />If you plug your USB device into a PC, does it recognize it? If not, it sounds like you may need to replace the USB. If it recognizes the device, try reformatting it and using it with your Xbox 360 once more. Unfortunately if you the information shows as missing on your Xbox 360 there isn't a way to recover it.<br /><br />Please keep us looped in with how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

 to his XBOX 360 and it worked. Has anybody else had this problem if so is there a fix?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook keeps hanging when I wake my computer from sleep... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremy chaney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook keeps hanging when I wake my computer from sleep...</h2>
                    ...I'm running Vista Ultimate x64 and I have Outlook 2007 installed.<br />
<br />
When I wake my computer and I click on Outlook I get the little spinny orb thing, and then I wait a little bit, click Outlook again to see if it is responsive, and it ghosts itself (turns mostly white) and the title bar says "Outlook is not responding". On
 rare occasions it will recover (1 out of 10), but usually I get the dialog that says "Restart" or "Wait for Program to Respond". I always have to click the Restart button. Does anyone have any ideas as to what is going on?<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Those links are mainly for diagnosing and troubleshooting Outlook, if you think the problem is caused by Hibernation itself then perhaps you could run the Disk Cleanup tool and delete the Hibernation files and&nbsp;then&nbsp; rebuild them via the procedure outlined

            <p>Sadly, no. The ribbon contains commands; the five shortcuts change the program's mode of operation so they don't really belong on a command ribbon. When the program was first released eight years ago, these mode shortcuts were indeed at the top of the window,
 but there were so many complaints about their location that they were moved&nbsp;in the next release to the bottom of the folder pane, where they've remained ever since.</p>

            There's no date yet, but be sure to follow Major Nelson as he announces release dates of backward compatible titles.
