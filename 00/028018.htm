<h2>            Unable to sync notebooks in OneNote 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few OneNote notebooks on OneDrive, and am able to view all of them in OneNote Online.</p>
<p>However, when I try to sync these notebooks, OneNote refuses and gives one of two errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a password to sync this notebook (Error 0x5)</li><li>Your account is seemingly not authorized to edit this notebook</li></ul>
<p>I am logged in into OneNote 2016 (as part of Office 365) with the same account.</p>
<p>I have been having this issue for a few weeks now, and have searched and tried solutions I found online, but none have worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing however, is that I am able to sync all notebooks to the windows 10 metro-app OneNote version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help regarding this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Adding subfolders while using WMDC &#38; Win Mobile Ver. 5.0</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I've attempted to create folders on my Palm Treo 700wx and then move e-mail to them from main inbox however the additional folders that I create do not show up. They don't even show up after adding them and then going&nbsp;into inbox to move an e-mail fromthe main
 inbox. &nbsp;I'm using Vista Ultimate and Windows Mobile Version 5.0 OS 5.1.195 (build 14932.2.2.2). There are only two folders other that the main inbox in Windows Mobile Device Center that I can check off to syncronize. How do I create additional folders?????

<p>Other than the main inbox I have two other folders on my PDA. I would like to create additional folders which I have attempted to do on PDA but when I go back to my inbox to be able to move e-mails to those additional
 folders the newly created ones do not show up. From what I was able to under stand from one of your other replies to another question in this forum, I have to create them on PDA and then move e-mails to them on PDA before they will syncronize with Outlook.
 I am using Outlook 2003 and I have 28 subfolders in addition to the main Inbox. I have only two of them on my PDA that are syncronizing. They are the only two that I am able to select from using WMDC. I would like to be able to select more of them however
 I can not figure out how to accomplish.</p>

            I think you have too many subfolders and probably too many emails to sync. I recommend you delete the emails that are not important and limit the number of subfolders to at least 5. Bare in mind that your device has limited memory.

<p>About three months ago I had a computer that had Windows XP as the operating system and I used Verizon Wireless's included software that used a program called Wireless Sync. I was able to access all 28 of the subfolders
 without any limitations with this same phone and Mobile Operating System. Since I had to use WMDC due to using Microsoft Vista on a new computer&nbsp;with Microsoft Mobile OS which you'd think would work better in conjunction due to the fact that both products
 are Microsoft, I have been unable to access all of the folders when using Active Sync and also the phone keeps on crashing while on the cradle to syncronize with Active Sync and a text message or phone call is incoming. I know that you said to "bear in mind
 that my phone has limited memory" however prior to using Vista and being forced to use WMDC everything worked flawlessly.
</p>
<p><br />
I know that this is a user forum with users helping fellow users but it looks like I am not going to be able to get the help that&nbsp;I need here. If you have another way that you know of for me to access support for WMDC in Vista and Windows Mobile I would appreciate
 it if you could steer me in their direction.</p>

            Unfortunately your last reply basically led me right back to these user forums and that isn't what I needed. I ended up removing the partnership on my pc and also rebooted device back to factory default settings. I then placed Treo 700wx back into cradle
 and created a new partnership with PC and low and behold I am now able to add/remove any of the subfolders that are part of my inbox. This is what I figured I was going to have to do from the begining however I though that I would try and find another solution.

</span>real-time antimalware products</strong> that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial product that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc). Then, use the cleanup tools here:<span>&nbsp;

    <title>Requery a Combo Box in a Sibling Subform, on AfterUpdate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vwp1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Requery a Combo Box in a Sibling Subform, on AfterUpdate</h2>
                    I have a parent form with two subforms, in Access 2000.&nbsp; The first subform is data entry mode, and the 2nd subform is a continuous mode.&nbsp; The first subform contains a dropdown combo box.&nbsp; That is it!&nbsp; The 2nd subform is a listing of those items selected
 from the 1st subform (the data entry form).&nbsp; Currently, I have a procedure which has worked for years, and quite well!&nbsp; I wish to enhance the updating, so that the parent form doesn't have to close.
<br />
<br />
The following works fantastic, but the parent form closes and re-opens:<br />
========= beginning of properly operating procedure ==========<br />
Private Sub cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups_AfterUpdate()<br />
On Error GoTo Err_cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups_AfterUpdate<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim stDocName As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim stLinkCriteria As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stDocName = "f_personFavoriteGroupDetailForm"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stLinkCriteria = "[personID]=" &amp; Me![personFavoriteGroup_PersonID]&nbsp; ' Linkage from data entry's subform to the parent form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.Close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm stDocName, , , stLinkCriteria<br />
<br />
Exit_cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups_AfterUpdate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
<br />
Err_cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups_AfterUpdate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups_AfterUpdate<br />
&nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
========= end of properly operating procedure ==========<br />
<br />
GIVEN:<br />
1) parent form: <b>f_personFavoriteGroupDetailForm</b><br />
2) data entry subform: fsub_FavoriteMusicGroupNew&nbsp; This has the dropdown (<b>cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups</b>)<br />
3) continuous subform listing: <b>fsub_FavoriteMusicGroupListing</b><br />
4) I've three tables to support this entire schematic:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) people (has the peopleID)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) intermittent table with a field for people and a field for music groups (each with the proper Long Integer, indexing, etc.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) a listing of Music Groups to feed the Music Group Dropdown<br />
<br />
The intermittent table is the primary table for both subforms.<br />
<br />
I seek to have something that will update the 2nd subform, without closing the parent form, and re-opening it.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
I tried the following, and it doesn't work:<br />
<br />
========= beginning of operating procedure not working ==========<br />
Private Sub cbo_FavoriteMusicGroups_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
'[Forms]![f_personFavoriteGroupDetailForm]![fsub_personFavoriteGroupList].[txt_personFavoriteGroupName].Requery<br />
<br />
End Sub<br />
========= end of operating procedure not working ==========<br />

<p>You should use the name of the 2nd subform as a control on the main form. This is not necessarily the same as the name of the source object of the subform.</p>

            Thank you for responding.<br />
<br />
The 2nd subform doesn't update.&nbsp; I was using the name of the 2nd subform also as the "nickname" of the frame in which it resides.&nbsp; I changed the nickname of the frame to<b> fs_personFavoriteGroupList&nbsp;
</b>(removing the characters ub from fsub_....)<br />
<br />
Now the frame is named fs_personFavoritesGroupList while the subform inside the frame is still fsub_personFavoriteGroupList.<br />
<br />
The 2nd subform is still not updated.&nbsp; And,...the 1st subform's combobox doesn't refresh (become null again).<br />

            As far as I can tell from your post you are attempting to restrict the second subform to the current person in the parent form and the music group selected in the first subform.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two methods which can be employed to correlate subforms:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Add&nbsp; a hidden unbound text box to the parent form which references the key of the first subform.&nbsp; In your case this would be the value of the combo box in the first subform, referenced with the following syntax:<br />
<br />
=[SubFormControl].Form![ComboBoxName]<br />
<br />
Note that SubFormControl is the name of the control in the parent form's Controls collection which houses the subform; what you have referred to as a 'frame'.<br />
<br />
Include the name of the hidden text box as part of the LinkMasterFields property of the second subform.&nbsp; So, if for example the second subform is currently linked to the parent form by its LinkMasterFields and LinkChildFields properties being PersonID, and
 the second subform's recordset also includes a column MusicGroupID, which is also the bound column of the combo box in the first subform, the LinkMasterFields property of the second subform would become:<br />
<br />
PersonID;txtMusicGroupIDHidden; <br />
<br />
where txtMusicGroupIDHidden is the name of the hidden text box in the parent form, and the LinkChildFields property of the second subform would become:<br />
<br />
PersonID;MusicGroupID<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The above method, although having the advantage of being completely code free, can be a little slow in my experience, however, and I've generally found a more efficient method to be to base the second subform on a query which references the key of the first
 subform, the combo box in your case, as a parameter, and then to requery the second subforms module.&nbsp; Normally this is done in the Current event procedure of the first form as correlated subform's are generally both in continuous forms view.&nbsp; In your case,
 though, the AfterUpdate event procedure of the combo box in the first subform would be appropriate.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example of this second method of subform correlation as StudentLog.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

            <p>From when are you facing this issue with Excel files? Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</p>
<p>Verify if Office 2010 service pack 1 is installed on the computer, if not you may download and install service pack 1 from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26622</a></p>
<p>You may also change the default printer to ‘Microsoft XPS Document Writer’ and then change the data format to long date format and check if it retains once you save the file.</p>
<p>Refer the link below to know on how to change the printer:</p>

<p>We were told that SharePoint 365 does not support workflows.&nbsp; However, I've seen postings on the forum about how people are using their workflows in the cloud.&nbsp; Is the issue that you can't create/publish SP Designer workflows?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or do you need some special
 level of service (SP 365 Gold :) to use them?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or are there different cloud versions of SP 365 where some might not have that feature?</p>

<p>Hi Geek 2016,<br />
<br />
Here are the answers to your questions:<br />
<br />
1. Yes, workflow is supported in Office 365 plans that include the SharePoint Online license.<br />
2. We can create and publish workflows in SharePoint Designer.<br />
3. We don’t need any special services to use SharePoint Online workflows. We can use them if we have the SharePoint license and correct permissions.<br />
4. We won’t have workflow feature without the SharePoint Online license in our Office 365 plan.<br />
<br />
For detailed information about SharePoint Online workflow, you can take a look at the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Overview-of-workflows-included-with-SharePoint-D74FCCEB-3A64-40FB-9904-CC33CA49DA56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overview of workflows included with SharePoint</a><br />

<h2>            Disable Clipboard Sidebar Permanently</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I've googled the heck outta this and I can't find it here either.</p>
<p>I want to get rid of that annoying Clipboard sidebar that pops up when you copy two or more items in Excel.</p>
<p>There are options presented at the bottom of the sidebar that work <em>only for that session of Excel.
</em>I want to disable it permanently.</p>
<p>There are rumours of a registry edit that changes a certain AcbControl value from 0 to 1.

Press twice on Ctrl C to get the Clipboard Sidebar then at the bottom of that menu you have a button "Option" click on it and you have the choice to stop it.<br />

    <title>How can I downgrade Windows Reader App&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leopard20  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I downgrade Windows Reader App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After updating the Reader App (by installing Windows 8.1 update), it lags all the time when I scroll. It's driving me crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I tried updating it through Store, but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to downgrade it back to a previous version. </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I don't think the problem is related to the Store app. Because the Reader app worked fine before the update. I also installed Adobe Reader Touch from store to make sure the issue is not with the graphics card driver. And sure enough it was perfectly smooth.</p>
<p>If you could kindly provide the appx package of a previous version, I can install it and see if it fixes the problem.(the version I had before had a white vertical fly-out popup when I right clicked, but the new version has a black horizontal one, so I'm
 guessing you know the right version. I think it should be around version 6.2)</p>

<p>Okay - try the following array formula.</p>
<p>(Note: You would be aware that an array formula needs to be entered with CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER instead of a simple ENTER button)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the Range under "Articles" is Name-Ranged as "Articles"&nbsp; and</p>
<p>the Range under "Inventory" is Name-Ranged as "Inventories"&nbsp; and of-course</p>
<p>your already defined named range of Vendor_Issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(COUNTIFS(Articles,Vendor_Issue,Inventories,0))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER,&nbsp;&nbsp; you will get your answer 9&nbsp;&nbsp; and</p>
<p>the formula in the formula bar will look like</p>
<p>
</p><p>{=SUM(COUNTIFS(Articles,Vendor_Issue,Inventories,0))}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is Helpful.</p>

            1. Please try to perform a quick repair of your Office.<br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx<br />
<br />
2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />

            <p>I got that error out of the Update Assistance.</p>
<p>Did you properly burn the download or did you just copy it to the media?</p>
<p>For USB you should use Rufus.&nbsp; For DVD the Windows Burn Image program makes it proper.</p>
<p>Did you insert the DVD in to you computer and then go to it in File Explorer and click on Setup?</p>

            <p>Did you go to the Media Creation tool site?</p>
<p>To get the Anniversary update it installs as there have been a lot of changes to the operating system.</p>
<p>Did you go through the process from the place where it said Update now?</p>
<p>when it asked for a key did you click on I do not have one?&nbsp; This is a must if you have Windows 10 on the computer already and it was an upgrade and you computer is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to update you do not have to be an Insider and do not need to be in a ring.&nbsp; You will be getting the retail version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the earlier posts and you went to Update History.&nbsp; That was not the place to go.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could someone help me?</p>
<p>Yesterday I was moving some emails form my Inbox to a folder called Tickets on my account and everything that I move to there disappear.</p>
<p>I have done loads of tests and if I move any message from anywhere to this folder it disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried on my mobile, on my computer and in different browsers and there is nothing on this folder.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think there is something wrong with Outlook/ Hotmail! I need my emails back and I don’t know what to do!</p>

            I understood that you moved the emails not deleted them. However you were not able to recover them, right? 
<br />When you search for this emails, what happens? 
<br />If they are not available in the search and in the deleted items, there is nothing you can do, to get them back :(

<p>But I couldn't find my emails anywhere on my Email web page.</p>
<p>That's&nbsp;inadmissible. I have my account for many years and a lot of import informations on it.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Try to search for any title that you remember about the e-mails you moved and see if something show up and also check in your archive folder sometimes by mistake we do move or click something and it goes there.
<br />
<br />Click in the Instant Search field (Ctrl+E) and Advanced Find is under Search Tools button.  You can use Instant search to search for the messages, but Advanced find uses a separate window so you can move around outlook without losing the search results.
<br />
<br />If you can find one of the missing messages, open it, click on it with the mouse and then Ctrl+Shift+F to open an Advanced Find window. Click Browse - the folder the message is in will be checked.
<br />
<br />Check also all sub folders just in case.
<br />
<br />Do you have connected accounts? 
<br />
<br />Only one mailbox and one inbox?
<br />
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />Victor

<p>Hi Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't have success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Try to search for any title that you remember about the e-mails: DID NOT FOUND</p>
<p>- Check in your archive folder sometimes by mistake: DID NOT FOUND</p>
<p>- Click in the Instant Search field (Ctrl+E) and Advanced Find is under Search Tools button: DID NOT FOUND</p>
<p>- Check also all sub folders just in case: DID NOT FOUND</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have connected accounts?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my hotmail account on my MACBOOK (Software Mail) and iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder was with 4 to 5 messages and it was ok. When I moved a email I saw at the same time it was gone inside the folder.. I moved two more to be sure and they were gone too.</p>
<p>Then I opened my Hotmail account on Safari browser and I couldn't see anything inside the folder too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started moving unimportant emails to this folder and everything is gone.</p>
<p>If i move to other folders they were working ok...</p>
<p>It was just this folder. Now it is working well.. But i can &nbsp;not trust it anymore.</p>
<p>I've lost three important emails.</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />If you will still be unable to recover the account, then it is better to contact Microsoft Account Support for alternative recovery options <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/...</a> They have the necessary tool to verify you as the owner of the account, and they are replying usually within 24H.

<h2>            Ovi maps data update through Ovi Suite A bug&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Don't know if its a problem but the darn Ovi suite keeps prompting to update the maps data in my N97 mini even I have already done it twice. Seems like it just read and check&nbsp;my phone maps data and just erase everything and download all the data over&nbsp;again.
 Doesn't seems to be optimized. Should have program the updater check the data files size or date tag&nbsp;and just update those outdated files, instead of everything. &nbsp;If I have a huge maps data in my phone it'll be a loooong wait.</p>
<p>Anyone having the same problem?</p>
<p>I'm still getting prompt today to update my maps data.&nbsp;Doubt that nokia tech can&nbsp;update their maps data that fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook Webmail - Contacts missing after moving to Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Webmail - Contacts missing after moving to Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem where a user has recently bought a new laptop and installed Office 365, but on his old XP PC he was using Outlook 365 via webmail, and now his Contacts list is empty on both Outlook 365 and Outlook webmail. He is using a remotely hosted
 Exchange email account.</p>

<p>His Autocomplete list is still there on webmail but it has not synced to Outlook. The Global Address Book only has a dozen entries, which I think are all email addresses of people he has replied to since he got his new laptop. AFAIK this means when he sends
 an email via webmail it creates a new autocomplete entry but doesn't add it as a Contact.</p>
<p>Then again it's also possible he managed to sync his fresh install of Outlook to the cloud, so all the contacts he had in webmail got cleared out, and Autocomplete was unaffected because it's not part of the settings that synchronise.</p>

<p>Is there any way to undo this, or to convert Outlook webmail's autocomplete addresses into Contacts which can then be synced? Or is he going to need to manually add them all as contacts?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi maushawk,</p>
<p>In Office 365 Online, every time you send or reply a message in&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>, the recipients are stored known as the Auto-Complete List. The next time you start to type those names, the Auto-Complete List suggests
 names in your cache that are possible matches. However, to my knowledge, it is not feasible to convert the cached Auto-Complete List into Contacts in the online Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>I understand the user got his Outlook desktop from Office 365 suite. However, according to your description, he is using a hosted Exchange email account, not an Office 365 email account, right? If you are not sure about this, please provide the domain name
 in his email address. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message. Here is the URL of the PM:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations. You can provide the requested information in it.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Alex</p>

<p>Rather than spend more time trying to resolve this I have advised the customer he'll need to restore the contacts manually by copying &amp; pasting them from the Autocomplete menu into the desktop Outlook 365 program.</p>
<p>Wish there was some explanation for what most likely happened here and how to avoid it in future? As I have a lot of customers asking about moving to Office 365 but if cloud sync combined with webmail risks deleting their contacts or emails with no option
 to back up or restore, then I won't be recommending it.</p>

<p>Hi maushawk,</p>
<p>According to your description, the user is using an hosted Exchange email account in Outlook app that is downloaded from Office 365. Setting up an email account in Outlook app doesn't affect the existing contacts on your mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Office 365 Online, emails, contacts and calendar events are synced in Outlook, Outlook Web App and other mobile devices via Exchange connection. When a mailbox item is deleted, we can recover it by several motheds like<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Recover-deleted-items-or-email-in-Outlook-Web-App-c3d8fc15-eeef-4f1c-81df-e27964b7edd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            SUMIFS with nested Year &#38; Month&#63;... Any Help</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently attempting to SUM payment amount and display the totals in an overview sheet. &nbsp;I have the current formula set up as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(Reporting!$C:$C,Reporting!$B:$B,"&gt;=1/1/2015",Reporting$B:$B,"&lt;=1/1/2015",Reporting!$D:$D,"=Income")</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this formula is working, however, I am hoping to make the year calculated from the YEAR(A3) or YEAR(TODAY()) and the month calculated from MONTH(Reporting!B:B)=1. &nbsp;None of the adjustments that I have made seem to work. &nbsp;I have tried SUMPRODUCT as
 well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has an idea of how to make this formula work I would be grateful!</p>

<h2>            Access 2016 hangs when running currentdb.execute query</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade an app that works fine in Access 2013. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>CurrentDb.Execute "@UPdateMembership", dbFailOnError&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;hangs and I have to close Access with Task manager</p>
<p>My work around was to change the command to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoCmd.OpenQuery ("@updatemembership")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>

<p>Do you really have a query with a name that starts with the @-sign?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rename, and try again.</p>
<p>(actually I tried and it did not crash for me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If same problem I would compact the db, and from there simplify the query until it no longer crashes, trying to understand why it's happening. Maybe some form of corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can repro the bad behavior with a query in the Northwind sample database, I would be happy to look into it further.</p>

            <p>Yes Tom, I do have a query named with and "@" prefix and it has worked without issue in Access 2013.</p>
<p>In fact it works just fine if it is run directly by a user.</p>
<p>As noted above, I had to switch the syntax and now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also thought of and tried renaming it without the "@" but it made no difference.</p>

            <p>I got that. I can think of no reason that one syntax (OpenQuery) would work, and the other (Execute) would not.</p>
<p>To debug, I would run OpenQuery without the ubiquitous Docmd.Setwarnings False, so you can see if there are any exceptional warnings.</p>

            <p>Hi Bernard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, the issue may be caused by incompatibility of the applications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you use Office 2016 MSI on your PC? If so, please note the Skype for Busniess 2016 installed through Office 365 (Click-to-Run) may be not compatible with Office 2016 Standard (MSI, Volume Licensing) on same computer. Here is the statement:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-installed-with-Click-to-Run-and-Windows-Installer-on-same-computer-isn-t-supported-30775ef4-fa77-4f47-98fb-c5826a6926cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office installed using Click-to-Run and Window Installer on same computer isn't supported.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if you are assigned related license and have access to download Lync 2013, you can download it in
<a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 portal</a>, which is compatible with Office 2016 MSI.</p>

 this is not your scenario, could you please provide the information below?</p>
<p>1. A screenshot about the error message.</p>
<p>2. A screenshot about your Office's product information: File&gt; Account&gt; Product Information.</p>

    <title>My wife&#39;s hotmail account was hacked and hacker added phone number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norm husband of a wife with a hacked hotmail accou  say:</h3>
<h2>            My wife&#39;s hotmail account was hacked and hacker added phone number and alternate email</h2>
                    <p>My wife and I are not happy.&nbsp; Microsoft is helping the hacker not the valid owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happened.&nbsp; We are computer beginners and did not fill out a phone number and alternate email.&nbsp; The hacker did and now, Microsoft support relies on those 2 items as priority support for ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what we supplied to prove my wife is the owner: 1) we use the same IP address for the 20 years 2) hacker used a different IP address 3) hacker's telephone area code is different from the 20 year IP area code 4) as soon as the phone number and alternate
 email were added the hacker sent out emails to all my wife's contacts 5) my wife took a photo of herself which match the many photos in the account and this was sent to Microsoft 6) my wife supplied details of emails in the account 7) my wife provided a list
 of contacts in her account 8) my wife got her contacts to email Microsoft to say my wife is the person they have been emailing for 20 years 9) my wife has notified a credit agency to protect against identify theft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Common sense would conclude who the owner is.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is a flaw in Microsoft's department and they continue to fail to understand what is happening.&nbsp; We have been provided the above as proof of ownership and 3 Microsoft responses have said it
 is not enough and they are relying on the phone number and alternate email address.&nbsp; We have spent days to deal with Microsoft support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my wife does not get back her account, we would like Microsoft to at least permanently block the account but I fear, Microsoft will rely on the phone number and alternate email address and continue to give access to the hacker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are getting very frustrated dealing with Microsoft support.&nbsp; Quite possibly, there are other departments to contact.&nbsp; Maybe they have more common sense than Microsoft support.&nbsp; Any help to recover the hotmail is appreciated.&nbsp; I am so frustrated, I cannot
 proof read the above before posting it so I am sorry if there are grammar mistakes.</p>

<p>I am using Team Planner in Project 2010.&nbsp; I have only 8 resource names that fit on one page.&nbsp; When I have the Team Planner up to view, the scroll ends at page one, *which indicates to me that's all I have) however, when I want to print the Team Planner,
 it wants to print 162 pages!&nbsp; The first page is all I need as the rest of the 161 pages are blank with only the header row printed on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can prevent unnecessary pages from printing by setting the print "Page&nbsp;1 to Page 1" in the print setup, but I want to delete these extra pages from ever showing up.&nbsp; When I SAVE AS a pdf, all 162 pages are saved.&nbsp; The first page is the only valid page
 that I need.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> nightspear &#244;&#191;-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 not opening files from sharepoint 2010 hyperlink</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with Office 2010 Pro Plus not opening files from our sharepoint server. &nbsp;We are using IE 11 (x86) to open hyperlinks to files on our sharepoint server. All of the office files types hang while trying to open during downloading of document
 on the splash screen. I get the option for read only or to check out, both options fail after about 90 sec. The file will shoot out the error
<strong><em>"Sorry, we couldn't open file http://sparepoint_server/site/doument library/documentname.doc</em></strong><strong><em>"</em></strong>, docx, xls, or any other Office file extension. Excel is followed by "<em><strong>Microsoft excel cannot access
 the file http://sparepoint_server/site/doument library/document. There are several possible reasons: &nbsp;The file name or path does not exsist. the file is being used by another porgram. The workbook you are trying to save has the same name as a currently open
 workbook."&nbsp;</strong></em>Nothing looks suspicious in the event viewer to hint to anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the net for the last couple weeks for answers and nothing resolves the problem. I have the latest Office updates installed including service packs running on an HP Probook, Windows 7 pro, office 2010, Intel i3, and 8GB ram. and an HP pro3500
 series, Windows 7 pro, office 2013, i3, 4GB ram. I can download the file to the machine running Office 2010 or 2013 and everything works perfect, booting into safe mode with networking also works. All my other users a using Office 2007 Pro Plus and are not
 having any issues at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So far I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>verified the Sharepoint OpenDocument Class add-on is enabled&nbsp;- no change</li><li>verified no proxy setings&nbsp;- no change</li><li>Disabled active x filtering&nbsp;- no change</li><li>reset setting in IE&nbsp;- no change</li><li>restored advanced settings in IE&nbsp;- no change</li><li>added site to trusted site in IE - no change</li><li>disabled protected view in Office programs&nbsp;- no change</li><li>repair install of Office&nbsp;- no change</li><li>uninstalled and reinstalled Office and IE (tested without updates - no change, installed updates - no change)</li><li>ran sfc - clean</li><li>tested hardware - clean</li><li>upgraded one machine to office 2013 pro plus - no change</li><li>set UseBasicAuth in registry for non-SSL connection- no change</li><li>clean boot - no change</li><li>added sharepoint site to trusted locations in respective programs&nbsp;- no change</li><li>allowed non-SSL trusted locations in&nbsp;respective programs&nbsp;- no change</li><li>disabled AV&nbsp;&nbsp;- no change</l
<p>
</p><p>One thing I noticed between the different versions of Office is that in 2007 the document will open directly from the sharepoint server without downloading. Office 2010 and 2013 will download the file and kick out the error. I have screen shots if needed.
 I am starting to think it is driver related due to it working in safe mode.&nbsp;Any and all info would be greatly appreciated.</p>
