<h2>            I see many websites that sell very cheap windows 10 product keys</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the internet, I see many websites in the US and in many countries like in Thailan, my hometown, are selling windows 10 product key at very cheap price. Some of them sell at $10 for a windows 10 pro product key, and they receive good reviews from users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I am wondering:</p>
<p>- Does Microsoft know about this?</p>
<p>- How can they sell product keys at very cheap price?</p>
<p>- Are they authorized seller?</p>
<p>- How can they get the keys?</p>
<p>- Do Microsoft give them permission to sell product keys at very cheap price?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the keys are genuine, but they receive good reviews from buyers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** UPDATE ***</p>
<p>The buyers also receive digital license activation method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regard,</p>
<p>Sura Wankam</p>

            Hi Sura,
<br />
<br />- There's no telling if Microsoft acknowledges these websites, but it's likely.
<br />- Most of the time, these sellers provide volume license keys, or keys that are used by organizations, which are usually stolen. The "volume" in volume license keys means that it can be used and activated with a volume, or a mass, of computers. They are not meant to be used in a personal setting.
<br />- These sites are no way affiliated with Microsoft, they are not authorized resellers.
<br />- Refer to the second question.
<br />- It doesn't seem that Microsoft is approving of what they are doing. It may work for some people, but for some others, they find that their license might deactivate out of nowhere and be deemed as non-genuine.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend that you purchase from a known authorized reseller, or through the Microsoft Store directly, if you want to guarantee to get mileage out of your Windows license, because it's not worth going through the trouble of having your license deemed illegitimate later on.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

            These sites generally sell volume license keys. And more than often they fail or Windows is not able to activate them or they fail later on when number of license keys exceed in Microsoft servers than what was permitted.
<br />
<br />You should buy the keys only reputed sellers where you get good support / replacement guarantee.
<br />
<br />The reviews which are written there generally cooked up. Don't fall for them.

            Sura,
<br />
<br />I assume they're talking about digital entitlements. Simply put, a license can be unique to your computer given it retains its original motherboard, and you won't have to ever enter a product key when you reinstall Windows.
<br />
<br />This can happen on whatever route you go, those sellers, or through Microsoft directly. As long as your license is valid, you can reinstall Windows without a product key, which is convenient.

<p>Hi mEverBlack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry that I didn't tell you more information. </p>
<p>What I also found is that the sellers just sell product keys to the buyers. The product keys can use in the new computers and new windows. The sellers also claim that the keys are retail version (Full Package Product). And they also get many good reviews
 from buyers. I see some of the buyers reviewed that they got the message when typing "slmgr /xpr" in CMD, "The machine is permantly activated". I will attach the link for you to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>In this Thai website, the seller is selling windows 10 product key retail version only at 140 baht, which costs around $4.49. In the reviews of the buyers, they love it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keys give Digital License actvation method and the message "The machine is permanently activated"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how the sellers can sell Windows 10 Professional Product Key at this cheap price?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has Microsoft been violated?</p>

            Hi Sura,
<br />
<br />These are not genuine product keys for the general public. They are volume licence keys. They will work for a time and then they will require re-arming.
<br />
<br />In a company or organisation these product keys are used to install hundreds, maybe thousands of PC's and on a regular basis, the company server will re-arm those PC's - that is why these product keys are of no use to the general public
<br />
<br />This is a scam and and as the saying goes - if it sounds too good to be true, it generally is !!

            The are likely reselling MSDN keys.
<br />
<br />About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys 
<br />They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.
<br />
<br />In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.

<p>Hi Andre Da Costa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for this answer. Actually, I didn't buy the key from these sellers, I just found this website during surfing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, I am wondering how the license description will look like if they are MSDN keys when typing slmgr /dli or slmgr /dlv in CMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that in Windows 10, there are 3 versions of product, OEM_DM, RETAIL, VOLUME_MAK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know what the channel version for MSDN keys would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the picture cropped in Paint 3D below is my OEM channel when typing slmgr /dli in CMD. And in my retail version, the channel will change to "Windows(R) Operating System, RETAIL channel."</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be349954-15bd-418f-bf27-dd8c64913fa4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be349954-15bd-418f-bf27-dd8c64913fa4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But for the MSDN keys, could you please tell me how they should be? VOLUME_MAK? Or RETAIL? Or are there other ways to check?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can give the answer for this, it will be very useful for checking channel version in Windows 10.</p>

            Its gonna appear like a normal retail license. 
<br />
<br />You have an OEM Windows 10 Pro license installed.

            Sura,<br /><br />I believe it’s just a case of your mileage may vary. What I do know certainly is that Microsoft does not condone this kind of activity, and to use it with your computer is not a sure thing.<br /><br />So what Microsoft recommends is that you either purchase a Windows 10 license from them or any authorized reseller. If you purchase from these sellers that offer these keys on the cheap, there is no recourse when your license gets deactivated or is considered illegitimate.<br /><br />What I am trying to say here is: be cautious. It’s a risk in itself to purchase one of these keys. Not saying for sure you’ll face issues, but you should keep your guard up.<br /><br />Best of luck.

I have no idea what is critical and what is not.&nbsp; I suspect @BIOS should not be touched.&nbsp; That is the reason I suggested you contact Gigabyte.<br />

My hunch is that you can remove on/off charge.&nbsp; I am fairly certain you can remove EasyTune, SetupN, and app center.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Do you get an error message displayed along with the blue screen?</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Where you able to use sleep mode successfully earlier?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue screen usually occur due to hardware malfunction mainly due to corruption in the drivers on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that you first uninstall the card drivers available on the computer as there is a possibility that they may be corrupted and later install the latest driver for network card by
 visiting the manufacturer website and check if it works fine</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the bluescreen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".<br />
<br />
Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.<br />
<br />
As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.<br />
<br />
If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
<br />
Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
<br />
Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.<br />
<br />
If so, it might be as simple as dust buildup and subsequently inadequate cooling.<br />
<br />
I would download cpu-z and gpu-z (both free) and keep an eye on the video temps<br />

<p>
</p><p>Even though you might get this message, you can always run Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver.
</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>Type: <strong>wuapp</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5337c9ae-b165-4585-928f-725bc09c7039" /></p>
<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

    <title>Video Memory Management Internal BSOD and Freezing Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wasin p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Memory Management Internal BSOD and Freezing Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the latest Windows updates and also the graphics-card driver update (Nvidia Geforce GT 750M) (both were updated this morning), my laptop has started crashing with BSOD "Video Memory Management Internal" with no code appearing on the blue screen. Every
 time&nbsp;after the rebooting, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">my laptop may either crash with the same BSOD again or just freeze and cannot do anything&nbsp;after it finished rebooting for a while (no matter after I launched programs, a browser, MS Word or
 just didn't touch anything; I've to&nbsp;force turn off the laptop by pressing power button for seconds, other options don't work at all).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, since the Windows launched update around a year ago, I cannot play any computer games since then and always have problems with graphics-driver updates, it always crashed with BSOD (dxgmms2.sys), but recently this BSOD just be fixed, I guess.
 Cannot playing games for years is very tough time, but cannot finish any works because the screen just keep freezing is tougher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read <strong>ZigZag3143's suggestion</strong> in one Q, so I provide my DMP file download-link below. I posted this in safe mode with the network connection and it's working fine in this mode. (My laptop is Dell Inspiron 14R 5437)&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for all your help&nbsp;and supports.</p>

<p>Thats just the column headings, so it should mean (as per the Dev man reports) there are no obvious problematic devices.<em><br />

<p>Other things to try, as your PC doesn't seem to be reporting any problematic devices:<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Slow computers can be caused by many things from corrupt configuration, to lack of a driver to malware and many more. After time a PC can sometimes just get slow and may require a re-install of the OS. (If you decide to reinstall backup all your data first)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Quick basic checks to try:<br />
</p>
<p>1. run a disk error check - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641432</a><br />

</p>
<p>3. Try creating a new user account and see if using that account is still slow -

            I have just tried switching my default photo viewer to Irfanview. I can confirm that the above procedure DOES NOT WORK in Windows 10. Within seconds of making the switch I get an error message telling me that an application has changed the default and
 Windows then resets it to Microsoft's default app. If somebody knows how this can be done please help!

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes when starting a program</h2>
                    Whenever I start windows, and open any program, my laptop freezes completely. I am forced to force shut down my laptop. I tried restarting my computer many times but the problem still persists. I checked task manager to see what happens when I open a program
 and I found that the CPU, DISK, and NETWORK go to 0%. I don't know why this happens but this SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. This is completely unacceptable since I use my laptop for school work. Now I have to use my tablet because of this.

    <title>Dark theme for Windows applications&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parxtroiani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dark theme for Windows applications&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before some admin comes on here and says "looks like you can add this to the endlessly ignored abyss called the suggestions section." please just read. (oh no not this again, time to move the thread)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to a predominantly technology based school for animation where we use adobe software and Autodesk software.&nbsp;People that do anything similar sit in front of dark applications (more than likely in a dark environment) like Photoshop, and Maya or similar
 until they have to open a file.&nbsp;Upon opening the explorer to import something I am greeted by the equivalent of a&nbsp;strobe light point blank&nbsp;to the eyes as windows&nbsp;file explorer&nbsp;flips both middle fingers&nbsp;up in the air&nbsp;while screaming<em><strong>"WAKE&nbsp; THE F***** UP!"&nbsp;</strong></em>Many other people have expressed their feelings on this over many years, and absolutely nothing has been done aside from a small few things like the Settings application, or Groove Music.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But both&nbsp;Autodesk and Adobe have&nbsp;realized that their consumers are in front of a computer &lt;&gt;90% of their day and give the option to make all of their software dark as to not burn the retinas out of my eyes. Microsoft is a much larger and more capable company
 from my understanding and actually <strong>makes</strong> the operating system and doesn't think for a second that
<em>"maybe people sit at their desks most of their day." "Nah what a silly thought."</em> So of course I'm not just posting angrily on a forum only to inevitably be ignored without having done some research beforehand. So of course the first thing any person
 would do is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google: how do I make my windows explorer dark?</p>
<p>http://www.howtogeek.com/222614/how-to-enable-windows-10s-hidden-dark-theme/</p>
<p>I tried following this and I wasn't able to do everything it asked due to some registry error. and I think its absolutely absurd that we have to jump through hoops in the ownership of file and registries&nbsp;just to change the background of every application
 to dark and I've given up after 5 hours of tinkering and fiddling and Googling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to get the answer for this a couple times a year just in hopes that maybe something has changed something, but I always get answers like:</p>
<p>"How to turn your brightness down"</p>
<p>"This application changes your screen tint based on the time of the day"</p>
<p>"WOW what a great idea, you should put this in the suggestions section" </p>
<p>"Unfortunately windows doesn't care enough about their community's opinions"</p>
<p>"Maybe you shouldn't be in front of a computer as much as you are"</p>
<p>"Here's another workaround that requires you to tirelessly mess with your registry and file ownership"</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the reason I didn't put this in the suggestions is because I am not asking<strong> if you can</strong> add the option to put dark theme on all windows apps, I'm asking any admin, or anybody with knowledge of the issue
<strong>why</strong>&nbsp;a simple thing like that&nbsp;hasn't been added.</p>

            <p>This feature has been added already. You need to have the Anniversary update to be able to use the feature. Make sure that your OS is fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have the Anniversary update, then you need to solve the registry error that you mentioned for you to actually enable it. Here are some things that you can do if registry errors are hindering you to enable the dark theme:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been looking for a way to change the explorer for years, at times using skins to change them which will stop working when windows launches big updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like an easy task to give the option to change from white to dark, but this isnt the case based on how the OS is coded. (Though it is incredible stupid) I am sure MANY users would be greatful for a dark theme. But as all things, most features are
 not used by the vast majority which at times results useful features being taken away because a low % uses them. This mindset is wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us more customizations, and an updated file explorer (I know you are working on one, but make it a priority. We've had this file explorer design for years now)</p>

 several hours (repeated twice now), it finished the copy, stated there were several bad sectors (which tells me it was good I tried to replace it when I did), and after shut-down, and running solely off the new drive, I get errors which prevent the OS from
 loading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I loaded the Win 8 disc for recovery as instructed by the first&nbsp;error, I try running the advanced items:&nbsp; First, to "auto-diagnose &amp; repair," then when that fails it recommends to "Refresh your PC," which also errors out and it states (much more meaningfully
 at least) that&nbsp;the drive is locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never done the port from drive-to-drive with a Win 8 PC before, but with none of the other Win 7, Vista, and XP moves I did, did I have an issue.&nbsp; Can anyone point me in the right direction?&nbsp; I'm fairly certain it's related to the drive being locked
 thing, and worst case, I have another Win 8 desktop I can put the drive in if there's something I can do to unlock it.&nbsp; The key is, I'm trying to save time, and having to do a&nbsp;"clean" OS install, finding/reinstalling all my software, and re-downloading all
 my DRM'd media may not be an option before I leave....&nbsp; my system specs and the exact error messages are below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exact error messages:</p>
<p>BOOT ERROR AFTER TRANSFER (from OS on disc):&nbsp; "Your PC needs to be repaired.&nbsp; A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed.&nbsp; Error code:&nbsp; 0xc000000e.&nbsp; You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media..."</p>
<p>AUTOMATIC REPAIR:&nbsp; "Automatic Repair Couldn't repair your PC.&nbsp; Press "Advanced options" and try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC.&nbsp; Log file:&nbsp; \system32\logfiles\SRT\SrtTrail.txt"
</p>
<p>--(didn't post this yet, but if needed I can pull the drive, find it and reply to this thread with it)</p>
<p>REFRESH YOUR PC:&nbsp; "The drive where Windows is installed is locked.&nbsp; Unlock the drive and try again."</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look on The Win 8 Disk for a "Boot Repair"...I had to do this under similar conditions, and that fixed it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also try this....</p>
<p>The first 4 steps will be slightly different for a Repair Disk as compared to an installation Disk...
</p>
<p>You basically just need to get to the Command Prompt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>1. Put the Windows installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.
</p>
<p>2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.</p>
<p>3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.
</p>
<p>4. Click Repair your computer. </p>
<p>5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next. </p>
<p>6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt. </p>
<p>7. Type BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>8. Type BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>9. Type BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER. </p>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death after attempting defragmentation of drives, repeatedly</h2>
                    Hello, I'm having maajor issues everytime I attempt to defragment both of internal hard drives on an Acer Aspire 5920 laptop running Windows Vista (completely updated with drivers, etc running the latest versions).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A blue screen pops up while the system is going through defragmentation (doesn't matter whether I run the Vista defrag tool or just run defrag through cmd).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on what might be causing this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">I've run CHKDSK multiple times and it comes up with 0% bad sectors, uninstalled all anti-virus software utilities etc</span>, so I'm thinking something else is rotten in Denmark.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I took a photo of the exact blue screen that pops up and it's linked <a href="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/6700/bluescreen.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Gaming isn't how it used to be. It used to be people would talk in games and you could make and find some cool friends. Now that they have party chat it makes it difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoy playing Team Deathmatch. if you have a mic and are looking for someone to play with hit me up!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Would like to change my email account associated with my account login - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Would like to change my email account associated with my account login - e.g. change Log in ID.</h2>
                    <p>I would like to change my email address that I have associated with my account login/ User ID/Account Login.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Must I delete the account and then create a new account with the different email address I want to use?&nbsp; In the Edit Profile option I am able to update my email address but this is simply to change what email is used to send information to my account, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
