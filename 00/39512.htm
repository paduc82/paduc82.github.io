<h2>            Moved my account region to the wrong country</h2>
                    
<p>Today, I tried again to move my account region back to Brazil. Everytime I tried that an error showed up. Then, I selected Argentina just to see if the same error should appear. It didn't. No confirmation of what I wanted was asked and now I'm stuck at Argentina
 for three months! I can not go back to my USA account, and can not go the region I really wanted. How can I fix that? I can not buy games at Argentina, and I used to buy games almost every week. I can not wait 3 months to buy games again! And it's ridiculous
 that a decision with such impact don't have at least a confirmation before that. I can not be punished for a interface mistake of yours! I want to move back my account or move to my correct country, please.</p>

<p>not true it asks you to confirm it at least I think 2 times before it goes through, and sorry you have no choice you have to wait the 3 months.</p>

<p>Hi rdourado,<br />
<br />
If you pick a region you can successfully change to it would give you the terms of service to agree to again before changing your region. If you aren't able to change your region it will display an error message right at the beginning of the process. If you
 were having an issue changing account regions you should not select another region to try to change to. You should instead contact Xbox Support in that country/region for assistance in finding out why you're not able to change regions. They can see the exact
 date that you've switched regions previously and tell you what's going on.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as you've already completed a region change, you will now need to wait 3 months before being able to change again. There are no exceptions in the case of region migrations.</p>

<p>I did not agree with the new terms of service. But that did not cancel my action. Instead, if I don't agree with the new terms of service I'm just disconnected. There is no confirmation for an action that ties me for three months to a country where I don't
 even speak their language. That's just the stupidest thing I've ever saw MS do.</p>

<p>Hello rdourado, I'm sorry to hear about this! There definitely will be a confirmation screen before the migration is initialized. &nbsp;We want to make sure to avoid such situations. However, you can still change the language on the console, which should help
 some of this for you.<br />
<br />
Here's how to get that changed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<b>Guide</b>&nbsp;button on your controller. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>System Settings</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Console Settings</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Language and Locale</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Language</b>. </li><li>Select the language that you want to use. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;I'm afraid there is no way to expedite the region change process.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
EricLaw's IEInternals - A look at Internet Explorer from the inside out. - Understanding DEP/NX<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/10/10/Understanding-Data-Execution-Prevention-Crashes-in-IE8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/ieinternals/archive/2009/10/10/Understanding-Data-Execution-Prevention-Crashes-in-IE8.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
The problem might actually be an addon or other program causing the problem and you should check that<br />
1st.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER has on this<br />
machines including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Reset all Zones to default level - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
Close&nbsp;IE and then try IE and/or IE with no Addons<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />

<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be
<br />
unusual with Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then
<br />
run it as a scanner. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
I would add prevx as well.<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security programs. This is
<br />
a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

Do yourself a big favor and work through the above 1st.<br />

<h2>            qualcomm atheros ethernet slow not working properly.</h2>
                    <p>running windows 10 everything is up to date. i have a 10/100/1000 gigabit ethernet card&nbsp;qualcomm atheros ar8161&nbsp; since the last few microsoft windows 10 updates i have been having an issue with my internet speed. before i would get 250 mbps download speed&nbsp;
 now it varies an stays below 80mbps download. i went to device manager and seen the settings for fast/duplex but i only find 10/100 and not 10/100/1000 i tried to update but it says i have the latest drivers up to date. i changed my cat 5 cable to my router
 and checked all connections. if i use my cell phone wireless i get my 190 mbps speed so i know it is not the modem or router. i have plugged in to my modem directly to rule out issue with router no improvement. i spoke with a few people and they are not sure
 of what the issue is i even disabled my antivirus. i have made no changes or added any apps to my system that can cause this. also done a netwok troubolshoot it says it is working. do not know where to go from here ? please give details. thanks , gio</p>

            Hi sergiom3,
<br />
<br />"CAT5 uses either the 10BASE-T or 100BASE-T standard for data transmission. 
<br />Using two cable pairs to signal over copper wire, CAT5 is now largely archaic and isn't widely used for Ethernet connections. 
<br />It's rated for a maximum frequency of 100 MHz and top speeds of 100 Mbps."
<br />
<br />I would recommend you upgrade your cable to cat 5e/6 at least.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it's the auto negotiation that is detecting a lower spec'ed cable &amp; defaulting to 10/100.
<br />
<br />"Category 5 enhanced cabling, also known as Cat5e, is an improvement on Cat5 cabling. It was made to support 1000 Mbps "gigabit" speeds, so in theory, it's faster than Cat5. It it also cuts down on crosstalk, the interference you can sometimes get between wires inside the cable."
<br />
<br />To go beyond, 100Mbps, both ports should be able to support Gigabit Ethernet. 
<br />The Qualcomm Atheros ar8161 PCI-E card fullfills this criteria.
<br />As you managed to achieved  250 Mbps download speed before I'm going to assume that the router is able to support that too.
<br />
<br />If the cable route fails, I would suggest to reinstall the drivers for the PCI-E Ethernet card.

 if that will work or if it is being caused by microsoft windows 10 updates ?</p>

<h2>            xbox360 saindo do jogo sozinho</h2>
                    
<p>Já há algum tempo, meu xbox360 começou a sair sozinho dos jogos com mídia. Durante o jogo, ele simplesmente vai para a Dash sem nenhuma mensagem de erro. Então da quadro do Iniciar referente à mídia, fica aparecendo escrito "abrindo" e não acontece mais
 nada.</p>
<p>Procurei pela net e encontrei muitas pessoas com o mesmo problema, mas nenhuma solução.</p>
<p>Alguém sabe resolver isso?</p>

            Hi Technificient.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            this was not caused by the 1809 update. I am on the latest update version of 1803.<br />
and im not going to uninstall any updates as that will cause stability issues.<br />
Is there a group policy I can change to get the missing security options back for registry objects?

<h2>            How to convert Windows 10 Home to Education&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I currently have widows 10 home edition on my laptop and need to use Hyper-V. Since I have access to win 10 Education through my university I would like to switch to the Education version. What is the best way to go around doing this?</p>
<p>If it involves using the iso image and booting will I lose any data?</p>

            <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Right Click On the notifications icon</p>
<p>2) Click Open Action Center --&gt; All Settings --&gt; System --&gt; About --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Change Product Key Or Upgrade Your Edition of Windows --&gt; Change Product Key</p>
<p>3) Enter your windows 10 education version key here(I am not sure if any other version works)</p>
<p>4) Follow instructions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole process should take less than an hour or so, I now have windows 10 education version with absolutely no loss of settings/programs/files or any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note this is simply my solution, please try at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S This also works for win 8/8.1 but the process is a bit different to change the key.</p>

<h2>            Control panel - Display option disappeared</h2>
                    I had installed a program. &nbsp; All of my displays became micro small. &nbsp; I uninstalled the program. &nbsp; All of my displays are still micro small (icons on display and file explore --- can't read). &nbsp; I went under control panel, appearance and display. &nbsp; I no
 longer have the display option to change. &nbsp; Do I need to reinstall windows 10?

<br />
<br />I haven't seen anything like it, to be honest. That is a strange issue.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Microsoft made an awful decision in removing a setting that could be instrumental in fixing this problem.
<br />
<br />You can try using Advanced System Font Changer here (third party software) to change the size and see if it would make a difference: <a href="https://www.wintools.info/index.php/advanced-system-font-changer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wintools.info/index.php/advanced-sy...</a>
<br />
<br />Maybe run System Restore and see if there's a restore point before that application was installed? (Start &gt; type in "System Restore", click Create a restore point, new dialog box should appear then click the "System Restore..." button, and follow the prompts)
<br />
<br />If not, your last ditch effort method is to go into Windows key + I, then navigate to Update &amp; Security, then Recovery. Under Reset this PC, unless if you *absolutely* have to, you can keep your files but not your apps and settings, you can choose to reset the PC of any settings and click "Get started".
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try changing resolutions to see if you can find one that works like it once did.
<br />
<br />See if you have a System Restore point to revert back before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  
<br />
<br />If you have the latest driver then right click it in Device Manager to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>

Dolby digital plus keeps turning off and sound is very low
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with the audio driver on my Acer aspire V15 nitro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to windows 10 I had a strange problem with the sound being low, even if I set it to 100%. I saw that if I enable the Dolby Digital Plus from control panel the problem is solved.&nbsp; However, it works till I start to play a song from
 my computer or from the internet, when the sound automatically drops back to low (the power level still remains the same). I saw that the Digital Dolby Plus is turned off automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using process monitor I found that the audiodg.exe is the process which changes the registry key to turn off Dolby Digital Plus, when I play any sound on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is quite annoying, I done further research. What I discovered is quite surprising. I had "Hey cortana" option enabled in Cortana, and it looks like this is the cause of the problem. When I disable the "Hey Cortana" I am able to play music,
 watch videos on the internet and so on, and the Dolby digital plus does not turn off automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will write what I tried as solution to avoid posting some basic question regarding the possible solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I did a reset of my PC from recovery, without saving any data after upgrade, no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have the latest Realtek HD audio drivers installed (from the manufacturer web page). (also windows update does not give me any other more recent driver)</p>
<p>3. I reinstalled the drivers a few times, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change the permissions to the registry to disable the automatic changing of the registry. Bad idea, since the sound disappeared completely:)). Thus, i needed to change back to the original permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted it on technet forums, no luck, I contacted Microsoft support via the app, no solution, actually they told me to post the problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution would be great, since it is quite annoying problem. My notebook has 4 built in speakers and it can be really loud, but with digital dolby disabled is really low, even at 100% power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the "solution" is to disable "Hey cortana" setting, but, this should be just the temporary solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I did not have this problem when I was testing as an Insider on my other notebook even if the audio driver is still from Realtek (probably other model).</p>
<p>PS2: The problem is also posted on acer community forums and there are other people having the same problem. There are also other types on notebooks mentioned there not just mine.</p>

    <title>Disabling a Hard drive in Device Manager makes it stop spinning and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disabling a Hard drive in Device Manager makes it stop spinning and using power&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>If I go in DEVICE MANAGER - DISK DRIVES, then I right-click on my second&nbsp;internal hard drive (not the main one on which Windows Vista is installed, but my additional hard drive that I have bought separately and added inside&nbsp;my computer on a SATA port) ,
 then I click on DISABLE, then can you tell me&nbsp;if this hard drive:</p>
<p>1. Stops spinning?</p>
<p>2. Still uses power?</p>
<p>Simply put, does DISABLING an internal hard drive in Device Manager stop it&nbsp;from using power and from spinning?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is this: I want to use that second hard drive only for&nbsp;backup, therefore I don't want it to use power and to wear out when I am not&nbsp;doing a backup, in other words, almost all the time.</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

thanks coork!<br />
<br />
and it doesn't stop spinning, right?<br />
<br />
this second hard drive is in my laptop and I need to use it only once a week or less;&nbsp;<br />
so I want it to stop spinning when I'm not using it so to preserve its service life;
<br />
judging by your answer, the ONLY WAY to do that would be to keep this second drive out of the laptop for most of the time and put it in only when I need it?<br />
<br />
there is not another more practical way? (using an external hard drive enclosure is not a solution since I want it all to be easily mobile)&nbsp;(that would have been so nice if DISABLING the drive would do that...)<br />
<br />
thanks again!

            your looking at more trouble tha it is worth ...............<br />
<br />
a lot of lap tops only have one drive partitioned into 2 hd <br />
<br />
another thought though may be to purchase a usb thumb drive they come in very larges sizes now that would be portable a tou could plug it in only when needed

            Hi there,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am still encountering the same issue where my OS hangs or freezes. Today it has happened 5 times in the space of 3 hours.</div>
<div><br />
<div>please see attached screenshots:</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is enough space on the HardDrive:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bc6ad16-4530-405e-bd96-c6c8195d2fb5" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>Below are my comp specs, which meet the requirements:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f737c9c-d201-40a5-9ee0-ada254d7961a" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue seems to occur when the CPU is spiking:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21b4dff4-c30b-4026-82a9-a6a15750e888" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>And it is constantly running above the normal CPU levels:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab0cbecf-21d3-494c-9eed-cd7f355f6d43" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>And this is the result of the chkdsk:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9072830f-454f-45fc-958b-9606ab5234b2" /></div>

<div>And this is snap shot of the event viewer:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d48378c4-fbf0-47b7-bb3e-b7d9b9bf06ea" /></div>

<br />
My phone is Samsung S3 i9300<br />
Android version = 4.3<br />
<br />
Apart from that the issue has not occurred.<br />

                    I have what looks like a link page that says "(Untitled)" that I am unable to close by hitting the close button.&nbsp; There is a second square box at the end of the heading that has a + symbol, and when I hit that it just opens another "untitled" window.&nbsp;
 This happened after upgrading Firefox and Adobe.

<p>Hi <strong>Orondo</strong>,</p>
<p>As this issue occurred after upgrading firefox and adobe, I would suggest you to check for this issue in safe mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Refer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p><strong>If the issue does not recur in safe mode, then I would recommend you to perform clean boot.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />
&nbsp;<br />

</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Janet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the printer?</li><li>Do you have the printer manual with you?</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>The following factors can cause paper jams:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Paper loaded incorrectly in the paper tray.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Damaged or dirty paper rollers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Torn, wrinkled, or damp paper loaded in the paper tray.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The rear access door or two-sided printing accessory (duplexer) might not be closed or is not locked into place.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Paper was added to a stack already in the tray.<br />
</span><span>The tray contains more than one type of paper.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Torn pieces of paper from a previous jam are stuck in the product.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The tray is too full.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If printing on an envelope, the edges of the envelope are bent.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent damage to the printer, check the information that came with the printer to see how to remove paper jams. Depending on the printer and where the problem occurred, you might want to try one of these options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Go to the printer, check for messages in the status or display area on the printer that might tell you where the problem occurred, and then complete any steps provided to remove the paper jam. If the printer does not display information about
 the problem, check the information that came with the printer. If the printer is connected to a network domain, contact a system administrator or your company support desk for assistance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Some printers offer a button that you can press and hold, or another paper feed option that you can use to try to extract paper without damaging the printer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You might need to open the printer casing and remove the paper that is causing the problem. Before you do, check the information that came with the printer to see if you should turn off the printer or take other steps to prevent injury to
 yourself or damage to the printer.</p>
<p>You should also check if opening the printer casing will void the warranty or any repair agreements that you've purchased or that came with the printer. For information about agreements, check the retail and manufacturer information that came
 with the printer.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If the issue remains, u<span>se printer manual for help or get in touch with printer manufacturer for help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h3> norianodoshiho  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Harddrive not accessible the request is not supported</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from windows 8 to windows 10 when I plugged my Seagate BUP External Hard Drive 1TB.</p>
<p>In the file explorer it is read as Local Disk (F:) Opening it yields this dialog box</p>
<p>
</p><p>"F:\ is not accessible</p>
<p>The request is not supported"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching for solutions for hours and nothing seems to work. I can't just format this drive since all of my important files for school and work are in their. 10 years worth of collected data is in there. It is not also guaranteed that formatting
 the device will fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been around since August 2016 (not entirely sure) so if there at any users out there that had the same problem please help me fix this. As I've said earlier I have been&nbsp;searching extensively for solutions and nothing works and windows 10 still
 keeps denying access to my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>From all of the information I can find, including THIS thread, Instagram just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not work with Windows based devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is intended for mobile devices but, the only app stores they show are iTunes and Google Play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on a computer (even a Mac) you can only view posts from others but not leave any posts. I even tried work-a-rounds that are purported to work. They did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due respect to the Microsoft folks they&nbsp; are trying to pass the buck rather than being up front.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is that Instagram shuts Windows users out and there is nothing that Microsoft can do about it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am&nbsp; wrong and someone can tell me of a way to use Instagram from a Windows device (computer or phone) that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with the mobile world (Instagram is intended for mobile devices) the companies seem to focus on iOS and Android. I believe it has to do with Windows phone being a niche market and the fact that Apple was once the niche with limited software options
 since Microsoft had the lion's share of the market.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I just got my new PC which I discovered having Windows 10 installed. I used to play with my friends on Xbox One so I downloaded Xbox One App for Windows 10 and I created a Group. I first noticed that my player icon was glowing as it does when you talk, but I wasn't actually talking. Then a friend joined and told me that there was a noise that nobody could stand because too loud. I downloaded discord and everything is fine with my mic and my configuration. I tried everything but can't resolve this. Please Help :)</p><p>SliiMe.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to the internet after installing Windows 8.1.</h2>
                    Since installing windows 8.1 I have not been able to connect to the internet. I am using a windows 7 computer at the moment and they are both connected to the same router, so the problem obviously lies within windows 8.1. When ever I connect it says that
 I have 5 bars, however when I try to go on the internet it just wont load any page whether I am using Chrome or Internet Explorer. I hope there is a solution to this problem, and I am sure I am not the only one having it

<h2>            Batman Arkham Asylum probably going to get cancelled</h2>
                    
<p>I think so it was announced for ever ago and nothing new released because some clad photos of catwomen to get horny kids to pre order it but it's cancelled. nothing out yet it was announced years ago going on about duke nukem. plus the movie isn't doing
 too good they're running out of money and Christain Bale said he might quit the project to work on the new inception movie probably. he's not even voicing batman in the game. i think they should just cut their losees and make it in a x men first class game
 now that movie looks bad @@@!</p>

<p>Batman is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who voiced the character in Batman the Animated Series and the Justice League cartoon series.</p>

<p>In fact most of the principal voice cast for the Rocksteady Batman games (Arkham Asylum and Arkham City) are pulled from the series.</p>

<p>The first one sold well, so it has not been cancelled. It does have a solid confirmed and official October 21st release date and we'll also see more of it at E3.
</p>
<p>So before saying a game maybe cancelled, first check to see if it was given a official release date. In the case of Batman:AA it has.</p>

<p>What are you talking about???, &nbsp;Barman Arkham City, Not Asylum (which is already out), Arkham City is due to be previewed at this mouths E3. and is ready to ship in October 21, 2011 (Release date from
<a href="http://uk.ps3.ign.com/objects/055/055050.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IGN</a>). So where is your source that states B.A.C&nbsp;may be canceled and why would a new movie have any play in it</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If you had done some homework then you would know that the last two films and games&nbsp;where funded by WARNER BROS cant see them running out of money and taking the budget from

    <title>Creating a user account does not create a profile. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertweiner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a user account does not create a profile.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop running Windows 7 SP1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a user new user account and try to sign on to it,&nbsp;I get the service profile loading error message. I have looked through this community at all the other messages and every time this question is asked it is assumed that the profile is corrupted
 and the replies all say to go to the tutorials on how to repair a corrupted user profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is NOT that the profile is corrupted. The problem IS that the profile DOES NOT EXIST! There is no&nbsp;SID key&nbsp;entry in the registry, and&nbsp;there&nbsp;is no folder created in the Users directory on the system disk. The only SID key&nbsp;entries in the registry&nbsp;are
 ones for previously existing users that are working properly. The only place the new account shows up is on the sign in screen and on the Manage Accounts Screen in Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the SFC utility and it found no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One response was to do a System Restore back to before the last user account was created successfully. For me that was 6 months ago. Even if I had a restore point that old, I would not use it. I have made too many changes to my system since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am not the only one having this problem, it would seem that some amount of resources should be assigned to it by Microsoft Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being able to create an User Account is a major problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help anyone can give to me.</p>
<p>

            <p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to follow the instructions in the link you sent me. As I said in my original query, there is no failed user profile. The problem is that a user profile is not created when I create a new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disregarding that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions the best I could. I tried to log into WinRE. I do not have a Win7 DVD. The only thing I have is a Windows repair disk which I created on the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I got to the System Recovery Options and selected command prompt. This opens the command prompt and I am at the directory x:\sources\recovery\Tools. Trying to enter the lusrmgr.msc in any way shape of form, either on its own or with the full directory
 path yields: "lusrmgr.msc is not recognized as an internal or external command".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I boot my system in SAFE MODE. then entered the command lusrmgr.msc. The Local Users and Groups screen comes up and says that I cannot run this snapin because this computer is running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run Microsoft safety scanner </strong>to check if the issue is caused by any infection like a virus or a malware.<br />

<p>Thinking I should have added: After creating the new account(s) in Control Panel (that have no profiles and do not work), then go to C:\Users, right click it,Share with, Security tab, Edit, Add, type new user acct. name(s), close out and restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget to disable the built-in admin account after everything new works well. It is not safe to have enabled. Anyway... again, hope this helps someone. It took me 3 days, lol. Nice now. Another helpful (?) link:&nbsp;

            <p>Indeed. Let me clear that up. I set the restore point <strong>before</strong> I dove in and tried a lot of various things in order to search for the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote from my post above:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"First, I created a restore point. Then I went overboard and shared it in every way with everyone in the Users list in Control Panel (4 tests). It worked! Now I will go back with System Restore to clean up my mess and then proceed slowly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unquote</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I found the solution, then I restored to erase all the mess I had made and then implemented the solution through the settings etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things are working great now. I disabled the built in admin and guest accounts, and I run on a standard users account with default permissions. Also have a separate admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me 3 days to find the answer. Hope this helps someone.</p>

 - Gold Pack if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: so far i have tried qllmmethods suggested byput i've had no success, im going to run it again and see what error messages pop up and add them to this so help is easier to find</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi OmegaUprising
<br />
<br />It is very unlikely a game aimed at Windows PX will ever run on Windows 10
<br />
<br />A game aimed at Windows 7 will more than likely run on Windows 10
<br />
<br />Open the CD disk in File Explorer
<br />
<br />On that disk you should find Setup.exe, Start.exe or Install.exe
<br />
<br />Right click that file and choose to run it in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode
<br />
<br />Once that installs, on your Desktop should be a shortcut for that game, wight click that short cut and choose Properties
<br />
<br />Then on the Compatibility Tab, set that game to run in Windows 7 compatibility mode - that only needs to be set once . . .       
        </p>

            Came closer to working than the other method suggested, but sadly still no luck.

<p>Play your game you will. Difficult it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Force ... of a virtual machine. If you are unfamiliar, a virtual machine is a computer created from software. Virtualization is very common and widely used in professional settings. If you're old enough to remember televisions with 'picture in picture,'
 a virtual machine is a computer within a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How it works: First you install the virtual machine software (more on that below) which creates another computer that runs inside your existing computer. Next, you install Windows XP or Vista or 7 into that new computer. Finally, you install Star Wars on
 the copy of Windows running in the virtual machine, and before you know it you're in a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The virtual computer doesn't have its own hardware, obviously; it uses your computer's hardware. The VM software uses that hardware to create a new computer that runs inside a window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The virtual machine software is free. Two of the most popular VM applications are VirtualBox (from Oracle) and VMWare Workstation Player (from VMWare.) There are plenty of instructions and illustrated tutorials on the internet that show you how to set them
 up and install an operating system. It's really not hard once you get the hang of it. Microsoft's own Hyper-V is virtual machine software that's included in Windows 10, but it's not as user-friendly as the other two. (Hyper-V makes you deal with obscure technical
 details like virtual switches.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a virtual machine you can run any software, no matter how old, in its native operating system. I actually have an MS-DOS VM for when I want to hone my skills at Gorillas, which runs in QBasic!</p>
