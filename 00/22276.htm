<h2>            MSflexgrid help</h2>
                    I am using visual basic editor to do a lab project for my class. Is there a way I can add the MSflexgrid control to my toolbar? Thank you for your help.

    <title>Need to add hours to time in a subform - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinrxz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to add hours to time in a subform</h2>
                    I have a db that is a time card/sheet.<br />
<br />
There is a form for entering ' timecarddate ', timein ', ' timeout ' and ' lunchtime '&nbsp;into a table as one record.<br />
<br />
There is a query that rounds timein up (&nbsp;'&nbsp;TimeInRoundUp '&nbsp;) and timeout down (&nbsp;'&nbsp;TimeOutRoundDown '&nbsp;) to the nearest six minute increment, gives me ' elapsedtime ' ( datediff timein, timeout&nbsp;) and ' adjustedtime ' (elapsedtime - lunchtime).<br />
<br />
There is a subform that displays all the records for a week based on timecarddate in the main form.<br />
In the footer of the subform I have control that sums adjustedtime for the week, a control that sums adjustedtime up to and including Thursday (&nbsp;'&nbsp;HoursThroughThursday '&nbsp;) and a control (&nbsp;'&nbsp;HoursShortof40 '&nbsp;) that give hours less than 40 as of Thursday (40
 - HoursThroughThursday).<br />
<br />
What&nbsp;I am trying to do is have a control that will give me what time is needed to timeout based on timein on Friday? ( TimeInRoundUp + HoursShortof40 + lunchtime )<br />
<br />
Sounds simple enough, at least it was in Excel?<br />
But from googling around it seems that is a very complex thing to do, at least to someone that is not versed in VBA.<br />
Looking for a way to do this within Access, without VBA if that is possible, and not masochistic!

            You'll find an example of a simple timesheet database as TimeSheet.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes a number of functions for doing date/time arithmetic, in particular the TimeElapsed function which returns the result of a simple time arithmetic expression in time format.&nbsp; It also includes a WeekStart function which returns
 the week-starting date for any date.&nbsp; By calling these in the following query in my demo the total hours worked per employee up to and including Thursday of each week would be returned, along with the hours short of 40 for the week, and the target finishing
 time on Friday based on the start time entered for Friday, defaulting to #08:00# if no start time has yet been entered for Friday:<br />
<br />
SELECT EmployeeID, WeekStart(1,WorkDate) AS WeekStarting, <br />
TimeElapsed(SUM((TimeEnd-TimeStart)*IIf(Weekday(WorkDate,1)&lt;6,1,0)),"nn") AS TimeWorkedToThursday,<br />
TimeElapsed((40/24) - SUM((TimeEnd-TimeStart)*IIf(Weekday(WorkDate,1)&lt;6,1,0)),"nn") AS HoursShortof40,<br />
TimeElapsed(NZ(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT MIN(TimeStart)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM TimeLog AS TL2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE TL2.EmployeeID = TL1.EmployeeID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND WeekStart(1,TL2.WorkDate) = WeekStart(1,TL2.WorkDate)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND Weekday(TL2.WorkDate) = 6)<br />
,#08:00#) + (40/24) - SUM((TimeEnd-TimeStart)*IIf(Weekday(WorkDate,1)&lt;6,1,0)),"nn") AS TargetFridayEndTime<br />
FROM TimeLog AS TL1<br />
GROUP BY EmployeeID, WeekStart(1,WorkDate);<br />

            Hello Ken, I had actually already downloaded your timesheet db!<br />
I found it after googling about something else I was having a problem with; I had contemplated just using yours, but there were some specific things I wanted, and I am not versed in VBA so changing some of those things frightened me!<br />
<br />
One thing&nbsp;I noticed in your timesheet form was you used a combobox for Start Time and End Time.<br />
I noticed that another person had suggested doing that as well.<br />
What advantages does that give?<br />
The main problem I had was that your Timeslots table was based on 1/4 hour and I needed 1/10 hour (6 minute increments).<br />
I changed yours easy enough, but when&nbsp;I went to pick the times from the combobox I got errors when I picked certain times, and the list had grown substantially.<br />
So I went on with what I had already been working on.<br />
<br />
I am going to look at what you posted here and see if that helps me do what I need to do, thanks again for making your examples available!<br />
<br />
PS; my solution for timein and timeout was in a query, and maybe not very elegant:<br />
<em>SELECT </em><br />
<em>TimeCard.TimeCardDate, </em><br />
<em>WeekdayName((Weekday([TimeCardDate])),False,1) AS DayName, </em><br />
<em>TimeCard.TimeIn, </em><br />
<em>TimeSerial(</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;IIf(</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 55 And 59,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hour([TimeCard]![TimeIn])+1),</em><br />

<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 13 And 18,18,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 19 And 24,24,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 25 And 30,30,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 31 And 36,36,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 37 And 42,42,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 43 And 48,48,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeCard]![TimeIn]) Between 49 And 54,54,0)&nbsp;))))))))),</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;Second([TimeCard]![TimeIn])) AS TimeInRoundUp, </em><br />
<em>TimeCard.TimeOut, </em><br />
<em>TimeSerial(</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;Hour([TimeOut]),</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;IIf(</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minute([TimeOut]) Between 0 And 5,0,(</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 6 And 11,6,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 12 And 17,12,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 18 And 23,18,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 24 And 29,24,</em><br />

<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 42 And 47,42,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 48 And 53,48,</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;IIf(Minute([TimeOut]) Between 54 And 59,54,0))))))))))),</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;Second([TimeOut])) AS TimeOutRoundDown, </em><br />
<em>TimeCard.LunchTime, </em><br />
<em>(DateDiff("n",[TimeInRoundUp],[TimeOutRoundDown]))/60 AS ElapsedTime, </em><br />
<em>[ElapsedTime]-[LunchTime] AS AdjustedTime</em><br />
<em>FROM TimeCard</em><br />
<em>WHERE (((DatePart("ww",[TimeCardDate]))=DatePart("ww",[Forms]![TimeCard]![TimeCardDate])))</em><br />

            Most timesheet systems have a particular <em>'granularity'</em>.&nbsp; In my organisation it was 5 minutes, yours is 6.&nbsp; In the demo I used 15 minute slots for simplicity, so as to keep the list relatively short.&nbsp; Creating a TimeSlots table as the basis for
 a combo box means you don't then have to do any rounding.<br />
<br />
An easy way to fill a TimeSlots table with times at 6 minute intervals would be to serially fill down a column in Excel and import it into an Access table.&nbsp; Or you could execute a little VBA procedure like this:<br />
<br />
Public Sub FillTimeSlots()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dtmTime As Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For dtmTime = #12:00:00 AM# To #11:54:00 PM# Step #12:06:00 AM#<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO TimeSlots(TimeSlot) " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES(#" &amp; Format(dtmTime, "hh:nn") &amp; "#)"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next dtmTime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Don't worry about the rather strange Step value; it's just how Access automatically formats the value #00:06# (6 minutes) in the VBA window.<br />
<br />
If you copied my TimeSlots table you might have fallen foul of a ValidationRule on the TimeSlot column in the table design, which limits the times to 15 minute intervals.&nbsp; You'd need to delete or amend this rule first, or just create a new table to replace
 mine.<br />
<br />
Note that because my demo does not include durations for lunch breaks, but has morning and afternoon start and end times entered separately as two ranges, the query I posted would need amending so that the simple expressions which subtract the start from the
 end time, would in your case also need to subtract the duration of the lunch break.

            <p>I will get back on this tomorrow, but I re-downloaded your Timesheet db.<br />
</p>
<p>I entered data for myself in there; name and a weeks worth of data for time in and time out.</p>
<p>I created a query using the SQL you gave previously and it seems to work.<br />
Using my data, the query shows 38:00 hours "TimeWorkedToThursday", 02:00 hours "HoursShortof40"and 11:00 for "TargetFridayEndTime" with a Friday start time of 09:00.<br />
<br />
The question(s) I have are this.<br />
In your db "TimeElapsed" is fine; when I try to use that in my db I get "undefined function "TimeElapsed" in expression".<br />
Is TimeElapsed a variable in your db, or is it built-in function in Access?</p>
<p>In your SQL you have this:</p>
<p>"<em>TimeElapsed((40/24) -...</em>"<br />
What is the purpose of the "40/24", it seems that it would&nbsp;theoretically be subtracting&nbsp;(1.66666?) from the SUM, which would be ~32 hours?<br />
<br />

            1.&nbsp; The TimeElapsed function is in the basTimeSheet module.&nbsp; Have you copied the module into your database?<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The date/time data type in Access is implemented as a 64 bit floating point number in which the integer part represents a day and the fractional part a time of day.&nbsp; Zero represents 30 December 1899 00:00:00.&nbsp; So to convert 40 hours to a value of date/time
<br />
You can see it for yourself in the debug window:<br />
<br />
? Format(40/24,"dd mmmm yyyy hh:nn:ss")<br />
31 December 1899 16:00:00<br />
<br />
The above returns the result of the expression formatted as date/time 40 hours after 30 December 1899 00:00:00.&nbsp; If we pass it into my TimeElapsed function it returns it formatted as hh:nn:ss:<br />
<br />
? TimeElapsed(40/24,"nn:ss")<br />
40:00:00<br />

            <p>All right, I was spending too much time on this and decided to live with what I had.<br />
But it is now starting to annoy me!<br />
<br />
I created a second subform on my first subform&nbsp;(subsubform?) , '&nbsp;<em>FridayTimeOutSubForm
</em>'.<br />
On this second subform I have fields bound to a query of my main query; the subquery has criteria ( ' 6 ' ) that only returns values for Friday.<br />
The fields give me day (<em>sfrmDayName</em>), date (<em>sfrmTimeCardDate</em>), rounded-up punch-in time (<em>sfrmTimeInRoundUp</em>), and time for lunch (<em>sfrmLunchTime</em>).<br />
All these fields are for Friday of the week based on the current week of the current record.<br />
So for this week, I have:</p>
<p><em>Friday - 1/6/2017 - 9:00:00 AM - 0.5</em>.<br />
<br />
I have added another field to this subform that&nbsp;I want to give me a time to punch out, based on how many hours worked up to and including Thursday, which is&nbsp;a calculated field on my first subform, plus lunch time on Friday.<br />
In the expression builder I have this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>=DateAdd("h",([Forms]![TimeCardWeekSubForm]![HoursShortof40]+[sfrmLunchTime]),[sfrmTimeInRoundUp])</em></p>
<p>But when I open my main form I get this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>#Name?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't it be this simple???</p>

            A subform is not a member of the Forms collection, which only includes open parent forms.&nbsp; It has to be referenced via the Form property of the subform control in its parent form:<br />
<br />
Forms.NameOfParentForm.NameOfSubformControl.Form.NameOfControl<br />
<br />
The subform control is the control in the parent form which houses the subform.<br />
<br />
Consequently, to reference a control in a subform which is itself a subform of a parent form, the first subform has to be referenced in the above way, and the second subform by way of
<em>its </em>Form property:<br />
<br />
Forms.NameOfParentForm.NameOfSubformControl.Form.NameOfSubformControl.Form.NameOfControl<br />
<br />
While this can be done in a single long expression, I'd be inclined to break it down in a little function in which a series of object variables progressively return a reference to each object in turn, with the return value of the function being the value of
 the final control.&nbsp; The following is an example using objects in the nested subforms option in my CorrelatedSubs demo:<br />
<br />
Public Function GetProduct() As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim frm1 As Form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim frm2 As Form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set frm1 = Forms.frmCompanies_2.frmsubOrders_2.Form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set frm2 = frm1.frmsubOrderDetails_2.Form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = frm2.ProductID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetProduct = ctrl.Column(2)<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Called in the debug window it returns a value as follows when the form is open at its first record:<br />
<br />
? GetProduct()<br />
Northwind Traders Chai<br />
<br />
The demo uses Northwind data, and the value is in the third column of the ProductID combo box, referenced as Column(2) because the Column property is zero-based.<br />
<br />
If you want to try it you can paste the above function into the file, which you'll find as CorrelatedSubs.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />

<h2>            Archiving emails - some aren&#39;t getting archived&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am selecting my mailbox in Outlook, then going to File --&gt; Archive and selecting a date... why does Outlook choose to ignore some email prior to this date? For example, I've selected the date of June 1, 2011, and yet I'm finding older emails still in my
 inbox from May 5, 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I&nbsp;(i) force items to archive, or (ii) fix some issue/option associated with an email that may prevent it from being archived?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If you then&nbsp;two days later move the email to a different folder, the created date stays the same but the modified date changes to the date of moving.</p>

 files are from 2007 (.xls) but we didn't have this problem with the 32bit system.&nbsp; Some of the files have&nbsp;links which will not run if opened in a browser, plus individuals are unable to save any changes back if opened in a browser.</p>

            As a suggestion, stay in the Resource Usage view, and split your screen to show the Gantt Chart view in the lower pane.<br />
<br />
You won't see the full Gantt chart - only the Gantt bars for the resource you have selected in the top part of the view - but this should allow you to easily see the effect on the task of editing the information.<br />
<br />
You can split your screen through View ribbon, Details.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

            Maria,
<div>The most "efficient" way to deal with resource overallocation is to use Project's resource leveling feature. Personally I like the manual approach you are currently using because it give more control, but it can be slow and tedious.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Resource leveling is based on the Priority field. The default priority is 500. Lower priority tells the leveling algorithm that the task can be moved to avoid the overallocation and higher priority tells the algorithm to either not move the task at all
 (priority 1000) or only move it after the lower priority tasks have been move and overallocation still exists. Leveling can be applied to a select resources or all resources and can be applied to the whole project or limited to a time period. Also be sure
 to check out the leveling options found under Resource/Level group/Leveling options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />
<div>John</div>

    <title>Nokia Lumia fake pin code screen after unlocking the real pin code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia fake pin code screen after unlocking the real pin code screen, 0-day exploit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this was a 0day exploit, however after unlocking my phone this morning, a very convincing pin code unlock screen appeared. It had a different theme colour to my phone's settings. I think the default colour was blue when I first got the phone,
 and that was the colour of the fake PIN code screen title. I hit the back arrow button on the bottom of the screen and didn't see it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's important to note that I registered a domain yesterday and usually I would have domain privacy enabled, however after not receiving an ICANN verification email, the tech support guy at my ISP accidentally disabled domain privacy and I started getting
 spam related to my newly registered domain at my registered email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone number was also published on the WHOIS record, and this would be how the attacker infected my phone. Data and wifi were disabled on the phone. I called my phone company and they told me to call a Microsoft number of which directed me here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make sure my phone isn't still infected? Is there any way to protect my phone in future?</p>

            <p>I know the stigma associated with Microsoft phones not being infected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery was full when I went to sleep last night (14 hours ago) and was half empty (or half full depending on your optimism) this morning and it's usually about 95-98% the following morning when I repeat this process (of which I've done many times) except
 when I've left the data connection on or wifi on (of which were both off) when the battery will be 90-95%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either the phone is not infected anymore or it's still infected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a school account but have never done anything related to my Microsoft student account on my phone, and it's not networked to any business domain nor has it ever been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging by how fast it charged this morning, it's (magically?) not infected anymore and has even cleaned up some background processes. Either that, or it's been replaced with a (much) more efficient piece of ... should I call it 'malware' if it's 'friendly'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should just assume it's all smoke and mirrors.</p>

            <p>I've called my phone company and disabled some (but not all) international settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The malware may have been using international sms to communicate, but likely uses the internet as backup. It would have been an sms that was used to run the exploit in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have to hit "Try again" several times after sending an sms even though I have good reception. This doesn't usually happen. Also, I was told I was sent an sms this morning by phone call and I didn't receive it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The malware is still there.</p>

            Possibly a defective SIM card, or a SIM tray defect in the phone.<br />
I suggest request a replacement SIM from your mobile operator as a first troubleshooting step. They should provide a replacement SIM free of charge when the connectivity issues and the weird behaviour is explained.

    <title>Office 365 OneDrive shared link UI is broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teranceo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 OneDrive shared link UI is broken</h2>
                    <p>All of the links that I have shared with customers now have a broken UI. The links shared externally and only contain photos with no other type of file. When you click on a shared link the page seems to be loading fine except that it has three rows of the
 loading dots going across the screen above the list of files and below the company name which never go away. When you click on a photo, it appears that it freezes the web page and you can't click on anything else. I found that if I hit f5 to refresh the page
 it loads a large version of the photo. I can then close out of the large version of the photo and the UI returns to a normal working state. The loading dots are now gone and I can click on other photos and they load the larger version as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this issue or have a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>FAQ&#58; Microsoft Mathematics Add-in for Word and OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich porter - microsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            FAQ&#58; Microsoft Mathematics Add-in for Word and OneNote</h2>
                    
<p><span>The &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=ca620c50-1a56-49d2-90bd-b2e505b3bf09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Mathematics
 Add-in</a> for Word and OneNote makes it easy to create graphs in 2D and 3D, calculate numerical results, solve equations or inequalities, and simplify algebraic expressions in your Word documents and OneNote notebooks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: How much does it cost?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Mathematics Add-in for Word and OneNote
 is available as a free download, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=ca620c50-1a56-49d2-90bd-b2e505b3bf09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
found <span>here</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: How can I get support for the Mathematics Add-in?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span>Questions about using the Mathematics
 Add-in in Word should be asked in the “<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wordgraphic/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Working with Graphics and Inserts</a></span></em>” forum on Answers. Questions about using the
 Mathematics Add-in in OneNote should be asked in the<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">“<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addonenote/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote: Sharing, Creating and Managing Notebooks</a>”</span></em>forum.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: Which versions of Word or OneNote work with the Microsoft Mathematics Add-in?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Mathematics Add-in is compatible
 with Microsoft Office Word 2007, Word 2010, and OneNote 2010. A full list of requirements is available on the download page.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: Can I install the Microsoft Mathematics Add-in if I have a previous version of the Math add-in already installed?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span>Yes.</span><span>If
 you install the Microsoft Mathematics Add-in on a computer that also has Microsoft Math Add-in for Microsoft Office Word 2007 installed, Microsoft Mathematics Add-in treats the installation as an upgrade and replaces the older version of the add-in.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: Where do I find the add-in after I install it?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> The add-in appears as the Mathematics
 tab in Word and OneNote.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: Why aren’t all the Compute and Graph actions available?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Your cursor must be in an equation
 or mathematical expression for the actions to be available. Also, Compute and Graph actions are available only when they can be applied to the selected expression.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: Can I edit a graph after I insert the picture in my document?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> After inserting a graph, you
 can change it at any time. To edit the graph, double-click the graph and adjust the settings in the Graph dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: Can I use the Microsoft Mathematics Add-in with notebooks that are in the OneNote 2007 file format?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span>No. When you upgrade from OneNote 2007
 to OneNote 2010, notebooks aren’t automatically updated to the new OneNote 2010 file format. The feature to insert math equations is available only in OneNote 2010 format notebooks. If you can’t insert equations, you may need to convert your notebook to OneNote
 2010 format. For information about how to do this, see OneNote Help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q: How do I use the Mathematics Add-in?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: Clicking Help on the Mathematics menu
 launches the Microsoft Mathematics Add-in Help file which contains detailed explanations of each feature and function in the add-in.</span></p>

<p>
It would be a lot more helpful to simply add "Past Year" to the drop-down on the search menu. &nbsp;It would also be nice to add a "Custom Range" where you can specify the time period you'd like to search for. &nbsp;I often have to use google just so I can use this feature
 quickly and easily. I'd prefer to use Bing, but if you won't allow us to search for more relevant information it is extremely limiting. &nbsp;ADD THIS FEATURE!&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00da874e-6fa4-408a-a799-1e217839fbc9" /></p>

<h2>            Journal Entries Disappeared After &#34;Reconnecting&#34; to Outlook 2016 - Thread moved to a more appropriate forum category.</h2>
                    <p>I received an email telling me I needed to "reconnect" to Outlook 2016, and giving me a link to step-by-step directions.&nbsp; I followed the directions precisely.&nbsp; I did not delete my old account, but instead created a new one.&nbsp; Outlook works just fine, but
 every single one of my journal entries has disappeared entirely.&nbsp; Outlook lists three accounts on the My Journal panel, listing my newly-created account, as well as&nbsp;"Journal (this computer only)," and a "Journal -- My Computer" folders.&nbsp;
<em>All </em>of them are empty.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know where my hundreds of prior journal entries went, and I really need to get them back.</p>
<p>

            <p>Desiree:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your message.&nbsp; I signed out from the Outlook program on my computer.&nbsp; Using Micorosft Edge, I then signed in to Outlook.com on the web.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not see anything suggesting that I needed to update Outlook.&nbsp; In particular the "Notifications" window
 was empty.&nbsp; The "Settings" window contained a number of links ("Refresh," "Automatic Replies," "Display Settings" and the like) but didn't say anything close to "update."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed Outlook.com and then restarted my computer.&nbsp; I then opened Outlook 2013 on my computer.&nbsp; The journal entries do not appear in any of the folders listed in Outlook (my reconnected email account; "Journal (this computer only)," and&nbsp;"Journal -- My
 Computer").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line:&nbsp; I don't see anything asking me to update; my Journal entries are still missing in action.</p>

<p>Outlook.com emails (all emails and folders except for Drafts and Outbox folders), calendar, contacts, and tasks items accessible on the web won’t be affected by reconnecting. Once you reconnect, your Outlook.com emails, calendar, contacts, and tasks will
 resume syncing to your desktop version of Outlook.</p>
<p>However, if you have emails in your Drafts or Outbox folders or items in Journal or Notes, these may get deleted or remain unsent as these items are stored locally in your computer. You will need to back them up or remove them from another folder before
 reconnecting. See this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/article-on-how-to-back-up-your-email-e5845b0b-1aeb-424f-924c-aa1c33b18833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>What SHOULD happen is that the hyperlink will send the URL to the system's default browser and open there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asking the browser to send the document back to Word to be opened is a bridge too far. &nbsp;Word is not a web browser and it's Hyperlink abilities are intentionally very restricted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is functionality that exists by default in an XML application such as Word, but for security reasons Microsoft turned it off.</p>

<br />
Is this a link that ends with a forward slash, i.e. no "file name" or extension, like this one?</p>

<p><br />
If so, </p>
<p>&nbsp;a. do you find that the link works as expected the very first time you click on it in Word (e.g., save and close the document with the link, close Word, and preferably any other Mac Office applications, then restart Word, re-open and try to follow the link
 again? If it opens, close the browser window and try to follow the link again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. do you see the same behaviour in Excel/PowerPoint?</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At the moment all my documents are just in one big pile...</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The classic SharePoint way with metadata columns is not it anymore, I can see, so what do I do then?
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I know that I could revert to classic view, but since Microsoft calls it classic, it will soon go away I imagine :-)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I uploaded around 50 documents and I find it very difficult to find the documents I want - or check what documents I have on a specific topic.
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The search function doesn't really do what I want, since I only get 6 documents suggested at first. Then I have to search everything and then filter by me as an author then I get
 more or less what I am looking for...... </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>But is there another way? I would love something like the "grouped by" view option in SharePoint views.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For sorting documents on the new experience of OneDrive for Business library, we can click on the
<strong>Sort</strong> option or directly click the column name to sort by columns which we want.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca940b22-1f40-4be4-acfd-3c906a7ad450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca940b22-1f40-4be4-acfd-3c906a7ad450" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, there is not any information about that the classic view will be moved soon. So, you can still turn to the classic view to create a new view which you can use the group by function.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            Complete removal of the Yandex virus</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge as my browser. Somehow my I picked up a variation of the Yandex virus, an adware virus. I followed the removal suggestions that I found on on a Malware site that included ADW Cleaner, Malwarebytes, Hitman, and Zemana cleaners.
 They seemed to work in that they stopped the incessant ads. However, I still don't have access to Microsoft Edge and am also denied access to other items. &nbsp;It only allows me to use Google Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try and go to Settings to change my default browser, I get a box that says "This app can't open. Contact your administrator..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I cannot use Start and I no longer have any sound at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to my next step?</p>

            The problem with page breaks is this - I was using an old sheet and updating it as needed. The many software updates created some glitches in the formatting. I had to delete all formatting, reformat everything, and now it works fine.

            Dear Steve,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You posted your question in Outlook.com forum, so I assume you have problems with sending emails from your Microsoft Account and accordingly to your verbatim you created this account recently. If yes, then there are some limitations for newly created accounts <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sending-limits-in-outlook-com-279ee200-594c-40f0-9ec8-bb6af7735c2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sendin...</a> I advise you to start with reputation check as verification can take a while. Of course please follow other suggestions.
<br />
<br />Please share the results.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to make a line using tabs after "firm/farm" that extends nearly to the end of the page and is formatted like the first photo, but if I pull my tab any further than the line above it, it messes up the tabs and changes my formatting. I've used
 tabs a lot, and this is the first time I think that I've had this issue. I appreciate your input!</p>

            Tab settings are a paragraph property. You can't have different tab stops on different lines in the same paragraph. You will have to set all the tab stops you need for a given paragraph and use them as required. Alternatively, for the type of copy you
 show, you could just create lines using underscore characters.

            You can set grammar check to check for two spaces between sentences. You can't get two spaces automatically, if that's what you're asking.

    <title>Outlook archive password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dianebechtler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook archive password</h2>
                    Outlook will not work unless it has a password for Outlook archive 1. I have no idea what it's even talking about. I have some Outlook archives, but I don't know about any passwords. Can anybody help me here. I am stuck. I cannot even pick up my email.
 Thank you very much

            <p>If you are referring to your previous post, and the answer given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming you removed the archive via the mail applet, starting outlook it would not ask for a password for an archive that was disconnected via the mail applet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of password</p>
<p>1) The password provided by your ISP (Mail provider), in which case it would be shown in the msg box that this was the password required.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2) A password the user set for a Personal Folder set (Be it an Archive, or any data file)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Mail Applet, the data Files Btn, what is shown under both name &amp; Location?</p>

            <p>Control Panel&gt;Mail Applet&gt;Data Files........remove the offending Archive.pst</p>
<p>This doesn't delete the underlying file it just removes it from Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can password protect any outlook data file. MS provides no means of removing/cracking a lost&nbsp;password, there are third party tools available via a Google/Bing search&nbsp;</p>
