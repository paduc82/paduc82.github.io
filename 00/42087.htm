    <title>Brightness on 2017 Microsoft Surface Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> modona  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brightness on 2017 Microsoft Surface Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface Laptop (The recently released. Intel Core i5, 4GB RAM 128GB SSD). The first two days I had it, the brightness worked fine. &nbsp;The adjustment buttons on the keyboard would trigger the brightness slider and the screen would adjust accordingly.
 After those two days, though, it went left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do manually, the brightness won't change. I have my display settings so that the brightness will change automatically according to the lighting in my surroundings. This particular feature works but is quite sloppy and when the screen is
 adjusting it's brightness, it does it in a way that I can only describe as choppy. It's like I'm watching my screen go through a presentation of my computer with the slides set on different levels of brightness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this is the only time my brightness changes. No matter what I do to alter my settings. When I'm outside on a sunny day though, the brightness won't adjust in the slightest. The screen is nearly pitch black, and nothing I do changes the brightness
 (even with my settings on auto-brightness).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What in the world is going on?</p>
<p>When I got the laptop, of course, it came set to work in Windows10S but I made the switch back to 10 because that's what I'm more comfortable with.</p>

<p>Hello Modona,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do definitely understand the situation at hand and we have a few clarifications to make in regards to the settings that have been placed on your Surface Laptop.</p>
<p>With auto-screen brightness enabled, when there is more light recognized by the Surface Laptop the screen will go darker, and when there is less light the screen will become brighter. If you are wanting to manually control what level the brightness is at,
 we recommend disabling auto-brightness and restarting the device, then attempt to adjust the screen brightness while outside in the sun.<br />
<br />
As far as the auto-brightness setting being choppy we would want to ensure that there are no driver or system file related issues. At a point in time when you have a steady internet connection, please follow
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> and&nbsp;run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. This will run through a few tests and scans&nbsp;to ensure your device and software are functioning properly.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this toolkit helps your situation or if the issue persists with the choppy auto-brightness adjustments. We look forward to receiving a response from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely~</p>

            Hi Kapuso.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How did you lose your Administrator account, do you know?  If you install Windows or set it up on any PC it always sets up an Admin Account.  Is it on a separate Sign In so you can sign in with it now and move into that account?  
<br />
<br />See here how to change to Admin Account:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that won't work Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> 
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC to access the Command Prompt without needing a password:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this.  If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account.  If not try another of these methods: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            This looks like a very old version of Windows 10 if you don't even have Family &amp; Other Users on the Account Settings tabs.  Perhaps updating to the latest version will fix the loss of Administrator.  Try install the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />There is also a choice for Administrator showing to choose in your second screenshot, apparently to access the Command Prompt.  What happens if you choose it?  
<br />
<br />If you cannot access the Admin Command Prompt this way, what happens if you type CMD in Start Search, right click the result to Run as Admin?  
<br />
<br />If you cannot access the Command Prompt in Windows then try all methods here to access it:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />But as I wrote above it may be necessary to create bootable media to boot into the Command Prompt at boot to run the command to enable Built-in Administrator:  net user administrator /active:yes.  So please don't just quit halfway through but continue with all steps to repair Windows that I give.  I will be here to help as needed.

<h2>            Minecraft 360 Worth it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I have Minecraft for the Mac, but honestly I kind of play it from a laptop with a small screen and I tried out the demo for the XBOX 360 and I love that crafting is so much easier. The only problem I personally have is not knowing if I will ever be able
 to multiplayer with other people because I hear that you need to actually play with friends? On the Mac, I'm about to put in a IP address and join different servers and play CTF with other people. I guess I want to buy Minecraft 360 but really would love the
 same multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Yes is true is more easy, less updated that the minecraft of the laptop or mac &nbsp; &nbsp;but the multiplayer limit a little bit the number of players (16 max) but also you not need sign on the offisial minecraft page, you can not put commands how the laptop or
 Mac &nbsp; &nbsp;and cannot instal mods. &nbsp; &nbsp; other detail, yes, if you want to join whit someone &nbsp;you most have at less 1 friend playing in that map (if the host dosen`t put the option of not admit friends of friends) or can &nbsp;you are invited to play by a menssage you
 enter to the world directly if there even if nobody are you friend, or, you can be the host.</p>
<p>In a simplify for:</p>
<p>*not so hard to made your own server</p>
<p>*control &nbsp;the grifers</p>
<p>*can also be in creative</p>
<p>*is easy to join</p>
<p>-can not upload other maps</p>
<p>-the host need to be avalible (if he disconect &nbsp;every one out automatic)</p>
<p>- a 16 player max</p>
<p>anyway I recommend this game even if you not on multiplayer server &nbsp;you can do "anything" to the world in a single player</p>
<p>or local if you have the HD mode</p>
<p>&nbsp; I hope this help you</p>

<p>It's definetly worth it! The amount of microsoft points it cost me was equivalent to about NZ$26. Minecraft has gone viral:) Over 4 million purchased on xbox 360. The Minecraft Forums on xbox.com is choco-block full of posts. 2/3'rds of my friends have the
 game. </p>
<p>With multiplayer, you can play with only 8 players at a time in multiplayer (just like you can only have up to 8 pp in an xbox live party). But it's not open server. You can only play with your friends or pp who are friends with one of your friends. If you
 try to play with anyone else, an Xbox Dashboard message appears saying you cannot join cause your not friends with this person, or something.
</p>
<p>There are pp who will greif your world and steal and pvp. But you can control these in Host Privelages. You can kick someone if your host, make a friend you really trust a moderator, play on survival or creative mode and switch between the two at whim. Note
 if you switch any world to Creative Mode, achievements for whatever map you do this to will be permanently disabled (Microsoft doesn't allow cheating in gamer score achievements).
</p>
<p>It's cool how many Xbox Dashboard Messages/Notifications menus this game brings up. Like this game doesn't have it's own menu system!? Not complaining but it's kind of cool. Want to write something on a game sign. The Xbox Dashboard keyboard menu pops up.
 When Your about to kick someone out or loading a world on Creative Mode, and Xbox Dashboard message pops up. This goes to show that the game your playing is legit on your Xbox 360 console. It's also a chance to express your imagination or do whatever you want.
 You can control what goes on in your world and decide weather to give certain, any, or all permissions for anyone playing in YOUR created map/world or not.</p>
<p>The game is really popular on Xbox 360 without a doubt. Even pp old enough to be you're parents play this game:) &nbsp;PS3 doesn't even have Minecraft LOL:) Which makes Xbox Live even more cooler. Plus the achievements at the start of this game are fast and easy
 to get! </p>
<p>Just get it and try it for yourself. Request you want Minecraft friends on this forum. It's not a game where you pay $50 or $100 for it. When converting Microsoft points, the game is like less than $30 in NZ/Australia/UK/US. &nbsp;It's a fun game one worth playing
 and trying xx.</p>

<p>I just got it and yeah I love it. Even just single player. Basically because I was trying it out again on my Mac and I know that the game is bigger and with mods and all that but the truth is whenever I go to a server for PvP or something I get kicked out
 as soon as I die and I find that kind of frustrating. So I went ahead and bought it.</p>
<p>Please feel free to friend request me everyone so I can play with you and your friends because none of my friends are playing this.

<h2>            Preparing windows</h2>
                    So i am now starting my pc backup after a while and had to redownload windows 10. Everything is fine up until the log in screen. I type in my password and i hit enter and it tells me preparing windows for about 15 minutes then a blue box pops up and tells
 me "there was a problem resetting your PC.&nbsp; No changes were made." Is there a way to completely reset my pc or a way around this?

            I don't have a restore point and it tells me there's something wrong and cannot restart computer. Is there a way to force restart it?

    <title>Can&#39;t boot into WinPE or Win Install DVD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gsw_champs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t boot into WinPE or Win Install DVD</h2>
                    <p>My Dell Inspiron 5558 came with Win 8.1. I upgraded it to Win 10 a few months back. Last week, it was downloading Update 1 (I think) and I shut it down because I had to leave. Then it wouldn't boot up after that. It just keeps spinning at the Dell logo.
 I couldn't get into Safe Mode or Repair mode. I've powered it off many times since it just spins and it still wouldn't get into Repair mode. I have tried booting into WinPE 3 and WinPE 4 on usb but it just spins. I have tried booting from Win 7 and Win 10
 Home DVD but I just get "Starting Windows" under Win 7 DVD and spinning circle under Win 10 DVD. I tried UEFI Secure Boot enabled and disabled and also Legacy BIOS and still nothing would boot. My WinPE and Win DVDs all work on my Dell Latitude.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Dell diagnostics thorough mode and all components passed. Funny thing is if I boot the Inspiron from Ubuntu 12 DVD in BIOS mode, it detects the drive and installs Ubuntu fine so all my previous partitions are gone. I don't have any data so it's okay.
 &nbsp;After reboot, I can login and use Ubuntu. I stick in Win 7 or Win 10 DVD and try to get to Windows Setup to repartition drive and I can't even get to Windows Setup. I just get Starting Windows or spinning circle again depending on which Win DVD I use. AFAIK,
 Dell Inspiron don't have TPM. Any idea why Ubuntu would install but none of the Microsoft tools would boot (WinPE 3 and 4, Win 7 and 10 DVD)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another test I've done is attach a used 160GB HD to my Dell Latitude. Boot to WinPE 4, did a:</p>
<p>1. clean</p>
<p>2. convert MBR</p>
<p>3. turn off laptop</p>
<p>4. put 160GB HD into Inspiron</p>
<p>5. set Inspiron to BIOS mode</p>
<p>6. press F12 and boot to Win 10 DVD</p>
<p>7. it just spins at Windows logo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since hardware diags passed, what can it be? Can the Dell firmware be corrupted? Any insights appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply but my Windows 10 DVD is fine. If I put the Win 10 DVD into my Dell Latitude, the Latitude boots into Windows Setup. My usb keys (WinPE 3 and WinPE 4) and install DVDs (Windows 7 and Windows 10) all boot fine on my Dell Latitude. The
 problem is none of them will boot on my Dell Inspiron, no matter if I set it to BIOS or UEFI (Secure Boot disabled or enabled). However, Ubuntu 12 DVD boots and installs fine on the same Dell Inspiron with the same hard drive. Have you heard of this before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>I probably had a different situation than others getting stuck at 55%.</p>
<p>My issue is that I have a SSD which has limited space.&nbsp; I had mounted a partition on a separate drive to c:/users/Youzer (my working username).&nbsp; Although I don't think it matters, I have another partition mounted as c:/users/Youzer/Documents.&nbsp; In order to
 complete installation, I had to log out, log into my 'Maint'enance user, remove c:/users/Youzer path from the mounted drive, and then do the update.&nbsp; Everything finished just fine then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To illustrate/resummarize...</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:/&nbsp; -the partition on my SSD. (512G; okay it's not as tiny as other systems I've had)</p>
<p>c:/User/Youzer - a partition an a HDD (1TB)</p>
<p>c:/user/Youzer/Documents - another partition on a HDD (1TB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since windows/applications like to store thiings in c:/users/&lt;user&gt;/appdata I wanted to make sure that I never ran out of space on my SSD just because some game likes to keep 200GB save files; that and many applications (visual studio, unreal, unity) default
 their projects into Documents/... I wanted to give them an entirely separate space to work from.</p>

<h2>            Yellow dots and lines across screen</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is displaying coloured dots across my screen that vary depending on the background colour, and are mostly yellow. There are also lines running&nbsp;across&nbsp;the screen that disrupt the display. The problem isn't with the monitor, and I don't think it's
 hardware either. I've had this problem before, which then developed into my computer crashing during start up every time, and someone managed to fix it for me when he&nbsp;reinstalled&nbsp;windows. It had been running fine, but the other day I started up a demo in Steam
 and the display messed up as soon as it loaded. I tried reinstalling windows to see if that would work, but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system is running an intel E6750, a Radeon HD 2900 XT 4GB of RAM and Windows Vista 64 bit</p>

<h2>            Skype shortcuts - need to know how to reverse this short cut</h2>
                    <p>When I'm using Skype for Business, I found this shortcut to hide the pictures of all of the people on the screen, who are in the Skype conference call.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Ctrl+Shift+K</p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Switch to content-only view.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, I can't find out how to add the pictures of all the people back to the screen once I hide them. Sometimes I want to get rid of, or hide, the images of the other callers because it blocks content on the "stage" in Skype for Business. But then I sometimes
 want to see those images of all and add them back to the stage. But I can't find the shortcut to add them back on once they are gone. Does anyone know how to add them back? Is there a better way to see the whole screen being displayed and minimize the images
 of people on the screen stage?<br />

            Hi Sheltieowner,<br />
<br />
When you say “sometimes want to see those images of all and add them back to the stage”, do you mean that you want to switch to the gallery view? If so, you can use Keyboard shortcut "<strong>Ctrl+Shift+l</strong>".<br />
<br />
If you want to view the Conversation window in full screen mode press<strong> F5</strong>.<br />
<br />
For details conversation or meeting stage Keyboard shortcuts, please refer to the link:

If this is not your requirement, please provide us with detailed information about the requirement with an example screenshot so that we can further assist you.<br />

            You have to buy a license for each computer. If they already have a qualified Windows system installed you can buy the upgrade for a cheaper price. If you want to buy the full version of Ultimate then yes, it would be around $1,000 for all three computers.

<h2>            Disable PIN Sign-In Option - Lock Screen</h2>
                    <p>When creating a fingerprint sign-in option, you are required to create a PIN. The problem is that PIN codes are not as secure as a password and can possible be hacked. Luckily PINs are not restricted to a character limit. I still feel insecure about having
 the PIN be an option </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a finger print scanner and I felt like it was time to set it up again. What I'm asking for is a way to control what sign-in methods are allowed on my device such as disabling PIN code sign-in option. Removing the PIN entirely disables Windows Hello
 which is what the fingerprint system runs on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I can ether have both a PIN and a fingerprint, or I can have only a password.</p>

            Thanks for responding. It is windows 10. After turning on, there is no HP logo. On the black screen it tells Processor type, speed, cache size, channelA, and channelB. About 30 seconds later the blue screen with error message saying Hard Disk Error.<br />

            Yeah I wasn't sure if you meant what it came with, Windows 8, or had when it crashed. I had upgraded to Windows 10 about 2 weeks before this problem. Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Flash drive file on movie maker</h2>
                    I had previously made a slide show movie now after upgrading to Windows 10 I needed to make a new copy with more pictures. I seem to have the problem zoo it not even appearing as a selectable file on the TV where the previous version of the movie is still
 selectable. To clarify I'm plugging the flash drive directly into the TV. Is it the TV compatibility issue? Check all the properties of the two files and they both appear to be the same. Movie will play off flash drive on computer though.

            <p>The first question is what is on the flash drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just have the project file (.wlmp) that that isn't a movie. What you instead have in the project file is the saved editing state of your project. It is a text file that remembers the names of all the photos, videos, songs, etc. and how you have put
 them together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the project file is only useful within Movie Maker. Movie Maker will read the project file and reload all the pictures and let you continue editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are all done with the editing, you want to create a movie. To do this you choose File &gt; Save movie. The resulting output is a .mp4 file (or a .wmv file in older versions of movie maker).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some SmartTVs are able to play .mp4 files, so you should be able to copy that to a flash drive and play it on the TV. Some SmartTVs will also play .wmv files, but not as many. If you are using an older version of Movie Maker, you should upgrade to Movie
 Maker 2012 so you can create .mp4 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, if you were just trying to "play" the project file (.wlmp) from the flash drive, that will never work. First there is no video/photos/music within a project file, just the *names* of those files to let you edit. Second, that format is only understood
 by Movie Maker and not by any consumer devices like TVs.</p>

            MovieMaker2012 is the current issue I'm using and there is no error message. the problem has seemed to happen after the windows 10 upgrade but I also somewhat remember having a similar problem with the first draft of the movie before the upgrade. both
 movie files are .mp4's and will play off flash drive on computers other then my own. any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm still having trouble understanding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have created some recent slideshows as .mp4 files under Windows 10 (using Movie Maker 2012), correct? Do those files play correctly on your computer right after you've created them as movies? Or did they not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said when you copied them to a flash drive and took them to another PC, they played there as well, right? Is that both the old and the new files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when you plugged them into your TV and tried to play them, they wouldn't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide more details on exactly what steps you are trying on the TV? What is the make/model of TV? Are you able to see the files in the list of available videos on the USB drive? If so, do you see any thumbnail for the video? And if you try to play
 it do you see an error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to track down where exactly you are having the issue because I'm not 100% clear.</p>

            Hi, 
<br /> Digital license is valid only for unchanged hardware and need to be renewed by ordinary activation with product key after motherboard replacement. 
<br /> How did you get Windows 10? 
<br /> If it was preinstalled you have no rights to use it on a new PC  unfortunately and need to buy new license.. 
<br /> If you bought Windows in Microsoft Store or in local retail store, please call Microsoft support during work hours and ask a help from support person.       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            <p>Hello stevekopf,</p>
<p>The chances of recoveing deleted data/files becomes more remote as time goes by.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that after they are deleted the space they still occupy is flagged as available to write files to.</p>
<p>And the odds increase that they will eventually be overwritten by newer Data.</p>
<p>You can try this Program, RECUVA, which is very good at recovering deleted Data, if&nbsp;&nbsp;they still available for recovery:</p>
