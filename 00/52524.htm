<h2>            WD external hard drive</h2>
                    I'm currently running windows 10 and I have a WD MY BOOK 3T EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. My laptop is a DELL LATITUDE E6530. When I plug in the hard drive, neither of the laptop or windows recognizes that its plugged in except for in device manager. and there's
 no opening it. I used it before windows 10 but now it says I can't restore to Windows 7 because I didn't have restore set up. I'm not even sure that's the problem. All I know is that I've accessed it before without any problems but its been quite some time.
 I'm needing suggestions or remote help to tell me what the problem is because I need it to open up space on the laptop

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Outdated USB drivers are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We recommend using the Windows USB Troubleshooter to help resolve USB issues. Click this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17614/automatically-diagnose-and-fix-windows-usb-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>, then click the
<strong>Download </strong>button to perform the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, try uninstalling the USB driver on your laptop and see if it helps. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Double-click <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> to expand.<br />
</li><li>Right-click <strong>USB Root Hub</strong>, then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Go to <strong>Driver </strong>tab.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
</li><li><strong>Restart </strong>your computer.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After restarting your computer, Windows will automatically install a generic USB driver.<br />
<br />
If the issue is still not resolved after performing all the given steps, we recommend contacting
<strong>Western Digital support</strong> to report a possible issue with the external HD.<br />
<br />
If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime.</p>

<h2>            How can I unsynchronize my personal hotmail account from my work windows mail account.</h2>

 and&nbsp;taking my&nbsp;personal email&nbsp;out of there but it keeps&nbsp;saying something to do with POP3?&nbsp;Anyway, my question is,&nbsp;I'd like to know how can I unsynchronize my personal email address/account from my work email/windows mail account. I dont know want to lose any
 emails from either account.&nbsp;Please help!! I need to get some work messages out ASAP and I don't understand how to fix this problem!<br />

            <p>Hi hotmailuser8914,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community Forum. It's my pleasure on helping you to un-sync your personal email account from your work email address in Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In order for us to isolate this issue, we would like to ask did you configure your personal email account in Windows Live Mail or did you setup your personal email account under your work email address? Please provide us the exact
 steps on how did you setup your personal account from your work email so we can further investigate this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Regarding the error 0x800CCC69 in Windows Live Mail, please be informed that this error message usually caused by the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not<br />
2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recommend that you remove and add your account. To do so, please visit this link:

 if I do so Ill lose all the information in it. (Which I can't).</p>
<p>I created my personal email address many years ago on hotmail. I don't know how my account ever synchronized with my work email by&nbsp;itself because I don't remember ever doing anything like that. Please help me!!! I need this fixed ASAP!</p>

http://ask-leo.com/how_do_i_turn_off_data_execution_prevention_errors.html</a> unntil we can determine the cause.&nbsp; In certain circumstances you may need to turn it back on so we can test if the problem is resolved.</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the box
 to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (or boot into Safe Mode and try from there). The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information
 you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the problem persists, try logging on as a different user and see if that user has the same problem.&nbsp; If not, your user profile may be corrupt.&nbsp;
<span>
To fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a>&nbsp;
 If so, it's a bigger problem than that.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We'll need to do a comprehensive troubleshooting technique to try to identify
 the probllem:</span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span><span>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need
 to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive
 and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work&nbsp; (try turning DEP back on before you reboot and then back offf it the problem persists), try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the
 disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Try to post any corrupted files here so
 we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;DEP (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting
 from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>.&nbsp; Turn DEP back on before you start this to see if this resolves the problem - if not turn it back on). If the problem goes away then
 it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If
 the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Turn DEP on and boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.&nbsp; In either case, leave it on for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span>.</span></p>

<h3> jordanbates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t click on many windows elements.</h2>
                    <p>I had no idea which category this fit in, so I put it in Accessibility since I can't access anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded to windows 10 on my main desktop. I have already performed the upgrade on several other devices, and the upgrade went very smoothly on them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after upgrading to windows 10 from 8.1 on my main PC, I can't click on many of the UI elements. For example, I can open the start menu by clicking it, but then clicks inside the menu do nothing. Hover actions still work and I can still scroll, but
 the actual clicks (left and right) do nothing. The same applies to the new action center, volume slider, and other popups like that. I can't click on anything in the settings app either.&nbsp;I also noticed I can't click anything on the top of Microsoft Edge, but
 I can click on things within webpages. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some apps work completely fine, like Google Chrome and Spotify (and I don't think I ran into any issues with file explorer, but I could be mistaken).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried doing a reset of windows 10. I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling my mouse. I have tried other mice. I have tried other USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could help me figure out what is going on here, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Search Indexing not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have a problem with my indexing. It's been there since I installed Windows 10.<br />
It seems that indexing is not working.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5b11da2-6c8e-447c-a77e-b0d3fd153d0c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As the picture says - 0 items indexed.<br />
I've tried rebuilding and lots of other methods but nothing seems to work.&nbsp;<br />
Start menu search is not working obviously. Any idea what can I do to fix this?<br />
<br />
PS: This is my second installation of Windows 10 since launch, so I guess that reinstalling the OS won't work.</p>

<p>I hope MS finds better way to resolve their bugs.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to create a new email account on Yahoo, you need to use the web browser and visit yahoo page to create an account. Once you have create an account, that is when you may use it in the mail app to receive and send emails. If you have already
 created the account and are unable to configure it in mail app, <span><span>I suggest you to run Windows Store Apps troubleshooter and check if it fixes the issue<strong>.

</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;<strong>View all</strong>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Windows Store Apps&nbsp;</strong>troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists,</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Re-register the Store App and check.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;a. Press “Windows Key + R” button from the keyboard.</span></span></p>

You need to disconnect all peripheral devices like <b>printers, speakers, flash drives</b>, and also the devices like

<h2>            Wondering where the All Users folder has gone in Windows 7</h2>
                    Wondering if there is away for default desktop icons to be created in windows 7.
<br />
In XP usually just edit the all users folder, as my business does a lot of work remotely, this folder is handy to be able to change default icons etc.<br />
So just wondering if anyone knows how i can now do this.

<br />
There could be a lot reasons why you're having this issue. Do you still have a copy of your pictures? If you do, kindly open the picture from the original source just to make sure the file is not corrupted. If you were able to do so, try to copy the pictures
 again. We suggest to copy the pictures on a different location and open it again afterwards.<br />
<br />
If you were not able to open the pictures from the original source, the file might be corrupted that is why you are having the error message.<br />
<br />
After you performed the update, are you getting any error message?<br />
<br />
We'll wait for your response. </blockquote>
<p>I just updated to "2017-09 Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4038806)" today and now I can no longer view .jpg's or .png's, neither files I had before the update nor .jpg's I create now. &nbsp;When I click
 on the thumbnails (which still display the correct images), I get an error message that says "Windows cannot find 'C:\Users\ ... .jpg'. &nbsp;Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again." &nbsp;The exact location of the file doesn't seem to matter. &nbsp;Copying
 the file to a different location preserves the thumbnail but the problem persists. &nbsp;I am an Admin and the only user on my computer.</p>

<p>Hi Stranger_Hanyo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excellent! - I went to the Windows Store and when I selected 'Photos' it did not list any updates available but had a "Launch" button to start the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I started it this way it was as if it was an initial startup after the upgrade - i.e. it told me about new features I wasn't interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now it can be associated with the file type and run correctly from File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise with "Films &amp; TV" app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi <span><span><span>Lou1961</span> !!</span>
</span><br />
<br />
Sorry you are having a problem with this!&nbsp; Try the steps below and please let us know status.<br />
<br />
There are many reasons that can cause the Vista AutoPlay (or AutoRun) not working and does not pop up. If you’re facing the AutoPlay not appearing issue, the guide below will point you to the possible cause and where to check for the error.<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Ensure that Shell Hardware Detection service is running</strong></p>
<p>Type “service.msc” in Start Search to run Services console. Locate <strong>Shell Hardware Detection</strong> , and ensure that the “Service Status” is
<strong>Running</strong> , and “Startup Type” is <strong>Automatic</strong> . If not, start the service and change the Startup Type setting accordingly.</p>
<strong>NoDriveTypeAutoRun</strong> registry key is used by Group Policy to configure whether to disable the Autoplay feature on all drives of the type specified. To check this setting, run Registry Editor (regedit), and navigate to the following registry key:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br />
<br />
or (note that above registry value, if exists, will always supersede the below user-specific key),<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br />
<br />
<p>Locate the <strong>NoDriveTypeAutoRun</strong> registry entry on the right pane. The registry key is in DWORD hexadecimal value, which each bit determines which type of drive to disable or enable AutoPlay feature. There are many possible value for NoDriveTypeAutoRun,
 some possible wrong value that disable AutoPlay are:</p>
<p>0×000000B5 (181) disable AutoRun on CD-ROM drives, plus default unknown drive, removable drive (meant for floppy or ZIP), network drive and reserved drive type.</p>
0×000000FF (255) disable AutoRun/AutoPlay on all drive types<br />
<br />
The best bet is to set NoDriveTypeAutoRun to default value as set by Windows Vista, which is
<strong>0×00000091</strong> (hexadecimal) or 145 (decimal). Previous Windows versionsuch as XP uses 0×00000095 (hexadecimal) or 149 (decimal). To enable AutoPlay on all drive types, set NoDriveTypeAutoRun to 0 (zero) or 0×00000080 (128) which only disable AutoPlay
 on unknown reserved file type.<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Also NoDriveAutoRun</strong> registry key, which stored at the same registry location, meanwhile determine whether a particular connected drive should run AutoPlay function or not. When AutoRun is enabled on the drive, media is automatically started
 when it is inserted in the drive.</p>
By default, Windows Vista does not add any NoDriveAutoRun registry subkey. And you probably don’t want to block any drive from AutoPlay too. So remove and delete all NoDriveAutoRun key in the registry.<br />
<br />
Hope this would help.!!!<br />
<br />
Warm Regards !!!

<h2>            File names do not display</h2>
                    I have Windows XP.&nbsp; The file/folder names in my "My Pictures" folder do not display any more.&nbsp; I have always used the&nbsp;thumbnails setting.&nbsp; The file/folder thumbnails show up fine, but their names no longer appear beneath them.&nbsp; This is only in the "My

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after GPT conversion. Hal.dll missing and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after GPT conversion. Hal.dll missing and CLFS.SYS missing errors.</h2>
                    <p>My windows machine had a mbr partition table. I converted it to gpt. After the conversion it booted to the desktop and I kind of left it there. When I can back the system was off and booting it would give me hal.dll is missing or corrupt error. I tried to
 boot from a installation usb and running automatic repair. It couldn't fix it. I now tried running sfc from the command prompt which gave an error "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation".<br />
<br />
After a bit of reading online I deleted the first partition and made EFI and MSR partition. This helped to no avail. I even tried copying the hal.dll to System32 to see if this was the only file that is corrupt. It wasn't as it now gave a clfs.sys is missing
 or corrupt. After this I got back to command prompt on the live usb running chkdsks and sfcs which found no bad sectors and gave the previous error respectively. I know tried bootrec /scannos which devastated me as the result was 0 windows installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the said above however still haven't fixed it. If the startup repair or sfc where to work I think it would fix the problem, but they don't. Please tell me how to fix either the repair tools or my windows itself. It had taken me years to
 install all programs with my abominable internet so I can't afford to lose it. If there is no way I am ready to do so as all those programs are useless if I can't boot. Just mentioning, I do have a secondary OS on the machine.</p>
