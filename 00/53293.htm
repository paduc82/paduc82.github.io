<p><strong>Occasionally when I install a foreign langauage font, it does not display properly.&nbsp; For example, I have two Greek fonts, Galatia SIL and QVGreekHebrew, that although appear in my font file as installed, when I have them displayed, they appear in
 English characters.&nbsp; I suspect somehow that they have not been installed properly.&nbsp; Any ideas?</strong></p>

<h2>            Not possible to answer the first incoming call &#40;Linux&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Have installed the latest Skype for Linux (v5.3.0.1) on my Linux Ubuntu 17.04. Everything seems to work, but when there are an incoming call it immediately reject the call when I try to answer. And the person calling me gets the information "no answer".
 Then, if the same person tries a second call to me directly after the failed call, then I can answer and start the conversation normally.</p>
<p>

</p><p>You may try to uninstall and reinstall your Skype Application. Make sure that you have a strong internet connection as well. If Skype detects a weak connection, it will automatically reduce the quality and may result to drop calls. Close any applications
 that could be interfering with your call. </p>

            Hi, and thanks for a fast reply.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have tried your suggestions, but with no luck. Answering the first call from a user rejects. Then that other user tries a second time to call me, and then I can answer and establish a call with that user. When the call is finished, and I later get a new call,
 the behaviour is the same (call is rejected).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My internet connection is via a fiber, with a speed of about 90Mb/s. So I have a good and fast internet connection.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have also tried to uninstall Skype, and then re-install, but the behaviour is still the same.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My system is: Linux Ubuntu 17.04<br />
Skype For Linux v5.3.0.1<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this problem has a solution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards/ Tomas Nilzon, Sweden<br />

<p>I have now installed the very latest Skype version (v5.4.0.1 Beta).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with answering incoming calls is exactly the same. Skype rejects the call as soon as I click on the answer button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At random some calls is possible to answer, and to have a normal video conversation. But again the next time the same person tries to call me the call gets rejected when I try to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a problem with a weak internet connection (I have fiber with a 100MB/s connection) and no other software is using the net during my tries with Skype. And also when I am able to answer a call, there is perfect quality with a video call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying and makes Skype almost unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this could be fixed, because I used to like Skype very much and make many calls.</p>

<h2>            In Windows Live Mail, when I delete an Email it again comes back</h2>
                    <p>After Windows 10 upgrade from 7 Pro. After I receive, read then delete e-mails. I turn off the the E-mail. Then the next day I open up Win Live Mail those same e-mails are back in the inbox but without anything in the the message window except that the "message
 has not been downloaded". they also stay in bold print, after I Hy-light them. Then after deleting them again they stay in bold print.&nbsp; Until I delete them out of the delete folder they keep partially returning to the inbox in so many hours after shutting
 down Live mail.&nbsp; Now when I shut down Live mail and then restart it doesn't do it.&nbsp; Just after an extended period of time.</p>

            Sorry it took a while for it to do it again. When it comes back it is addressed to where were it came from. I receive mail from two address on "Windows Live Mail".&nbsp; One is a Pop3, the other comes from live.com. It does the same thing on both addresses.
 When they come back they will not go from unread to read on their own. I have to manually change that myself.

            <p>I have the same issue all the time. When I delete mail in Windows 10 email program, it ALL comes back into the inbox INSTANTLY! This does not happen on the Outlook Mail website, only on the Windows 10 mail program. There is an issue with this for a while,
 and the latest Anniversary upgrade did nothing to fix it. It is very frustrating to have to keep on trying to delete over and over!</p>

<div>Hi Guys,</div>
<div>My system page file is on the E:\ along with everything else that gets written to frequently... (ie Temp folders, etc)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My machine is constantly freezing and has crashed a few times.</div>
<div>The freezing is most noticable when Im watching a video from the E:\</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the event viewer I have a loooong list of the message below:</div>
<div>Event ID:<span> </span>11</div>
<div>The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Ide\IdePort? (By "?" I mean whichever port its plugged into at the time.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've replaced the cables and even switched ports, so its definitely a problem with the HD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At one point I checked the Device Manager =&gt; IDE ATA / ATAPI controllers / ATA Channel 0 &nbsp;Properties =&gt; Advanced Settings, and see the current mode as "Ultra DMA Mode 6" with Enable DMA checked. A couple minutes later when I checked again, I could swear
 it said "PIO Mode 4" with Enable DMA grayed out. I've checked it again several times and it hasnt displayed "PIO Mode 4" again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions as to what I can do to sort this out?</div>
<div>Or is the disk knackered and need to be returned?</div>
<div><br />

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I'll give it a go this evening, and while I hope it works, Im not sure it will.<br />
I've already uninstalled the drivers for that drive and updated them. No luck.<br />
<br />
While checking the drivers, I've noticed the PIO MODE 4 change on one other occassion, so it wasnt just my imagination...<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions would be appreciated. <br />
<br />

<p>Do you have a pagefile on C as well as on E?&nbsp; If not you should have. If only 100 mb!</p>
<p>As I said earlier you need to post complete Event Viewer error&nbsp;reports, especially the Event ID: 11 report.</p>
<p>Can you please provide the model details for each drive?</p>
<p>You can use HD Tune 2.55 (freeware) to get reports on both drives:<br />

            <p>Just create a nominal 100 mb pagefile on C. You can leave the main&nbsp;pagefile on E.</p>
<p>I do not think there is a firmware update for the Kingston SSD drive.</p>
<p>The Hitachi is Sata 111 but you will need a motherboard capable of supporting 6 gbs as if it does not then it reverts to Sata 11.</p>
<p>I have found that tracking down the precise cause of Event ID 11 errors can prove elusive. What is said about the controller in Device Manager?</p>
<p>In HD Tune what does it say on the Health tab about the Hitachi drive?</p>

            <div>Hi Gerry,</div>
<div><br />
<div>HD Tune says the health of the drives is OK.</div>
<div>I think this issue comes up when the drive is being really used.</div>
<div>I got nervous when the errors started appearing so I decided to move most of the data off, I got loads of messages at that point.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I installed an extra drive (exact same make and model as the 2TB hitachi onto the same bank of ports, and I see that it also has the odd Event 11 error :o(</div>
<div>Its not used as much as the E:\ though</div>
<div><br />
<div>In Device Manager =&gt; IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers all the channels say "This device is working properly".</div>
<div><br />
<div>E:\ Hitachi 2TB</div>
<div>ATA Channel 0 =&gt; Advanced Settings=&gt; Current Mode is Ultra DMA Mode 6, which is strange because if I look in&nbsp;</div>
<div>HD Tune =&gt; Info =&gt; Active: says UDMA Mode 5 (Ultra ATA/100)</div>
<div>HD Tune =&gt; Info =&gt; Supported: says UDMA Mode 6 (Ultra ATA/133)</div>
<div><br />
<div>F:\ Hitachi 2TB</div>
<div>ATA Channel 1 =&gt; Advanced Settings=&gt; Current Mode is Ultra DMA Mode 5</div>
<div>HD Tune =&gt; Info =&gt; Active: says UDMA Mode 5 (Ultra ATA/100)</div>
<div>HD Tune =&gt; Info =&gt; Supported: says UDMA Mode 6 (Ultra ATA/133)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last night I uninstalled both Channel 0 and Channel 1 drivers and rebooted, so far I havent used the machine heavily and havent had any errors.</div>
<div>We'll see if that changes today when I fire up VMWare and a screen capture program...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've got the P8P67 Rev3 motherboard, which does support Sata III.</div>
<div>I've taken a look at the manual and it says the Marvell PCIe SATA 6.0Gb/s controller are for data hard drives only, ATAPI devices are not supported, which shouldnt be a problem, but I think this evening I'll move the drives to another bank of ports to
 see if I get any more messages and hopefully they'll start working as SATA III drives.</div>

            <p>Is your computer 32 bit or 64 bit?</p>
<p>Have you checked that you have the latest BIOS and motherboard drivers? There are a&nbsp;lot of updates. Surprisingly a lot reference sata drives.</p>

            <div>I have Win 7 64bit installed.</div>
<div><br />
Good idea on the BIOS drivers.
<div><br />
<div>I checked my board on the asus site and there were sata updates.</div>
<div>I found an interesting utility called Ai Suite II that would update BIOS drivers from the windows desktop, I tried to install it.... BIG MISTAKE!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>On rebooting it was stuck on the "Starting Windows". I restarted a couple times, but it was just stuck there. I tried booting into Safe Mode, but the Safe Mode option wasn't there. There was only a repair option, which ran for a while but couldnt fix the
 problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried booting from my win7 disk, but that wasnt much help either, till I noticed the cmd prompt option. I remembered that the AI Suite patcher program had installed to C:\Program Files (x86), so I navigated there and renamed the Asus folder. On rebooting
 my machine started as normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think before I do anything else, Im going to setup a restore point and also run clonezilla to backup my SSD just in case.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I've gotta say though, that after uninstalling the Channel 0 and Channel 1 drivers and rebooting, I havent had any more Atapi Event 11 errors.</div>
<div>Im currently running a little stress test on the drives, If this doesnt generate any issues, then I'll count this issue as fixed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it isnt, I'll run the bios updates this evening...&nbsp;</div>

<p>Stay away from third party software just manually take the BIOS and driver updates from the motherboard manufacturers site. Also do not get drivers from driver agents.
</p>
<p>Same point with software utilities. Always go to the programme providers site.</p>

            AI Suite II is from the providers site (ie ASUS)
<div><br />
<div>I totally agree about not getting drivers from driver agents.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to recap, my issue seems to have been sorted by uninstalling the Channel 0 and Channel 1&nbsp;(the channels for the drives I was having the trouble with)&nbsp;drivers and rebooting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Gerry, thanks for all your help.</div>

<h2>            Need Microsoft to fix my rank</h2>
                    
<p>I caught a hacker while playing "Call of Duty Ghosts", I uploaded a video as evidence on xbox live. The hackers name is
<strong>"[Mod Removed - Personal Information]". </strong>After I reported him for cheating, which the video clearly shows him using aim bot hack. When I said I was reporting him for cheating with video evidence. I got booted from the match, and noticed he deranked
 me back to level 1 with all my characters. I had all except 4 maxed rank. I want microsoft to ban this persons IP, so he can't access live again. Plus I want microsoft, to re-establish my ranks back to what they were before the hacker reset my stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a friend who was also de-ranked by this same person during the match his name tag is<strong> "[Mod Removed - Personal Information]"
</strong>my name tag is "ChrisLGlines". I want both our ranks put back to what they were before the hacker de-ranked us. My friend had maxed every character, and had the gold knife as well. He is noteably more upset than me, but this isn't right. That these
 hackers are allowed to screw us legit players over, while they don't get banned. Fix this Now!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
We understand your concern on File explorer crash on Windows 10 and I'd be glad to help you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed, please answer these queries, for a better understanding of your issue:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the latest build on your&nbsp;system?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any changes to your&nbsp;system, prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I would suggest&nbsp;you to refer to the Microsoft blog,&nbsp;regarding the latest Windows 10 build and update your system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 10586:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/11/05/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10586/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/11/05/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10586/</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists even after installing the latest Build then,
</span><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and check, if it works. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify, if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and MSN</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using my bing desktop icon to search and get into MSN mail. From there I can sign in and see my twitter feed, one drive, word, and my outlook email account in the old view style like Windows 7 home premium (without a half screen).</p>
<p>Will I still be able to do this when Windows 7 restore date expires in 30 days. Also what is the adjustment if any on Windows 10 to see mail across the whole screen? Hope this is understandable.</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>When experiencing issues with MSN Premium, MSN Dial-Up and MSN Explorer (Butterfly), post your concerns to MSN Solution Center @

</p><p>If all is working well now, it should continue to do so.&nbsp; However, I learned earlier from Product Group "<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Because of the built-in search bar on Win 10 and no plug-in policy on Edge browser, there are no current
 plans to support Desktop and Toolbar on Win10."</span></p>

            I think I got the answer I was needing.&nbsp; As long as I use a search engine to get into the Bing homepage I can then go into MSN.com, sign in, and access my mail just like in windows 7?? I have not tried the adjustment for the reading pane in Edge and have
 not used it as I do not feel comfortable with it yet.

            <p>Yes, you can log into your account through msn.com.&nbsp; Just type msn.com in your address bar and press enter.&nbsp; It will take you to the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you do play around with Edge browser.&nbsp; It's basic as opposed to Internet Explorer.&nbsp; If you have feature suggestions for the browser, click More Options on the right hand side &gt; select Feedback and let MS Developers know what you think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer is still included with Windows 10</p>
<p>Click on Search &gt; Type Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Right click on the app &gt; Select Pin to Taskbar</p>
<p>You'll then see Internet Explorer icon appear in your taskbar.&nbsp; Edge icon is similar in appearance but you should notice the difference.</p>

            <p>I have had MSN for years.&nbsp; MSN was on&nbsp;my desktop when I upgraded from Vista to W-7 and on to W-10.&nbsp; It is still on my&nbsp; desktop as I type.&nbsp; So you should have no issues.&nbsp; My only issue on this machine (older HP desktop) is stretching of pix on the&nbsp; display.&nbsp;
 Wife has an issue on her 18 month Gateway that you can address an email and type a subject but cannot type any text.&nbsp; Will not work period.</p>

            <p>Wow, you are an old pro with MSN. Crazy about your wife's email issue. I am trying to use the Edge mail function a little bit now as the first responder suggested. It's kinda cool but I am not weaned off of MSN explorer&nbsp;yet. Think it must be my middle age&nbsp;resistance!
 I am having some strange things happening as it seems like my Win7 home premium explorer mail&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;melding into my Win 10 edge mail sometimes when I send messages. I don't know why. I can be sending an email in my explorer browser and sometimes I am
 getting linked to the edge browser mail. I sent an email with an attachment from explorer and when I went back to check my sent folders the attachment folder was not there even though the recipient received it. I then went into edge mail and it showed the
 message sent with an attachment in which the "download failed" Maybe one of you whiz kids or adults can help, I am not getting the logic tree. Used to having IT at office handling problems but I realize that I have to figure out how to do things now at home
 for my small home business or get a consultant. Geez!</p>

            <p>Kevin, the wife uses the Mail portion of W-10 to send an email, and she reads them on MSN, since she cannot type text.&nbsp; I have notd messed with W-10 Mail much yet, so I don't know the ins and outs of it.&nbsp; Might do that when it turns too cold to do outside
 stuff.&nbsp; Good luck with your issues.&nbsp; I have asked MSN about it and never got any response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can relate to the IT functions, now gotta do it yourself.&nbsp; Hell to get old ain't it..!&nbsp; Be 75 next year.&nbsp; Worked with aircraft avionics for the last 30+ years and some of this new computer stuff is .. wierd.&nbsp; Used to working with my old Apple IIc, which
 was upgraded to an AST, then Toshibas latops.&nbsp; Last one had Windows 95 on it and it worked great.&nbsp; Then came XP and Vista.&nbsp; By the time XP came out I retired.</p>

            <p>What is the Monitor make/model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Courtesy of Ronnie Vernon, MVP</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen resolution is defined by the size of the display. Width x Height.</p>
<p>Example: 1280x960</p>
<p>You just need to select a resolution that either has a smaller Width number with the same Height number, or a larger Height number with the same Width number.</p>
<p>Examples:&nbsp; 1280x1024 or 1152x960</p>
<p>Note: Your available resolutions may vary, depending on the Graphic Card and Monitor supported resolutions.</p>
<p>You should always keep the drivers for the installed Graphic Card up to date. Check with the Computer manufacturer or Graphic Card manufacturer for the latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked for chipset updates through HP or Intel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which mail client can your wife not type text?&nbsp; MSN software or Windows 10 Mail?</p>

                    <p>I have managed to configure my&nbsp; Elite Stream HP Windows 10 to show the battery's time remaining. I cannot remember exactly what I did but I did it whilst correcting the fact that the battery icon wasn't being displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the battery icon to appear following a suggestion in the forum to enable and re-enable the battery devices in the device manager. After which the battery icon displayed time remaining - before it showed only a percentage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one provide an answer/solution that describes how to configure this?</p>

    <title>How would I go about backing up and restoring Windows 10 Display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mistr-k  say:</h3>
<h2>            How would I go about backing up and restoring Windows 10 Display Settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to backup and restore the Display settings on Windows 10. I thought I could do this with a batch file or two by exporting/importing registry keys.
</p>
<p>I was able to export them without issue, but Importing them gives me an error that says: "Cannot Import C:\DisplayConfig.reg: Not all data was successfully written to the registry. Some keys are open by the system or other processes, or you have insufficient
 privileges to perform this operation." I ran this script as an admin, so I don't think it's my privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a way to back up the Display settings (size, placement, orientation, etc.) for a multi-monitor setup and allow for a restore should anything be changed around? I don't want to back up the whole computer, I'd just like a small script or something
 similar to fix my settings if something should happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>One way to backup and restore the settings (all settings) would be to create a system restore point. Restoring the system to that restore point would restore all settings
 and will undo the changes (including updates, apps) made after the restore point was created, however your personal files will not be affected.

            Hello Abdul,<br />
<br />
I'm afraid every Windows customization tool (like the by you mentioned Tuneup Utilities)
<u><b>will</b></u> change the registry. It's the only way.<br />
<br />
Plus: in some cases removing the arrow can cause problems (won't work)&nbsp; if you want to pin a program to the startmenu or taskbar.<br />
<br />
If you still want to get rid of the arrow you can use tools like <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-v2-a-tweak-ui-for-windows-7-vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ultimate Windows Tweaker</a> or whatever tool you can find. <u><b>Warning</b>: these tools can seriously mess up your system!!</u> Use carefully and at own risk.<br />
<br />
I found another topic on this on answers.microsoft.com <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/how-do-you-remove-shortcut-arrow-from-desktop-icon/120156c5-2b6a-429c-8b2f-dc6131f51596">

Good luck.<br />

<h2>            NXOE Issues Power cycle Before you read this..</h2>
                    
<p>OK the NXOE interface is not that bad as far as looks which is what Microsoft is famous for.. Not a Shock there.&nbsp; You would think with the bad line of updates to make things look good they would adjust but they haven't they continue to add features that
 don't work and take away or wreck features that do..</p>
<p>Here are the issues that I have run into since the Nuked XBOX ON EVERYONE or NXOE and been implemented</p>
<p>1. Play works half the time.. ( Plays one time and doesn't play the other ) OH and I have power cycled again and again</p>
<p>2. When Play to works voice command don't work -- CAN'T PAUSE FROM HERE&nbsp; ... WHAT?????</p>
<p>3. When Play to works the Picture Dims ( Have to active with voice command for controller )&nbsp; Again Power cycle does not fix..
</p>
<p>4. Picture Dims while watching a DVD or Bluray.. ( Have to Activate with Voice or Controller ) Again Power cycle does not fix this.</p>
<p>5. Xbox one stops responding to&nbsp;network request&nbsp; ( Nothing to do with my network as I have it plugged it and can ping it.. ) Didn't happen before NXOE</p>
<p>6. Xbox support and update department doesn't beta test before releasing updates and tell us to power cycle..
</p>

<p>Please fix these issues.. </p>

<p>VOID</p>

<p>Hi VOID</p>
<p>I've seen this screen a few times and it's usually intermittent, and hard resets seem to sometimes resolve. If you haven't tried a hard reset then hold the power button down till the console shuts off. After that just power it back on. If no resolve then
 perhaps try a factory reset. You'll need to reinstall all your games, but your saves should be stored online provided the console is connected to the Internet. &nbsp;With the amount of random issues you're having it may be worth a shot.

<p>I agree. The NXOE is riddled with bug defects and not much resolves it, even factory resets; all began with the NXOE &nbsp;update. There has bee MANY, MANY posts on the beta forums that identify the bugs and defects in the software system. Support does not look
 in these areas when people complain about the bugs, they appear to rely on older fixes, which don't necessarily work with the new bug issues.
</p>
<p>If the screen is dimming, WHEN did it start? If it started exactly when NXOE was installed, yes, MS needs to look in there, figure out if the Kinect software has anything to dim it, and why. If the Kinect is not operating exactly as it was before NXOE was
 installed, look into the Kinect drivers and conflicts it has with the software and games. If the drivers conflict with the software, it won't operate right.
</p>
<p>If the network card is not operating properly, where it was before NXOE was installed, the same procedure needs to be done. Look into driver conflicts with software.
</p>
<p>I do think the software updates need to be beta tested at least a year before they are put into mass production. Kind of the disaster MS had with Windows 8. Not many people liked the operating system due to the issues it had.

<p>Thank you for the response except for Hydro Skillet.. Eat some more fish buddy because you need some more brain power.. As I explained I have done the power cycle which is what you talked about and by the way everything worked fine before this wonderful
 update.. &nbsp;As for blowing away my XBOX .. there is a resolution.. People need to think before they reply.. I have 40GB of games that have been download and will need to be downloaded again over my bandwidth. You may have free bandwidth but do not..
</p>
<p>I ask again for a solution?? How is it that a company can release an update that would create as many issues as this has without either doing a recall or fixing it in the first week????? Boy if drug companies did this what would happen.. Ok not drugs but
 Cars. What happens if we have automated cars and this update comes out.. Best Intentions.. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Quick reply to Grin.. Ya everything started with the NXOE update.. The Kinect doesn't register activity on the cam I have to voice activate to undim the screen during a movie.. I have to keep the controller on and hit it every 15 minutes or so to keep the
 show bright.. Drives me nut because I think it went to a dark seen only to find out it looks like power save has kicked in.. Oh and the power save option I have already check out in the settings not it.. These are all bugs.

<p>So you said power cycle, not hard reset. The factory reset would have been the quick way as you mentioned multiple issues, most of which are resolved by factory resets.
</p>
<p>1. I'm assuming you mean play to and not play. Did you do the win 10 update? You stated it works sometimes so that would rule out a firewall issue. Are you wireless, what happens when you plug in via cable if you're not already.
</p>
<p>2. I use the controller and not my kinect so I won't even try to answer if it should or should not work after the update.
</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;This is where I said people usually see intermittent issues. If the hard reset didn't work try to uninstall and reinstall the Xbox Video app and Media Player apps.
</p>
<p>4. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the bluray app. If that doesn't work go to settings, &nbsp;bluray, then clear your persistent storage. PS reboot after this.
</p>
<p>5. You've plugged it in, is it still plugged in? Do you go through switches or just one router? When you say it stops responding to network do you mean network at all or just stops responding to packets from your PC? Run a Wireshark on your pc to see what
 exactly it's not responding to. If it's all network run a detailed network test from your network settings on the console and then post the results here.</p>
<p>6. I don't really care for fish. If you know of a nice steak place pass me the info and I'll check it out.

<p>LOL.. I generally associate skillet with Fish.. Just didn't look like you read the post.. I wrote it pretty fast and *** about the quality of service of the XBOX and a little annoyed with the limited comment you provided.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Yes I meant Play to.. No Windows 10 in the mix.. Windows 8.1. &nbsp;No Firewall and nothing that would cause issues with the connectivity as I can complete the play to just fine with my TV.. Yes I am Wireless but once again I have no issues with connectivity.
</p>
<p>2. The voice control works some times and not others but indicates the command on the screen was received by the XBOX so I know it is being interpreted by the system.. Surprised you don't use the feature as the controller can be a pain if it turns off well
 unless you have the xbox remote. I Don't have it.. </p>
<p>3. Power Cycle and Hard Reset are the same thing unless you are talking about the factory reset which I would rather not do. These problems weren't there before and the Video app seems to have updated to Movies and TV now so not sure why that would need
 to be reinstalled.. Haven't tried the Media player app yet. &nbsp;But come to think of it Netflix didn't work properly with the Voice command either after the update.. Will try and uninstall and reinstall those apps though.
</p>
<p>4. Will try that and let you know</p>
<p>5. Go through a wireless router and the Xbox is directly plugged in to it. &nbsp;The Xbox stops responding to requests but is pingable on the network, no other issues with clients. &nbsp;PC is still sending packets the Xbox stops responding to the requests.. &nbsp;Will
 capture the packets with Wireshark but pretty sure that isn't going to lead anywhere since this all worked before..
</p>
<p>6. Love Steak to.. Charcoal Grill.. Best Steak in the world.. &nbsp;</p>

<p>No worries let us know on the tests and someone or myself will hopefully be able to help. Just suggested the factory reset because it does fix most random issues, and is a time saver in most cases :)

<p>I REALLY don't understand this , how the updated has all these issues for some people and others remain unaffected , I've been with it from the beginning (preview) and haven't had any issues , not one , other people have every issue and we ALL haave the
 same Xboxes ? How can that be ? ....I have many friends that play online with me and none have had issues like this . Now I will say this , I am 100% convinced that most if not all of the connection issues are related to the type of router that you have ,
 me and all my friends who play , all have , what I call "gaming routers" as in the early days we all had problems when we TRIED to play together ,( this guy would join , that guy got kicked , one guy in a lobby by himself ...stuff like that) &nbsp;now if you go
 over to the &nbsp;"Connecting to xbox live " section of this forum , 99 % of the people with problems are using isp issued "Gateways" &nbsp;(mostly Arris ), there just has to be something going on "traffic" wise that they cant handle , i will also tell you this , when
 i was having my problems a year or so back and called ms support and got as high up as i could , the guy told me that ms couldn't really endorse a brand of router but if were HIM , get a Netgear , and DO NOT get a gateway , never get a gateway...so idk , i
 have no tech knowledge , just real world experience (lots of it , I'm old) it just seems odd to me ...i have OCD and HAVE to fix things , no matter what

    <title>How to install Windows Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twothe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to install Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>After following an instruction to move the Package repository for Store apps, Windows Store failed to start. Reverting that change, using wsreset or similar guides did not help, the Store is unable to load. At the current situation any attempt to install
 the store fails and I exhausted all answers on this and other sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Target:</p>
<p>Install Windows Store without reinstalling Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>- Get-AppxPackage reports: a package named *Store* does not exist.</p>
<p>- Get-AppxPackage reports: dependencies of the Store package have no install location (InstallLocation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp; )</p>
<p>- Files on disk cannot be installed, because Add-AppxPackage -register either reports that the file does not exist (while it definitely does) or that the package is not registered in the Windows Package Repository.</p>

 that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the "powershell" fix but it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I don't want to do a factory restore on my computer. However, since even Microsoft can't find a fix for this problem. I might just have to bite the bullet.</p>

</p><p>I tried Method 1, but it did not solve my problem. The sfc command found issues that could be repaired, but still no Store installed, so the last PowerShell command completely failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what method 2 is supposed to do, as I am pretty sure that a new account won't magically re-install the Windows Store from an outside location.</p>

    <title>Does overwriting a file put the new data in the same physical location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does overwriting a file put the new data in the same physical location as the original data on the Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    This question relates to NTFS volumes under Windows 8 (and probably Windows 7, Vista, XP...).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If one accidentally <b>overwrites</b> an existing file with a different one of the same size, what happens within the NTFS - does the original file get flagged as deleted, and then the new file get saved in a different physical location&nbsp;(clusters/sectors)
 on the Hard Drive, or does the overwriting process <b>replace</b> the original file in its pre-existing physical location?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A more specific case: I have two similarly-named Excel 2013 .xlsx worksheet files (both about 10KB). &nbsp;Some time earlier, I set both as Read-only (using Properties in Windows Explorer). &nbsp;Now a slight update is needed on one of the files. &nbsp;After opening
 it in Excel, updating it, then trying to save it, I am reminded that it is Read-only and am presented with the Save As dialogue window. &nbsp;Then right-clicking on the file in the presented list, I choose Properties to turn off the Read-only attribute. &nbsp;When Save
 is clicked, I am asked if I want to overwrite the existing file. &nbsp;The problem is that I did not realize that the
<b>wrong </b>file had been selected for turning off the read-only attribute, and the
<b>wrong</b> file was therefore in the Save As file name box, so when Save was clicked, the
<b>wrong </b>file was overwritten!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>An answer to the question above will determine whether it is at all possible to recover the original of an overwritten file or not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need a definitive answer for this please - please don't answer this if you don't really know or you aren't sure. &nbsp;If you can provide a reference to Microsoft technical information (that I couldn't find) to verify your answer that would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I now know about Windows 8's "File History", but that was not turned on when the above mistake was made. &nbsp;And Excel's File &gt; Info &gt; Versions says "There are no previous versions of this file" - even though AutoRecovery was turned on - unfortunately
 it was set to the default 10 minutes, and the quick editing session was done in less than 10 minutes, so no auto save file was made...</div>
<div><br />

As a general rule I would expect overwritten files to be <br />
replaced and non-recoverable.<br />
<br />
However.....the following article may be worth a look:<br />

            Hi Volunteer J,
<div><br />
<div>Sadly the article you referred to is misleading - it says "Windows 7 &amp; 8", but unfortunately the author has written it based on standard Windows 7 functionality - Previous Versions - which has been removed from Windows 8 and replaced by File History. &nbsp;I
 mentioned File History in my post - that is useless in its default disabled state - very different from Windows 7 that has Previous Versions enabled and running right from original installation...</div>
<div><br />
<div>"As a general rule I would expect overwritten files to be replaced and non-recoverable" - probably a common thought simply based on the definition of the word "overwritten", but I vaguely recall reading many years ago something about the way NTFS (?) works
 every time the same file (without any change in file size) is saved - it doesn't write the new data to the original clusters, it does something like flagging the directory entry and/or&nbsp;allocated space&nbsp;for the original file as deleted/free, then writes the
 new data to a new location, but Im not sure it was actually talking about NTFS or some other system - that's the detail I am looking for definitive information on...</div>

I'm sorry the link was not useful. Personally I would not be <br />
expecting to recover overwritten files anyway but I wish you <br />
the best of luck.<br />

I hope you find the info you are looking for.<br />

<p><br />
Until you can solve the missing Extract All&nbsp;option, suggest you install 7-zip program.</p>
<p>It is free, widely used and recommended.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/download.html</a></p>
<p>Note : there is a 32-bit and a 64-bit download. Make sure you pick the right one.</p>

<p>When setting up my Live TV, the easy guide will not find my cable box DCI401GEU2. I tried to enter the code manually, but it didn't come up with anything for me to use. I tried doing some research to find a remote code, but didn't have any luck there either.
 Does anybody know of another code that might work? Or a remote code that might work? Thanks!</p>

<p>=====================================<br />
Windows Media Player has an option to change the Aspect<br />
Ratio but it's complicated and does not work for DVDs...<br />
though it does work for video clips...wmv, .avi, .mpg, etc....<br />
<br />
Open Windows Media Player and go to...<br />
Tools / Options / Devices tab / Display / Properties button...<br />
Drag the slider to a new position / Apply / Yes / OK / OK...</p>
<p>FWIW...the freeware VLC Media player has more options <br />
than Windows Media Player...maybe it would be worth a try:</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem.&nbsp; It is not an aspect ratio issue.&nbsp; The DVD image is correctly aspected at 16:9.&nbsp; WMP11 is putting the 16:9 image into a 4:3 box, then displaying that 4:3 box on my 16:9 monitor.&nbsp; The net effect is the 16:9 image has bars
 on topIf I full screen this, I have bars on the side of the image.&nbsp; I only noticed this yesterday as I finally purchased a widscreen monitor for my old XP machine.&nbsp; I can correctly view 16:9 wmv files.&nbsp; The issue is not occuring with WMP11 on my Vista laptop&nbsp;or
 with WMP12 on my Windows7 laptop, so I'm assuming is must be a setup or configuration issue on my XP desktop.</p>

            After looking into it, theissue stems from XP not supporting DVD's.&nbsp; There is no "legal and free" plugin codec for media player under XP.&nbsp; Any issues would have to with the codec.&nbsp; I had installed cyberlinkpower dvd years ago, so I'm assuming that the
 codec does not support a wide screen format.&nbsp; I went the VLC route for XP and it works OK.&nbsp; Windows 7 includes support for DVD's, and my Vista laptop has Media Center which supports DVD.

<h2>            Laptop constantly loading...</h2>
                    <p>Hi...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop seems to be constantly loading something... It makes the sound of when its loading... and for example when I am using an app and I am typing for example it constantly goes off from the app and I have to click on it again to continue to type.</p>
<p>I have already run a few options that I found here on the community but did not succeed, just like the startup programs and task manager, and also performed an optimization yesterday... after the problem ceased but started again today.</p>
<p>It is important to tell that this problem started after I installed a 2016 version of AUtocad, student trial. I already uninstalled it and all of its components and barely used it since it was making my computer too slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help with it... since its making my computer to have a very poor performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Att,</p>
<p>Fernanda</p>

            <p>Hi Isha...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply... but unfortunately none of the suggestions worked. Do you have any other recommendation? This problem is really affecting my productivity since I have to work with softwares that require the focus on the window in which I am
 working... It looses focus every 3 seconds, the sound of a loading component has faded but the focus fading away keeps happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>
