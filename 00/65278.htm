    <title>Windows Vista Reinstall Stuck at &#34;Expanding Files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Vista Reinstall Stuck at &#34;Expanding Files &#40;27&#37;&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I was haveing some issues with my main PC (on my laptop right now) and decided after 3 years, time to reformat. From what I've heard supposed to be simple in vista, pop in the disc and hit reinstall windows. It grayed out the keep old files button, but that
 was ok since i wanted a clean install. then it went ahead and said it would keep everything in windows.old, fine, i'll just delete that myself later.</p>
<p>anyway, I pick reinstall, it goes through a restart or two and gets to Installing Windows, Expanding Files, I've been staring at it for over an hour now and it hasn't moved beyond (27%). Not sure what will happen if i force it to restart right now and try
 again. please help and advise.</p>
<p>Stats:<br />
Dell (i know, i know, never again) Dimension 9300<br />
intel Duo DUal Core 2.6ghz<br />
nvidia 6800GTS<br />
4gb RAM<br />
350gb HDD</p>
<p>-Dan</p>
<p>&nbsp;p.s. It's 32bit Vista Home Premium, the same disc that came with teh computer in the first place, original vista, no SP on the the disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:<br />
<br />
ok, after sitting around for another hourish waiting for a reply the instal has puched past 27% and is now at 70%, heres hoping it continues, so for anyone else having this issue, go watch a movie, come back, and hope it's worked.</p>

<p>If you have a genuine Vista Installation Disk (and not an OEM disk or a Recovery disk from Dell), then I can help you. If not, you need to contact Dell as it is their recovery process and not Microsoft's and we have no infomration about how it works.</p>
<p>Assuming you're using a genuine Vista Installation Dist, the installation has obviously failed at this point so you should cold stop the system and reboot to begin the process again.&nbsp; Before doing so I would clean the disk gently with a tissue running from
 center to edge to remove any fingerprints or smudges that may be causing the problem.</p>
<p>When given the option to format, choose a full format rather than a quick format (just to make sure that has nothing to do with the problem).</p>
<p>Then try the re-iinstallation again and hope it works this time.&nbsp; If it won't re-install from the disk, then try to find another genuine Vista Installation Disk of the same bit-size to borrow and try.&nbsp; If not, then push F12 immediatly after pushing the startup
 button to access system diagnotics (at least that's how it works on my Dell - use whatever process works for yours if you have the diagnostics program installed) and run every option to see if it finds any problems with your system (hopefully not).</p>
<p>If not, then you should contact Dell Technical Support (if out of warranty a phone call may cost money but I believe the chat option is free even after the warranty expires and see if they have any suggetions to offer.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about the Kinect trouble. Just to check, do you have your Xbox One connected directly to a wall outlet or is there a power strip in between the two? If you have a power strip please skip that and plug directly into the wall to see if there's any change. Keep us in the loop :) </p>

<h3> christinetong  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 nov 2017 update problems restarting after sleep</h2>
                    <p>hi...</p>
<p>Just did the Nov 2017 windows 10 update.</p>
<p>Now my computer has problems restarting after sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer was just left running, waking-up after sleep mode just gives a crazy pattern on the screen. software reboot doesn't work. Can only restart by doing a hardware reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer was only at the start screen when entering sleep mode (i.e. waiting for me to enter my pin), on wake up, after I enter my pin, computer says there was an error, and I should restart to see if it fixes the problem (which does fix the problem)....but
 always having the problem with sleep mode..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help??</p>

<p>Hi...</p>
<p>The problem is now even worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to manually put the computer in sleep mode, instead of just physically closing the laptop.</p>
<p>Now the computer won't even turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working perfectly well before the windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a 14-month-old Dell Inspiron 3000 series, that came loaded with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Dell suggestion of removing the battery, and then restarting, but still nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>Ok...at last now I have managed to get the laptop running...or walking!!</p>
<p>I removed the battery and the CMOS battery overnight, and now I can get it to work.</p>
<p>However, now my system says the battery has an error and should be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the laptop still has sleep issues...</p>
<p>I'm on Windows 10 version 1709 (OS build 16299.64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if I shutdown the laptop, it is ok. But if I just close the lid (so go into sleep mode), when I open the lid again, i just get a black screen, and if I use the touch pad, I see a screen of fuzzy colours. All I can do from there is use the power button
 to turn off the laptop.</p>
<p>After that, the laptop will not turn on again..just sits with a black screen. And then the laptop is back to not turning on again at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you help?<br />

<p>Just an update. I've fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After (again!) removing the battery, CMOS battery and RAM, and leaving overnight, I was able to get the system working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back Windows to the previous version (OS build 16299.15). Everything in my computer is fine...the "problem" with my battery was not real..just a Windows BIOS issue. I put everything back in it's place, and all was good.</p>
<p>Just to make things safe, I've got rid of the setting where the computer would go to sleep if I closed the lid. It now shuts down instead. And I also set the computer to never sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As expected, Windows decided it should update (because the update had been downloaded), so I let it. So now I'm back to the 'problematic' OS build 16299.64</p>
<p>But so far, because my computer will never sleep, it has been ok.</p>

            We're glad that you were able to resolve the issue. Since the issue has been resolved when you remove your battery and the CMOS battery of your computer, this means that the firmware of your hardware is not compatible with the latest update of Windows
 10. For us to assist you, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer of your computer to see if they have the latest firmware so that your PC will work perfectly on the new update of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help with any Windows issue.

<p>Things went wrong after the Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>When woken up from sleep mode, the screen gives also a crazy&nbsp; pattern on the screen.</p>
<p>Of course I cannot remove the battery as it is a desktop computer.</p>
<p>This computer is only one year old</p>

<p>Hi...</p>
<p>It wasn't removing the main battery that fixed the problem, but the smaller CMOS battery...the round one like a watch battery.</p>
<p>If your PC is outside its warranty, then open it up, find the CMOS battery and remove it. (Should be something on the internet about how to do it).</p>
<p>Then you need to 'get rid of any extra power' by holding the power-on button for about 30 secs. (At least that's how I did it on mine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you can re-insert the CMOS battery, and the computer should start up again.</p>
<p>BUT don't ever let the computer go into sleep mode again. I've set my computer to never go into sleep mode (use settings to adjust this). Often, if the computer is unattended for more than 20 mins, it goes into sleep mode. I set mine to just blank the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

    <title>Hotline Miami - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hotline Miami</h2>
                    
Recently started looking into this game, I've gotta say it does look pretty interesting &amp; enjoyable. I'm considering purchasing it through Steam at the momemt, however I wondered if there was a chance that this game could make it to GWG? Of course not during
 November, but at sometime in the future?

I should have done more research first, I gathered that if it was on steam and PS+ that it may have been on the Xbox 360 too, my mistake! Seems like a great game to play from what I've seen though, shame it hasn't been released on the 360.

    <title>Job stuck in local machine print queue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan hammons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Job stuck in local machine print queue</h2>
                    Job stuck in local machine print queue but not server print queue. We have 4 Copiers/printers on the network and 2 just printers. The 4 copiers are forced down by GPO and the 2 printers are connected to 5 people for local use. We have 75 users and this
 happens to one or 2 users a day. Restarting the local print queue does nothing. We have turned off bi-directional printing. To clear the print job the user either has to restart the network PC or log off and log back on to clear the stuck job. Anyone else
 had this issue?

<p>Had the same issue. Rebooting the workstations always worked, however it might be inconvenient for the users. It actually cleared after a few days without any major intervention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One workaround that we found is by restarting the server's print spooler. It should be safe to restart it even if other users are in the network.</p>

<p>The issue is it doesn't show up in the print queue of the server.&nbsp; It only shows when you hover over the printer icon in the corner of the screen.&nbsp; If you open up the see what's printing screen its only on the local machine. I have tried to restart the local
 printer spooler and that doesn't work and I have tried to restart the server print spooler and no luck.&nbsp; Its strange issue.</p>

<p>I don't know why this is happening (network communication problems?), but you can make a batch job to implement the process described at the link in Yasshiel Zhang's post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@echo off<br />
net stop spooler &gt; nul<br />
del /Q "%windir%\system32\spool\PRINTERS\*.*"<br />
net start spooler &gt; nul<br />
exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the workstations have the Fax service running (probably not), the above has to be modified slightly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>@echo off<br />
net stop spooler /y &gt; nul<br />
del /Q "%windir%\system32\spool\PRINTERS\*.*"<br />
net start spooler &gt; nul<br />
net start fax &gt; nul<br />
exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create a shortcut and set the shortcut to "Run as administrator" ("Advanced" button in Shortcut properties) and "Run minimized," the only thing you have to do after double-clicking the shortcut is respond to the UAC prompt.&nbsp;

            Merely stopping and restarting the spooler won't necessarily get rid of corrupted print jobs in the queue.&nbsp; The "queue" is the files in "%windir%\system32\spool\PRINTERS\*.*".&nbsp; On the other hand, you can't delete those files if the print spooler is running.<br />

<p>Thank you for all the replies and the issue is still why is it that a couple of times a day this happens to&nbsp;different people on 2 sets of copiers/printers, one set in each of 2 buildings.&nbsp; We have them pushed out thru GPO.&nbsp; we have cleaned out the registry
 on all the networked computers and used the kyocera driver removal tool to remove any unused printer dll's and drivers. I have 80 users and I would rather find out why its happening and fix that, &nbsp;then have to train them all on how to stop the spooler, delete
 the corrupted file, and then restart the spooler.&nbsp; The only other option is try a print server I guess.&nbsp; Any other suggestions please?</p>

<h2>            Blue screen of death IRQL_Not_Less-Than or Equal</h2>
                    Hey there all. I have just build a new PC (First build) and I'm having the BSOD problem that has been mentioned in many other articles.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PC Specs:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Motherboard AMD ASRockA-G3.1<br />
RAM: Corsair Vengeance 32GB x 4&nbsp;<br />
Case: NZXT Phantom 410 case B/W<br />
Cooler: Cooler Master Evo 212<br />
Graphics Card: NVidia G-force GTX 960<br />
Power Pack: EVGA Supernova 850 Gold<br />
CPU: AMD FX 9370<br />
Optical Drive: Asus Tek Windows 10 M Disc (Surely the disc can't be windows 10 only?) I'm in windows 7<br />
Hard Disk Seagate Barracuda 2TB 72000 RPM<br />
<br />
The blue screen occurs mostly when I'm trying to install drivers or whatnot via the disc drive. I can give a photo and .DMP file for more info if need be.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            Hello there.<br />
<br />
THanks.<br />
<br />
please see the DMP files listed below. (I have three of them)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem has now changed from "not less than or equal" to something else.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have seen one message that pointed towards the memory. I am running 1866 ram with an ASRock A-G970 3.1 motherboard *Which only lists 1866hz ram with "OC" next to it. But looking in the UEFI the ram appears to be running at 1333hz.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But I'm sure you'll find the DMP more use than that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hello there.<br />
<br />
THanks.<br />
<br />
please see the DMP files listed below. (I have three of them)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem has now changed from "not less than or equal" to something else.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Option to Pin to Start Menu is missing</h2>
                    The "Pin to Start Menu" command no longer shows up on the right-click menu. How do I get this back? I have a Toshiba laptop with Win 7 Home Premium. When I right-clicked on an icon I could pin the program to the Start Menu. It was working fine until a
 couple of months ago and I have no idea why it no longer shows up.

<h2>            Error 1305. Error reading from file.</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to install Call of Duty World at War&nbsp;I get&nbsp;the following:-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Error 1305 Error reading from file.</p>
<p>On my brand new computer I have windows 7.</p>
<p>I've tried to install from a clean Boot and from The compatibility troubleshooter specifying XP service pack 2 and then 3.</p>
<p>I've inserted the disk into both the CD/DVD drive trays. Thet are :- Optiarc DVD RW AD-7260S ATA Device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optiarc DVD RW AD-7260S&nbsp;SCSI&nbsp;CdRom&nbsp;Device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I dropped the resolution to&nbsp;1024 X 768.</p>
<p>Apart from Microsoft Office 2010 installed and the McAfee Firewall and Anti Virus diabled I cannot think of any compatibility issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did install dotNetFx40_Full_setup.exe &nbsp;after a few failed CoD installs.</p>
<p>I've got loads of free memory (8Gb) and Hard Drive space.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can suggest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>KB2596764 failing with a 0x80070643 [resolution]<br />
<br />
So you have a PowerPoint 2007 update being offered up on boxes where only <br />
Office 2010 has been installed?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://msmvps.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/bradley/6811.office2007update.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmsmvps.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fCommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles%2fbradley%2f6811.office2007update.PNG" /></a><br />
<br />
Check to see if you have Microsoft Office 2007 Primary Interop Assemblies <br />
installed. If you do, remove it, as that's what is flagging the update on your <br />
systems.<br />
<br />
So ... now you are probably wondering how do you have that?<br />
<br />
Answer: (at least in my office) is Quickbooks - I think 2010, maybe 2011 <br />
version -- I'll have to double check but it's a more recent vintage that <br />
installed that.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com/support/articles/INF12790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.quickbooks.intuit.com...icles/INF12790</a><br />
<b><b>Microsoft Office <br />
Components</b></b> <br />
<br />
Intuit Statement Writer (ISW) <br />
uses Office Primary Interop Assemblies and Visual Studio Tools for Office for <br />
Microsoft Office Integration. The installation file location on the CD is: <br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Office 2007</b>: ThirdParty\MSOffice\vstor.exe</li><li><b>Office 2003</b>: <br />
ThirdParty\MSOffice\vstor20\vsto.msi</li></ul>
<p><br />
<b>RESOLUTION: So if you have been impacted where KB2596764 errors out with a <br />
generic 0x80070643 error? And you have Office 2010 (and only 2010) installed? <br />
See if you have a Microsoft 2007 Primary Interop Assemblies installed on your <br />
system and remove it.</b></p>
<p><strong>[edit 2:57 p.m.]</strong></p>
<p>Please note this will not impact exporting to Excel.&nbsp; In fact I see no change in behavior<br />
as a result of removing it, so I'm not sure what (if anything) it was used for.</p>
<p>If Quickbooks is not the one that originally installed the 2007 interop stuff, and you think the app that installed the 2007 interop assemblies might still need that, install in it's place

    <title>windows 10 where is my desktop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jarmysc14  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 where is my desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to win 10 from 8.1 about a week ago on my Asus transformer notebook. Used tablet setting. Logged on twice today with no problem, but when I turned on machine and logged in a few minutes ago, my desktop was blank. Argh. Shut down, waited a couple
 of minutes and started again. Same deal. No desktop icons, no taskbar. I can open the computer file folder but it shows no downloads, no apps, no nothing. I need to fix this because I'm in the process of applying for a job online. I've already had to "refresh"
 my pc once since loading Win10. Looks like that will be a routine task. </p>

            <p>What happened to cause you to need to refresh your PC last night?&nbsp; That should be atypical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say your desktop is blank but that you see no taskbar: you shouldn't be able to see any desktop (it should just be a blank screen) if you don't see a taskbar.&nbsp; That would indicate that Explorer is either not running or that it is wedged.&nbsp; If you launch

<p>What happened to cause you to need to refresh your PC last night?&nbsp; That should be atypical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say your desktop is blank but that you see no taskbar: you shouldn't be able to see any desktop (it should just be a blank screen) if you don't see a taskbar.&nbsp; That would indicate that Explorer is either not running or that it is wedged.&nbsp; If you launch

I refreshed the pc two days after installing Win 10 because some&nbsp;MS apps wouldn't open. I don't have that option now because my screen is a blue blank after I login.&nbsp; I finally managed to get a partial taskbar, about half of what's usually there, but the file
 folder icon let me open to the hard drive with current folders. There is no Windows&nbsp;Update folder, no Start folder, etc.&nbsp; When I CTRL+ALT+DELETE, the only thing running is the Microsoft magnifier--not sure why that's even running.&nbsp; I can get online but when
 I go to Windows update site, all I get from MS is to go to Start, etc.&nbsp; I have no Start option!&nbsp; Researched going back to Win 8, and get "go to Settings, Update &amp; Security, etc.&nbsp; I have no Settings option.&nbsp; Currently using my old Win 7 laptop to get online.&nbsp;
 In Win 8, I had to turn off automatic updates because they caused the machine to crash about 85% of the time.&nbsp; I believe this problem occurred because the pc updated at some point yesterday.&nbsp; SOOOOO what on earth do I do to get my desktop, Start, Settings
 options back when I have none of the options listed on MS website?&nbsp; The hours involved in trying to resolve these problems&nbsp;aren't worth it.&nbsp; I'm pretty much done with MS products.&nbsp;

Again, I get a blank, blue screen when I login.&nbsp; No way to get to any Start or Settings or Update options.&nbsp; I finally got the taskbar with about half of the usual icons.&nbsp; IE is working so I can get online, but there's no option to update directly from MS website,
 only instructions to use Start, Settings, etc.&nbsp; Don't have Start, Settings...nothing that will allow me to do what website says to do.&nbsp; Should be a way to download the update directly from the site.&nbsp; I can't even go back to Win 8 because I don't have the means
 to get to any settings.&nbsp; ARRRGH

            Sounds like you're viewing the Applications tab in Windows Task Manager: you probably at this point want to be in the Processes tab so that you can see what processes are running.&nbsp; Is Explorer.exe running there?

            <p>Whoops, I was mistaken.&nbsp; There is no Explorer.exe in the Task Manager Processes.&nbsp; There is only a Windows Explorer folder, which I can't open (I guess I'm not supposed to be able to open that folder?).&nbsp; The Windows login App, Windows Session Manager and
 Windows Start-up App are listed below that folder but they aren't running.&nbsp; Windows Desktop Manager shows it's running...&nbsp; Otherwise, I have only a "desktop" picture, a few taskbar icons and not even a power off icon.</p>

            <p>I'm always in tablet mode, since I'm using a tablet!&nbsp; I've had to refresh my machine eight times since switching to Win10, had to totally reset once.&nbsp; Thank goodness I have two other (desktop) machines, both loaded with Win7, because there's no way to get
 info when your Win10 crashes, or when the system&nbsp;"misplaces" the desktop and taskbar&nbsp;icons unless you have another computer!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone back to my Win7 machines for all important work.&nbsp; Now using the tablet only for playing "casual games."&nbsp; The graphics on these games (all MS games, BTW) is jerky and frustrating,&nbsp;and about half the time, the game locks up on me and I have to close
 it.&nbsp; After closing a "frozen" game, I'm careful to&nbsp;login to IE once before shutting down the tablet. I found that when I shut down&nbsp;immediately after closing a frozen game of Solitaire, Sudoku, etc., the desktop icons disappear.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely NOT a system for gaming, either, unless perhaps you own an MS tablet.&nbsp; I also don't like that every other day or so, I'm asked to update my MS info.&nbsp; ARRGHH!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Horrible, horrible OS and my last MS system.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow these steps and check if it helps</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Insert the Windows Vista System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot.<br />
b) Select the correct keyboard input method and click ‘Next’.<br />
Note: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the display.<br />
c) The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that “Windows found problems with your computer’s startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?”<br />
d) Click ‘Repair and restart’ and reboot again to the Windows Vista System Repair environment.<br />
e) Click ‘Next’ at the keyboard selection prompt and when the ‘System Recovery Options’ screen appears verify that the “Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows” is selected.<br />
Note that on your Dual Boot system there now should be only one operating system listed. Click the ‘Next’ button.<br />
f) Now from the menu list select the ‘Command Prompt’ option.<br />
g) At the DOS prompt type the following three commands:<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixmbr<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixboot (may return an 'Eliment not found' message)<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /RebuildBcd<br />
h) Close the command prompt window and click the ‘Startup Repair’ option.<br />
i) The repair process may take some time, so wait until the process completes</div>

    <title>Windows 7 Backup is working, but does not show up in Backup and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timf87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Backup is working, but does not show up in Backup and Restore panel</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Pro and have had a backup running to a network drive for a couple of years now. &nbsp;Up to this point it has worked fine. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, my wife asked me to reschedule this off hours and I went directly to the task scheduler and just updated the schedule there. &nbsp;I have also had to modify the scheduled task to wake my laptop up to perform the backup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, after making these changes, I can see in the event log that the backup kicked off at the correct time (1:00 AM) and that it completed successfully 30 minutes later. &nbsp;I can also see on my network drive that it backed up at the right time and the registry
 keys show the right network location. &nbsp;However, when I go to the Backup and Restore panel, it tells me "Windows backup has not been setup" (which previously it would show me the network location and the last backup time and the next scheduled backup time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know the backups are still viable as I can point a restore to the correct network location and it properly shows me that I have backups on that drive. &nbsp;So, any ideas why the backup and restore screen is now showing me that no backup has been setup? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am a little concerned that making the change to the schedule has whacked a key somewhere that the backup and restore screen is using and that eventually the backups will fail and I won't notice unless I am constantly reviewing the event logs (which for
 home use just isn't that practical to me).</div>

            Alright, try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Open Device Manager by running devmgmt.msc command.
<br />
<br />2. In the Device Manager window, click Action &gt; Add legacy hardware.
<br />
<br />3. Then in Welcome to the Add Hardware Wizard screen, click Next.
<br />
<br />4. Moving on, select Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced) option. Click Next.
<br />
<br />5. Then select the drive category (in your case, it may be display adapter) and look out for the "Microsoft basic display adapter" or the basic drive you want to install.
<br />
<br />6. Once you found the driver, proceed installing it as legacy hardware.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Hello,
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

            Hi SUBHENDU
<br />
<br />Your PC should not be running on the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter, that is only meant to be used when installing Windows. If your system was using that, then you basically did not have a video card device driver loaded
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC/Laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<p><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try to start your computer in safe mode with Networking and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode with
 Networking place the computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit program running in the background creating this.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.

            Hi Bejay
<br />
<br />You will not need an Internet Connection when resetting Windows
<br />
<br />A Reset will roll Windows back to the last major upgrade that your PC received
<br />
<br />Say your PC originally cane with version 1703 and you subsequently upgraded to 1709 and then 803, a Reset will put your system into its original state on version 1803, it will not revert to 1703

<h2>            Remove a product key from my Microsoft account</h2>
                    I am returning a tablet PC and would like to disassociate the product key from my account so that the next person who gets this device can activate it. How can I do this?

<p>Probably can delete it as a device&nbsp;from your account.microsoft.com too.</p>
