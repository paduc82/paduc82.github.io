</p>
<p>The server is an internal Exchange server at the company where I work and it's managed by my IT colleagues (but they are generally not very Mac friendly, so if it's only Outlook on the Mac that has the issue it won't get much attention I'm afraid).</p>

<p>Been having same problem on all my computers on the network so every computer reports to server of critical errors! Because windows 10 does not allow you to skip updates this is very annoying and has the tendency to make you not check the errors on the server
 because they are so numerous. &nbsp; The computers also have third party anti-virus software (Ad-Aware pro) installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also noted is that Windows Defender is in the stopped state and will not start throws error code 577 Windows cannot verify digital signature..... recent hardware change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly ...or malicious software from
 unknown source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please supply &nbsp;a fix or allow users to decline windows updates!</p>

<p>Unless you can find it via a google search then it isn't possible. It's very rare that symbian based devices can be made to natively run other operating systems.<br />
<br />
Any talk of hacking is against the rules of this forum. If you want to go down that road you'll have to find an unofficial forum. There's plenty of them out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you should consider a more modern model such as the N900?</p>

<p>I think E90 is dead and burried, and nobody is developing anything for it anymore. The hardware is, in deed, very good, even for today's standards, but the software was a disaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you should look at Motorola Milestone or the rumored HTC Vision for a Communicator replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: N900 is also a dead-end, an experiment with no future.</p>

<h3> hdias  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page Numbering and using INSERT&#47;OBJECT&#47;TEXT FROM FILE</h2>
                    <p>I maintain many documents that all have their own unique headers/footers and page numbers etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to figuer out how I can use the "Intert/Object/Text from File feature to "stack" documents at the end of a document package without the Headers/footers/page numbering and sometimes formating t all getting messed up.&nbsp; For example I have 10 individual
 documents.&nbsp; Each has their own unique page numbers (i.e. Page 1 of 10, Page 1 of 2, Page 1 of 15 etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How&nbsp;do I setup my documents so when I use the <strong>insert text from file feature</strong> at the end of a document, I can sucessfully insert another document and they will all retain their unique page numbers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does each individule document have to begin and end with to make it work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated....its been quite a struggle with this....</p>

<p>hi!</p>
<p>i have a laptop with w7 and office 2013 and office365 enterprice account with sharepoint online. &nbsp;in explorer i have created a number of favorite links and a mapped network drive to sharepoint. i am automatically logged in to sharepoint when i start ie 11.
 i have also added various site url:s to local intranet and trusted sites. i have admin rights to our team site and to my computer.</p>
<p>now to the problem: in the morning when i've logged in to my computer, i start explorer and click the mapped network drive to access sharepoint. this works fine. then i also access sharepoint via ie to do some other type of work via the browser. i am automatically
 logged in once i start ie. the mapped network drive to sharepoint still works fine. but as soon as i start outlook, the mapped network drive and all the favorite links stop working and i get the following message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdc650ac-e9cc-4b01-8648-e7600b672021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdc650ac-e9cc-4b01-8648-e7600b672021" /></a></p>
<p>after this i close outlook, but the linkes etc still don't work. i close explorer and ie, i start ie first and explorer then and the links works. but again, when i start outlook, the connection is lost.</p>
<p>i have reseted the ie settings, removed other users office365 local accounts from my computer, cleaned the credentials etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i know that one can use open via explorer to reactive the links in explorer but i find it completely unnecessary step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>could my problem depend on my user account settings in ad? is there anything i can do in outloook except removing my profile and creating a new one, which i have also tested to get rid of the problem?</p>

<p>Hi Heli,<br />
<br />
I understand that you have already tried to create a new Outlook profile, and the issue disappears.<br />
<br />
To further look into the issue, please confirm the following information:<br />
1. When the network drive works normally, open Outlook in safe mode. Presss <strong>
Win + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window, then type <em>Outlook /safe</em> and enter.<br />
2. Start Outlook first, and then open your network drive.<br />
3. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2616712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check the status of the WebClient service</a>, when the connection is lost.<br />
<br />
Let us know if there is any update or misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Spike!</p>
<p>Thanks for asking. It took a while before I could test because I wanted to test another thing at first. I had installed Harmon.ie which is a plug in to Outlook and I thought it may cause the problem. So, I uninstalled it, and the linkes started to work.
 I worked couple of days testing the links to be sure that it was not a temporary luck. Today, I tested installing Harmon.ie again and the links stopped working directly. I uninstalled again, the links did not work, I restarted Outlook, no luck, I restarted
 my laptop, no luck, so I removed my Outlook profile and created a new one, and the links started to work again. I have had contact with Harmon.ie support but they don't quite believe me that their product causes this. At the same time I have installed Harmon.ie
 in my second laptop with W10 etc. and have not problems at all. </p>

<p>I think everyone experiences the loss of connectivity you do, so I'm not sure harmon.ie is responsible. Authentication between SP and local environments is poorly designed and notoriously fickle. Msft has no clue how to fix it.</p>

<p>Hi Spike!</p>
<p>I find it important to find a solution to this problem since it pops up EVERY TIME I have Harmon.ie installed in my laptop with W7 and Office 2013. That's why I am glad you take time to help me. Perhaps the same solutions can be used in other similar kind
 of connectivity problems, not only related to Harmon.ie. And I have not found your two steps among the proposals on internet to solve this kind of problem.</p>
<p>The same connection problem occured also in my laptop with W10 and Office 2016 but it was solved with the first steps (Unenable Protected Mode, clean IE cache, add https://*.sharepoint.com). I have now enabled the protected mode and it still works.</p>
<p>In my other laptop with W7 and Office 2013 I didn't perform a clean boot but tested the two steps. I started by uninstalling Harmon.ie a couple of days ago. During these days I had NO PROBLEM at all with the links and mapped network drives.
</p>
<p>This morning I started testing. At first I made sure that all the links and mapped network drives in explorer worked in all kinds of situations; explorer opened only, then started also Outlook, and thirdly Sharepoint via IE with automatic login. No problems.
 Then I installed Harmon.ie. And the links and mapped network drives stopped working!
</p>
<p>Then I did the first step in your instructions; Unenabled Protected Mode and cleaned &nbsp;IE cache, https://*.sharepoint.com was already listed. I closed all programs, started explorer -&gt; links etc. not working, started IE and logged in to Sharepoint (+ keep
 me signed in) -&gt; the links etc. started working, started Outlook (now Harmon.ie installed) -&gt; links etc. stopped working, closed all programs, started explorer -&gt; links not working, started Sharepoint -&gt; links worked, started Outlook &gt; links stopped working.
</p>
<p>So, my conclusion was that the first step didn't solve the problem. Time to test the second step. And it works! I had not checked the "Connect using different credential", only the "Reconnect at sign-in" when I mapped the netword drives the first time.</p>
<p>I also tested the second step in my laptop with W10 but it is set-up differently why there is no need for it. The first steps solved the problem as it seems. Remains to see after couple of days.
</p>
<p>I don't jump high yet but I want to wait and see what happens the following days to be sure. I'll let you know.</p>
<p>I will also test the steps if and when my colleagues face connectivity problems and I'll let you know.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Heli</p>

            I understand COMPLETELY and i will make this so easy and i cant believe that more effort was wasted telling you to go someplace else instead all they had to say is, This is Microsoft and they have Windows OS, Googleplay is an Android based program, Or
 app but none the less I have have to Log into my Google account or Gmail and then from the Google Browsers you should be able to download from there but I still am learning what I can get to work with my windows from there. Its funny cause I just thought about,
 I'm on a laptop and not android, but I do have a tablet with windows 10 and it is also a android. I hope this helps some, and I'm still working on learning also.&nbsp;

<h2>            Force Updating to 9926&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I currently run 9879 as my build, havent had any issues with it at all. They released 9926 and updated me to it, for some reason it was really buggy on my computer, I did not like it and wasnt able to run a variety of the programs I like, so I reverted back.
 Every day or so, I keep getting the notice that Windows needs to update several things, and that it will restart in 15 minutes or whatever time I choose. There is no option to opt out of the updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been letting it update and reverting back everytime it does this and it is getting pretty annoying. Is there any way to fix this force update or am I to be subjected to a technological Prometheus fate?

            <p>Yes, you agreed to forced upgrades when you signed up to join the preview.&nbsp; If you don't agree to those terms of service, you should stop using the preview immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They want everyone on the latest so they can continue collecting telemetry data and continue building forward.&nbsp; They don't want you to stop say "nah I like this one, I'll use it forever".&nbsp; That's now how a beta process works.</p>

    <title>Word&#58; automatic double space after a paragraph or numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lvuy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word&#58;  automatic double space after a paragraph or numbering</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word for MAC:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you get double space automatically after a paragraph?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar question to have double space after a bullet point or numbering?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to manually do it by using <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Layout:</span></strong> &nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">spacing</span></strong> and choose
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span></strong> and put in the number of lines that I want to have in between paragraphs or bullet points or numbering. &nbsp;But when I hit return after the paragraph or bullet points or numberings, I could
 not get the double spacing, even doing it manually by putting in 6 or 12, it has no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help with the above. &nbsp;Thanks1</p>

            <p>The best [IMO] method is to modify the <em>Paragraph Style</em> being used to include the desired additional amount of
<strong>Space After</strong>, but that's measured in <em>points</em>, not <em>lines</em>. Space Before/After is added to whatever is called for by the line spacing used in the paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Line spacing does not pertain only to spacing between paragraphs. It pertains to the line spacing (i.e.,
<em>leading</em>) within the paragraph as well &amp; varies based on font size. The rule of thumb is that Single line spacing = 120% of the font size, so: 1.5 Line = 180%: Dbl = 240%, etc., but that formula doesn't hold true for every font.<br />
</p>
<p>If your Spacing Before/After values are not being honored in the Ribbon, Format Paragraph dialog or Paragraph Style we'll need more info to explore it further. First, make sure your installation of Office 2016 is fully updated [15.18 was just released] &amp;
 do the same for your version of OS X.</p>

<h3> lebin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com people not appearing</h2>
                    <p>When I click on People on Outlook.com in my browser, there are only several contacts listed of my full list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I search on the People page for a contact, the entry is found and shown below the search box, but when I then click on the contact the search result is empty... Also when I want to send an e-mail in Outlook.com the "missing" contacts are found
 and I can send easily an e-mail to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the solution proposed in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/opeople-ocontacts/contacts-not-appearing-in-people-page-outlookcom/33317e41-0228-45ce-be5c-2ffc2cdd84ae">
this question</a>, but the gearwheel button in the People hub in the new Outlook.com doesn't show an option for filtering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked in my application Outlook 2007 and there I have to seach in "all contact items" before I can find the "missing" contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue (Office 365 version 1704 build 8067.2115 Click-to-Run) - and I've also tried to repair the install to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a search form using "+ More" and it works fine except that when I click "Close Search" then open it again, the "From" field is still populated from the previous search and I cannot delete the content using either the delete key, backspace key
 or right mouse button context menu. &nbsp;The only way to proceed is to remove the "From" field from the search form and then add it back. &nbsp;Please see the attached screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a7596db-9f2b-4f29-82f7-55e9b7e52e81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4a7596db-9f2b-4f29-82f7-55e9b7e52e81" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you confirm that you can't replicate the issue so that I know that it's specific to my (and Graham van Wyk's) setup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

<h2>            Embedded Excel Table in Word 2016 Not Showing All Borders</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to link an Excel chart in Word 2016. I copied and pasted the chart in Word as a linked&nbsp;Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object. In the Excel file, my totals column is double underlined however, when linked in Word, the double underlines do not show.
 See the example below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The 150 should have a double underline but does not. I think this is just a formatting issue but am not sure how to fix it. Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

                    <p>I have created an email signature in Outlook for Mac by copying my PC Outlook signature from an email.</p>

    <title>Backup not retaining data&#58; How to combine OneDrive backups for an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wpdiehard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup not retaining data&#58;  How to combine OneDrive backups for an associated device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 950 XL has a backup, but it is not retaining any data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to either combine OneDrive backups, or change the associated device's MAC address within an older backup so my device can be restored from it.&nbsp; Here's why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cliffnotes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Damaged device&nbsp;replaced May 2017</p>
<p>Replacement would not restore most content</p>
<p>Device had an audio issue, was sent back twice and was factory reset both times</p>
<p>Both times still did not restore most content</p>
<p>Device still had audio issue - mainboard was replaced, this time no data restored</p>
<p>Backup has existed the whole time, date always current</p>
<p>Lost all texts on 23 November 2017, this is now as far back as they go</p>
<p>Found my data still exists in a backup from 9 May 2017 after downloading backed up texts with WP Message Backup</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Long version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My (auto) backup settings have been "On" for years, and has worked flawlessly 'til now.&nbsp; Had Microsoft/Nokia's since Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, never had an issue recovering data.&nbsp; Everything's kept updated and has been regularly power cycled.&nbsp;&nbsp; After my damaged
 Lumia 950 XL was completely replaced back in May 2017, I found my text messages, and some of my settings weren't restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it back to the store to resolve an audio issue it had.&nbsp;&nbsp;They returned it, factory reset.&nbsp; This time when restoring,&nbsp;not only were all texts missing, but now most settings and my app icons were in their darkened state, but were not downloading&nbsp;- I
 had to do this manually.&nbsp; &nbsp; The audio issue had not been resolved, so I returned it to the store again.&nbsp; Again factory reset, and again restored data from my backup, but this time all texts, alarms, most settings, most ringtones&nbsp;and apps were not restored,
 and I could not access my Start Screen yet as there was nothing in it.&nbsp; The backup is there (can see it in OneDrive), but it does not restore everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the audio issue still unresolved,&nbsp;I returned it to the store a third time.&nbsp; This time the mainboard had been replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before attempting another restore, I noticed that a new backup had already been made, which would have backed up almost nothing as
 there were little settings remaining in place on the device; no alarms and no text messages, so I did not want to use that backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set everything up manually, including alarms and re-linking all my contacts, but was still missing my texts.&nbsp; All texts from then on stored on the phone, 'til 23 November 2017 when they disappeared.&nbsp; I've since downloaded the WP Message Backup app, which
 accesses all texts from your backup, and can see everything from before 9 May 2017.&nbsp; This is the part of the data I can't restore, and is proof of its existence.&nbsp; I believe if this can be made an available restore point, I will have my data back, albeit missing
 everything from that date, hence my question regarding combining backups.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate all the information you provided. However, you may need to reset your phone again, and select the one that contains your old text messages and settings from your backups. See the following links for instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

    <title>Unable to get correct orientation of photos in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to get correct orientation of photos in Outlook.com</h2>
                    When I attach a photo to an outlook.com message, the attached photo has incorrect orientation.&nbsp; When I view the phot that is on my hard drive&nbsp; via the Photos app on Windows 10 the photo has the correct orientation.&nbsp; How can I fix this?

            When you took the picture, did you hold the iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation? What I think may be happening is you took the photo in landscape orientation and the web browsers and picture viewers you are using examine the orientation metadata
 embedded in the JPEG and rotate the picture, but that Outlook, which is not a picture viewer, is not using the orientation metadata and so it showing the photo in the original orientation.

<h3> tomhoosier  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Address Book in Outlook 2010 - doesn&#39;t show my Contacts</h2>
                    In newly installed Outlook 2010, using Windows 7, everything transferred perfectly. My emails, files, accounts, and contacts are all in Office and Outlook 2010. However, my<strong>Contacts do not appear in my address book</strong> - in fact there are no
 address books. I used this article KB287563 and did everything it said. Yet when I get to Step 3 Outlook will not let me 'click to select the "Show this folder as an e-mail address book' check box. It is grayed out. We are using Windows 7 Ultimate, Office
 2010. So frustrating - every new email I have to go to Contacts and cut and paste the address. When I hit the "TO:" or CC: nothing comes up. Tried MS support but my PID number wasn't recognized (why not?). Do I need to pay to get help to fix this? Any advice
 would be so much appreciated. I've tried to change the properties of the contacts folder but same issue - check box not available. Thanks so much!

                    I have uploaded a Word (2003) manuscript to Create Space half a dozen times, but the Interior Reviewer keeps saying that my fonts aren't embedded.&nbsp; I have verified that the correct boxes are checked and unchecked in the Options menu.&nbsp; The fonts are TrueType
 fonts (Adamsky and Accord), but I'm not certain that they are embeddable, because I don't know how to confirm that.&nbsp; Does anyone have an educated guess as to why this is happening?<br />

            Go to <strong>Start | Control Panel | Fonts</strong>. Select the font in question, right-click, and choose
<strong>Properties</strong>. By default the Properties probably have no information on embedding, but you can download the Font Properties Extension from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/FreeToolsOverview.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/typography/FreeToolsOverview.mspx</a>. This extends the font Properties dialog so that it has an Embedding tab that will tell you what level of embedding is allowed.
