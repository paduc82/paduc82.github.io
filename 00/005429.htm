    <title>How can I pin folders &#40;not just documents&#41; in Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I pin folders &#40;not just documents&#41; in Office 2016 &#40;as I did in previous Office versions&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just allowed Microsoft's "Office Update" to update my system from Office 2015 to Office 2016.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the new 2016 version is installed (and I am quickly feeling that it was a mistake to allow the update), it reset many of my preferences back to "Out Of Box" defaults.&nbsp; It also wiped away the favorite documents and folders I had pinned to my Favorite
 places / Recent places menus.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to locate, open and re-pin the favorite documents.&nbsp; However, I cannot find a way to re-pin the favorite folders.&nbsp; The only answers I find point to cloud-based solutions - which is not what I wish to do, and will not accept. I wish to directly
 pin local folders.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for "Help" both within Office, as well as Web searches, I cannot find instructions detailing how to re-pin folders I access frequently.&nbsp; (I do find many complaints, which indicate I am not the only user with this question.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I pin folders &amp; subdirectories to my Favorite Places / Recent Places menus?</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion, but unfortunately no, I am not looking for Windows Explorer Favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very specifically wish to re-pin a folder (e.g.: "C:\MyBiz".&nbsp; This would be a folder that I created that is local to my system and always available - not from any removable media where mapping would be lost at the end of a session or workday.)&nbsp; I had such
 locations pinned previously, but cannot find ways to restore them since the 2016 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the 2016 update, the "This PC" option only shows "Documents" (actually pointing to C:\Users\<em>myLogonId</em>\Documents\) and the up-arrow next to it is ineffective.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The "Add A Place" option only offers "Office 365 SharePoint" and "OneDrive" - again, choices I do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Browse" option allows me to find the folder(s) that I wish to access, but leaves no trail for pinning in the "Recent" tab (other than any specific file I select within that folder, which would result in too many pins and would quickly become counter-productive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I am specifically looking for a way to pin <em><strong>folders</strong></em> (not just
<em><strong>files</strong></em>) to the "Recent" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I have exactly the same complaint.&nbsp; Seems as though Microsoft removed this ability in Office 2016 and was available in Office 2013.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a screenshot from PowerPoint 2013.&nbsp; You will notice that it has a option to pin a recent folder.&nbsp; Office 2016 only allows pinning of files and not folders.&nbsp;

Pinned folders are just as important to "Home" users as they are to enterprise users. The fact that Microsoft has removed this feature is intolerable, in all cases.<br />

</p><p>Indeed, it's only back for the feature I use (save as). I don't use "open" nor the quick access toolbar, and I can't say how they behaved before.</p>

 8.1".&nbsp; but by mistake I clicked on 8.1 and now system back to 8.1. How I can again go back to OS 10 TP?. either I have to download again or any other method as already OS 10 TP available in system.</p>

            <p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

<h2>            Cannot Access My Skype Account</h2>
                    <p>I tried to sign in to my Skype account on two different computers, in both cases the login kicked back that Microsoft had no record of any such user. I've used the account for years, so obviously there is something wrong. I have no notification of my account
 being canceled either, I had money for calls and my contacts that I now cannot access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to create a new Microsoft account hoping it would see I already have a Skype account, the email I used to make a new Microsoft account is the same as the one I used for the old account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to access my old account. The new account is not too useful, it doesn't have my contacts and any messages nor the unused credit I still should have.</p>

<h2>            How to send mass emails with separate attachments</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a way to send emails to several different contacts, but each contact receives different files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example; Files 1, 3, 5, 6 are Excel workbooks, Files 2,4,6,8 are PDFs. Not every client is getting an Excel/PDF, some may get an Excel, some may get just a PDF, this is just a basic example to set the scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John Doe 1 - File 1/File 2</p>
<p>John Doe 2 - File 3/File 4</p>
<p>John Doe 3 - File 5/File 6</p>
<p>John Doe 4 - File 6/File 8</p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I am going to new email, selecting the contact, then attaching the files manually. Since I have over 150+ contacts to do this for, the manual option takes a minimum of a day and a half (granted I have other things to do in between).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to do this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I access outlook through Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if 'not possible' is a probably answer, considering I've heard there is a thing called 'mail merge toolkit' that does something similiar to what i'm requesting.....</p>

    <title>Setting default from address in Outlook 2016 with Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucylucy123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting default from address in Outlook 2016 with Exchange</h2>
                    <p>Since the change to Outlook.com and migration to Exchange from EAS, Outlook 2016 no longer uses the 'connected account' set up in Outlook.com for sending.&nbsp; Outlook.com, however, is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go back and set up Outlook 2016 manually with s.outlook.com, i.e. the EAS server, then it automatically sends from the address configured in Outlook.com, but Microsoft sent a final reminder to tell me to use the new exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, I tried to set up a default 'from' address in outlook 2016, but this is not enabled when using Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was raised here: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/1c6ba812-fa2d-4d38-bbf3-f5fb9f0aa906/in-outlook-2016-cannot-set-default-from-address-since-transition-to-exchange?forum=Office2016ITPro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/1c6ba812-fa2d-4d38-bbf3-f5fb9f0aa906/in-outlook-2016-cannot-set-default-from-address-since-transition-to-exchange?forum=Office2016ITPro</a> but Winnie Liang (Moderator), being very honest about it,
 recognised that this was indeed a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, three questions:</p>
<p>1. Why does Outlook 2016 not reply in the same way as Outlook.com using the connected account and when will this be fixed?</p>
<p>2. When will there be an update to Outlook 2016 to allow me to set a default 'from' address?</p>
<p>3. Is there a registry hack that can be used as a workaround to set a default 'from' address for Outlook 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>I cannot answer msn questions.</p>
<p>As to your hotmail.......</p>
<p>A) if you sign in to outlook.com with your HOTMAIL address and password, them here is simple way to switch back to Hotmail :</p>
<p>open outlook.com &gt; top right next to your name, click the Gear icon &gt; select Switch back to Hotmail &gt; click Skip &gt; you will be directed back to your HotmaiL account.</p>
<p>Just one thing : Microsoft has changed your hotmail.com contact list to a new interfae. It is now called PEOPLE.</p>
<p>If you have problem using it, please post back with specufic questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) if the above does not work for you, have a look at this answer given by Dan T, forum moderator.</p>

<h2>            How do I consolidate&#47;merge two Outlook 2003 pst files</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to consolidate/merge an old and new pst file in Outlook 2003 under Vista. I saw some older posts but the instructions were sketchy. Also I tried to locate my pst files via selecting properites under Personal Folders and advanced and it showed an
 address but the App Data folder it showed did not display when I opened the folder. This was the path:&nbsp;C:\Users\My Name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\Outlook.pst. I tried to see if somehow all folders were not being displayed under properites but I could
 not find anything. Any ideas about how to find that App DAta folder?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks, God bless,</div>
<div>Van</div>

            <p><span>What is the size of PST file that you are trying to merge?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The folder might be hidden hence you are unable to view the app-data folder. Follow the steps mentioned below to enable the hidden files
 and folders:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Start</b>&lt; <b>Computer</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Organize</b>&lt;<b>Folder and Search Option</b>&lt; <b>View</b>&lt; check the option <b>
Show Hidden Files and Folders</b> and uncheck the option <b>Hide Extension for Known File Types</b> and click
<b>Ok</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now try to browse to the outlook data file location and check if you are able to view the PST file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To merge the PST file, you may import the data from one PST file to another. You may refer the link mentioned below to import the PST file in Outlook
 2003:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/import-a-file-HP003073738.aspx#_Toc278198847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/import-a-file-HP003073738.aspx#_Toc278198847</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also open both the PST files in Outlook and drag and drop the data from one PST file to another:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below to open the PST files in Outlook:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Outlook.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>File</b>&lt; <b>Open</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Browse to the location where the PST files, highlight it and click
<b>Open</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once the PST file is open in Outlook drag and drop the data from one PST file to another.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Ensure you have a backup of the PST file in case something goes wrong.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To take the backup you may just copy and save the PST files in any other location in the system.</span></p>

    <title>calendar freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            calendar freezing</h2>
                    Hi, I have Outlook 365 running on Windows 10. Today whenever I tried to access my Calendar screen I'd get a green dotted circle whirling in the middle of the calendar screen, and if I attempted to open anything Outlook would freeze and I'd have to force
 a restart. Hours later, I don't even get the courtesy of a green spinning circle - just a completely frozen app if I try to open any calendar item. What gives?

<p>Hi B Bohn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, there are different attachment limits between mail providers,<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">
</span>for example, if you are an Office 365 for business user, the default attachment size limits is 150MB for Outlook client, 35MB for Outlook Web App.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know which mailbox you are using? What is the size of the attachment you are going to send?</p>
<p>And please provide the <em>Non-delivery Report.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to send large files with Outlook, you can refer to the methods in the link below:</p>

<p>Hi B Bohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the error message we can learn that it is your message exceeds the message size limits, not the attachment size limits.
</p>
<p>You need to contact your admin to configure message size limits for your mailbox in the Exchange Admin Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And have tried using another account to send this email to the recipient? Can the message be sent?</p>

<p>The message size of Exchange online cannot be increased. Exchange online message limits is 150MB for Outlook client, so&nbsp;theoretically your message about 20MB can be sent.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It looks like you have changed your community account, I sent the private message to your first account, so you may not see it with your new account.</p>

</p><p>After our research on your NDR, after you have already tried sending with another account to the same recipient, and the message can’t be sent too, this may be the recipient side block, you need to contact recipient to check his message receiving maximum

    <title>Selecting cell in filtered list with a Macro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Selecting cell in filtered list with a Macro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have written a macro which amongst other things filters a list. Once the list has been filtered I want to select the resulting range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you do this normally you can just select the first cell at the top of the list. Say we do this by&nbsp;selecting the header row A1 and the pressing the down arrow once. This selects the first cell I need say A500.&nbsp;When I record this it immediately tells
 me the exact range I have selected, A500. However, in the macro I don't know it is A500.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I determine which row the first item I want to select is? The MATCH formula will tell me the row number but I can't get that formula to work in conjunction with the macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            <p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if this is entirely what you want but feel free to get back to me if not.</p>
<p>The following example assigns the visible data to a range variable and then copies the visible data and pastes it to another worksheet.</p>
<p>Sub CopyFilteredData()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngFilt As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Sheets("Sheet1").AutoFilter.Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFilt = .Offset(1, 0) _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Resize(.Rows.Count - 1) _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rngFilt.Copy Destination:=Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1")<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>A space and an underscore at the end of a line is a line break in an otherwise single line of code.</p>
<p>Sheets("Sheet1").AutoFilter.Range&nbsp; is the entire AutoFiltered range (Includes both visible and non visible rows)</p>
<p>&nbsp;.Offset(1, 0)&nbsp; &nbsp;moves down one row off the column headers but now includes an extra row at the bottom. (Still includes visible and non visible.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;.Resize(.Rows.Count - 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; removes extra row off bottom created by Offset. (Still includes visible and non visible)</p>
<p>&nbsp;.Cells.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restricts to visible cells only.<br />
</p>
<p>Note: You cannot iterate through rows in filtered data because it will stop at the first non contiguous row. If you need to do this then please get back to me with an explanation of what you want to do because there is a work around.</p>
<p><strong>Following added with Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Not really sure what you mean by "Once the list has been filtered I want to select the resulting range". I thought you meant the entire filtered visible cells. Further down in your post you seem to be referring to an individual cell which is the first cell
 of the&nbsp;visible data.</p>
<p>You could replace the Copy/Destination line with the following line&nbsp;to select all of the visible data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rngFilt.Select</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you could use the following to select just the first cell of the visible data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rngFilt.Cells(1, 1).Select</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over to you Rick and like I said before, fell free to get back to me.</p>

<h2>            Excel - Sorting Part Numbers &#40;Ascii Format&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I want to sort a column with inventory part numbers. &nbsp;Our part numbering system is based on each digit (not value), I think it's ascii. &nbsp;So part #71 should come after part #100000. &nbsp;And part #20 would come after #100 In other words, I don't want it to sort
 based on value. &nbsp;It should sort based on the 1st digit, then on the 2nd, then on the 3rd and so on. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure this is a standard part numbering system but can't find a way to easily sort it. &nbsp;Note: Our part numbers are different lengths and some do
 contain letters. &nbsp;</p>

            Make sure that all values are text, even if they consist of digits only. You can do this by formatting the column as text, or by prefixing the values with an apostrophe (single straight quote). The values should then sort the way you want.

<h3> bazza103  say:</h3>
<h2>            cipher strength 0</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>IE8 Windows7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a laptop with a problem. I cannot log in to HTTPS secure sites. After hours of searching for help on this one I have discovered that the cipher strength is "0". I have not got a clue why or how this happened. My kids use the laptop and they download
 too much stuff including to my horror, "Norton security" which I am well aware is dodgy. I have disabled numerous add ons and 6 toolbars, I also uninstalled Norton, AVG, and another one which i forgot the name of. I reinstalled MSE (the best) in my opinion.
 I updated everything and scanned with MRT and MSE. No malicious software was discovered. So if someone could tell me how to get the 128 or 256 (as it appears on this laptop for some reason I'm unaware of) bit rate back, hopefully all will be up and running&nbsp;
 again.</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help on this.</p>

<p>Word does have a Calenedar "Tool" that displays a small calendar and allows you to pick dates on it when you are doing date entry.</p>
<p>BUT, we REALLY need to know the Word/Office version you are using.</p>
<p>Does it have menus or tabs?</p>
<p>If menu, look in Help / About / right at top it'll will tell you version, ie Microsoft Office Word 2003 (11.8328.8329) SP3</p>
<p>If Ribbon, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; is the first tab a blue "File" tab, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IF yes Word 2010, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ELSE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is there a big blobby 4 color Office Logo button,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if yes then Word 2007<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if No have your eyes checked because there are no other choices</p>
<p>OK for ribbon versions the "Right" way is to click on the 2007 Office button / Word Options / Resources option /&nbsp; version info is at the bottom of the pane</p>
<p>For 2010: File tab / Help option / in the right pane version info is displayed</p>

<p>I'm sure I posted an answer to this earlier.</p>
<p>There is a calendar tool in Word for data entry. Clicking on it displays a mini calendar that allows you to pick a date from. Is this what you are talking about?</p>
<p>The version of Word is very important in answering this question, please tell us which one you are using.</p>

<h2>            IoS &#34;Your Exchange credentials aren&#39;t valid try updating your exchange or Skype for Business Credentials.</h2>
                    
<p>i have a couple of iphones in our environment that are getting the following message.</p>
<p>"your exchange credentials aren't valid try updating your exchange or skype for business credentials."</p>
<p>the error does not go away even if i enter my exchange credentials manually.</p>

<p>the strange thing is i have installed ios lync 2010 and i can connect and also see all meetings that are taking place for the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0e7f62a-6689-496e-8cf1-9d3eaa23a862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0e7f62a-6689-496e-8cf1-9d3eaa23a862" /></a></p>

<p>the application has been uninstalled and reinstalled and the issue persist.</p>
<p>i want to say that it is a client issue but i have no way to fix it.</p>
<p>i found a post where someone had seen the same behavior on a ipad&nbsp; and they had solved the issue but there was no resolution.</p>
<p>the skype version is 6.2.0.24</p>
<p>the ios version is 9.2.1 </p>
<p>has anyone else seen this issue and is there a resolution posted?</p>

<p>It turns out this is a known issue, The following post happened yesterday.</p>
<p><a href="http://communicationsknowledge.blogspot.com/2016/02/skype-for-business-mobile-app-issues.html?m=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://communicationsknowledge.blogspot.com/2016/02/skype-for-business-mobile-app-issues.html?m=1</a></p>
<p>Issue 1: Unable to see meeting information on iPhone, iPad (iOS) and Android mobile devices using Skype for Business mobile app. This is known issue. For iOS 8.X, 9.0, 9.1 and 9.2.</p>
<p>Symptoms: When you click on meeting tab on Skype for Business app however meeting information will not show up. Most of time this issue occurs when user is on external network.</p>
<p>Mobile app log shows app trying reach only internal Exchange Web Services.</p>
<p>Resolution/Workaround:</p>
<p>This is known issue and Microsoft will be releasing bug fix soon. I don’t have ETA. Please don’t ask..</p>
<p>As a workaround users can click on meeting URL from calendar or meeting invite and join meetings. In case meeting join using fails or stuck in Safari browser then use workaround mentioned in issue 2.</p>

    <title>Request for error fix in Lunar calendar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Request for error fix in Lunar calendar</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Many Koreans are using Lunar calendar, especially for their parents birthdays and death anniversaries.&nbsp;<br />
I found Outlook Lunar calendar has error in converting my parents Lunar birthdays into Solar birthdays.&nbsp;<br />
1949-04-18 in Lunar should be 1949-05-15 in Solar, but Outlook converts it to 1949-05-29.&nbsp;<br />
I could confirm that I'm correct from the website of Korea Astronomy &amp; Space Science Institute. (KASI)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; * &nbsp;<a href="https://astro.kasi.re.kr:444/life/pageView/8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://astro.kasi.re.kr:444/life/pageView/8</a>&nbsp;<br />
KASI also provides OpenAPI to government bureau of public data&nbsp;<br />
so that other major service providers can reference this for providing calendar.&nbsp;<br />
(Only MS is servicng wrong Lunar calendar, not matching to this public data)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; * &nbsp;<a href="https://astro.kasi.re.kr:444/information/pageView/31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://astro.kasi.re.kr:444/information/pageView/31</a>&nbsp;<br />

<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">This is not a nice-to-have feature. This is a must-fix.&nbsp;<br />
We know the correct value, and there's no reason not to fix.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 44, 51, 1)">Hope MS take action on this bug soon. Thank you.</p>

<p>Sorry, but your reply is irrelevant to the error.</p>
<p>This is not a sync problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a problem of already added calendar.</p>
<p>I properly added Korean lunar calendar, but it is showing wrong dates.</p>
<p>Every other calendar service providers are correct, but MS Outlook is incorrect alone;</p>
<p>because Outlook is not using public data that Korean government is officially distributing.</p>
