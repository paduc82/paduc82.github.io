<h2>            Windows keeps chaning Driver Letter for Boot&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey i use Windows 10 64 Pro edition opdated until lastest since that disabled my usb drivers for keyboard and other wired stuff in windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost every 2nd time i reboot or had shutdown pc and start up...it comes blue screen with error ..then i found out when using win usb installer and starting advanced options "cmd" and in cmd enter "diskpart" -&gt; list Volume that my normal "D" driver is now
 C and my C is D.&nbsp; So that means windows cant find boot...i assign letters right and then sometimes it works but only if i reboot after changing letters and remove usb install . otherwise windows keeps starting to repair and then makes error and no usb works
 so i have to reboot manual . then when usb removed it can boot as normal.&nbsp; But sometimes it keeps to change letters back from C to D and D is C every time i boot. Also changes sometimes in bios the boot orders...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who can tell me why??? Somehow does windows change letters before i reboot ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked i do not have virus. I kinda a geek with father worked for ibm 40 years. but he is brain damaged now so cant help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a for C windows SDD samsung 250 gb sata 600 and D 950 gb normal sata 600 barracuda .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus sabertooth x58 motherboard (i maybe think that my motherboard has some loose connection problems with usb etc)</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The reason that your computer is not able to boot when a USB is plugged in is that boot order are set to boot from USB as a first option. Kindly change the boot order
 from BIOS (steps may differ depending on the manufacturer of the device). Set hard drive as first options and then USB/DVD.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The drive letter will change to default if the operating system is not installed on default drive i.e. C drive. So could you please confirm if you are using dual boot
 operating system? </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also as you mentioned that you are getting blue screen, I suggest you to upload the mini dump files from the location here, which will help us determine the exact
 cause of the issue. The dump files are located at: <strong>c:/windows /minidump</strong><br />
<br />
Copy the files and zip it and share it with us. To enable mini dump file:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.<br />
2. Double-click System.<br />
3. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Settings under Startup and Recovery.<br />
4. In the Write debugging information list, click Small memory dump (64k). </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile you can try the steps mentioned below:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open <strong>command prompt</strong> as administrator (you can type cmd in start menu and run it as administrator).
</span></li><li>
<span>Then type <strong>diskpart</strong> and press enter.
</span></li><li>
<span>The type: <strong>List Volume</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Then type: <strong>Select Volume n</strong> (where n is the letter assigned to a drive on which you have your operating system).
</span></li><li>
<span>Then type: <strong>Attributes Volume clear hidden</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Then restart your computer. </span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please reply so that we can help you better.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Skype is not releasing my camera after a call</h2>
                    <p>Hi Skype,&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I call, when I look at my Logitech webcam C270, I can see that most of the time the green light is still on.</p>
<p>To release the camera, I can go Tools &gt; Option &gt; Video Setting &gt; Cancel and it will release the camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI I also have Kaspersky Internet Security installed that monitors the use of the cam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using skype 7.40.0.103 on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Runtime broker uses too much memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a.feinberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runtime broker uses too much memory</h2>
                    <p>For some reason I notice that the Runtime Broker process takes up too much memory. Close to 300mb.&nbsp;Also I see two of them running now. I don't recall what I did but at this point its memory use slowly went down&nbsp; to about 15mb. The 2nd instance is taking
 about 1mb.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During high memory usage period the surface is not behaving properly.&nbsp; It does not react to clicking links for example. Clicking a link in Mail does not bring up ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you aware of this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I once killed that process and nothing bad happened.&nbsp; I cannot figure out what its for.</p>

            Runtimebroker.exe is basically in charge of metro permissions.&nbsp; If you have a bunch of metro apps running it will get larger.&nbsp; You cant kill the process because that would kill the metro apps.<br />

            <p>Yeah, I checked it out, but based on its behavior it looks like a runaway app can cause the runtime broker process to grow in size indefinitely affecting performance of the entire system.&nbsp;&nbsp; A leaky app should only leak its own memory, not the memory of another
 process.&nbsp; Bad design?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One must concede, however, that it's difficult to design an OS that can sustain an impact of a really badly behaving process.&nbsp; As I understand, the Store with its rigorous verification should be vetting these bad apples out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a feeling that Microsoft
 with its&nbsp;over-eagerness to populate the store is causing more long-term damage to the ecosystem by&nbsp;compromising on the quality of the apps it's letting&nbsp;through&nbsp;into the store. Yes they get many apps quickly, but bad apps tarnish reputation of the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for quick reply, BTW.</p>

            <p>Had to kill it again this morning.&nbsp; It was using 348mb of ram.&nbsp;App processes kept on running and a new runtime broker was launched using about 3mb.</p>

            From the Start screen type the word 'task'. Select Task Manager, then in the lower lefthand corner of Task Manager select 'More Options'. You should be able to track down the app causing the problem.

Can you get a clue as to the leaky app in App history?

            <p>I guess I am missing something.&nbsp; The app that's using to much memory is not, really, an app.&nbsp; It's a process called "Runtime Broker".&nbsp; This process is used by other apps.&nbsp; According to the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee">
ZigZag3143x</a>, the app memory grows with the number of apps used.&nbsp; But that's not the case.&nbsp; I notice that the process uses a lot of memory, unrelated to the number of apps in use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, as the memory usage grows beyond reasonable, to well over 200MB, the tablet performance and functionality suffer.&nbsp; Killing the process seems to restore the tablet to good state.&nbsp; But I think that's a wrong way to fix things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I started
 the thread.</p>

            I'm seeing this problem as well, although on an x86 instance of Windows 8 rather than a Surface.&nbsp; In my case, the Runtime Broker rose to 1.5 GB and the machine became unresponsive.&nbsp; Need some way to identify the offending application.&nbsp; Another thread has
 suggested this involves a Windows Store app not handling notifications but it's unclear to me what I can do to identify the bad app.&nbsp; Task Manager doesn't seem to provide a way to break out any detail here.<br />

I think that this occurs when more than one user is logged into the system.&nbsp; Keeping two users logged in overnight causes this problem in the morning.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I just tried switching from my user account to another one. That switch alone caused runtime broker to go up to 238.8mb. Microsoft please look into this urgently.</p>

            Uninstall clock apps if you have any. These apps are most prone to this fever. Hope Microsoft fixes it with an update.

            <p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The description suggests the issue could be of some missing files of any programs which could not got removed completely or might be of some missing corrupt files. I suggest you to p<span><span>erform<strong> SFC scan.</strong></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>System File Checker</strong> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You can follow the steps in the following article:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't helps. then I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform&nbsp;Start Up Repair.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a>
</p>
<p>(Refer to the section "<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool</span></a> " in the above article for creating the tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start your computer from the installation media. Insert&nbsp;the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to ‚ÄúPress any key to boot from DVD,‚Äù do so. If you don‚Äôt see the message, you might need to change
 the boot order in your computer's&nbsp;BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to&nbsp;start the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Start Up Repair'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Hope the information helps. Write to us if you need more information and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>

            Several users have been reporting issues with Excel 2003 running under Windows 10 1803. 
<br />
<br />Please rollback to your previous version or consider upgrading to the latest version of Excel for optimum compatibility.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Andre, </p>
<p>Thanks very much for your help. However rather than expend more time (and in my mind, risk) trying to roll back the update, I decided to go with an alternative, non-Microsoft office suite, which so far is working fine for my spreadsheet files. I have not
 lost any formatting or data that I've noticed. Microsoft rolled out an automatic update with features I'm not looking for, but which broke something (Excel) that I use all the time. Not my idea of good customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            Glad I didn't do the roll-back. Another update came along a couple of days ago, installed very quickly, and now Excel is working again. Oddly, update history reports that the update failed, but I guess I don't care.

<p>I had the same problem and fixed it by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open an existing spreadsheet.</p>
<p>2. Change the cell justification from left to right, or right to left.</p>
<p>3. Save the spreadsheet and close it.</p>
<p>4. Reopen the spreadsheet and change the cell justification back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually fixes the crashing problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>I would suggest you to open the ports in Windows Firewall and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open a port in Windows Firewall</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are not able to open the port in Windows Firewall or the steps don‚Äôt help in fixing the issue then, you might want to forward the ports 2077
 and 2078 in your router settings and check if it helps. You need to follow the instruction from the router‚Äôs user manual or get in touch with the router manufacturer for help with forwarding the ports.</span></p>

<h2>            Reinstall Windows 7 Without Product Key</h2>
                    <p>I bought a used laptop that has either a retail or upgrade&nbsp;version of Windows 7 installed (the OEM product key sticker is for the original OS, Vista). I'd like to reinstall, but I don't have the product key. I've tried tools like Magic Jelly Bean KeyFinder
 but they are unable to&nbsp;produce the key.</p>
<p>I've&nbsp;made an installation USB using the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. How can I reinstall?</p>

            If the key finder displays BBBB-BBBB-BBBB then its a volume license key. You will likely need to reinstall the original Windows Vista that came with the machine.

                    <p>I was asked to give them access to my computer because Microsoft had detected a serious virus coming from my computer that was infecting other computers.&nbsp; The call sounded suspect, like a sweatbox call centre with people who had East Indian accents.&nbsp; I asked
 for their telephone number to prove they were from Microsoft and I was given 16143889092 when I called them back it didn't sound like a professional service.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to the fact that the COM ports are being used by some other process or devices. This normally depends on the driver. Some drivers allow you to edit the COM port number assigned by going into the device properties in device manager and using
 one of the properties pages to specify <br />
the COM port number.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Let‚Äôs check if the devices using the COM ports are hidden and <br />
</strong></p>
<div><strong>check if it helps to find the other ports as well.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the steps:</strong></p>
<div><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <strong>cmd </strong>on the Start screen and right click on Command Prompt.
<strong>Select Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
<strong>b)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ‚Äú<strong>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices</strong>=1‚Ä≥ without the quotes.&nbsp; Hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>c)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ‚Äústart <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>‚Äù without quotes and hit Enter.<br />
<strong>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Select ‚Äú<strong>Show hidden devices</strong>‚Äù under View menu. Now if you expand the section on COM ports, all the COM ports that have ever been created will be displayed, the non-present ones being in grey. You can uninstall anything
 that you don‚Äôt want<strong> (right click on each device icon and select uninstall).<br />
</strong></div>
<div>If they're not listed in the device manager, you can try these suggestions to see what‚Äôs preventing the ports from getting displayed in device manager.</div>

    <title>Code 31 across multiple devices in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Code 31 across multiple devices in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
Several months ago I bought the Samsung NP355V5C, and as many suggest did a wipe of the system to remove all the bloatware that was pre-installed on the system.<br />
<br />
However after doing so the device drivers for WAN Miniport (IP), WAN Miniport (IPv6), WAN Miniport (Network Monitor) and an 'unknown device' which is the bluetooth driver (Qualcomm Atheros AR3012 Bluetooth 4.0) have the yellow exclamation symbol and all have
 "code 31" in device manager.<br />
<br />
While unable to do anything about the WAN miniport's as I am unable to uninstall or update them I have tried updating the bluetooth both manually, through device manager, SW update (Samsung program I reinstalled to try fix driver problems) and windows update.
 None of these methods work and I either get told access is denied or the installation has failed. I have tried uninstalling the device first and it either pops straight back up in device manager or the installation still fails.<br />
<br />
On top of all this my wireless connection occasionally just drops out even when using different internet connections so I can only assume that is to do with the driver issues and not sure whether the aforementioned issues are causing this. Again I have tried
 reinstalling the network adapter the Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG and it has made no difference.
<br />
<br />
Any help or advice would be appreciated as Samsung's support is useless and they don't even have Windows 8 drivers on their site.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            Hi thanks for the help,<br />
<br />
I've tried doing this with the bluetooth drivers but despite changing the compatibility mode to windows 7 it still states there are compatibility issues.<br />
<br />
On top of this I don't really know what the WAN drivers really are and as such am unsure exactly where I would find them other than possibility the Wireless LAN or Qualcomm WLAN drivers so any other advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also tried method two every time it happens and it stays fixed for a few hours at most. I've tried it on two separate ISP's and have the same problem on both.<br />

<h2>            Media Center&#58; Any way to adjust recorder start time&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to record two shows back-to-back on different channels. The first one usually gets cut off at the end because of the start of the second program. I would prefer to delay starting to record the second program (<em>American Idol</em> ) in order to make
 sure I get all of the first program.</p>
<p>I see where I can adjust default start and stop time for all shows when there is no overlap. I also see where I can adjust the stop time for a specific show if there is no overlap. But I don't see a way to delay the start of a specific show.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi Cliffskier,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you extend a recording past its scheduled end time, it's a good idea to check for recording conflicts to make sure it won't conflict with other scheduled recordings during
 the extended period. If you only have one TV tuner, and a show is scheduled to record directly after an extended recording, you'll need to cancel one of the recordings.</span></p>

<h2>            Storage space filled with nothing</h2>
                    My C partition, which is an 120GB SSD has only 9 GB of space remaining. If i try to add up all the files, including the hidden ones, they sum up to about 75GB. The rest of the space is occupied by some mysterious creatures. The disk clean-up tool didnt
 help with anything. I tried to figure it out for some time already and i cant find a solution. Anyone with an idea?

            You can execute following to gain space on your computer
<br />
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Type Storage in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Storage &gt; Click Change how we free up space &gt; Down below there is button Clean now under Free up space now which you should press
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Type Disk Cleanup in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Disk Cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Analyze disk space
<br />You should analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one but my personal favorite is WinDirStat.
<br />
<br />TreeSize Freeware version - <a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />WinDirStat (Released under GPL license) - <a href="https://windirstat.net/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windirstat.net/download.html</a>
<br />
<br />4. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />5. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

<p>Thank you so much for your reply!</p>
<p>After using WinDirStat, i found out that the folder C:\Windows\Installer\&lt;Files&gt;&nbsp; has 37 GB. It takes 80% of the windows folder.</p>
<p>All other methods didnt solve anything. Is it normal for that folder to take up so much space?<br />

            Yes, it is normal though on my computer, it is 12GB. It all depends upon the apps and patches which have been installed. You should not delete anything from that folder. If you really want to create space there, uninstall some of the apps which you don't need.

            Hi DragosBarbuRo
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a tiny free utility canned Patch Cleaner, that was written by one of the developers over there, for this specific purpose .  .
<br />
<br />Run that, it will clean out the C:\Windows\Installer folder for you, removing all redundant entries and recovering a lot of hard drive space for you:

            With Windirstat, you can further drill down to see which folders and files are taking large space inside this folder.
<br />
<br />This folder is not supposed to be moved to another partition.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>It could be a driver/program installed by Creative, Logitech, or a company named Chicoy (no real<br />
information on it). Do you use any of those products? Right Click on the file - Properties - Details<br />
tab - is there any information that helps determine its origin?<br />
<br />
If you remove it from Startup does a device not work? Start - type in Search box&nbsp;-&gt; MSCONFIG<br />
find at top and double click on it - uncheck it in Startup tab - APPLY / OK - Reboot.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often<br />
easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove<br />
payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check<br />
with these to an extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very<br />
sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should<br />
also run&nbsp;them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

<p>Ever since I mounted an image file off of my external USB hard drive using Daemon Tools Lite, and accidentally removed the external hard drive before stopping the device, I have been getting this error whenever opening ANY program, when the screen saver
 starts up, or anything involving the hard drive.<br />
<br />
I have tried disconnecting the removable hard drive and I have uninstalled Daemon Tools Lite, but I still get the error. It happens all the time and my programs still work, but Windows Vista gives me this error before actually loading the program. When I start
 up the computer with the external hard drive connected, I get a Blue Screen stating that it can not find "drive\device\harddisk 4\dr4", and it begins dumping the physical memory.<br />
<br />
I have tried opening Windows Computer Management/Disk Management and changing the drive letter of the external hard drive, but I still get the error.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if this is the cause of the problem, but I will mention that in Disk Management, in the list of drives, my internal hard drive (Disk 0) is split into two partitions: 7.07 GB "Healthy (EISA Configuration)", and<br />
225.81 GB NTFS "Healthy (System, Boot, Page File, Actve, Crash Dump, Primary Partition)". The 225 GB partition has the volume label "SW_Preload" and is assigned to drive letter C:, while the 7 GB partition has no volume label or drive letter assigned to it,
 and therefore has no option to add or change a label or drive letter. I don't know if that is the true cause of the conflict or not, but I am suspicious because I can't access the 7 GB partition anywhere, don't know what it's for, and I can not assign a drive
 letter or volume label to it. I figured that might have something to do with the error, because it seems odd, and I still get the error even when the external hard drive is not plugged into the computer.</p>
<p>I know this seems to be a common issue with Vista, but I have tried all of the "fixes" for it and I still get the error. Hopefully you can help me solve this problem. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi JNunez6,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
This behavior may occur if one of the following factors is true: <br />
1. The incompatible software conflicts with Vista.<br />
2. The drivers to removable disks are corrupt.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; To troubleshoot this issue, I suggest we first perform these steps: <br />
<br />
<strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. <br />
The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135
<br />
&nbsp;1) Perform clean boot <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vii. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Enable half of the services<br />
3)&nbsp; Determine whether the problem returns<br />
4)&nbsp; Enable half of the startup items<br />
5)&nbsp; Determine whether the problem returns<br />
6)&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat the above steps until you find out which service or program is causing the issue<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> .<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
i)&nbsp;Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
ii)&nbsp;On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;Try scanning the computer using Antivirus software because this issue can occur if the computer is affected with virus. You can do a PC Safety scan by clicking on the link
<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Clicking on the Full Service scan and accept the Agreement.</p>

    <title>Keyboard and mouse abnormal functioning abnormally after win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anshumanmohanty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard and mouse abnormal functioning abnormally after win 10 &#40;1607 ver&#41; september 2016 update</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to win 10 1607 a couple of days back. Since the time of update my laptops mouse and keyboard are not functioning properly. My keyboard is continuously typing "0000.." during which mouse is lagging continuously, and I have to press windows button
 to make it work proper (which works properly for around 10 seconds and again starts working abnormally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it proper these are the things I have tried:</p>
<p>1. Complete virus scan using 360 security - no virus found.</p>
<p>2. Complete scan using windows defender - no virus found.</p>
<p>3. System file checker (sfc /scannow) - no issues found</p>
<p>4. Updating keyboard and mouse drivers.</p>
<p>5. Factory resetting - which reverted back to the newest upgraded win 10 (buggy win 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem still persists and I don't understand what could the problem be. Its not because of faulty keyboard and mouse because both the peripherals were working smoothly before update.&nbsp;I cant even revert back to win 8.1 which was working flawlessly.
</p>
<p>PLZ HELP .. THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING. </p>
<p>
</p><p>REQUEST TO WINDOWS: PLz check win 10 updates before sending it. This is the second time I had to reset my laptop because of buggy win 10 update.</p>

    <title>safely remove usb mass storage device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onehunga  say:</h3>
<h2>            safely remove usb mass storage device</h2>
                    using the safely remove hardware comes up with an error message. Windows can't stop your 'USB Mass Storage device' device because a program is still using it. Close any programs that might be using the device and try again later. all usb memory staick
 have the same problem. no programs are accessing the devices and the are not configured to speed up the system. the only way to safely remove is to do a hot unplug[not recommended] or shut down the computer (really annoying].

<p>With a device plugged in, right-click Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Device Manager (in the left pane) to see if the&nbsp;stick appears under ‚ÄòDisk drives‚Äò. If it does, right-click it &gt; Properties &gt; Policies Tab and check the box ‚ÄòOptimize for quick removal‚Äô. A USB&nbsp;stick
 should have a check in this box. Restart the computer if you change anything. Internal hard disk drives use ‚ÄòOptimize for performance‚Äò and ‚ÄòEnable write caching on the disk‚Äô.</p>
<p>I suggest you always use the same port and don‚Äôt be too hasty in unplugging a device. Also, a common hardware problem is a bad connection caused by repeated off-angle insertions and removals. Where possible plug the device into an extension lead.</p>

            Printing presets are stored in the printer driver, not Windows. I've never heard of backing up and moving presets to another computer, but if there's anyone who knows if that can be done, it's the manufacturer of your printer.

<h3> astratton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard Icon disappears</h2>
                    <p>The keyboard icon (bottom right) disappears when using the command line - the icon doesn't come back until the surface is reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The touch keyboard still comes up for (say) browser fields - I'm using it now, but not for cmd or powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the on screen keyboard - but it is very poor solution...being in the way most of the time.<br />
<br />
I do have the option in the task bar set (show touch keyboard button is ticked).<br />
</p>
<p>I guess this is a bug, like the two bsod's I've had in a week - sigh - thought they'd gone away from windows...hopefully they've gone with the updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it helps, my task bar doesn't always appear - I have to swipe from left and then up to make it work sometimes...it also has a blank space in it - it shows power blank notifications icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I'm not impressed with the pro at the moment - it's slowing me down too much...the pen is lovely though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes</p>
