            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>What application did you use to view photos?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Clean Boot.</strong><br />
Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, <strong>Restore from a system restore point </strong>
</p>
<div>This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring won’t affect your personal
 files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;<strong>Right-click </strong>(or press and hold) the <strong>Start </strong>button, and then select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Search <strong>Control Panel for Recovery</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Open System Restore </strong>&gt; <strong>
Next</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next &gt; Finish</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong><br />
If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for Recovery, and then select Recovery &gt; Configure System Restore &gt; Configure and make sure Turn on system protection is
 selected.</div>

<h2>            Cloud Save Problem</h2>
                    <figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=undefined" />I'm hoping somebody on here can help me with a problem I'm having with playing a 360 game on on my Xbox One. I've just bought Dark Souls as a download from Microsoft and when I loaded it to play the game it asks me to 'select a device' to save the game - and the only option is Cloud Saved Games. When I select this option I get an error message on the screen that says 'You don't have enough room in the cloud for saved games. Exit your session or continue to play without saving'. I have deleted all the games I don't currently play and have 75% storage on my hard drive left. I have gone into each remaining&nbsp; game and deleted all storage, I have also gone into 'Settings' and 'Storage' and cleared all 360 saves. I also have an Xbox Gold subscription. I am still getting this message and can't play the game without saving which is totally pointless. If someone could help that would be great.<im

<p>it wasn't done for that reason at all. Bioware even stated it was done because the overheat mechanic didn't achieve what they wanted which was for people to fire in burst where the overheat encourage spamming. Also if it was done to appeal to the shooter

<p>The overheat mechanic only encouraged spamming once you're at a high enough level and when you have the appropriate upgrades to compensate and limit the gun from overheating.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you do have to fire in bursts and not just "spam" your shots, otherwise your gun will constantly overheat.<br />
<br />
However, I will always take the "overheating" mechanic from ME 1 and overall stat-based system of how good or bad the weapon actually performs from naturally leveling up, as compared to this general and completely bland shooter mechanic of reloading ammo and
 scavenging the battlefield for that ammo that you see in ME 2 and will see in ME 3.<br />
<br />
Every weapon is exactly the same in ME 2 in how it's going to perform. The only differences is of how fast or slow, or what type of ammo power is attributed to that weapon.<br />
<br />
I can understand why people like ME 2's system over ME 1's, if they enjoy the faster paced combat that it offers then so be it, it's just not what I like and I will always stick to ME 1's system as being the superior system as I have never once had an issue
 or problem with my weapons overheating. I don't hold the trigger down like some ratard.</p>

<p>Also, NPD numbers do hardly anything to represent how many of the "shooter" crowd purchased Mass Effect 2.<br />
<br />
All of those sales figures are purely estimations and do not represent fact. &nbsp;Even then, for all that we know over 50% of those who purchased ME 2 could be those that only play shooters, or it could be the other way around and over 50% could be those who played
 ME 1 and bought ME 2 on the premise that it's a sequel to an amazing game.<br />
<br />
Because those sales figures don't point to either general guesses, posting them is a bit pointless for the sake of an argument here.<br />
<br />
We all know that if you demand something a whole lot on the BSN that your wish is likely to be received. Case in point, same *** relationships for ME 3. People demanded and demanded upon multiple threads that it should be implemented, and in the end it was.<br />
<br />
For all that we know, it wasn't some design philosophy to change the combat mechanic from overheating to thermal clips, but rather a plea by the
<b><i>vocal minority</i></b> to do so.<br />
<br />
BioWare does have a great habit of listening and actually taking action on their community's questions/ideas and so forth, so for all that we know that could of been the case with the change.<br />
<br />
Either way and like I said earlier, no matter what anyone tries to say, Mass Effect 1's system will always be superior to that of ME 2's and from the looks of it ME 3's because you actually had total control over how your weapon performed good or bad not only
 because you did have to control your shots, but also from many layers of customization and stat leveling to make the same weapons good or bad.</p>

<p>This is the same Bioware who swore blind that there was plenty of DLC coming for Mass Effect after the release of Bring Down the Sky. A blatant lie unless you consider Pinnacle Station, made by a different company, to be plenty of DLC. So I have no reason
 to believe them when they say what the reason for changing the combat system was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'thermal clip' system was in there to appeal to the shooter crowd plain and simple. Otherwise they would have simply fixed the balancing issue which let you create one weapon which never overheated. One weapon that unless you'd played through once, only
 the Solider would be able to get, plus is next to useless on Feros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So they went from a stat based system to twitch based reflex system for the sake of not having to bother to balance one weapon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant but I genuinely hate the change in combat mechanics from 1 to 2.</p>

<p>But to have a weapon which never overheated would be kind of unrealistic wouldn't it? I know people had complaints about the thermal clip system, but having played ME2 multiple times (as multiple classes) I always found clips readily in supply. Also, if
 I was a class other than Soldier, I preferred to use either my Biotics or Tech abilities more (Case in point as Engineer, I often used Incinerate and Combat Drone more than using my weapons). I admit, the difference in combat mechanics from ME1 and ME2 are
 somewhat different, but I was able to get the hang of combat quite easily... but then, that's just me and my opinion.</p>

            <p>Are you trying to create a System Image apart from the File Backup?&nbsp; Doing one or the other by itself may give some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first error I don't have an exact description of but it seems to be related to access being denied possibly by an anti-virus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second error means this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>ERROR_FILE_CORRUPT1392 (0x570)</em><br />
<em>The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were doing a file backup, you might be able to eliminate some locations from the backup and figure out where the problem was occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A System Image is a little particular about where it goes so perhaps you could describe the saving location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first error may be causing the second one or vice versa.&nbsp; I am not clear as to why you would want to disable a service.</p>

            I had the same error 8078014b when I tried to perform a system image backup onto one of my drives after upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; I believe I solved my problem by deleting the folder WindowsImageBackup that had been created by a previous backup under Windows
 7.&nbsp; I just now deleted that folder and my backup is now running.&nbsp; The folder was re-created during the backup process.&nbsp; I'm guessing it's a compatibility issue with a Windows 7 backup format.

    <title>Wmm no longer accepting .WMV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daerg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wmm no longer accepting .WMV</h2>
                    <p>I've been using .WMV files for months with no problems. &nbsp; I updated a graphics driver (only thing that has changed since last attempt) and now WMM no longer recognizes any .wmv file and I cannot import them (circle with a line through it when I attempt to
 drag it in). &nbsp; Tried rolling back the driver, that just caused WMM to instantly crash before doing anything else, so I updated the driver again as at least I can open the program. &nbsp; When I use the manual import, it puts a blank seven second clip there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to what's going on?</p>
<p>

            Yes, files play normally in any video player, which is normal. &nbsp; I drag them after making them from the folder to wmm. &nbsp;That is the part that has changed as it no longer recognizes the format. &nbsp; .mp4 works fine, but the editing process is long enough without
 having to convert so id likebe to get .wmv working again.

            <p>My exact process is as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Record video using Microsoft expressions screen capture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Send the video to the encoder program, after this encoding process, a .WMV file is created of that screen capture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;In the past, I would either relocate this .WMV file to my desktop for later ease of use, or simply drag it from it's current location straight into Windows Movie Maker for editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, steps 1 and two are identical. &nbsp; However, currently, Windows movie maker will not allow me to import any .WMV file. &nbsp; If I attempt to drag and drop it into the editor, I get a circle with a line through it indicating I can't do that.</p>
<p>If I click to upload a file, in this case the video that works perfectly in windows media player is 7m34s long, all it shows in Windows Movie Maker is a 7 second clip of grey screen, no video, no audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to understand what changed with Movie Maker to suddenly stop me from adding .WMV files for editing. &nbsp; I have done so with no issues since mid December. &nbsp; File sizes make no difference, I have tried to add videos I've previously edited in Movie
 Maker but it doesn't recognize those either as this are .WMV as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10, DirectX 12, AMD Radeon R4 graphics. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You have the right graphics adapter and windows movie maker as well as OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are &nbsp;two possible things to do in order your video will be accepted by movie maker, is to convert your .wmv to .mp4 file, and search why this files advance system format container ( .asf ) is not acceptable by movie maker, undistributable because it
 needs a right to use it. Click on video, rt. click and see options available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next is trial and error: Relocate the original video file to your video file folder and upload to movie maker, see if the mp4 codecs is H.24, and run a system maintenance ( troubleshooting ) from control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not forget the complete antivirus run for malware.</p>

            <p>I tried converting to .mp4, and movie maker accepts it and I can edit it. &nbsp; However, it will not save, it just says step 1/2 and 0%. &nbsp; I noticed there is a graphical bug and the top most bar is transparent (the one you use to drag the window around). &nbsp; I'd
 rather avoid .mp4 &nbsp;as my hobby is almost not worth the effort to add an hour of file change time per video everyday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried switching compatibility modes, non of them work. &nbsp;My computer refuses to system restore. &nbsp;Reinstalling my encoder and movie maker did not work. &nbsp;Your second half of your first paragraph I don't understand as it's beyond my computer knowledge at
 that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried uploading from where the video has saved, from desktop... nothing makes a difference there. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a problem with movie maker, I've run anti-virus, anti-malware and there's nothing.</p>

            <p>So sad about that, what you can do is do not stop searching for remedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not save - check the video duration if more than ten minutes better reduce to eight and make two separate video files. Check also the video start/end time if overlapping, At File - option- advance - unchecked the two boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pixelated video ( graphic bug ) - one cause is that your video driver is not matched with your video hardware, only techs can give a better advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Microsoft fix it tool.</p>

=======================================<br />
Now that you have Windows 7 Professional...the following link <br />
may provide a way for you run older software:<br />
<br />
Install and use Windows XP Mode in Windows 7<br />

<p>Except nothing works. Not the refresh, system restore, start up or the chdsk/scannow commands.</p>
<p>Is there anyway at all i can save all my files?</p>

            Hello.
<br />
<br />For restoring your data youou will need to use the installation media e.g. your retail Windows DVD.
<br />
<br />If you are using a bootable DVD or USB drive press any key when are asked to do so. When you press a key, Windows starts loading files from the DVD you will see “Windows is loading files” message. Select your language, keyboard type, language, and then click Next button.
<br />
<br />In the following screen, you will see Install now button. Don’t click on the ‘Install now’ button as doing so will take you to the installation screen. Click Repair your computer option located in the lower left corner to start System Recovery Options. 
<br />
<br />System Recovery Options will search for Windows installations and list them. Select the operating system, click Next button to see available recovery tools.
<br />
<br />In this screen, you will all available System Recovery Options.
<br />
<br />Click on Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Command Prompt, type Notepad.exe and press Enter key to launch the Notepad application. Once the application is launched, click on File &gt; Save As (you use Ctrl + S keys as well) to launch Save As dialog.
<br />
<br />Locate the files you want to back up
<br />
<br />Plug in your USB or external storage
<br />
<br />Right click on the files and/or folders you want to back up and select ‘send to’ your USB drive.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need more help.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />The safest way to save your files would be to remove your hard drive and plug it into another computer to copy the files over.
<br />
<br />But if that's not an option for you, you could create a recovery USB drive and repair Windows, keeping your files but reinstalling Windows and removing your apps. Here are the steps:
<br />
<br />You'll need to use another PC for this.
<br />Type "create recovery drive" into Start, or by following the steps in the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/</a>...
<br />
<br />The USB drive needs to be empty and have at least 8GB storage space. Once you've created to bootable media, you can plug it into the computer that won't boot and set your startup boot options to USB. It'll load up the Windows Recovery Environment, and from there you can repair Windows.
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

            I was able to get it to work by setting Compatibility mode to "Run as Administrator", Compatibility mode for Windows 95, and "Disable Display Scaling on high DPI settings"<br />
<br />
You may also "Disable Visual Themes" if it's an option. Not only did it begin opening documents without freezing but was able to print as well.

<h2>            Hard Drive 100&#37; Active Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a problem with Windows lately.&nbsp; Namely that it freezes and hangs up on me when ever I use any program.&nbsp; Checking Task Manager reveals that the hard drive is active 100% of time with huge latency (as much as 12 secs!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Microsoft virus and malware program - no threats detected.</p>
<p>I have run MalwareBytes - it found some issues and I removed the files concerned.</p>
<p>I have run CClean - cleared out registry and disk clean.</p>
<p>I have optimised the hard drive.</p>
<p>I have adjusted the virtual memory to between 8,192 mb and 16,384 mb.</p>
<p>Avast found some possible 'decompression bombs' but MalwareBytes did not locate them (?).</p>
<p>I have also stopped Superfetch and Windows Search (as advised on a youtube vid).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Lenovo core i5 dual core processor 2.4 GHz with 8GB ram.</p>
<p>

 open the WPR file.&nbsp; For some reason it would not let me share it.&nbsp; The problem is all the time and the amount of time between my original reply to now is a good indication of how slow it has become.&nbsp; The task manager reckons that it is the System file that

            <p>Is there a way to easily diagnose this issue?&nbsp; I am having EXACTLY the same problem.&nbsp; I use MalwareBytes and SpyBot Search &amp; Destroy, and only the usual junk ever shows up (oneclick, zedo, etc.).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lenovo computer is maybe a year old, running 8.1, and I always keep it up-to-date with Microsoft patches.&nbsp; This issue only started happening a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One additional piece of evidence: The 100% disk usage drops to normal after a couple of minutes (and stays low) if I boot up with the Ethernet cable disconnected.&nbsp; Usage jumps to 100% the instant I reconnect it, and stays high for a very long time.&nbsp; Interestingly,
 the resource monitor shows essentially no activity in the Ethernet window.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a drive issue, or have I contracted some sneaky virus that isn't being caught by MalwareBytes or SpyBot?

</p><p>First these results may not be reliable because there were some things dropped either because of to little buffers, memory etc.</p>

<p>
</p><p>because of this it does not appear that your HD was at 100% when you were running the trace.&nbsp; That being said you have 100 processes running and I would do a couple of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of unknown processes which can be because they were dropped or because of Malware so I would run Malwarebytes just to eliminate the possibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also run a system file check and if you have readyboost running disable it</p>

 to Firefox.&nbsp; I got rid of them.&nbsp; But I'll do another full scan again tomorrow, it takes quite a while.&nbsp; I also downloaded CClean and did a full registry clean too.&nbsp; I'll also do the system checks as well.&nbsp; Busy morning tomorrow!&nbsp; I will check to see if Readyboost
 is running now and disable it if it is.&nbsp; And, of course, I will update you on the outcomes. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File History - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralphhosmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File History</h2>
                    <p>I've Turned On File History with storage to my external 500 GB IOMEGA drive.&nbsp; The default settings of "Save every Hour" &amp; "Save Forever" have been left unchanged.&nbsp; About 11 GB on the Iomega drive was used.&nbsp; I started the "Turn On" at 5 AM, and at 10 AM the
 File History screen continues to say: "<span><span>File History is saving copies of your files for the first time" , and the IOMEGA activity light continues to "flash on and off".&nbsp; IS THIS NORMAL, or is the File History initial "Turn On" still in process ?</span></span></p>
<p>EDIT: 11.Aug.2015: File History appears to be working normally now.&nbsp; I have been using a 3rd party program [Retrospect] to do both file and system image backup. Yesterday, the computer FROZE [no mouse / keyboard response] so I did a hard Power Off.
<strong>QUESTION</strong>:&nbsp; Is it possible / likely that Windows 10 File History and RETROSPECT are interfering with each other?</p>

<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to use File History rather than using third party apps/programs.</p>

            I am not sure who you could contact, and I am not convinced that anybody could help you anyway,&nbsp;unless you are on friendly terms with the System Admin where your blog is stored. And there lies the next problem.. your blog is not stored locally, so no recovery
 software will bring it back, but if you posted to your blog using Windows Live Writer and you always saved the content in draft form, you could possibly re-build it..

<p><span>Based on your description, I would like to inform you that merging two Microsoft account is not possible. However, you can add alias email address to your account. An alias is an additional email
 address for your Microsoft account. It uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as the primary alias. You can sign in to your account with any alias—they all use the same password. You can send email from an alias whether you’re using a mail
 app like Outlook or a device such as a phone.</span></p>

                    Is there any way to get rid of the irritating "you may like" ads on the Skype app home page? I try to close them, but then I have to give a reason, and then they simply grey out, and next time I sign on, lo and behold, there's another two of them. Maybe
 some people like to be told what they may like. Personally, I'm not interested. I would rather have a clean interface. I'm on Mac 10.12 and Skype 7.58.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use Skype free version, some ads will be displayed occasionally. If you have a little credit, no matter how small is the amount, you will not see any ads at all. Also, if you have a plan, advertisements will not show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can maybe change your <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA140/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
privacy settings</a> to change the information you are sharing with advertisements so it won't be used as retargeting info. Maybe you'll get different sets of ads.&nbsp;</p>

            Your link answers my question. I have two pcs both using family safety, I wanted to have a time limit total across both devices. Ie if I set the time limit at an hour then once an hour it's used up neither machine can be used. Is this planned for a future
 update?

<p>I have a similar issue relating to aggregate screen time.&nbsp; I have a computer and an xbox one that I currently have screen time limits set to 2 hours each.&nbsp; I would also like to limit the total screen time across the devices to two or three hours.&nbsp; My child
 understands that he has a total screen time of two hours a day, but I know he will try to play xbox for two hours and then go to his Windows 10 computer and sneak in another hour before I figure it out.&nbsp; we have adequate internet connectivity for the feature
 to check in with the other device(s) to make sure the aggregate time is not exceeded.&nbsp; In fact, I would prefer the devices to be err on the side of caution and have my son ask me for additional screen time if the feature is not working correctly rather than
 him getting double the screen time that I want for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I have disabled all screen time on the laptop and he/she has to come to me and ask for screen time on that device to make sure the aggregate screen time is not violated.&nbsp; This requires me to allow time on the computer and at the same time,
 go in and manually reduce the time for that day on the XBOX which I then have to adjust back to the previous setting on the following day so it will be correct for that day when it comes around again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having an aggregate time allowance would help this significantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an excellent article on why limiting screen time is so important:</p>
<p>https://scoutingmagazine.org/2013/12/try-methods-managing-kids-screen-time/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me give my child freedom to choose which platform or device he uses his screen time and at the same time help me with an automated way to do this.</p>
