<h2>            when did north korea take over xbox live&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have been an xbox live member for over ten years and now suddenly trash talking or even swearing at an opponent is grounds for suspension? Who do you think pays for this service? A bunch of grown adults who use it and know what cuss words are. Its not my fault that a bunch of lazy good for nothing parents have been using xbox as a 60 a year babysitting service. Its not meant for kids especially if youre playing mature games that have cuss words and way worst in them than ive ever said. its a joke and&nbsp; a true disappointment Microsoft you have truly lost your way.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install FSX&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My FSX has been quite buggy lately so I decided to do a complete fresh install with no addons. There was no uninstaller entry in the programs and features control panel so I just deleted the directory manually. Looking back that was a mistake.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Now whenever I put the install disk in (disk 1) I only get the options to repair or remove. Remove gives me a 0x80040702 'Failed to load DLL: GameuxInstallHelper' and Repair lets me reinstall everything all the way to the end when it says "Please insert
 disk:" which make no sense at all!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've followed other people's advice and completely scoured the registry for 'fsx', 'flight simulator' etc and deleted all their entries. I've also searched my entire C: drive for fsx and deleted all related folders. Still get the same issues above.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've been trying to do this for the past couple of hours and it's really **** me off at how complicated it is to just reinstall a program. All the Microsoft docs seem to be years out of date and complete garbage.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I'd really appreciate some advice on this topic as I'm completely lost for ideas now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;- Josh.</div>

            Hi Rod.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model‚Äôs Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Rod, 
<br />
<br />I think removing and re-adding the printer with the latest print driver is our best bet to clear this up. 
<br />
<br />Click start, and type ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù - open it, and look for Devices and Printers - open it up, and right click on your printer and remove it. 
<br />
<br />Reboot. Then go here - <a href="https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software13/COL40842/ds-99374-19/upd-pcl6-x64-6.6.5.23510.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software13/COL40...</a>

<br />
<br />Download and install the latest 2025 driver, and once reinstalled, try to print color. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            After Windows 10 updates (not sure exactly which ones or I'd remove them!)&nbsp; - I'm having same issue with HP Envy 5531. I have unplugged, uninstalled &amp; reinstalled drivers from both HP &amp; MS. I have done these things like 3 times. Nothing has changed Grayscale
 is off &amp; it still will not print in color any longer. HP is of no help they're suggestions same as all over here. Reinstall, get new drivers, etc.&nbsp; I uninstalled the print drivers manually by going into Device Manager before I attempted all the reinstallation.
 When things still didn't work, I scanned MS for new updates, none, I scanned for HP Drivers again, same ones I had. I am afraid to purchase a new printer and have same issues w/MS b/c of updates that messed up this printer, which had been working fine. LIke
 others have said the features for changing from color to black &amp; back again just completely changed; but I did FINALLY find the area for Grayscale and it is indeed off. No one seems to be able to fix this

            Hi,<br />
<br />
to see the cause of failures with Windows Vista or Windows 7 updates, we must look for error messages in the file CBS.log.<br />
<br />
Please run the Windows Explorer and go to the folder "C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\" and copy the file "CBS.log" to your document folder (otherwise you can't upload it) and upload the complete CBS.log to your SkyDrive [1] and post a link here.<br />

                    I am connected to the internet but I cannot play any games like Minecraft and LoL because I'm apparently "not connected to the internet". Its been happening for a while now, it doesn't only affect games, Skype as well. I can't add a contact or go to Skype
 home because I'm "not connected to the internet" but I can still chat and "call" people. Help?

            Can you browse other websites? Also, do you see a yellow triangle with exclamation mark on it on the adaptor (wired or wireless)?
<div>Like here:</div>

<div>[Note the yellow triangle with exclamation on it, over the network adaptors, above image shows wireless and the below image shows wired].</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or is it without the symbol? Like:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2flouisville.edu%2fit%2fcommunications%2fwireless%2fwin7_newscreenshots%2fconnected_icon.jpg%2fimage_thumb" /></div>

<div><br />
<div>If it is without the symbol, go to start-&gt;type cmd-&gt;right click on it-&gt;click Run as administrator. Type the following and press enter:</div>

            Hi PamHoldsworth 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+i &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Make sure that Allow apps to access your Camera is ON 
<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for Skype 
<br />
<br />2. Turn off your Antivirus for few minutes and then test it as AV can block your camera. Turn on your AV after diagnostics is completed.
<br />
<br />3. To isolate the issue, can you make call using Web Skype (Edge / Chrome browser) to see if issue is with Skype client
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />4. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> 
<br />
<br />5. If above doesn't work - Share with me your DirectX Diagnostic report 
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type dxdiag and Enter &gt; Save All information (down button) to a Text file &gt; Upload text file to Onedrive and share the link here
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>How to change View Settings for the folders so that they show - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fizzyvassal  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change View Settings for the folders so that they show different views&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Folder "View" tab - displaying "Details Pane" in some folder types only</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is intended behaviour, if I have encountered a bug or if I simply don't understand how to do what I am trying to do.<br />
<br />
I am using the "View" tab to set up different views for my folders and applying these views to folders with the same folder type e.g. Picture folders display large icons/previews, document folders stick to a simple detail list. Unfortunately, none of the other
 options in the "View" tab are applied to only to the folder type and instead change the view setting of every folder on my system, whether or not I actually go into "Folder Options" and apply them to other folders of the same type (it's automatic, I change
 something in "View" and all the folders across my system take on the new settings).<br />
<br />
I can live with file extensions displaying in a folder where I don't care about them, but the "Details Pane" I mostly find to take up real estate with irrelevant information - except in my picture folders, where I love to see the details of the camera used,
 the settings of the camera for that shot, any tags I've added, the geo-location stuff. Unfortunately, because every option except those that fall under "Layout" in the "View" tab is automatically applied to every folder, I have to turn on the details pane
 for every folder or none. That's pretty inconsistent behaviour when the "Layout" options, which are in the same tab, work completely differently.<br />
<br />
Surely this isn't intended behaviour? If it is, one of the UI folks needs to sit down and realise why it doesn't make sense. If it isn't intended behaviour, what am I doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help offered.<br />

<h2>            Using Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop parts independently</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am considering buying a Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop to use with my work laptop, which does not have a numeric keypad. When I am on the road I would like to use only the numpad and mouse, but not the main keyboard. Is it possible to use the devices like that,
 or is the main keyboard required (perhaps the signal is passed through)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>

<h2>            How to become administrator on Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought a netbook with Windows 7 Starter preinstalled. When I filled the info needed for windows to start, I've noticed it has made my account as "standard user" and not the "administrator". Therefore I can't install anything, nor can I access any
 application that needs you to allow for it to make changes to my computer (I can't click YES in that window).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the only account I have on my Windows, the windows is licensed and I'm wondering what can I do?</p>

                </div>

</blockquote>
<p>This is not quite correct. When you set up Windows right at the beginning, you were prompted for the password to be used for the Administrator account. Many people leave it blank. Try rebooting into Safe Mode, then log on as Administrator. If this account
 is active then it will be visible at the log on screen.</p>
<p>To see all existing account (in Safe Mode or in Normal Mode), do this:<br />
1. Click Start, then type the three letters cmd into the Search box and press Enter.<br />
2. Type these commands and press Enter after each:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to see all account names)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to see if account xxx is active and if it is a normal user or an administrator)</p>
<p>If there is no active administrator account whose password you know then the simplest solution is to restore the machine to factory condition and restart the initial setup process. When finished make sure that you have two fully tested admin accounts.</p>

===========================================<br />
See the following article for instructions.<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer the auto-hide setting...that way the taskbar <br />
is always hidden unless I move my mouse pointer to the bottom <br />
of the screen.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t Install Windows 10, Have Windows 7 SP1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richhurtz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Install Windows 10, Have Windows 7 SP1</h2>
                    <p>This is getting to be really frustrating. I've been trying to upgrade to Windows 10 through the Media Creation Tool because the "Get Windows 10" App never showed up on my computer for whatever reason. But every time I try, I always get the "Something Happened.
 something happened." message, which doesn't help me in the slightest. I tried it one more time earlier today and at least got an error code. "0x8009000F - 0x90002"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the Get Windows 10 App Troubleshooter to see if I could figure out why it was seemingly impossible for me to get the App so I wouldn't have to deal with this headache. And, after running it, all it tells me is that "Windows is not up to date. The
 Get Windows 10 App is only for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 users." I HAVE Windows 7 SP1. I have Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1. And I've installed EVERY update Windows Update has for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? What do I have to do?</p>

            Yeah I'm getting that error code too. Tried the methods&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/cc8f69b0-4457-45de-8d88-6fec83d419d5" title="Sagnik_Chakraborty">Sagnik_Chakraborty</a>&nbsp;listed and still getting it saying Something Happened. I
 know I've got Win 7 Srv Pk 1 and the product key so it's a genuine Win 7. The laptop is a Dell Inspiron N5050. There was one updated that I could not update so I hid it from the list. I asked a few weeks ago if this would be a problem and 2 people said no.
 It was update KB2901983 and I tried all the different troubleshoots to get it to install but it just doesn't. &nbsp;I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I was able to upgrade my Win 8 HP laptop with no problem. Very frustrating!!<br />
<br />
I tried to download the Creation Tool on to a USB and "Something Went Wrong". I've tried "Upgrade This PC Now" and "Something Went Wrong". What's wrong?

<h2>            Guest Account in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have just spent good few hours to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 10 only to realise there is no option to have Guest account.&nbsp; This is a must for me as my friends and family use this future to use my computer.&nbsp; However cannot locate this anywhere.&nbsp;
 I do not want to create account for my friends and definately not for my 5 year old kids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the work around?&nbsp; I have tried looking in control panel - users and no option of guest or turning on/off there.&nbsp; No option when I click start and type Guest.&nbsp; Cannot work out how to access group policy as keep putting me in standard windows
 10 style option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not will be reverting back to Windows 8.</p>

            I did this as well, but it would not accept just Guest.&nbsp; I had to name it Guest1.&nbsp; None of the things saved under the Guest account in Window 8 imported.&nbsp; We can't get to all the stuff all the family members saved there including precious photos!

            <p>You can't re-create an account named 'Guest' because technically it still exists. &nbsp;It's just not activated. &nbsp;See link below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have an external or cloud backup drive that would have a copy of the lost files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try looking in c:\users\guest to see if it exists and if it has sub-directories ... my guess is it does not exist in Win10, but it should exist in your backup files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also look in c:\windows.old\users to see if a 'Guest' user exists with folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you will be able to recover the Windows 8 stuff you lost in the old Guest account, but you can try to re-activate the old 'Guest' account using the Administrator Command Prompt. &nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/</a>&nbsp;for
 detailed instructions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>It's sad I have to create a fake visitor account. I try to make it convenient but without guest account, I will have to add a sticky to my laptop. And that's more of a threat than the reason they choose not to have a guest account option.</p>

            Hey there, John
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />Is this in Microsoft Office?
<br />
<br />If so, highlight your text and use the A with a colour underneath to change your colour. 
<br />
<br />For background colour, please see this article:

<br />
<br />Then select print. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

    <title>Cannot delete network folder in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bschmeltz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete network folder in Windows 7</h2>
                    Recently we have upgraded some users to Windows 7 from Windows XP, since doing so a number of them have run into issues renaming network folders unless they reboot.&nbsp; Here is what I have discovered about the cause so far, it appears to only happen related
 to MS Office applications so if I open word and create a new file then save it to a network folder if I go to the MS Office app and click File -Close so only the document closes and the app stays open then I will get the error "The action can't be completed
 because the folder of a file in it is open in another program." when trying to rename the network folder, once I close the application then I can rename the folder no problem.&nbsp; Having the users close out of the app isn't a good solution as it causes a lot
 of lost productivity.&nbsp; I have already tried the suggestions I found on Microsoft.com (
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2025703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2025703</font></a>) and it didn't make any difference.&nbsp; A number of us have been explorering solutions but we havent had any luck fixing the issue.&nbsp; If
 we do the same thing on a Windows XP machine we have no problem so it is related to Windows 7.&nbsp; Any suggestions/thoughts are appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hola EXTERMINADOR DX,</p>
<p>Dado que el programa Xbox Live Rewards termina en su regi√≥n, si desea reclamar un premio de la B√≥veda usando sus Gems, debe usarlo en los premios actualmente disponibles en MyVIP Vault antes de la transici√≥n a Microsoft Rewards.</p>
