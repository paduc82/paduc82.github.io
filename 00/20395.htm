</p><p>Skype credits become inactive if unused for 180 days, but the credits are still on the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reactivate your credits:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to My Account on the Skype website. </li><li>Beside your profile picture, there would be a prompt message to reactivate your credits, click Reactivate.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>It could take up to 15 minutes for the credits to be reactivated. You will get an email notification once the credits have been reactivated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot see the option to reactivate, please try to use a different browser or clear your browsing history and log back in again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you still cannot reactivate the credits so we can look into this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Lync 2011 for Mac &#40;internal calling&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have adopted Lync Online in our organisation.</p>
<p>Specific to our mac users, when people try to calls from one another there are problems - often the client will hang when the call comes in, this means the user can't answer the call in time, or sometimes the client will crash.</p>
<p>The clients are typically a 2010 Mac mini running Mac OS X x86 (32-bit) 10.10.3 (Build 14D136) with an Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 @ 2.40Ghz processor, 2 cores). They contain 4Gb 1067 MHz DDR3 ram.</p>
<p>Is this commonplace? Are there any fixes available?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

<p>Hi Jacob,</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, can you please confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. Do other Mac users have the same problem?</p>
<p>2. If you configure the user account in another Mac computer, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>3. Do you receive any error messages when the Lync client crashes? If any, send us the complete error message for analysis.</p>
<p>4. Please uninstall the Lync client and then re-install it to test the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Firefox to access my account.&nbsp; There was no reason for the specific email to go to the Deleted folder and I am not sure why changing my browser would make any difference.&nbsp; The sender was not included in my Blocked Senders list nor was there any rule
 for sending it to deleted.&nbsp; I have added the sender to my safe list but other than checking my deleted folder carefully every day to make sure there are no emails being sent directly to deleted I am not sure how I can ensure that nothing is sent there in error.&nbsp;
 I have to say that I am becoming a bit disillusioned with Outlook/Hotmail because I have raised numerous queries as to why I can't view slideshows - I just get a black box when I click on the request to do this and then when I right click I get this a box

            I have raised this point with you before. Occasionally emails are going straight to Deleted Folder. I am not using POP but view my emails on Outlook using Firefox.&nbsp; I have not had rules set up blocking the emails or instructing them to be sent to deleted.
 It just seems to be random. I now have to go through my deleted folder with a fine tooth comb to make sure nothing important has been deleted. This is really annoying and could be costly. Other people have also raised this issue but you don't seem to be doing
 anything about it and I assume that the people raising this question with you must be just giving up on getting an answer.

            Look ! If it was so simple in my case I wouldn't have even posted it.. First thing is tht I used the manual hard reset and same things you did but didn't work... So it's a lot more painful ! Nd yeah I had to be dramatic ! But I've fixed it using windows
 recovery tool..

<h2>            Created Macro, but now it doesn&#39;t show up</h2>
                    I created 4 macros on a co-workers computer,&nbsp;I saved the macros in her personal.xls file.&nbsp; We used them later that afternoon and they worked fine.&nbsp; However, when she went to use them the next day they were gone.&nbsp; Does anyone know how and why this would
 happen?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In which case it seems that P.xls wasn't saved when the session was closed so they are almost certainly lost.</p>
<p>Don't forget that closing a workbook and opening another is not the same as closing the entire session by shutting Excel down.</p>

<h2>            Resolution of Microsoft Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. I just upgraded to Windows 10 and noticed that my Microsoft Word resolution seems to be lower than Microsoft Powerpoint. I have included a screenshot. As you can see Powerpoint is clearer than MS Word. I have looked under the properties of Word and
 there is no option to disable display scaling like there is for other apps. How do I increase the resolution of word? TIA</p>

    <title>Outlook Quick Step Not Synchronizing Properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenmistall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Quick Step Not Synchronizing Properly</h2>
                    I use Outlook 2013 to manage my hotmail email account. In Outlook my hotmail account is configured as Exchange ActiveSync. I've noticed for some time that the contents of my Outlook email did not match the contents of my email when using a web browser.
 The only way I could figure out how to sync everything back so they matched was to delete the pst file on my PC and let it download all my email. I finally figured out how my email was getting out of sync. I have several quick steps configured and basically
 the only thing the quick steps do is mark an email as read and move the email to a specific folder. When I executed the quick step in Outlook the email was marked as read and moved to the correct folder. However, after running the quick step, when I checked
 my hotmail account using a web browser the email was still in my inbox and was not read. Running a Send/Receive in Outlook did nothing as far as getting the two systems (Outlook and the browser interface) to get in sync. Any ideas?&

They all are nice stable, most of these phones updated a few hours ago and haven't rebooted at all.</p>

            <p>Same problem here, but not spontaneous restarts. It locks up when navigating to apps or within apps.
</p>
<p>I left it overnight and this morning I've not poked at it too much, but I did open a few apps and no lockup/restart, so it could have been heat.</p>
<p>Mine is a 950 and it also had taken the 14998 update in the morning yesterday.</p>
<p>A bigger concern is that the Store and Groove Music are nowhere to be found on the phone. I plan to poke at it a little more later today.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You will not be able to stop the videos from playing automatically when visiting websites. These settings are managed by the website administrator or owner. Contact the websites
 owner for more information and assistance.</p>
<p>However, you can disable the flash player add-on responsible for flash playing videos on websites, which will stop flash videos from playing and also will not display any content
 that requires flash player till you enable it back.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint Web Viewer differences between Windows 8 &#38; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have added a web page to PowerPoint 2016 using the Web Viewer add-in on a Windows 10 computer which takes the user to a secure login page and have been able to successfully log in to the site and display the live web page in presentation mode.&nbsp; However,
 when I attempt to do the same on a Windows 8 laptop (accessing exactly the same document), the login page appears and although the username and password are correct, the page simply refreshes and does not log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the fundamental differences are between W8 &amp; W10 in this regard that would cause this issue to occur?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Both PC's are running PowerPoint 2016.</p>

 worksheet has the rental charges. Column B is for 3 months with dollar value for A $47, B $57, C $90, D $100, E $400. Column C is for 9 months with dollar values for A $128, B $138, C $216, D $286, E $650. Any help would be appreciated. I am going to try and

<p>Hi Diego,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know if you're still experiencing this issue. If so, may I ask if the issue only happens on a specific file? Also, does the issue occurs on other Microsoft apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try reinstalling Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To notify me and have me get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

<h2>            Search For Record Help</h2>
                    <p>I'm probably having a stupid moment, but I can't figure out what is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a main form based on tblProtocolMain that has several small subforms containing associated data linked to the current record on the main form (tblProtocolMilitary &amp; tblProtocolCivilian &amp; tblProtocolAffiliations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have an unlinked subform on the main form based on a query built to gather select fields&nbsp;from&nbsp;those four tables.&nbsp; What I want is to use this unlinked subform to filter down to specific records and then have the user&nbsp;double-click on the record to bring
 up the detailed info the main form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;use the double-click event, however no matter how I structure the docmd.SearchForRecord or docmd.GoToRecord either in VBA or Macro, I can't get the main form to go the record.</p>
<p>GoToRecord works but only if the ID is equal to the sequential record number.&nbsp; For example ID is an autonumber and I select record with ID as 5 and it goes to the fifth record using the Offset in GotoRecord, however I delete the record with ID of 4, so now
 when I select the record of ID 5 it now goes to&nbsp; record with ID of 6 because it is now the fifth sequential record since 4 was deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to double click a record in the query subform and use the ID of the that record to go to the record of the same ID in the main form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            I cannot access MS acct on Windows 8 phone although I can online.</h2>
                    I have a brand new Windows 8 phone &amp; I can't access MS account on it even though I can online. I've spent 2 days talking with Verizon, HTC, and several MS Techs. The MS Techs didn't even try to figure out what my problem was but kept shifting me off to
 yet another Tech. I've also spent time online and haven't seen this problem. There isn't even a topic that fits it.<br />
<br />
And...no, I haven't misspelled either my email or my password. <br />

<h3> tamras72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365&#47;SharePoint Online &#62; SP Designer 2013 installation</h2>
                    <p>My PC was replaced and had to install SPD 2013&nbsp;again.&nbsp;From Office 365 &gt; Software &gt; Tools &amp; Add ins, I downloaded and&nbsp;installed the SP Designer 64-bit.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c39af56f-89da-45a1-8d85-b7bff4c89de2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c39af56f-89da-45a1-8d85-b7bff4c89de2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the Service Pack 1 for 64-bit but got this message.&nbsp; (Also, are the software&nbsp;links from this page of Office 365&nbsp;provided by Microsoft? because it is only providing a link to SP1 32-bit)<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2743e157-ca80-423a-a48a-608870f078ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2743e157-ca80-423a-a48a-608870f078ed" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP Designer seems to run fine except I'm getting this message when attempting to open one of the inactive workflows:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e5c05ac-36dc-44f4-8d05-2ffbb9bca9ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e5c05ac-36dc-44f4-8d05-2ffbb9bca9ff" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I only seem to get this message when opening old workflows that is no longer being used or activated in SP Online. However, this behavior is new.&nbsp; I was able to open old/inactive workflows before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just to note, my old PC was using SPD 2013 32-bit with SP1 32-bit&nbsp;-- but this time around, it wouldn't let me install the 32-bit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the group is Public then all the users will be able to create a new post on the group.</p>
<p>If the group is Private only the Group members will be able to see the post or create a new post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am afraid we wont be able to restrict the group members. Do let me know if you have any update for me.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I change margins in Word 2010 when I get a popup box every time I try to change the margin.</h2>
                    The pop up box says Column widths cannot be less than 0.5".&nbsp; However in every case there is only one column on the page and it always over 3". This document is a reproduction of a book.&nbsp; Each page is a section.&nbsp; I have tried to change the page margins
 on many different pages(sections) and I always get the popup box shown below.&nbsp; On every page I have tried there is only one column and it always over 3".&nbsp;

            <div role="alert" class="m-alert f-information">

            <div id="threadBottomSection" class="">

        <div data-bi-id="message-username-image-link" class="message-user-image message-username-image-link avatar-size-small circular-display" role="img"
           title="Suzanne S. Barnhill" aria-label="Profile picture" >
            <img onerror='this.className="default-avatar-profile circular-display lime362 avatar-size-small"; this.setAttribute("alt", "SS"); this.style="display: inline-block";'

            <p>It's incredible that this old bug should still be surfacing, but it certainly sounds like it. Try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Page Layout </strong>tab, in the <strong>Page Setup </strong>group, click
<strong>Columns </strong>and choose <strong>More Columns...</strong> </li><li>In the <strong>Columns </strong>dialog, click the preset picture for <strong>
One </strong>(even if 1 column is already selected). </li><li>If possible, set "Apply to" to "Whole document." If you can't, you'll need to repeat it for every section (it may help if you select the entire document with Ctrl+A before going to the Columns dialog).
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If this solves the problem in a given document, and you are experiencing the problem in all new documents, you will need to use the same solution in the Normal template (Normal.dotm), which you will find by selecting Templates in the navigation pane of Word's
<strong>Open </strong>dialog.</p>

<p>I understand what you‚Äôre describing, but I‚Äôm wondering what you might be doing differently since I‚Äôm not seeing that on my Mac with a similarly designed signature.</p>
<p>What version of outlook are you using? (In the about box)</p>
