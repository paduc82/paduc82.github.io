<h2>            Keyboard lag after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Windows did an automatic update on 11/20.&nbsp; Since then, when the pc wakes up, whenever the first time I got to type, there is a 2-3 sec pause before the characters type.&nbsp; And it doesn't matter if I wait a while, but as soon as I try to type, it's pauses.&nbsp;
 Everything else seems to work fine.&nbsp; The mouse works, programs open, etc, but the keyboard is like it's still in sleep mode.&nbsp; I haven't seen anything online about this.&nbsp; Seems like other situations is the whole system frozen.&nbsp; I would love to resolve this
 as it is annoying and only started after an update.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An incompatible device driver is most likely the cause of the keyboard lag. To resolve your issue we suggest that you refer to the post of

            I apologize for any confusion there may have been.&nbsp; I was already running Windows 10 for quite some time.&nbsp; It was a minor automatic update from Windows.&nbsp; It was after this minor update that the issue occurs.&nbsp; It was working properly before the update.&nbsp;
 Should I still follow that post, because it looks like that was after an update going to Windows 10?

<p>Also would like to note that that is nothing in the event logs showing as an error or even informational during the time I am seeing this.&nbsp; The only thing that is near that time frame is Windows Security Auditing messages, but those seem to be happening
 every 2-5 mins.&nbsp; I'm not getting any errors on the device manager, but I do see that I have several keyboards and 2 pointing devices.&nbsp; In keyboards in have:</p>
<p>Designer Bluetooth Keyboard</p>
<p>HID Keyboard Device</p>
<p>HID Keyboard Device</p>
<p>HID Keyboard Device</p>
<p>Standard PS/2 Keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 HID-complaint mouse listings in the Mice and other pointing devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how or why a minor update would change any of those.</p>

            I tried to enter into safe mode with the options from your link, but it doesn't look like the bluetooth will work in safe mode, because I wasn't even able to hit one of the options when the option screen came up.&nbsp; I used a different method to get into
 safe mode, but again, I couldn't do anything because the keyboard didn't work.&nbsp; I had a USB keyboard that I plugged in and it worked fine and after booting normally.&nbsp; It also didn't have the lag that I've seen with the bluetooth keyboard.&nbsp; This is extremely
 frustrating because it is a Microsoft keyboard.&nbsp; You would hope it would work properly with Windows, but I guess not.&nbsp; Also, I tried updating both the bluetooth driver and the keyboard driver, neither of which worked.&nbsp; I also I was going to manually update
 the driver, but there is no downloadable driver on the product page under Downloads, just pdf manuals.&nbsp; Very frustrated with this process.&nbsp; I guess I wasted my money on this keyboard and have to go

            In addition, I hooked back up a IR keyboard that has a USB receiver and that didn't have a problem either.&nbsp; So it's either the Microsoft keyboard or the bluetooth.&nbsp; I would lean away from the bluetooth being the problem as the bluetooth mouse has no issues
 at all.&nbsp; Curious what the suggestions would be at this point.

<p>Hello,</p>

</p><p>I did both of those and it did not resolve the issue.&nbsp; I ran the troubleshoot file a second time and it still says it finds an error.&nbsp; It doesn't tell you what it found.&nbsp; Another restart didn't change anything.&nbsp; I think it's unacceptable that a $80 Microsoft
 keyboard does work properly with Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; Very frustrating and makes me want to stay away from Microsoft accessories.</p>

<p>I am also having the same problems as MikeMcClure after driver update "Logitech - HIDClass - 10/11/2017 12:00:00 AM - 1.10.85.0" which was installed last week on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the Bluetooth designer Keyboard from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried all the steps above as well. As well as other Keyboards (wired, wireless, Logitech, Bluetooth) and they all functioned properly.</p>
<p>Only the Microsoft Bluetooth designer keyboard has the 2-3 second lag issue upon login in or 10+ minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating that there is no support for this problem considering it's a Microsoft Keyboard on a Microsoft OS...</p>
<p>Also the media keys stop working with the first creators update for this keyboard...<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be specific, but there is stuff that won't work properly, or at all in Safe Mode...</p>
<p>Safe Mode works by starting the computer by using only the most basic of function, and doesn't load the drivers for some devices..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is to hopefully get the computer run by disabling the device\process that is causing a crash...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error report you provided mentioned that in addition to not being able to verify the license, that there was a failed repair attempt..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you in fact connect to the internet ?</p>
<p>Do you have ant 3rd party Security program that might be blocking Words access to the internet ?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t ave a Word doc- folder is &#34;Read only&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Today I attempted to make changes to a document. When I tried to save I was advised that C:\Users\Sean\Documents\Document Name was a folder marked as 'Read Only'. I right clicked one the document name to view the properties to see if read only was checked
 - it was not. I went to &nbsp;My Documents inspected the Properties noticed that "Read Only" was highlighted I un-highlighted it clicked "Apply" then "OK" and restarted the computer. I then went to My Documents checked Properties and noticed that "Read Only" was
 again highlighted went through the same procedure with the same result. How can I resolve this problem so that I can edit documents and save&nbsp;the changes?</p>

<p>Did you mean to say that the "Read-only" box was ticked and that you unticked it? If so then the file might be encrypted. With such files the read-only box is permanently ticked.</p>

            The "Read-only" box was colored blue, not ticked, I clicked on it to remove the blue color. It then asked me if I wanted to apply&nbsp;this change to all files and subfiles whereupon I clicked Apply and then OK. As for the file itself, I can open it in Word,
 I just can't make changes and save. I tried "Select All" to copy it and perhaps paste it to a new file whereupon it advises that C:\Users\Sean\Documents "Folder is marked Read Only". I check several other files to see if this was a singular occurrence, but
 it is happening with each file I check.

<p>I suspect that there is some setting in the Word document itself that prevents you from manipulating it. To find out what it is I would ask the experts in an MS Word forum:&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;recently installed windows 7 professional 32 bit, I have a program for my creative mp3 player that also burns mp3s unfortunatally it only works upto xp so I downloaded the virtual pc for computers without the&nbsp;<span><em>
 Hardware Assisted Virtualization </em>then the xp mode, both download but the virtual pc installs but will not run saying The program is blocked due to compatability issues and there is no 'fix' whe I download the xp mode it says ' the update is installed'.&nbsp;</span><span>Admitted
 this is not a major problem and windows media player accepts my creative zen mp3 player but it is the mp3 burning that I miss, is there a way round this because the xp mode was the main reason for buying the professional version of windows 7. I have installed
 all the microsoft updates.</span></p>
<p><span>On another note windows 7 used to take 5 mins. to start after I signed in, the problem was Zonealarm!</span></p>

 to click any button on the page.&nbsp;I have to close it by right clicking the app on the taskbar and clicking close window. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there also a way to go back from Windows 10 to Windows 8 after a month. I really feel like going back now, but I can't.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per my research, I see that this is a common issue with the Intel Wifi adapter. I would suggest you to try the steps in the following Intel article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Intel my wifi technology: Adapter is not found:<br />
</strong><a href="http://communities.intel.com/message/124644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://communities.intel.com/message/124644</a>
</p>
<p>It would be better to contact Intel support for further assistance.</p>
<p><br />
Also make sure that the wifi adapter is compatible with Windows 7. Try this link to check Windows 7 compatibility.

<p /><p><br />
</p>
<p>J3RS3Y, what are you saying? Are you advocating that we buy the digital versions for all of these Deluxe and Super Deluxe preorder items? It's confusing, because when I re-read your post, you're clearly stating that you're buying the dital version (ie, "no more standing in Midnight release lines for me") but at the same time you seem to be suggesting that digital downloads would take *too long* given one's internet plan (ie, "the game download is rumored to be close to 50+ GB. I don't know about you but I'm not going to wait for that even with good download speeds").</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Surely the advantages of the physical version is faster installation and ZERO bandwith (notwithstanding day one patches). In which case are you advocating the benefits of physical over digital? As regards the game itself, I think it's safe to say that Andromeda is my *most hyped* game of 2017! Outside of any super surprises for the Scorpio launch, I can't see any game eclipsing this one in 2017, so naturally I've been on board the hype train since it was announced. Would I love to play the game at 12:01 AM in my time zone? Hells yeah, I surely would, but here's the thing...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've preordered the 'Nomad Diecast Collector's Edition' for $US195 from the Australian equivalent of GAMESTOP&nbsp;(ie, EB&nbsp;Games) and it will be despatched 24 hours prior to release. However, owing to the vagaries of the postal system, I may *not* be playing my rather expensive physical edition until the DAY&nbsp;AFTER release! 😢 Even worse is the fact that NONE of those Deluxe or Super Deluxe preorder items&nbsp;are part of *my* physical package. Which means if I want them, I'll be paying even MORE from the Microsoft store! So, why did I opt for physical? 👻</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Because it's MASS&nbsp;EFFECT&nbsp;ANDROMEDA! It's a physical *proof of purchase* and that dinky Nomad&nbsp;replica will be taking pride of place on my display cabinet! Because the physical version is housed in a smexy white Steelbook! It's something I can hold close to my heart ❤ However,&nbsp;playing devil's (or digital) advocate, I can't honestly say that I'm *not* swayed by the allure of even more&nbsp;things to make my purchase complete (eg, "Pathfinder Casual Outfit - Look your best while aboard the Tempest and docking at different friendly locations" is a no-brainer for me),&nbsp;so yes, MONEY&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;BE&nbsp;SPENT. I shall enjoy this game because I CHOOSE&nbsp;TO. Because it's Mass-Freaking-Effect Andromeda and these games burn brighter than any others in the&nbsp;gaming universe!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, whether or not I'm there on day one or day two, physical or digital,&nbsp;doesn't really matter. Because my&nbsp;❤ is there already! 🙂

<p>And you are correct. I am advocating the digital preorder. The physical copy will still need to be downloaded to the console. Disc data transfer will be faster than online but you will still have a considerable time to wait. 50+ GB is 50+ GB. </p><p>I'm just waiting for the final file size from Bioware to pull the trigger. I might need to get some more external HDD space. Too many games! Is that a bad thing? :)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh and to the friend across the pond, We adults, in as someone put it "Murica", have jobs and get paid time off. My particular job gives me 40 such days. As a huge fan of this franchise, I plan on playing the heck out of this game ASAP. Oh and no caps on my ISP if your are willing to pay for it. </p>
<p>Enjoy the game. Whenever you get it. Think of me while its installing. :)</p>

            you can try to enter safe mode and see if the same problem is occurring. You can also run sfc /scannow and dism commands to see if that can clear it up. Also run your anti-malware and see if you may be infected as well.&nbsp;

            If the issue perists I might suggest to try to obtain a user mode dump which has the potential to pinpoint the cause.
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as dump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time explorer.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After Explorer (explorer.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive (SkyDrive) or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\explorer.exe]</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.</p>

            Thanks for this suggestion. I had already tried sfc /scannow without success. However, when I started in safe mode it was fine, and was still ok when I then restarted normally. Hopefully it will not return.

<h2>            Xbox One Bots</h2>
                    <p>recently I've been receiving messages from these "people". They usually ask for an age and continue to message you. Some of them say different things but some say the same thing as others do. I heard that if you reply to these bots that they can get private information. I want to know if this is true. These bots have 0 gamerscore and have Xbox generated gamer tags.</p>

    <title>Trying to swap my motherboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisrandall3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to swap my motherboard</h2>
                    <p>Hey All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few years ago I built my first PC and everything went great. Recently I tried to swap out my motherboard but after doing so couldn't reactivate windows. I then put my previous mobo back in and everything's running fine but I still would like to know how
 I can get my windows license onto the other mobo.<br />
<br />
Activation in settings says I have a digital key tied to my account, but if I log in to my account I don't find any record of a windows license.<br />
Unfortunately, I don't remember exactly where my windows license came from. I thought I purchased a dvd installer when I bought the rest of the computer but can't find any record of that so apparently did not.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way for me to just move the license from this mobo to the new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi chrisrandall3
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi chrisrandall3 
<br />
<br />1
<br />Check whether you have a Retail licence:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, on the second line should be'Description'
<br />
<br />Does that mention 'RETAIL'?
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />3.
<br />If that is a retail licence, after you move to your new Motherboard, you best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

            <p>I had the same problem where I was running the Blaze HDTV on windows 7 without issue.&nbsp; I upgraded my PC to an HP Pavilion Touch screen with Windows 8 and the Blaze software would not run on this system.</p>
<p>I emailed Blaze and they informed me that the only way around the problem was to buy the upgrade to Blaze HDTV 6.6 for $40 US.</p>
<p>I reluctantly did this and down loaded&nbsp;the new version.,&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the software loads but goes into a scanning mode and locks up (not responding) and attempt to do anything in any of the|Blaze windows greys out the windows. Even going to Task Manager&nbsp; to end
 the process will not kill the application.&nbsp; I am forced to re boot the pc to kill it.</p>

            <p>INTEL PROSET/Wireless Software for Bluetooth Technology may break integrated/onboard bluetooth in Windows 8 (did for me, anyway). I completely lost all bluetooth function. This might be different if you have an aftermarket bluetooth adapter, but I don't
 think this software is meant for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to roll back to a system restore point just to regain bluetooth functionality; uninstalling the Proset application did not solve the problem. It's been awhile, but as I recall I couldn't uninstall the program, even in safe mode, tried reinstalling
 it, repairing it...uninstall kept failing.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem. I cannot for the life of me get my Astrum Bluetooth headset to show in audio Playback Devices. I have been searching online for weeks, but everything I try just does not work. The headset works with my smartphone, &amp; syncs with&nbsp;
 my Dell E6420 (Windows 7 Professional 64bit), but there is also no Audio tab when I hit the BT headsets properties option under Bluetooth Devices.

<p>

    <title>HOW DO I GET A HUMAN TO HEAR MY COMPLAINT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> so disgusted with microsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW DO I GET A HUMAN TO HEAR MY COMPLAINT</h2>
                    <p>I was getting Sync Host prompts about failing so I contacted tech support- 8 hours later my PC is still not where it was before several incompetent, uncaring techs screwed the pooch over and over- I was hung up on 3 times; had the computer taken over remotely
 without my permission and this tech then left; I called again got hung up on; called and also chatted simultaneously; after 8 supposed techs messed up dropped the ball and were somewhat perturbed I was upset by the total lack of competence I got one tech who
 finally got the files back and almost got it back to normal but there are still issues, new ones created by these "techs"-- also nowhere can you find a person to talk to about this-- I lost an entire day of work and income because of Microsoft issues and totally
 useless techs--- so who do I talk to and how? I am exhausted and disgusted. I work for a living self employed and they act like oh well???? UNACCEPTABLE</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW it was Microsoft One that caused all the problems, and like cortana something I have no use for and never use</p>

<h2>            Bought Complete Series of Several Shows but Episodes are Missing &#40;XBox 360&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The Movies &amp; TV app works great on my XBox One and Windows 10 PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have many shows where I bought the complete series (all combined into a single season) and the Movies &amp; TV app only shows 25 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single season which is more than 25 episodes has the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried troubleshooting suggestions to 'reload' / 'refresh' my purchases on the machine including removing the profile completely.&nbsp; Nothing works -- it is always the same problem.&nbsp; One series doesn't even show up (the Complete Series run of the Sopranos).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is ONLY on the XBox 360.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the XBox 360 version of the Movies &amp; TV app needs an update to bring it in line with the version that is on the XBox One?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble watching your series collections from an Xbox 360. Try these steps:
</p>
Reinstall the latest Xbox 360 system update
<div>
<p>To reinstall the latest Xbox 360 update, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the system cache. To do this, see the "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console/system-update-help#S3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Clear the system cache</span></a>" section above.
</li><li>Roll back and then reinstall system updates. To do this:
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Guide</strong>&nbsp;button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on your controller. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>. </li><li>Enter the following button sequence:<strong>&nbsp;X</strong>,<strong> LB</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;RB</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>X</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>LB</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>RB</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;X</strong>.
</li><li>Select the option to roll back all system updates that are installed. The console will restart automatically and then download the updates again.
</li></ol>
</li><li>Reset your network hardware. Here's how:
<ol>
<li>Unplug the power cable from the back of the router, modem, or gateway. If you have a router and a modem, unplug the power cable from both devices.
</li><li>Turn off your Xbox 360 console by pressing the power button on the front of the console.
</li><li>Wait 5 minutes. </li><li>If you're using a router, plug in the router and wait for all the lights to return to their normal state.
</li><li>Plug in the rest of your hardware and try to connect to Xbox Live. </li></ol>
</li></ol>

            I have had a similar problem and it turned out there was a license issue with some of the music used in an episode and the episode was pulled from digital purchase and re added once they changed the music.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If this was a handful of episodes, I could see that being the case.&nbsp; However, there is a pattern here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stargate: SG1 Complete Series ... 213 episodes but only 25 showing up on my XBox 360</p>
<p>Chuck Complete Series ... 90 episodes but only 25 showing up on my XBox 360</p>
<p>American Horror Story Season 1 through 7 compilation... 84 episodes but only 25 showing up on my XBox 360</p>
<p>Futurama Complete Series ... 128 episodes but only 25 showing up on my XBox 360</p>
<p>Archer Seasons 1-9 compilation ... 101 episodes but only 25 showing up on my XBox 360</p>
<p>X-Files Seasons 1-11 compilation ... 217 episodes but only 25 showing up on my XBox 360</p>
<p>
</p><p>In every single instance with a series / compilation where you get to buy a series, Movies &amp; TV on my 360 only gives 25 episodes of the run.&nbsp; Not even a continuous 25 episodes either.&nbsp; It just seems to 'cap' at 25.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problems on any Windows 10 computer I log into and no issues on my XBox One.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately most of what we watch is on the XBox One.&nbsp; This is why I thought it was more of a glitch with the 360 incarnation of the Movies &amp; TV app which is different
 from the XBox One and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried wiping my profile... rolling back and reinstalling updates (as previously suggested) but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh... and I bought the complete run of the Sopranos and despite all my efforts, it's not even showing up on my 360 (but it does everywhere) despite everything I've tried.&nbsp; I suspect that if it did show up, I'd only get 25 episodes of that too.&nbsp; ;)</p>

<p>Thank you... I've tried these steps but I still get the same problem.&nbsp; As indicated, I really find it interesting that all instances where I am having this issue, I'm 'capped' at 25 episodes in any compete series or compilation that I have purchased.&nbsp; I
 find that to be an interesting coincidence.</p>
<p>
Thankfully, I usually use my XBox One as my primary device and I have no problems there.<br />

            Did you ever figure this out? I purchased a bunch of DBZ seasons on sale, I can watch all episodes on my PC, havent tried my XB1 yet, but just tried my 360 and its doing the whole 25 episodes per season thing yours did. Refreshing purchases didnt help
 and I dont want to go through the pain of wiping my 360 and starting over or anything. This is insane. Funny thing is I can go to the store click on the individual episodes and it will try to sell them to me even though I already own them and the store says
 I own the seasons.<br />

<h2>            Thinking about getting Sleeping Dogs until GTA V arrives&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Sleeping Dogs isn't a GTA, but it's open world and similar to it, so in terms of replayability and story how's it?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The price is about right and I liked the demo very much, except the annoyance of cursing in both languages unnecessarily, just in Cantonese or English would've been fine.</p>

<p>I rented it on PS3. Its a really good game It doesn't really have much replay value if you're not competitive as once you have beaten the story, which is actually really good imo, it's kinda done, though there is DLC now. However the meta game ( I think
 that is what you call it) is really extensive, even more so if you have competitive friends due to the stat tracking, this also goes into the replayability. You can replay all story missions but except for like 2 I think &nbsp;in a effort to get a better score
 than your friends in that mission. There are also quite a few side missions and what not like girlfriends, races, face missions, cop missions and of course collectibles. I really enjoyed it and wish I had more time with it. If I get the cash I will purchase
 it for the 360.</p>

<p>It's actually really fun, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it to be honest. Like Ascenion says, if you have a few friends that have the game it makes it last a bit longer too, as you're trying to go one better than them in the stat tracking minigames.</p>
<p>The story is fun (a teensy bit on the short side) but there's enough side missions to keep you busy for a while! Highly recommend it!</p>

<p>I'm in the middle of playing it now. I really like it. The combat is fun. The only thing I don't particularly like is the camera angle &nbsp;gets a little weird when you are driving if you get caught on the corner of a building. Other than that, it's pretty fun
 and I thought GTA IV was a snore fest.</p>

<p>The story is a mess and is pretty predictable at times, and I would say there's little to no replayability, but still, it's certainly a fun game for your first run through.</p>

<p>Sleeping dogs is a very very good game. It is the sequal to True Crime LA. &nbsp; &nbsp;I think its one of the best surprise hits of 2012. &nbsp;You should be able to easily get at least 25-30 hours of gameplay out of it. &nbsp;Great game.&nbsp;&nbsp;SD is way better than GTA4 by a longshot.&nbsp;
 IMO.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you want a co-op campaign sandbox experience I would recommend Saints Row 2 or Saints Row 3.&nbsp; Just keep in mind SR3 requires a season pass.&nbsp; SR2 does not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SR 3 doesn't require a season pass at all, the DLC is optional.</p>
<p>And Sleeping dogs is a great game, I couldn't stop playing it once I picked it up, If I hadn't loaned it to a friend I would have completed the DLC by now.</p>

<p>Dang it I keep saying season pass. I meant "ONLINE" pass. &nbsp; SR3 requires an online pass, SR2 does not.&nbsp; And yes Sleeping Dogs is an excellent game. One of the best sleeper hits of 2012 IMO.</p>

<h2>            My games keep going from &#8220;installed&#8221; to &#8220;ready to install&#8221;. What&#8217;s going on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>i have an xBox One X with a 4 TB USB HDD. I have 126 games installed. However, starting a couple weeks ago, 66 of then (yes, its always that number) show as “ready to install” rather than “installed.” I go through each game and select “install” and it installs
 instantly (because of course, it’s allready installed.) This has now happened three times in the past couple of weeks. I am at a loss as to how to proceed or make this issue go away. Assistance is welcomed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist, it sounds like you're experiencing an issue with games staying installed on the external HD. What I recommend doing is performing a<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Power Cycle on the Xbox One</a>, as well as trying to connect the External to a different USB Port. I hope this information was helpful in resolving the issue, please let u know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>
