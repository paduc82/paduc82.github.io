<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those lines normally indicate either corrupted Graphic Drivers or failing Graphics Hardware.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;it is only two weeks old, it is under Warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you either contact the Manufacturer or post in their Support forums to see if others are having the same problem with that model.</p>
<p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it was two weeks old at the time of that original post. Right now the machine has just about hit a month, and I had the GPU itself for about three weeks before everything else even arrived. So I have no warranty on the GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea if it's the same model since I can't contact them directly, but I did read one specific case where a person said they had a Radeon of some kind, and there was an AMD related driver that was prone to just breaking at random, which is why I
 even suspected the GPU in the first place. However, they specifically mentioned BSoD crashes when talking about it, so I hesitate to say it's the same problem. They also said that uninstalling the bad driver and rolling back by one version stopped the crashing,
 but overall broke their display because the GPU no longer displayed at the proper resolution without said bad driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll hit up AMD support to see if there are any similar problems, but is there anything I can do off the bat to try and fix things in the case that it's not the hardware itself, but the driver like the person said?</p>

            <p>Still haven't heard back from the AMD guys aside from "We're aware our drivers are buggy.". but when I took my machine to class with me today (since it's a computer tech course), it was pointed out that the power supply might not be cutting it 100% of the
 time, and that maybe the graphic crashes are because the power to the GPU randomly gets some dirty power/drop in power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been told that the power supply is just barely on the borderline of just being enough since AMD is ridiculously inefficient when it comes to power usage, and have been recommended to upgrade to a bigger supply; at least 700, but 750/800 was ideal. Also
 a supply with more than one 12V rail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts on this course of action?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Microsoft does not maintain information to track your&nbsp; computer. Be sure to contact
<br />
the System Maker who can help provide serial numbers and other&nbsp;information you&nbsp;<br />
might need to report it to the police. Be sure to report it to the Police as many are&nbsp;<br />
recovered and they go unclaimed due to no report. Check Craig's list and other for
<br />
sale sites in your area. <br />

<h2>            Recovering Lost Skype History</h2>
                    Recently, My computer had a issue where the only solution was to reset it back to its original factory settings. Before I reset my computer, I did not back up my Skype history, so now it is not there. I used apps like Skype log view to retrieve my lost
 history and it did not work. I've tried going into properties and restoring it to an older version, which also didn't work. One thing I do know is that it exists. I have Skype on Mobile too, and my phone still has the chat history on it, however it has difficulties
 accessing it. I am in desperate need to get my skype history back, it's very important! I would sincerely appreciate any help anyone has to offer.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your conversations are saved on your hard drive for a period of time, which you can specify in your
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA392/how-do-i-manage-my-conversation-history-in-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=skype+history#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
history settings</a>. The last 30 days of your conversation history are also stored in the cloud, so you can access it when you're signed in to Skype on any device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype history is stored locally on your device. Once you&nbsp;do&nbsp;restore factory settings, PC system will refresh&nbsp;and will delete all the applications along with their conversation&nbsp;history (unless you do back-up). That being said, I'm afraid to say that there's
 no other option to recover your Skype history at this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In future, you can back up your history if for any reason you need to make changes on your computer. You just need to copy the main database file in your Skype Name folder.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Graphics Driver</h2>

 graphics driver , or enable your adapter using the display manager ". I'm confused not knowing what to do . &nbsp;The name of my graphics card is Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 and the current display mode : 1366 x 768 (32 bit) (60 hz) whereas my notebook is manufactured
 by HP and the version of OS is windows 7 (64 bit). Can you please help me as soon as possible ..... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>I appreciate any help to fix the inability of my brand&nbsp;new HP G42 Notebook with Windows 7 to connect to my home wireless network.</p>

<p>Whilst I am able to browse the net connecting by cable, for the past 4 days, and an estimated total over 20 manhours, I have tried several suggested solution ound thus far online to resolve this inconvenience but to no avail.</p>

<p>Windows 7 detects my wireless network (OPEN WEP Security) but simply cannot connect.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my husband's Dell Latitde 630 w/ Windows XP Pro and dauther's Mac Book are running just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>As a first step, I will move temporarily the computer to a spot near the Wireless Router to compensate for weak, and or blocked signal that might be part of the problem in the further away working spot.</p>
<p>In the computer itself.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</strong></p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p>When working turn On the Wireless security, and move the computer back to its original location.</p>

<p>Since Windows 7 was not released to manufacturers until <strong>July 24, 2009</strong>, more than two years later, there is no way it shipped on this computer.</p>
<p>An activation exploit, called a loader, was used to trick the Windows Activation Technology into thinking that your Dell supported this copy of Windows.&nbsp; It does not.</p>
<p>You need to use the correct Dell recovery disks for your model computer to recover to the original Vista or purchase a full license copy of Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Memory card in Canon Ixus 40  does not get detected</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Connection Canon Ixus 40 to my ASUS Laptop</p>
<p>I have a Canon IXUS 40 camera. When I tried to connect my camera to my&nbsp;computer the comp. did not recognize the camera and so I can't empty my memory card. My system is a Windows 7 home 64.</p>
<p>I install the progams according the Canon Disk without problem. Before I have the same laptop and installing of these programs didn't give such problems, but this laptop was stolen, so I am trying to re-install my fotos on the new laptop.</p>
<p>I called Canon and they let me download a&nbsp;image zoombrowser but even with that, the system did not recognize the memory card of the camera. I also have another computer with a Windows XP SP2 system and there the same camera with the same cable are working
 perfectly without any problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will you please inform we what I am doiing wrong, and hopely you will give the solution for this problem.

            <p>Hello Sharky1946, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking the Question!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was disheartening to know that you face issues with memory card . As I get it right the memory card present in Canon Ixus 40 does not get detected.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I need to ask you a few questions in order to assist you in a better way.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>2. Did you insert the camera to another port of the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the troubleshooter and check. </p>

<h2>            Slog booting in Windows 10 after the Windows update.</h2>
                    I have a Windows 10 (original) HP laptop with SSD. It used to boot up with 2 or 3 seconds. But after few windows update now it takes about 3 to 4 mins to show the desktop. The circling dots that what what I see after enter the user id for 3 to 4 mins.&nbsp;
 I found tread to rename folder SoftwareDistribution to something else after stopping the wuauserv. Then restart the the service and reboot. it worked couple of restarts. Then again the slow boot occurs. I have see the same issue happen to several win 10 users
 after the updates.&nbsp; I know Microsoft recommends clean boot, trouble shoot maintenance etc. (in several threads) but those are not helping here.&nbsp; Is there any other permanent solution for this issue?

<p>Hello Joseph, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's determine the cause of the issue. To get started, I'd like to confirm the current build of your Windows. To get, type
<strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that your perform system restore to resolve your concern.
<strong>System Restore </strong>takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Control Panel.</strong></li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>View by: Small icons.</strong></li><li>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Open System Restore.</strong></li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic update.</li><li>&nbsp;Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>, and hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for<strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Configure
 System Restore</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt; Configure and make sure<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Turn on system protection</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is selected.<br />

            I started the recovery from the last windows update (which took place Feb 14, 2018), but towards the end it shows issues in restarting computer and gave me the option to undo the system recovery. I opted it and recovered the system recovery. After that
 my booting seems to be ok, it only takes less than one min to boot up (I think being in SSD it should boot faster than that). Any I am not going to do anything else unless the booting delay exceeds couple of mins.

<h2>            commercial use</h2>
                    hi, I have tried to search on the Internet terms and conditions about the usage of Kinect Sports in a public location but could not find much. Can anyone help? I would like to know basically if I can run the games in an arcade or any other public location.
 Any commercial license that can be purchased? Thanks in advance for your guidance.

            You may have to contact Microsoft head office about this. I know they discontinued the Kinect so a lot of the games and features don't work as well now. If you're running the Kinect and charging a fee that's definitely something you would want to get some
 clarity on.&nbsp;

<p>Hey there Kinect, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, when you purchase a game from Microsoft and the hardware for said game, you can use it almost how you see fit. &nbsp;You can also share with all profiles on the console by setting your console as the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home console</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make a dummy account for an Xbox and then have whoever will play it use that if you would like. You would just have to deal with any bans that that account will get if you don't know who exactly is playing all the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it's very much discouraged to mod the console or make games and programs for it as that's against the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/warranty-and-service/xbox-support-terms-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Services Terms &amp; Conditions</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. <br />

<p>I don't that, the licence you buy is for personal use, I doubt it would be allowed for commercial purposes. Worth checking with Microsoft&nbsp; or is your answer an official response?&nbsp;</p>

When you say in a public location do you mean it will be free for use, or that there's some charge associated for it? If it is for a charge, is it a fundraising/non-profit event, or for profit?&nbsp;

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the most relevant support article in regards to your question although this encompasses "Game Content" and how you decide to use the content you create using games owned by Microsoft:
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/developers/rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.xbox.com/en-us/developers/rules</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially you can use your Xbox however you want,&nbsp;but you can't use&nbsp;it to do anything illegal or against the Terms of Service of course, and there are some rules when it comes to digital licenses for games. These rules pertain to the content you
<p>
</p><p>Commercial use of content you create using these games is definitely not allowed. Here is from a bullet point in the rules: "Except as described here, you can't sell or otherwise earn any compensation from your Item, including through advertisements in the
 Item. &nbsp;This means you &nbsp;can't charge money in exchange for your Item, post it on a site that requires subscription or other fees to view the Item, or post it on a page you use to sell other items or services(even if they have nothing to do with Game Content
 or Microsoft). You also can't use Game Content in an app that you sell in an app store."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you technically are not creating anything out of these games to then sell &amp; distribute, and you state you are not going to charge to use the Xbox, I don't see anything wrong with setting up an Xbox to use for your arcade.</p>

<h2>            See more results on the start menu search bar does not work</h2>
                    When I click on "see more results" in the start menu search bar, an explorer window opens then closes straight away. How can I stop this from occuring? The search function works fine in Windows Explorer. I've tried resetting Windows Search, rebuilding
 the index and nothing seems to work.

<p>
</p><p>I've still not had any luck getting the 2008 package to install. &nbsp;The 2005, 2010, 2012, and 2013 packages all install fine, but when I try the 2008 package, the pop-up window gets to .\install.exe and then disappears and nothing else happens. &nbsp;I've tried
 running it in different compatibility modes also and still nothing works.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t go Back to Windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camelslayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t go Back to Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>So after hearing all the good things about Windows 10, I decided to proceed with the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I'm not happy with it. While I really appreciate some of the features added, at the moment I view it as a plague that needs to be purged because of how unstable it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After fighting for more hours than I care to admit to discover that the only way to access Settings was to deactivate my graphics cards, the "Go Back to Windows 7" option simply tells me "We're sorry, but you can't go back. The files we need to go back to
 a previous version were removed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>They weren't. I can still see the folder of the old OS on my computer in Windows.old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make Windows 10 stop thinking that the files are gone when they aren't so I can go back to Windows 7?</p>

            <p>I have tried all suggested solutions for not having a start menu, can't access notifications, edge is gone, and can't open app store. So I decide to go back to Windows 7. But I get the same error message as Camelslayer.</p>

            If you page through the forum you will find that there a load of people (including me) who have had this problem of W10 saying that the files are missing even though the Windows.old folder is clearly still there. The fact that Microsoft have not produced
 a sensible answer to any of them suggests that there is as yet no solution available. If you are really optimistic you might hope that they are looking for one

            <p>I hope they are looking for one. It's rather unfair to give people the option to downgrade and then have something like an update potentially take that away from everyone.</p>
<p>I do appreciate Windows 10 for some of the changes it's making, &nbsp;but I'd personally rather wait until it's more..... stable.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It looks like running the media creation tool after upgrading to W10 will destroy the ability to rollback to your previous system. I ran the media creation tool after the upgrade to make an install disk for the future in case I needed to reinstall. I don't
 know if this is recoverable in some way or not. The ~BT folder in the root directory gets rewritten when you run the media creation tool and apparently this folder is needed for rollback in addition to Windows.old. Sometimes it hard to believe that Microsoft
 has been in the software business for long. This is really a dumb design flaw.</p>

            <p>Running the Media Creation Tool after performing the Upgrade to Windows 10 will re-download all of Windows 10 upgrade files, which will in turn overwrite the critical upgrade files that enable you to carry out a roll-back. This is not as minor as&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b7f446cc-9c89-4317-80a2-b76f53bc0dc1" title="Camelslayer">Camelslayer</a>&nbsp;seems
 to believe, as there is little anyone can do to prevent someone from taking an incorrect course of action when they are the System Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this sounds harsh, but you probably destroyed the capacity of the system to carry out the roll-back procedure by overwriting the required management files; and even though your Windows.old file may still be present it can't now be accessed by the
 system. &nbsp;If you wanted to download a 'backup' of the Windows 10 system installation media you should really have downloaded an ISO and then used that to create DVD/USB media; but that's a very hard lesson to learn at this stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be in a situation where the only possible course of action is a complete re-installation of your original OS, Software and data, assuming you have all the necessary media and data backups. &nbsp;However, I would suggest that you should first try contacting
 the Microsoft Help Desk to see if there is any possible way to get your Windows 10 installation working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, whichever course of action you decide on.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Controller Buttons Stuck</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought the Limited Edition Gears of War 3 console not too long ago b/c I hadn't played on my account or ex-consoles for 4 years (Wish I knew about warranty back then...). The console comes with 2 nice looking controllers that I love &amp; I have only
 been using one to preserve the other (Keep it shiny).&nbsp; But the other day I went to use the controller the A/B/X &amp; RT buttons are all stuck, meaning I can't use it anymore &amp; I'm now using the other one.&nbsp;I just wanted to ask if there is any way I can fix it,
 or if it's just gonna collect dust on my shelf 4ever now.v-v&lt;--sad face</p>

<p>You can buy replacement buttons, but chances are there is goo underneath the button mat that makes contact with the pcb. Just take apart your controller and clean it with rubbing alcohol and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>I can't open my SD card because I can't find "Computer" in the Start menu. No screen comes up when I insert the SD card that usually gives me a lot of options, like, Download photos with Photo Gallery. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Ideazon Zboard Fang Gamepad ZGP-1000 41Button USB Game Controller</h2>
                    I have tried everything including buying a new Fang board from E-bay. I cannot get the driver to work with the board. I have tried this about 10 times-:http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproappcompat/thread/c9775f85-d49c-42d5-8b6c-62a60ec59c89
 and it doesn't work. This is a new P8P67PRO mobo and a new install of win 7pro 64 bit. System has been running for 10 days, all updates are installed. In device manager I get (Code 52) when trying to update drivers. This board worked fine with same OS but
 differant board. Also my hard drive is a solid state if that make a differance. Also am useing the drivers from Steel website. Tried US and UK 64 bit.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Method 01:</span></p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot into
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced Boot Options</a></strong> and disable driver signing checking.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabling driver signature enforcement has helped a lot of users in fixing the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also delete the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry and check if that helps.
</p>
<p><br />
Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry.
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Important</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure
 that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Start”, type “regedit” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter.
</p>
<p>Note: If UAC (User Account Control) pops up, please accept it.
</p>
<p>2. Right click “Computer” (the root node) in the left pane, click “Export” under the “File” menu, choose “All” under “Export range”, and select “Desktop” in the “Save” in
 box and type backup in “File Name”. Click “Save”. </p>
<p><strong>Note:
</strong>The backup file is on the Desktop and named backup.reg. We can simply restore the registry by double-clicking the backup.reg file.
</p>
<p>3. Click “Start”, type “regedit” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter again.<br />
4. Locate the “UpperFilters” value under the following key in the registry: 
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</strong></p>
<p>5. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.<br />
6. Locate the “LowerFilters” value under the same key in the registry: </p>
<p><br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</strong>
</p>
<p>7. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.<br />
8. Quit Registry Editor and restart the computer.</p>

    <title>Can I use Windows 10 key to downgrade to Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenniferpinkley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I use Windows 10 key to downgrade to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last year Microsoft updated to laptop to Windows 10 without my permission. It completely screwed it up. I have since switched to a Chromebook for most of my daily needs, but i still have a couple programs that only run on Windows. I didn't get installation
 disks with my laptop and don't have any record of my product key, but found an app that shows me my product ID, key, OEM key, and OEM edition. Obviously my edition is now Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since i initially purchased Windows 7, can I use the key to downgrade to/reinstall Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, no comments about security issues, etc., I just need a functional laptop.</p>

            Are you currently on the chromebook with windows 10 installed? 
<br />
<br />Can you clarify this for me please? If not, what brand of laptop are you on? 
<br />
<br />You should easily be able to do this, but it may be worth it to contact a support agent and let them know what key you have and they can tell you.

            No, I have a HP Pavilion Windows laptop I want to downgrade. Thanks for the link. I'll downgrade somehow even if I have to buy a new OS, but think I should be able to downgrade for free since Microsoft changed the software I actually purchased without
 my permission.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<br />Yes, you can downgrade to Windows 7 easily if you have the license key and upgraded within the free upgrade offer.

    <title>Windows Media Center Guide won&#39;t download data for HD channels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexandergr8one  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center Guide won&#39;t download data for HD channels</h2>
                    <p>I had problems with the EPG data not loading into WMC before, (immediately after MS switched the EPG over to Rovi), and eventually it was repaired but it's happened again over the past week and now there's a strange new twist --&gt; We're getting EPG data downloaded
 for all standard def channels but we're not getting it for our HD channels. When you punch in the channel number on Live TV the signal is there and the program broadcast is visible but the EPG says "No Data Available" so the ability to record HD programming
 is gone. Even pre-scheduled program recordings are gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives? Does anyone have any feedback on what's going on with the MS+Rovi electronic program guide?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it acting up all of the sudden and is anyone aware of this and are they working on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to report this somewhere else? If so please send a link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I am seeing this very same exact problem.. with one strange exception: One or two of the HD channels are actually getting the right guide data.&nbsp; But most are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Comcast and am in the Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth (Comcast's area is Brooklyn Park).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been chatting with a Comcast rep, but they keep wanting me to give them the serial numbers off of my other cable boxes!&nbsp; The completely don't understand the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks Barb. I've documented my incident there as well. Apparently it is a nationwide issue affecting thousands (hundreds?) of other WMC users that are using the software with Comcast as their cable provide. Apparently Tovi/Tivo is well aware of the issue

</p><p>Before we can proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below so that we get a clearer image of the issue in hand.</p>
<p>1. Can you explain what is the exact issue with the PC and what is it that you desire to change?</p>
<p>2. What do you mean when you state "all files instead of the normal ones", what is the "normal ones" referred to here?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your reply is very important to ensure a proper resolution. Please get back to us with the above information to assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<p>I agree with Vanessa. Tell her what you plan to do, lest it be something you'll regret. Nevertheless, here is what I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) At File Explorer's View tab, put a check in "Hidden items".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the same as selecting "Show hidden files, folders, &amp; drives" in Folder Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Click the Options button to open Folder Options,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;uncheck "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: A File Explorer search (typing into the Search box) will find the files revealed by (1) &amp; (2)
<em>only after they have been revealed that way. </em>But (2)&nbsp;gives a warning so severe -&nbsp;I do it only temporarily, myself.</p>
