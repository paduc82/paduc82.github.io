<h2>            Logitech m510 mouse on Windows 10</h2>
                    My Logitech m510 mouse has recently stopped working. It started lagging about a week ago and continued to function less and less until now it does not work at all. The computer will not recognize it, just noticing that there is a unifying receiver but
 not a mouse. I have tried uninstalling all drivers and reinstalling, restarting my laptop and nothing seems to be working. From what I have read it is a problem with Windows 10.

<p>Yes, the mouse does not work on another windows 10 computer, but it does work on a different OS. Yes, I tried another mouse on my computer and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried all of the suggestions below those questions and in the attached article. I have checked on the Logitech website and this specific mouse should be compatible and it did originally work.</p>

<p>Microsoft Works is very old software that hasn't been sold for years. It's not supported on Windows 10. That doesn't necessarily mean that it won't work at all on Windows 10. It means that Microsoft hasn't tested it on Windows 10 and hasn't continued to
 keep it up-to-date with all the changes to Windows over the years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Works may work just fine on your computer, or it may partially work or it may not work at all.</p>

 years of progress on my xbox account, all of the purchases, acievements, pre order items etc and if i made a new account i wouldnt have that unless theres some way to transfer the liscences but with drm i assume its likely impossible, and ive been trying to

    <title>Can&#39;t set up mic for speech recognition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bdawgqz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t set up mic for speech recognition</h2>
                    <p>Setup wizard wants me to set up the mic but doesn't give an option for built in microphone on the laptop, only headset, desktop (like sits on a stand on the desk) and other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when it tells me to read the sentence, the sound meter moves with my voice and the level is well into green just about to touch red. &nbsp;But then it says computer didn't hear anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a problem of speaking into the wrong mic, there is only one and it's the built in one. &nbsp;Also not a problem of the mic being switched off, again, it's the internal one....... and, it's hearing me obviously since the sound meter is moving when I
 speak and moving in line with the volume of my voice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. If your headset/headphone has a built-in microphone, then we need to set your built-in microphone on your device as the default microphone. To get started, we'd suggest that you check this

<p>I don't have a headset mic, I'm using the mic built in to the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the point here is that the mic is hearing me, but not the "computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says "the computer didn't hear anything."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I was speaking the meter was moving in response to my voice. &nbsp;If I talk loud, the meter gets closer to red, if I speak softer, the meter stays lower in the green. &nbsp;And it is clearly in the green, so not a volume or levels issue.</p>

<h2>            How To Access XBox Live Gold FROM CONSOLE</h2>
                    
<p>So I just signed up for one month of XBox Live Gold (I did try the free Trial, but my console is telling me I don't have one - even thought I do - so I figured I'd spent the $12). However, I can't for the LIFE of me figure out how to access Gold from the
 console. The "Go Gold" ad is still appearing on the dashboard and going to the regular Store section doesn't seem to bring up gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone explain what I'm doing wrong here? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>If you go to the settings, then go to subscriptions you can check to see if there are any live gold subscriptions active there.</p>
<p>Also have you tried doing a power cycle, might just need to clear the system:</p>

<h2>            Skype for W10 - Auto-correction still working even when the setting is off</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently switched back to the Classic Skype because the new one still has some issues (and totally feels like I'm beta testing it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the most annoying is the text auto-correction:</p>
<p>The documentation I've found so far, says the new Skype uses the OS settings now, so there is no in-application switch and so I did disable the auto-correction system-wide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, whenever I type, my&nbsp;text is still highlighted in red and then auto-corrected against my will - meaning that Skype or the entire OS is ignoring its own settings, so I have to use tricks in order to chat in Italian when my system language is set to
 English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, avoiding lazy workarounds such as "add Italian to system languages", could anyone advise on how to address this issue, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Stefano</p>
<p />

<p>I have found a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to take ownership and rename two files located under System32.</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\MsSpellCheckingFacility.dll</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\MsSpellCheckingHost.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Before you rename, create a Windows restore point for a safe roll back:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Now, to take ownership, follow this guide:</p>
<p>https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-how-to-delete-files-protected-by-trustedinstaller/</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Then rename the files - I have just renamed them into:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\MsSpellCheckingFacility.dllOLD</p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\MsSpellCheckingHost.exeOLD</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Reboot, open Skype, type anything. No more spellcheck or autocorrect kicking in!!</p>

            Hi 786Baraq , you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Here is how to download and clean install version 1903 of Windows 10, you can use the same USB installation media on both devices . . .
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Pro) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Kath.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The PC should show up soon.  Did you just add it? Are the files there?  Did you  upload the files from the online site instead of drag them into the PC OneDrive folder?  That's not necessary almost ever.  I've rooted all my User folders in OneDrive for ten years to sync to the cloud and then back down to all my other devices, and go to online OneDrive about once or twice a year.  
<br />
<br />You also don't have to manually drag files from their home folders into OneDrive to sync them.  You can now move the entire Documents, Desktop and/or Pictures folders into OneDrive so they sync to the cloud in real time, even to your other devices you do this for.  See how to enable Folder Protection here:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks Greg, no this PC has been on for weeks. Still not showing AND my external drive crashed on me which was when I realized that none of my latest work had sunk. -
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a huge internal drive, (my older PC was a surface pro 2 that finally died, and I purchased a new dell... I had setup OneDrive, and setup
<strong>my external drive</strong> to be my OneDrive folder but somehow that was changed or something didn't get setup correctly because nothing had sync to OneDrive in the cloud even though Windows shows that my one drive is "up to Date" in the tray.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sync just "documents, desktop and pictures" I saw that little windows with those 3 folders and there was no way to drag to that screen nor does it show you where desktop/documents and pictures are - so I have assume it's my local internal
 drive rather than my external drive. which is NOT what I use at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I do since I have pretty small drives is to remap mydocs to my external drive. ... so maybe that didn't take in OneDrive even through my system is setup that way??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx</p>

            If OneDrive isn't syncing correctly then Unlink it in it's settings (right click OneDrive icon in System tray, choose Settings, then Accounts tab, then Unlink this PC.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, sign back into OneDrive app accessed in Start menu Apps list.  Set it up as you like.  It should work now.

<p>Greg I unlinked the account and reset it up.. took FOREVER because I don't want the onedrive to sit local but on my new external SSD drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally have that all working.. windows (in the tray says it up to date) everything on my computer side looks fine...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THAT SAID...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onedrive - IN THE CLOUD (when I am in a browser window) STILL doesn't see my new laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the tray on my new laptop it says that onedrive is "up to date"&nbsp; (like I mentioned previously)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but when I click from even the onedrive tray icon to "view Online" and then look my PC still isn't showing up...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the articles all mentioned which talk about files syncing down to the win10 box, I am looking to move files UP to one drive..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onedrive (app installed is installed and working, all instructions followed)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Says it's syncing but from the browser side my new laptop isn't listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is entirely frustrating to say the least..&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            There is no &#34;contacts&#34; icon to call a number using dial pad. Please, add one&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Please add it as it was in previous versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I need to make a call, I usually open dial pad and click on a icon that opens my contact book, where I choose a number and then I call. Right now there is no such option and I have to copy the number first and then paste it to Skype dial pad space. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The new Skype on iPhone and Android does not have the option to directly access your device's address book from the dial pad. If you are using this version of the app, you may try syncing your address book so you can directly access
 your phone contacts from Skype. Follow these steps below</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer nav bar taking ages to load. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mysterymanx93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer nav bar taking ages to load.</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this has already been posted before, so forgive me if it has. Too lazy to search right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Recently after installing/upgrading from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1, I've noticed that that navigation bar along with other stuff like thumbnails take ages to load (up to five minutes max). One example is if I right click on a file and click Properties,
 it'll take ages to load, and appear a few minutes later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt it's the cause, but I got a feeling it's because I didn't fully updated Windows before upgrading to 8.1. My usual routine for getting a new OS on the go, is install it &gt; install necessary bits (i.e. drivers, software) &gt; and install core/essential
 patches before installing others. And when I started to upgrade to 8.1, I went into the Windows Store, clicked on the 8.1 Upgrade ad, and started downloading it. It did it's thing, asked me to reboot, and it again did it's thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried are using built in Disk Clean-up (I usually use IOBIt's Advanced System Care Pro), turned off search indexing for my primary boot drive, un-installed unnecessary software, secure deleted any downloads I think may be suspicious or contribute,
 and open my rig up and only plugged in essential devices. I also ran Darik's Boot &amp; Nuke before installing Windows 8 on a quick erase cycle, just to be sure everything was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have utterly run out of ideas of what could be the problem. Maybe an installation error? I don't know. Help would be much appreciated, as I'm on the verge of going back to Windows 7, which I don't really want to do since I'm starting to like 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will leave a link bellow to some basic info about my rig. Please ask if you need any more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After upgrading to Windows 8.1, did you install all pending Windows Updates and update all device drivers?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to if there has been changes made to the system file settings associated with Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>You may temporarily disable the security software and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: If you have to temporarily disable the antivirus to install other software; you should enable the antivirus as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled,
 your computer is vulnerable to virus attacks. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, you may disable UAC and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span>To disable the User Account Control settings on the computer follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- Press “Windows Logo” + “W”, type “Account Control” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span>- In the “User Account Control Settings” window, move the slider to “Never Notify” and click “OK”. Once this is done, remember to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>Note: User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We
 don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then let us restart the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists. Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services.</span></p>
<p><span>If you're not signed in to Windows, tap or click the power icon from the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key, and then tap or click Restart.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode, then
</span></span><span>you may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the game. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup
 procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 4.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may also try running the Windows Updates and install all the available updates including the optional driver and firmware updates.</span></p>

</p><p>I did not make any changes to it. I also immidnetly fully updated Windows before doing anything else. This includes NVIDIA drivers, although they did seem to download themselves, so I removed the ones it installed, and installed the ones I downloaded from

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In a clean boot state only Microsoft drivers and services are running. So if an issue does not occur in a clean boot then it is indication that some 3<sup>rd</sup> party services are causing the issue. We need performan advanced clean boot to narrow
 down the actual cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Recommend you to refer the steps under”</span> <span>What is next when I have a clean boot environment?” from this article and check the status.</span></p>

                    <p>I have a <strong>Windows 10 Pro Box </strong>that has a DVD\CD ROM installed on it. I shared it so the other computer on my network can use it since my laptop doesn't have a CD ROM (<strong>this box is a Windows 10 Pro box as well</strong>). I get the following
 error (pic below):</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I had no problem accessing this shared DVD/CD Rom from my laptop but the computer that has the drive installed had Windows 7 Pro on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded this system and&nbsp;ever since I've upgraded to Windows 10 Pro 2 days ago, I get this error. I've googled and googled and can't seem to find anything as to what this could be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I appreciate your reply. I had already done the first thing you had suggested and it just wasn't working. I will read over that link you supplied and give that a try. Its so crazy because I have 3 computers at my office and all windows 10 pro and same version
 and i have no issue. they really need to fix this .. its a pain. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is I see all files and folders and external drives hooked up to the one computer. It's just the cd-rom that cant be accessed.</p>

<p>click on the shortcut to access the PC with CD drive using the IP Address instead of the host name used in the network folder.</p>
<p>Now do you see the shared CD drive ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you shared the CD drive and it actually has the drivers loaded and is usable, then you should see it and be able to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also reboot modem and restart all PC's on network.</p>

<p>I can do all that. I see ALL MAPPED Drives from the Computer that has the CD ROM attached and can click on the both and see all files and move them around. I also can see the printer that is shared on that computer as well and print to it also. I can see
 the CD/DVD drive but when i click on that . i get the message that i attached on the original post. I see and open all and print .. just cant access the DVD drive and it worked fine when that computer had Windows 7 Pro on it a few days ago. Now that Windows
 10 Pro is on there .. I cant access it but i can see it. The "D" drive is a data drive mapped and shared and accessible. The "G" drive is an external hard drive that is mapped and shared and accessible and the Printer is mapped and shared and it prints as
 well. The "E" drive is the DVD/CD ROM drive and I get the error when i click on it.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e1922aa-9741-4afc-985a-ba0a324998be?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e1922aa-9741-4afc-985a-ba0a324998be?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Well I will be honest. You keep talking about MAPPED drives. First of all, they are actually useless and just cause problems. You do not ever need to map any drives. I show on my article Connecting PC's and Users how to setup and use a network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I can suggest to try this</p>
<p>back in advanced sharing permissions for CD drive</p>
<p>Add in the user <strong>administrators </strong>with full permissions</p>
<p>Add in the user <strong>NETWORK, NETWORK SERVICE &amp; REMOTE USER LOGON </strong>
with full permissions and restart PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try this since CD is considered Media.</p>
<p><strong>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings</strong></p>
<p>All Networks&gt;&gt;Choose Media Streaming Options&gt;&gt;Turn on</p>
<p>Restart PC</p>
<p>

<p>30 years using PC's and I have 20 years in business and 10,000 PC's and hundreds of networks, and never shared a CD/DVD drive. Seems like it is counter productive when you have to go to the PC and insert the disks and such, unless you wanted to watch a movie
 or listen to music on another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill will keep thinking of more to try if I can.</p>

<p>I'm sorry .. shared drives ... i've been working on this so long my terminology has run askew. I just did all you had me do and i'm still getting the same access denied error. I just don't get it. I see all shared drives and can access them all .. even shared
 printer and it works ... i can even see the shared cd rom but when i access it i get that error and access denied.&nbsp; Totally frustrated.&nbsp;</p>

            I just tried all that and nothing.&nbsp; I totally get you and understand. I'm stumped on this. I've been using computers for 40 years and have been in business since 1998 .. own my own computer business and never run across anything as frustrating as this.
 I'm sharing the cd rom because my laptop doesn't have a cd rom in it and i need to install some items from some cd's and its the only way i can install this software. I don't have to keep getting up as my laptop is sitting on the desk that this computer is
 sitting on. If i didn't need this software ASAP installed, I'd say forget it .. but sadly I need it.

<p>Installing programs. Why didn't you say so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you right click the cd drive&gt;&gt;open folder location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the folder name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the the Laptop Public folder</p>
<p>Network Folder&gt;&gt;laptop name&gt;&gt;public</p>
<p>
</p><p>now create a folder with the same name as the main CD folder holding all the files in it. Copy and paste all the files to the created folder on laptop
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to laptop and find the installer file.</p>
<p>usually SETUP.EXE or similar.</p>
<p>C:\Users\Public\YOUR CREATED CD FOLDER</p>
<p>
</p><p>the program will install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I been doing this for years since windows 95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as the main folder is the same as the main folder on the CD and you copy all the files to it, you can install from the folder. It does not have to run from the CD,</p>

<p>Actually, Some of my CD's that are copied in to folders on my external drive, I just created a folder with my own name and copied all files into it and then ran the installer and they installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Office Pro Plus 2007 and Works 9 are 2 examples</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then once you install them, you can delete the CD folder in Public or wherever you store them.</p>

<h2>            Progress won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t save in Squads or Extinction modes</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an Xbox One on Friday 29 with CoD Ghosts. The campaing and multiplayer modes work perfectly but whenever I try to play the Squads or Extinction modes with my sister on local play/splits screen it says "Progress Won't Be Saved", and it gives me two
 options:</p>
<p>Continue without saving</p>
<p>Return to previous menu</p>
<p>I've tried playing it alone but it doesn't work either, and like I said it's just the Squads and Extinction modes. I'm a Gold suscriber, and I'm connected online.</p>

<h2>            How do I open the Print Queue for my HP Deskjet F2120 All-in-One printer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium. I had a problem with print jobs being&nbsp;stuck in the print queue, which caused the printer to become inoperative.</p>
<p>The print queue is cleared now, but I had to download a diagnostic tool from HP that scanned the printer and cleared the queue. That did fix the problem, but in the past when I had this same problem, I simply accessed the print queue and deleted the stuck
 jobs. I could not find a way to gain access to the print queue this time and I hope that someone out there can tell me what I did&nbsp; not do right.</p>

<p>С Иранским DNS не лучшая идея, боюсь что могут забанить вас и ещё и иранцы взломают. Лучше использовать VPN и нормальный регион, для игры онлайн вполне должно хватить. А так подобная ситуация была уже с Исламскими странами, Украину просто забанили. Нет никакой

Врятли Украину забанили. Тут и западные коллеги ноют. Много отИтальянцев постов и мексиканцев. За ДНС согласен. Забанят канеш врятли но данные украсть могут на изи просто. Жил бы в я Киеве, был бы там в первый день.

    <title>Can&#39;t rename folders in the &#34;Downloads&#34;-folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dekadinious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t rename folders in the &#34;Downloads&#34;-folder</h2>
                    I cannot rename any folders in the "Downloads"-folder on my Windows 7 computer. I do not get any error message, it just does not get renamed. It happens with new folders and old folder that could previously be renamed. It happens with the right-click "Rename"
 way of doing it, and with the F2-command. It also happens if I push "Enter" or if I just click away from the folder after renaming.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is kind of annoying to have three folders called "New Folder (2)" etc. that can not be renamed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen 1 post regarding this on another forum, but no solution, so I thought I had to ask myself. It has been like this for a long time, and I can't remember if a special event or thing tripped it.</div>

            Well, it happened to me and I just figured it out.
<div><br />
See if you are using a shortcut of the folder. If you are, try to enter the folder by its path (usually C:\Users\*Name of the user\Downloads) and see if you can Rename things there. If you can, just hit Backspace and create a shortcut from there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In my case this problem happened because I accidentaly deleted the shortcut that I was using for that folder, and to make the shortcut again I used the "Search" fuction to find it and create the .ink. But when I did that, the Windows 7 created the shortcut
 with the Search path, being %search%downloads and so on. That made the "Rename" fuction to stop working.]</div>
<div><br />
<div>Weird, for sure. But hey, it worked here. heh</div>
