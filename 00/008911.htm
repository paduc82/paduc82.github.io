<h2>            Removing and creating genre&#39;s</h2>
                    I have windows 10 version 1511 and windows media player 12. My updates are checked weekly for WMP and I scan my computer regularly. My problem is this. I have been trying to&nbsp;reorganize my music by genre's but have had no success.&nbsp;I want to delete the genre's
 I have and create new ones. However when I delete a genre in WMP it deletes all the music and artists in that genre and also in my music file in my documents. Even though I have the box checked not to&nbsp;delete music from my&nbsp;computer. How can I remove/delete
 the genre's in WMP and create new ones from my artist list in WMP? If I recall correctly I was able to do this with my Vista OS in the past. If this helps any, I created most of this list on Vista, some of it on my 8.1&nbsp;OS system and it migrated to OS 10 on
 this computer. I can wipe everything clean and start from scratch but that would take days. I would rather ditch this WMP system and get a third party program than start over from scratch.&nbsp; Thanks fo
                </div>

            <p>Hi - I think I get your drift here...</p>
<p>You don't want to delete the existing genres because you will mess up your WMP library, but you can change them.</p>
<p>It's just&nbsp;your method you need to alter. Can you give me an example of what you want to do and I'll try to put you on the right track. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>First of all thanks for the offer to help Ric.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I am trying to do. I have in my WMP library a list of 48 known artists and several unknown artists. These have been ripped off of various CD's I have purchased and some given to me through the years. I also have 12 types of genre folders that
 all of these artists are&nbsp;placed in. Over the years these genre's have become convoluted. I want to reorganize them by moving artists or albums into or out of the present genre's folders and make new genre folders that&nbsp;suit the type of music&nbsp;they contain. Some
 of the old genre folders I can keep.&nbsp;I have no playlists I use the&nbsp;genre's folders as the playlists. I think that if I could figure out how to move the artists and albums into and out of the genre's folders&nbsp;and then rename them that would work. This new 10
 OS and WMP 12 is not as easy to work with as I remember the old WMP systems. Thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I like the fact you have cottoned on to using genres as a kind of playlist... I do too and I think it's a trick that's under-used. For example - you may have a 'greatest hits' album which duplicates tracks from another set by the same artist - I 'genre'
 those as 'Best Of...' rather than 'Rock' or whatever the&nbsp;other album is in, so that the same track won't get played twice. I'll put together a few screenshots to help get you started because images are easier to follow... I'll post them up shortly. - Cheers
 Ric.</p>
<p>btw - when you say 'Unknown Artists' do you mean unknown to you - or just not recognized by WMP? (because you can correct that too.)</p>

            <p>Right - Screenshots as promised...</p>
<p>The key thing to making this easy to do is how you select '<strong>View</strong>' in WMP - I'd suggest you make an old-fashioned pen and paper list of what you want where, and then you can work from that without having to keep checking your files.</p>
<p>First of all, you want to choose 'Album' (circled)&nbsp;in the left pane. Then in&nbsp; the bar above the columns choose
<strong>'Details'</strong> from the dropdown box. You can then simply highlight an item&nbsp;in the 'Genre' column - right-click it and choose 'Edit' (shown in the upper&nbsp;red oval) and change it to another existing or a new genre of your choice. NB -&nbsp;you must click
<p>To change multiple items see the second screenshot....</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b2319cc-cf6c-4aa9-808f-cbf4ca2908c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b2319cc-cf6c-4aa9-808f-cbf4ca2908c8" height="398" width="727" /></a></p>
<p>In this view I have made a further change to the layout by selecting 'Organize - Sort By - Album Artist' which means that if, say in this example I wanted to change all of Al Stewart's albums to the 'Folk' genre, I can highlight all of them and right-click
 and 'Edit' over one that says 'Rock' and enter 'Folk' - all will become 'Folk' - saves doing every album one at a time. You may find you can make further adjustments to the view to help you change things more easily using the 'Sort by' option - if there are
 any columns (other than the default ones) showing that you don't want you can clear them by choosing 'Layout' (just below the 'Sort By' on the left) and then 'Choose Columns' - uncheck any not required. This may make the screen easier to work in. Let me know
 how it goes...</p>

            Thanks for the reply Ric,. I don't have time to work on this until this evening but I will certainly try it. &nbsp;As for the unknown artists, they are unknown to me. WMP recognizes them and plays the tracks. I will get back to you on how it works out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Ric,</p>
<p>Your instructions worked perfectly. Thanks again. I have a couple of other questions. I have some albums that have "various artists" in them. They are normally the best of&nbsp;such and such, then there may be a album&nbsp;by the same artist playing the same song.
 Is there a way to delete the duplicity of the songs and have them play only in one album or place?&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I did find in my library a album listed as "unknown" with the artist listed as "unknown" you mentioned that this may also be corrected.

            <p>Glad to hear main mission accomplished! Now, regarding duplicated items - if you want to keep the albums intact in your music folder, but remove duplicate versions from WMP the best bet is to use the 'Delete From Library Only' tool as shown in the screenshot
 below... (I have overlaid three shots into one to save space!) Use the 'Detail' tab as before with
 Only'...</p>
<p>Have a try with this method and see how you get on and let me know. (There are alternatives if this doesn't suit)</p>
<p>Now regarding the unknown item - do you know what/who it is or is it a complete mystery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps - if you wish to see this screenshot more clearly, click on it and it will open in a new tab.</p>

            <p>Ric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your instructions on removing the duplicate songs and sometimes triplicate songs worked perfect. Also in regards to my first question, when I finished readjusting the genres the unwanted ones were gone. Only the ones I made up and wanted were there.
</p>
<p>Most of the unknowns were various artists in Discs of "the most popular" or "greatest hits" etc. These I think I will just leave them unknown. You have been a great help, thanks. But I do have one more question. My files are in a WMA format and I want to
 leave them that way, I am transferring them to a flash drive to play in my sync system that is in my vehicle. I used to be able to find the format easily, and also the FAT 32. I cant seem to locate this information now.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi again - I should point out that tracks deleted from the library only and not from the pc will sometimes reappear in WMP (I suspect updates can be one of the causes) but hopefully it will hold.</p>
<p>I'm not quite getting what the problem is with the flash drive... usually if you just copy the files they will play (providing the wma format is supported) Can you expand on that a bit more? Cheers, R.</p>

            <p>Ric,-With this problem I think the trouble is with the sync system in my vehicle. The sync system is in a Ford F250 pickup, its voice activated. All I need to do in theory is say the genre or artist and the player will play all the albums and songs in the
 item asked for. It works for the most part but sometimes it will not recognize the&nbsp;word pronunciation. For example if I say the&nbsp;word "Folk" or "Folk Music" it will ask if I mean Fold.&nbsp;The word Celtic completely baffles it, no matter how you pronounce it. &nbsp;When
 I sync my music onto my flash drive I use the WMA format which is&nbsp;one of the formats my&nbsp;vehicle sync system recognizes.&nbsp;So, to get around this problem I have changed some of the genre's in my WMP library to words that my vehicle can recognize.</p>
<p>First I organize my WMP library, then sync to my flash drive, try the flashdrive in my vehicles player. Its a lengthily&nbsp;and time consuming process. However the help you provided was&nbsp;very useful and cut down the time and&nbsp;brain numbing process. Thanks again
 for the help.&nbsp;</p>

            Have you considered upgrading from xp to Vista.&nbsp; Vista uses Windows Mobile Device Center, the new activesync for Vista systems.&nbsp; A friend of mine has the Palm Pro running windows mobile 6.1 and it works great under this configuration.

<br />
Did you find the solution to this? - I am experiencing the same issue. Palm Pro running Windows Mobile 6.1 - trying to sync to Windows Vista PC - same issue you described.<br />
<br />
Hoping you found a fix somewhere.<br />

<h2>            How do I clear or empty out my Cloud account</h2>
                    <p>I installed Office Professional 2013 on Saturday. During the installation files were copied to the "Cloud"? and when I try to use one of the 2013 office programs I have to be on line. I do not want to operate this way.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I want to deinstall everything that was done on Saturday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I access the cloud files to see what is there and how do I remove them?</p>

    <title>Paste delimited text into existing table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> service desk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paste delimited text into existing table</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2007 I could take some comma delimited text, copy and paste into an existing table, each piece of data falling nicely into a seperate cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example of delimited data:</p>
<p>1, Jimmy Smith, 1.3, 5, 6.79</p>
<p>2, John Jones, 2.4,8, 10.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Word 2010 I can't get it to work.&nbsp; No matter how I try to paste the data, it ends up all in one cell, or many cells, (so it ends up looking like this, or with all the cells filled in with this same data).</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>1, Jimmy Smith, 1.3, 5, 6.79</span></p>
<p><span>2, John Jones, 2.4,8, 10.5</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</td>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>I can't imagine why such a basic feature would go away, so I must be just missing something.&nbsp; I've tried all the paste options that appear.</p>
<p>The folks trying to use this feature get a text files once a week, and then have to copy just a portion of that information into an already existing document, to update it for that week.&nbsp; So creating a new table out of the data is not really a feasible option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com and synching</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I use outlook 365 on my win10 laptop with outlook.com calendar and contacts. I have been having trouble synching with my phone. As an example I added two test contacts on my laptop in outlook 365 people. This synched with outlook live server. The separate
 people app on my laptop did not synch nor did the people app on my phone. Calendar appears ok.</p>
<p>I have deleted the outlook.com account on my phone and added it back In but still no synching.&nbsp; Also did soft restore on the phone. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Anna</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had issues fort a while but not this specific after testing with a couple of test contacts. Since my last post the people app on my laptop ( as separate from my outlook 365 contact/people) has been synched and test contact has been synched, but still
 not to my phone. Laptop is also win 10 with latest updates. Don't know why it takes that long to synch contacts when outlook mail comes through pretty well immediately.</p>
<p>Phone is lumia 950xl with latest updates to win 10.</p>
<p>On phone I have a Microsoft account plus outlook.com account for email&nbsp; calendar and contacts.</p>
<p>Not sure what the Outlook App is. I have the Outlook Calender, Mail and People app installed.</p>
<p>There is no error message, I can't see in the outlook.com settings where I can force a synch.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Joe</p>
<p>Under the Change Mailbox synch settings there is no option for advanced mailbox settings. The only reason I need to change the settings is because I was advised to by answers to fix a synch problem for contacts. Thetest contacts I set u are now synched.
 It just took several days?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I use outlook 365 on my win10 laptop with outlook.com calendar and contacts. I have been having trouble synching with my phone. As an example I added two test contacts on my laptop in outlook 365 people. This synched with outlook live server. The separate
 people app on my laptop did not synch nor did the people app on my phone. Calendar appears ok.</p>
<p>I have deleted the outlook.com account on my phone and added it back In but still no synching.&nbsp; Also did soft restore on the phone. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2010 only downloads 1 msg when &#34;send receive all messages&#34; is clicked &#40;so also with F9&#41;.</h2>
                    Earlier I was able to download&nbsp; all pending messages on clicking F9.&nbsp; However I find that during the last 1 week only 1 msg gets downloaded ech time F9 or "Send &amp; Receive all messages" is clicked.&nbsp; I ran the repair tool today but the problem persists.<br />

This is most annoying and kindly let me have a solution urgently.<br />

    <title>Excel 360 - Match Similar Row Values - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 360 - Match Similar Row Values</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to match exact values only if they are in the same row.&nbsp; For example on the table below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; B&nbsp; &nbsp;C&nbsp; &nbsp;D&nbsp; &nbsp;E&nbsp; &nbsp;F&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp; &nbsp;J&nbsp; &nbsp;K&nbsp; &nbsp;L&nbsp; &nbsp;M</p>
<p>1&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; 7&nbsp; &nbsp;8</p>
<p>2&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp;5</p>
<p>3&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp;5</p>
<p>4&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp; &nbsp; 7&nbsp; &nbsp;8</p>
<p>5&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp;5</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here I have a table array of B1:F5.&nbsp; I want to set a formula that looks at I1:M1 and says "if these 5 numbers are an exact match anywhere in this array in the same row, then return a value of 1.&nbsp; If all 5 in the same row do not match then leave "".&nbsp; So in
 the example above it would look at I1:M1 and say that there is 1 match because B4:F4 matches exactly.&nbsp; However, if F4 was 9 instead of 8 then it would not return a match because all 5 numbers are not matching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried several different things online and I often run into the issue of it just tallying up the number of times that each one of those numbers appears or it does not stay true to the fact that the numbers need to all match in the same row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Unable to renew my MSN Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliespivey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to renew my MSN Subscription</h2>
                    This happens every year and I am tired of it. You send out the notice of expiration, but no way to deal with it. I only want to renew because of the number of things associated with my email. This&nbsp;is typical slipshod Microsoft stuff. Until such time as
 you can actually include a way to renew your subscription, I would recommend NOT cutting off the service or face a possible class action suit. personally, I am tired of having my account compromised because someone hacked your servers and MSN just stopping
 in the middle of something. I have spent a lot of time this morning going through stuff trying to renew it and it is all a bunch of crap. I do intend on using something else, such as Yahoo or AOL, but am willing to pay the subscription fee in order to have
 access to my email / contact list. Once things are changed over to a new email address it will be Bye Bye to MSN. I am not going through this year after year anymore.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>go to&nbsp;<strong> <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>
</strong>and login with your MS/MSN credentials. Select one of the options from the "Payment and Billing" menu at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Beware of email scams, directing you to fake web sites, pretending to be a Microsoft website.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When asking a question please include links to any websites that you are having problems with your questions...</strong> that way we can visit the exact same website as you to investigate and to make sure it is not a web scam or a malware site. It
 may be that IE's security settings are preventing a fake website from doing things that you would not want a fake website to do.... (steal your credit card details)... you may think .... this website does not work (darn MS)... when in actual fact IE is preventing
 it from 'working' because of IEs security zone protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may also be that IE's security zone settings are preventing you from logging in with your MS account....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From IE go Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. IF you cannot login to your MS account at account.microsoft.com, Select the Trusted sites icon, 'Sites' button.... remove any websites you have listed in your IE Trusted sites list.... the security in the Trusted zone is actually lower... eg. Unsigned
 ActiveX controls are allowed to run... https (secure protocol) works just the same (eg. your data is encrypted) in other IE security zones... micorosoft and other public websites like google, facebook or apple use other websites like live.com or account.google.com
 to validate your user credentials.... if those domains are not also in the same IE security zone, IE will prevent your account verification... (navigation into a zone of lower integrity eg. Trusted to internet is not allowed in MSIE browsers)...<br />
<br />
Generally, home users should not use the Trusted Sites zone....public websites are designed to work in the IE Internet zone.... Only large companies would use the Trusted sites zone for their B2B transactions with other companies where they know the other company
 can be trusted even though they require a lower security setting to that required by public websites.</p>
<p>

            I did all of this and when I clicked the Renew Button all I got was the membercenter page. In the process, I got a number that turned out to be someone from South Asia saying my Account was closed because of security issues. I do not need this aggravation
 year, after year, after year. What is the problem with putting a Link to click in to take you to renew your subscription ?&nbsp; Is this beyond the ability of the site designers to do this? I started at 8 am yesterday and at 1:30 pm. I finally got it renewed after
 finding a Phone Number and waiting on hold for a while. All I did was go in circles. I was in the forums and NONE of the answers given were any good.

<h2>            N97 connects on internet via WIFI or 3G automatically</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all. I have a problem with my N97 which seems to be animated by self-determination in connecting on the internet without me wanting it to ..</p>
<p>In other words, both at home and when I go abroad, it appears that the phon eautomatically connects to the internet, downloading data, without me even knowing it ..</p>
<p>Of course, at home, this is a sort of no problem ( I have a flat fee agreement with the service provider, and the data downoladed is very limited in amount, so .. no charges); when I go abroad, however, the problem becomes quite a serious one, given the
 fees for data roaming charged by the local provider ..</p>
<p>Can anyone explain me how to stop this ? I tried all I could think and read of so far, but with no success ...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This is usually caused by various applications or widgets that you have have inadvertantly set to update or sync regularly or at regular intervals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first suspect on the N97 would be the homescreen widgets. You need to set them, to offline. You do this by tapping Options&gt;Widgets to offline from your homescreen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, go through the settings of your email mailboxes and ensure that they are not set to sync at frequent intervals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next check social and IM apps like whatsapp, facebook etc and make sure they are n=ot set to update too often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, it is best to set all updates and syncs to manual if you don't want regular automatic connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cjlim, thanks for Your prompt reply.</p>
<p>However, and here stays the problem, all You kindly mention, has been done alreaddy.</p>
<p>I have no homescreen widgets ...</p>
<p>Email is correctly set to manual ..</p>
<p>No social and IM apps on the phone ..</p>
<p>and finally I went through all apps which appear by default on the phone (actually, the ones remained after I tried to disinstall them, with no success ..) and they are all set to manual too ..</p>
<p>I am really lost ....</p>

<p>It is probably due to the settings of a rogue app which unfortunately have to be hunted down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you remember this problem starting after the installation of change in setup of a particular application? Does the phone connect all the time or at regular intervals or at certain times of the day or when certain apps are running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many other apps which may require internet connection as well, such as weather apps, or apps that require position fix. May be worth disabling everytghing other than Integrated GPS in Positioning Methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot recall the exact date of when the problem started; I noticed it when I got the first bill from the provider, showing a few hundred euros in "roaming connections" ..</p>
<p>Accordint to the provider, the phone connects when ... it wants ... (ie: several times per minute, and then not for a while, then again once or twice, then silence .. and so on ..)</p>
<p>For Maps,. I imemdiatly set it to manual when got the phone; at that time I had no flat fee service (and did not want to use internet or email on the phone .. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really disturbing and confusing ... is there a way to set all applications together to go only for "manual" connection ?</p>

<p>With maps, you need to change two settings to stop it accessing the internet. The first is top set the application itself to "Offline". You do this from within the Ovi Maps application at Settings (spanner)&gt;Internet&gt;Connection, set to offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also neet to disable all Positioning Methods except Integrated GPS. &nbsp;This is done from the phones main settings menu and if I am not mistaken it should be Positioning&gt;Positioning Methods, Integrated GPS should be the only one ticked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from Ovi Maps there are a various applications which could potentially also positioning such as the Camera, compass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you could keep an eye on the phone to see if there is any pattern to the connections which could help to pin down the rogue application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other option would be to reset the phone and blitz the problem, whichever app it may be.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I regret the inconveniences that you are having with your account
<br />
<br />If you're having trouble signing in to your Microsoft account, there could be a few different reasons for that – like you can't remember your password, have two-step verification turned on, are travelling, or using a new device.
<br />
<br />Here are some suggestions to help you get back into your account as quickly as possible. First, try the easiest options:
<br />
<br />If you remember your password but it isn’t working, make sure that Caps Lock is turned off and that your email address is spelled correctly. 
<br />Clear your browser history, or try signing in to your account from a different internet browser.
<br />Make sure that you're connected to the Internet and that you have a strong network connection. If you have both of those and are still having trouble, we recommend trying to connect using a hard-wired ethernet port, if it's available.
<br />If you've recently changed your password, try entering your old one again. If your old password works, you must lock your device and then unlock it using your new password. 
<br />If these don't help get you back in to your account, try resetting your password or see if one of the other scenarios below applies to you and give them a try.
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - cannot rename or delete folder</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 on my Lenovo laptop with Windows 10.&nbsp; If I try to delete an empty folder I get a dialogue box saying 'move&nbsp;to deleted items&nbsp;folder?'&nbsp;&nbsp; I click yes and the folder disappears.&nbsp; A few seconds later it reappears.&nbsp; Its similar if I try to
 rename it.&nbsp; The folder changes name for a few seconds and then changes back to its original name.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have Outlook on my Surface RT (windows 8.1) and the same thing happens.&nbsp; The two devices synchronise.&nbsp; Is the problem with the synchronisation?&nbsp; I've
 tried deleting the folder from both devices simultaneously but that doesn't work.&nbsp; I am the only user of both computers, no shared folders and I cannot change folder permissions because on both computers, in Outlook the 'Folder Permissions Properties' is greyed
 out.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hello AmandaChiz, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience. <br />
<br />
I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />
See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a><br />
<br />
In case it is still not working for you, it could be a <strong>browser-related issue</strong>.
<br />
<br />
May I suggest you to delete your <strong>Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies</strong> and clear
<strong>browser caches</strong> then restart the browser? <br />
<br />
- selectively deleting browser cookies <br />

- clearing browser caches <br />
<a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a><br />
<br />
Alternatively, open in private mode ("incognito mode") or try with a different browser
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, clear your <strong>DNS revolver caches</strong>: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter
<code><strong>cmd.exe</strong></code> then key in <code><strong>ipconflig /flushdns</strong></code><br />
<br />
Please ensure that your browsers have <br />
<br />
- <strong>JavaScript</strong> enabled: <a href="https://www.enable-javascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

- <strong>Silverlight</strong> enabled: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
We are really sorry for the inconvenience caused and please do not hesitate to let me know if you require additional assistance.
<br />
<br />
Cheers! <br />

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Microsoft is having problems with the Outlook.com service 
<br />User Impact: Users may be unable to access their mailbox from Outlook, Outlook on the web, mobile devices, or other protocols.
<br />Current status: The deployment has almost reached 100% saturation. We are seeing a few isolated outlier availability issues on a small portion of infrastructure that has received the fix. We're analysing diagnostic data and service log files to identify why the fix was ineffective for some customers. 
<br />Scope of impact: Impact is specific to users that are attempting to access their mailbox using basic authentication.
<br />Start time: Thursday, November 15, 2018, at 10:05 PM UTC
<br />Preliminary root cause: A recent update introduced an issue impacting service availability. As a result, users may be unable to access their mailbox via multiple protocols.
<br />Next update by: Friday, November 16, 2018, at 12:30 PM UTC
<br />
<br />You can validate the service status in:

            Hello AmandaChiz, 
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that Outlook.com remains inaccessible to you. It was indeed a service outrage at Microsoft end, and had a few outliers despite reportedly fully fixed. 
<br />
<br />Please try accessing Outlook.com again, maybe with Microsoft Edge/IE11 in private mode. 
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026200/windows-browse-inprivate-in-microsoft-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/402620...</a>
<br />
<br />Since it was a service interruption on Microsoft's side, no further actions required for your Microsoft Outlook except DNS revolver caches.
<br />
<br />Let me know if it works. 
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />Sutharsan

<h2>            Data Execution Prevention&#47;No Execute &#40;DEP&#47;NX&#41;  causing &#39;Webpage has expired&#34; issue.</h2>
                    I believe I have found a memory issue/bug with IE 8. The outward symptom from a user's perspective is a "Webpage has expired" error in the browser, or a "This tab has been recovered" error, after they click a save button on your site. The symptom seems
 to be only for users using IE 8 on XP, and viewing a page that has a substantial amount of content (generally pages over 700k of data).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of the MS "Internet Explorer Compatibility Evaluator" reveals that when this issue happens, IE is throwing a Data Execution Prevention/No Execute (DEP/NX) under the hood. Turning off the DEP for Internet Explorer makes no difference, the error will occur.
 Also, usage of compatibility mode in IE makes no difference. Also, running IE in 'no add-ons' mode makes no difference. The users experiencing this isuue are able to work with an equivalent page that has mush smaller content just fine (with nothing else different
 about the page). So I believe this to me a memory management issue with IE 8. Also,&nbsp; I believe the DEP error being reported is a red herring, because running IE without DEP makes no difference.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This symptom has already cost thousand of dollars in irate customers abandoning their work on the site. Please suggest some solutions that do not involve 'reset IE settings', or 'try these random service packs'. This error users are seeing is not relevant
 to any install toolbars or add-ons. A clean PC running a fresh XP install with a new install of IE 8 will experience this same symptom doing the same work on the same page the users are doing. For reference, there are literaly thousands of other users with
 zero symptoms who are not using the XP IE 8 combination.<br />
As more of our users start switching to IE 8, I am sure this issue will become more pronounced.
<br />
So please offer some doable steps to remedy this, as telling the userbase that we don't support IE 8 will be a painful path to walk down.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Below is the output from the IECE Tool for when the crash happens:<br />

&lt;/IssueXml&gt;<br />
&lt;Details&gt;<br />
Data Execution Prevention/No Execute (DEP/NX) option in Windows Internet Explorer 8 prevents code from running in non-executable memory. When a violation occurs, the browser stops responding instead of running malicious code. When Internet Explorer 8 has recovered
 from a crash caused by DEP/NX, this event is logged. Typically, DEP/NX failures occur due to attempts to exploit the browser or its add-ons. But it is possible that a browser add-on is not compatible with DEP/NX, and failures occur even without malicious content.
 If an incompatible add-on is found, contact the add-on developer for an updated version. For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=120596.<br />

<h2>            Sound Problems With 10240</h2>
                    I have a HP ENVY dv6-7214nr Notebook PC with Beats Audio. After installing version 10240 I have no volume icon on the task bar. When I go to settings to where you want to show icons on the desktop, It is off and locked out. Also my Beats audio does not
 work. Volume is low and barely audible. Fortunately. this computer is a test machine and I will not be upgrading my other devices until these problems are fixed. One more day to go and this happens. Has anyone else run into these problems? If so, I would appreciate
 any help.

            Thanks Navneet for the reply. I tried all that you suggested but nothing has changed. In Fact, when I downloaded the audio driver it would not install. Said was incompatible with the OS. I guess my best hope is to wait until there is an ISO available so
 I can do a clean install.

            <p>i'm on build 10240, installed with esd files of windows update (so the new build out today for all)... i have an hp pavilion 3013sl, IDT driver here too. Drivers was perfectly working on insider build 10240, but now just don't. I tried to uninstall and reinstall
 4 different version of drivers in different compatibility mode, and nothing has chnged. They install on my pc but IDT control panel doesnt work, audio is thin and not loud on headphone and on pc speakers. I have this problem only on older build 9926, but in
 all other builds audio was just perfect. So what's happened in this latest release? Please help us... it's useless a pc without a good sound, and uninstall driver isn't a solution (sounds really bad) because is for sure a problem of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I event tried to install this build on a vhdx partition with clean install and the problem is there too, so it's not a problem of update process.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can I apply a color scale to certain cells in a column, depending on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#64;manda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I apply a color scale to certain cells in a column, depending on corresponding cells in another column&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to do a complicated conditional format and I'm stumped. I don't know if this is even possible. I have a table which includes three columns of dates: Date Posted, Date Due, and Date Sent. Date Posted has a date in every row. Date Due and Date
 Sent have some blank cells. I have done a custom sort that sorts Date Sent by oldest to newest and then sorts Date Posted by oldest to newest, so every row with a value in Date Sent appears at the top of my table. I want to apply color scales to the Date Posted
 and Date Due columns, but only if the corresponding cell in Date Sent is blank (i.e. the bottom portion). I can manually select only that range, but then it will not update when I add rows or enter more dates. I can easily highlight the top rows in some other
 color if Date Sent has a value, but all that does is cover the color scale. My color scale for Date Posted goes from cyan to magenta so the visible color scale starts at a dull blue that way. I want the oldest date that does not have a value in Date Sent to
 be cyan. I would like the top portion to have no color. I guess what I would like to do is use a formula to choose the cells I want to format (the ISBLANK function could be handy here), but then apply a color scale to that group of cells instead of a single
 format. Is there some way I can do this?<br />

I'm not sure I made this clear: I want the color scales to reflect the data in the highlighted cells (not the values in the other column). I basically want to apply the color scale to a subset of the column. I'm thinking it still can't be done though. I can
 manually change the range the color scale applies to but it's annoying to update it constantly. This is frustrating.<br />

            You'd need a formula to include a condition on the Date Sent column, and that is not possible.

<p>Your formula as-is should work fine, unless something else is happening .. eg "destructive" actions such as cut, move, paste, delete etc in the source data sheet&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd examine how&nbsp;the data process (eg data refresh)&nbsp;is being done on the source data sheet&nbsp;<br />
Eg #REF! would result if you do a copy n paste into the source data sheet, rather than a copy n paste special as values<br />

<p>Thank you for your reply Jim, yes that's the problem that I have. &nbsp;I am now unable to attach photo's to an outgoing email which is useless for me. &nbsp;I must admit that I thought I had the current Outlook in Office 365 home package as I've been &nbsp;paying &nbsp;a subscription

            You should be able to attach photos to email. You just can't browse the content you have in the Pictures app directly from Outlook 2011. You should have no trouble inserting pictures by dragging them into an HTML formatted email or attaching them to any
 email.&nbsp;

            It appears the font has a limited character set (lowercase only, with no international characters). You'll need to look for another, similar font if you want those characters.

<p>Hi Vagn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to use the manual setup method to configure it. If the issue still persists, what we recommend is using the Outlook for Android to get easy email and calendar management.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can try to add your account in other Android phone to check whether the issue is related to specific device. If the issue still persists and you get the same error message, please contact
 your Office 365 admin to check if he or she enables Exchange ActiveSync for your account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<p>Hi Leo</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for teh late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have tried to manual configure the account but it does not work. I have a Samsung Galaxy S8+.</p>
<p>It's not only me who has the problem. Seems to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Samsung&nbsp;problem trying to add the account as an Exchange account for use with the native Samsung Apps. (Iphone works.) Office 365 administrator say it is somthing with auto detektion which is not woorking
 with Samsung.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Vagn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually what I recommend is using our dedicated Outlook on Android email app which has better compatibility with your Office 365 account. Please try the following test about your ActiveSync, this
 may tell us whether the issue is related to the your account's connectivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log in
</span><a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer</span></a><span>.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to Office 365&gt;Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync Connectivity Test.</span></li><li><span>Run the following two test and send the report back to me in
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox"><span>PM (Private Message)</span></a><span>, I will further check it for you.</span></li></ol>

 you tried to perform it?</p>

<p>Hi Vagn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are too many errors in the test result and it's hard to find the root cause according to it. Given the situation, please check the following options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>May I ask if there are any firewall settings that block port 443? Please change a network environment and check it again (This test doesn't need to perform
 on a phone, you can directly perform it on a PC). In the result this port cannot successfully establish connection.
</span></li><li><span>Can you normally use your mailbox in other places such as Outlook client? If so, is it under the same network environment as this test?
</span></li><li><span>Have you tried using Outlook for Android? If so, what is the outcome?</span></li><li><span>According to your description " Office 365 administrator say it is somthing with auto detektion which is not woorking with Samsung", do you mean others in your organization
 also have the same issue with Samsung phone?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Original title: BLOCKED OUT OF ACCOUNT!!! why?!!</p>
</font></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have had my account blocked due to suspicion of somebody else using my account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried to regain access through the 'Can't access your account?' link both trying to gain access via another email, or through the questionaire which I had filled out more than 24 hours ago, however none of it works.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Even after when I filled in my telephone mobile number several times a code was never sent to my mobile device. (+447535604464).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I then phoned support to see if the issue could be solved there, however to my dismay they told me only online support was available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So after trying endlessly to regain access to my account via the questionnaire, my only last option is here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It worries me as it is imperative that I have access to my email, otherwise I cannot work (my job requires emailing clients etc), I feel rather helpless if I'm honest and really need this issue resolved asap, it is costing me money and is affecting
 me in a VERY personal way!!!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Pocket MSN Login Error - Original Q - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> llebcire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pocket MSN Login Error - Original Q</h2>
                    
<div>Started getting a login failed error about 3 days ago on my Moto Q (WM5). I've since done a master reset to no avail.<br />
<br />
"Sign-in failed. Please try again."<br />
<br />
Wierd thing is that I can sign into Messenger with the same software, as well as MSN Mobile Home and get into my e-mail there. From what I've heard WM6 supporting the new Windows Live Mobile software works fine.<br />
<br />
Did something change around the first of December to cause this with the server? Is there a way to modify the registry so that I can set my Hotmail account up in a similar fashion to my Gmail? As soon as the OS recognizes the @hotmail.com designation, it sends
 me to Pocket MSN. Is there a way to completely remove Pocket MSN?<br />
<br />
I'd really like to get this working without having to revert everything to my Gmail account!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div>

<p>In the thread referenced above at page 4, a solution to this Pocket MSN <br />
problem as been posted, and it works :-)</p>
<p>&lt;Quote</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="http://www.verisign.com/support/roots.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.verisign.com/support/roots.html</a><br />
2. Fill in the form and click "Accept" in order to download "roots.zip".<br />
3. Open the zip and extract the file named "Class 3 Public Primary <br />
Certification Authority - G2.cer" located at "VeriSign Root <br />
Certificates\Generation 2 (G2) PCAs\". This is the certificate we need.<br />
4. Send it to your Pocket PC and open it there.<br />
5. A pop-up will ask you to install the certificate, click Yes.<br />
6. Now you can use Pocket MSN again !!<br />
If you can open zip files in your device then you can do the download/unzip <br />
stuff from it. Also you can install all the certificates if you want to.<br />
EQ&gt;</p>
<p>Pass it on.</p>

<p><span><span>The Pocket MSN service will be shut down in Mar 2010, which may affect users ability to access the services offered through Pocket MSN.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Pocket MSN was a premium service (onetime fee) that offered access to MSN services (ie. Hotmail, Messenger) on Windows Mobile devices in 2005.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In 2008, Microsoft provided an e-mail message to Pocket MSN users &nbsp;on how to upgrade access to Hotmail and Messenger.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A user may continue to have access to Hotmail and Messenger on Windows Mobile device by the following the instructions below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the device use Internet Explorer to browse
</span><a href="http://wl.windowsmobile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://wl.windowsmobile.com</span></a></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>The best language should be detected automatically (so you should land on the Korean page if your device is set to Korean language).</span></span></p>
<p><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>For a non-touch phone like the Blackjack, you should be presented with the standard download.</span></span></p>
<p><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Download and install the cab.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If this option does not work, another option is to access Windows Live Browse for Windows Live mobile services. Access Windows Live Browse from your mobile internet
 browser:&nbsp; <span><a href="http://mobile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://mobile.live.com</span></a></span></span></span></p>
