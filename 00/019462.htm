    <title>Unreadable Content - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unreadable Content</h2>
                    I was working on a word document when my computer ran into a problem and had to restart. Now I can't reopen the document, with an error coming up saying "Word found unreadable content in...Do you want to recover the contents of this document? If you trust
 the source of this document, click yes". But it still doesn't open after clicking yes to recover it. I've tried opening the document on another computer, the "open and repair" and exporting the document via 7-zip installer, but nothing seems to work. Any help
 is greatly appreciated!

            Hi GeorgaBruechert,
<br />
<br />I'm Tyler, an independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />You can apply some steps to fix the content unreadable issue of MS Word Application. For that, follow the given below steps:
<br />
<br />Trick 1: If the issue is caused by the add-ins installed in MS Word, you can try opening the application with any add-in being enabled.
<br />
<br />First, click on Windows + R keys together to open Run box on your system and type winwordin the box and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />This command will make MS Word open but prohibit the automatic loading of add-ins and global templates, so if you can easily open the file without the error, then the problem lies with the Add-ins or Macros.
<br />
<br />Trick 2: You can also try the Windows option to retrieve data from the corrupted Word file.
<br />
<br />For this one, open MS Word and click on CTRL + O. Then, Choose ‚ÄúRecover Text from Any File‚Äù from the drop-down list of File Types.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps you.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />Tyler.

<br />
<br />If Tyler's suggestions do not work for you, and if that file does not contain any sensitive data, upload a copy of that file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . etc) and post a link here, I will have a look for you to see if that file or any of its content can be recovered

                    Just download the Raffle tickets with consecutive numbering and matching stubs from the Microsoft Office website. It is a 2003 version and I have Office 2010. &nbsp; The template has sequential numbering and displays 8 tickets on 2 pages, but I need 3000 tickets.&nbsp;
 How do I add more tickets to this document.&nbsp; I have looked online for tutorials, but most are for starting a ticket from scratch.&nbsp; Please help!!

            I haven't seen the template, but the sequential numbers are probably the result of SEQ fields.&nbsp; Try copying and pasting the content (repeatedly) then CTRL+a then F9 to update the fields.

            Dear Billy,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />It‚Äôs terrible to hear about your loss and I express my sincere sympathy to you.
<br />
<br />There is a way to try to restore this important letter, but the chances are slim, as it all depends on the server status and what happened to the storage, but since i is important email, it is worth to try.
<br />
<br />In order to retrieve the emails that were deleted more than 30 days you can use Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser)
<br />For the new Outlook.com
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &amp;gt; Customize actions, then click ‚ÄúGet Add-ins‚Äù and hit save. (Note: If you already have the ‚ÄúEmail Recovery‚Äù under Customize actions, please proceed in clicking on it, then hit save, and proceed in step # 10.)
<br />4. In ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù folder, click an email (if you don‚Äôt have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the ‚ÄúGift‚Äù icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type and enter ‚ÄúEmail Recovery‚Äù (without quote symbol)
<br />7. In the search result, under the ‚ÄúEmail Recovery‚Äù, click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button.
<br />8. Click ‚ÄúX‚Äù icon to exit.
<br />9. Go back to ‚ÄúCustomize actions‚Äù page, click ‚ÄúEmail Recovery‚Äù and hit save.
<br />10. Again, in ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù folder, click an email, then the ‚ÄúEmail Recovery‚Äù icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />11. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />12. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />13. Once it‚Äôs finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />
<br />I hope these helped to recover your emails you‚Äôre looking for.

            Hello BillyFang1,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear your wife's loss.
<br />
<br />I regret to inform you that deleted emails are permanently unrecoverable after 30 days. This is a common practice across all free online email services like Yahoo! Mail and Gmail.
<br />

<h2>            How can I get rid of Super Optimizer and Vosteran&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I can‚Äôt get rid of Super Optimizer, nor clean up totally after getting rid of Vosteran. They both appeared at about the same time.</span></p>

<p><span>When I go to uninstall Super Optimizer I get a message saying c:\Program Files (x86)\Super Optimizer\unins000.msg is missing ‚Äì correct the problem or obtain a new copy of the program.</span></p>

<p><span>I have managed to get rid of most of Vosteran‚Äôs manifestations but not all of them. I uninstalled it and stopped all the browsers in all my accounts looking for it as the start page, but it reappears
 quite often.</span></p>

<p><span>I am running Windows 7 Home SP1. I have got one Administrator account and four User accounts. As browsers I use Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, all up-to-date, or so I believe. My
 PC is backed up by Windows to an external hard drive. I run Microsoft Security Essentials.</span></p>

<p><span>There has already been a saga getting to this point. At an early stage I got the blank blue screen in the Administrator account. I have now rolled back to a restore point before when I think the
 machine got infected, but Super Optimizer is still installed and I can't uninstall it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I would be very grateful for suggestions for what to do.</span></p>

<p><span>To get rid of Super Optimizer could I create a dummy file in the Super Optimiser folder with the name of the missing file and then try uninstalling again?</span></p>

<p><span>Googling brings up a lot of recommendations for software to deal with these two bits of malware. How can I find out which are safe to use?</span></p>

<h2>            Why spartan use a different favorites folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>spartan use <strong>C:</strong>\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Spartan_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\Spartan\User\Default\Favorites</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 11&nbsp;use DRIVE:\User\USERNAME\Favorites</p>
<p>
</p><p>The favorites folder for the IE is a "library" and it's understandable and useful. (e.g. for backups)</p>
<p>But the spartan favorites directory seems to me a little bit bad. </p>
<p>I have the misgiving the reason for this is not, that the IE and spartan should run completly separate, I&nbsp;guess in the final retail version it's the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why MS give up the idea of "library directories" for the IE/Spartan? What's the reason for this?</p>
<p>I can imagine that other Apps/Application maybe use the favorite directory too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And, if I look in the spartan directory I wonder about the destination for temporary internet files too.)</p>

            <strong>I think </strong>due to testing 'Sparta' and a lot of issues with it,&nbsp;it was separated from Internet Explorer so You know that 'Sparta' is actually 'Sparta' and IE is IE for now...

            <p>Hi Carlo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visual voicemail is a third party application and we&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;say anything regarding the compatibility of third&nbsp;party applications with Windows 10 insider preview builds,&nbsp;you may have to contact the publisher regarding this query. However,&nbsp;we cannot predict&nbsp;Microsoft
 releasing&nbsp;any&nbsp;such feature, it may or may not be released. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further&nbsp;related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Word 2016&#58; &#34;Insufficient memory...&#34; message when opening some documents</h2>
                    <p>I have several templates I created with Office 2010: word.&nbsp; When I create a new document from these, I get the above messages.&nbsp; I sometimes can't save the file nor print it.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have search thru community posts and have tried the following to resolve my problem:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>tried selecting entire document and changed font - error remains</li><li>removed normal.dotx - error remains<br />
</li><li>reinstalled office 2016 - error remains</li><li>I tried copying the entire document to paste into a new word document but get errors when I paste in the new document.&nbsp;<br />
"Word has encountered a problem. You will not be able to undo this action once it is completed. Do you want to continue?"&nbsp; answer yes, then get<br />
"There are too many edits in the document. This operation will be incomplete. Save your work."&nbsp; &nbsp;I end up with a blank document</li><li>I opened it with LibreOffice Writer and saved it with the option: "Use Microsoft Word 2007-2013 XML Format", then opened the saved document with Word (2016) and get the same "insufficient memory" messages.&nbsp; Performance Monitor shows 10,822,000 MBytes Available</li><li>I tried saving the document as a .doc, .docm, and .dotx.&nbsp; I get the same error when I open the "new" file.</li><li>I tried exporting to pdf and it fails&nbsp;with "The export failed due to an unexpected error."</li><li>I tried saving it to .odt, and it also fails with more memory type messages. (I can list them if that would help)</li><li>I tried printing the dosument and looks like it worked, but nothing gets to the printer.</li></ul>
<p>I had similar problems on many of my excel files, but I was able to recreate them to resolve the problems.&nbsp; I do not want to recreate all the word docs I am having problems with.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are there any other ideas out there?<br />
Gee, LibreOffice?!?<br />

            <p>Same here, managed to start in safe mode and disable start up programs and that seems to have fixed it (praises demo gods). cldflt.sys description is "Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver" so OneDrive maybe? Shame we can not uninstall it from Windows 10 to see.
 But the only thing in my startup list in Task Manager that is Microsoft related is Skype and Windows Defender Notification. Not sure if those use cldflt.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wasn't able to rollback the insider update from safe mode but machine doesn't seem to be in a BSOD loop any more so I'll stick with it for now. Can't see an attach button (need more coffee) but if dump files are requested I can upload them somethere and
 provide links / find the attach button. The caused by address is&nbsp;cldflt.sys+362cc if that is help to anyone. If any info is requested give a shout and I'll get on it.</p>

cldflt BSOD dumps</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Following Jack's advice, I started disabling startup items that would use the cloud. I disabled OneDrive first, but the BSOD still happened. I then disabled KeyBase and the BSODs stopped happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I then tried to manually start OneDrive it gave me the sign-in window which threw 4 or 5 js errors. It just showed a blank white window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, before I disabled the startup items, I would see the same OneDrive sign-in window appear and the same set of js errors just before the BSOD happened.</p>

            <p>Enabled Keybase run on startup and the BSOD did return so I believe that is the cause. Guess its time to pester KeyBase on their GitHub.

<p>
</p><p>Opened an issue on their client GitHub as i'm not 100% sure if its a client or kbfs issue.</p>

<h2>            Searching hidden fields in SharePoint lists</h2>
                    <p>Two questions relating to viewing and searching fields in a SharePoint list under different operating systems. The context is a list created in SharePoint Online ("SPO").
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the form fields viewable and editable for the same task list appear differently on SharePoint Online, Outlook (Windows desktop version), and the iOS SharePoint app. One of those fields is ‚ÄúAssigned To.‚Äù That field, which appears in both SPO and Outlook,
 does not even appear under iOS. Is there any way to force it, so I can search on it? Otherwise, there‚Äôs no way under iOS to identify tasks by delegate.
<br />
<br />
A related question is how to search by field in a SPO list. How can I search for ‚ÄúSmith‚Äù in the ‚ÄúAssigned To‚Äù field in SPO without hitting ‚ÄúSmith‚Äù in the name, description, or other fields?</p>

<p>I don't think you can configure the list search without code, but generally folks use the built in filters to narrow down the list items. You can also filter results shown with a url query parameter like:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you just have to display the different options as links on the page.</p>

                    Hello, i just bought a HTC-TyTN in Shanghai, China, they had the WM6 software installed in Chinesse so before buying it i asked them to install the English version... They did so, but since it is my new PPC (I used to use Palm), I didn't realize that it

<h2>            Problems with Excel Web App on iPad with bluetooth keyboard</h2>
                    I've been a long time Excel web apps user and really want to get the full experience on my iPad. I use an external bluetooth keyboard and notice that I can't navigate between cells or type freely. Instead I have to double tap on different cells to edit
 them.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am I the only one experiencing this? Are there plans to improve the iPad experience?&nbsp;</div>

            Can you check if the same happens with other key boards.<br />
MS does look for suggestions on how to improve the ipad experience while working with office apps, so there would definitely be improvements later on.<br />

            Thanks for the reply!
<div><br />
<div>I've tried this with a Logitech FabricSkin keyboard cover and an Apple bluetooth keyboard. Same behavior - I can't use the arrow keys to navigate cells nor can I start typing unless I double-tap a cell.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ideal behaviour woud be as follows (basically I'd love similar keyboard behavior as on the desktop)</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard arrow keys navigate the cell selector between cells</li><li>Cell would allow typing immediately when the cell is selected (instead of requiring an additional tap)</li></ul>

<strong>
<p>2) After downloading the correct .iso file install HashCalc and validate the SHA1 hash value is correct.</p>

<p>(Note: If the download is not corrupt, the value HashCalc returns will match the SHA1 value I posted, hash values are not case sensitive; Example: an upper case letter A is the same as a lower case letter a)</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>a) Launch HashCalc and navigate to the location of the .iso file you downloaded.</p>
<p>(The default download location is: C:\Users\User account name\Downloads)</p>
<p>b) Remove all check marks from the list of HashCalc options except for SHA1.</p>
<p>c) Click the ‚ÄòCalculate‚Äô button and wait for the SHA1 string of letters and number to be displayed.</p>

<p>Note: When installing ImgBurn, choose the "Custom Installation (advanced)" option and remove the check mark(s) to eliminate unwanted options, including Optimizer Pro (I do not accept) which is not needed.</p>

            I don't know that this will help or not, so try and report back with it did or didn't.
<br />
<br />
Format menu &gt; Columns look for unhide. If there the click it. See what happens. If unhide is greyed out or missing altogether the the act of saving as XML&nbsp; altered the file some way. I've never saved as XML so I am not familiar with what it alters.<br />
<br />
IF it didn't help them someone with better knowledge that can step in and say whether that's normal<br />
<br />
You may have to open a Blank document and then import the file. rather than just trying to open it.<br />

            What steps did you take to group the columns? There isn't a "group columns" command in Excel so we don't know what you did to the columns.

            I don't mean to sound like a smart aleck, but that message <span style="font-style: italic">
is</span> the answer to your question :-)<br />
<br />
XML implementation in Mac Office is limited &amp; a number of features cannot be parsed into XML for other reasons as well... This is one of them. As a result, any of the outline that's collapsed when the XML Spreadsheet is generated is interpreted as Hidden because
 the Group &amp; Outline mechanism can't be preserved.<br />
<br />
If by "sort this out" you mean force the XML file to retain features which it can't support, I don't know what to suggest -- AFAIK there is no workaround.<br />
<br />

            <p>Rather than using Save As &gt; Excel 2004 XML Spreadsheet (.xml), maybe if you choose the default save as Excel (.xlsx) format you'd be better off.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can change the file extension of a (.xlsx) file to (.zip) in Finder. Then, also in Finder, double-click the Zip file to expose the folder structure of the Office Open XML file. You can get at the text of the XML files that way.</p>

AFAICT, the <span style="font-weight: bold">Group &amp; Outline</span> aspect still isn't going to be there &amp; that's what the expressed concern is.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2013 Notification does not work&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Notification does not work&#33;</h2>
                    This is the second time I have had to post this question about Outlook 2013 notification not working. The previous one was marked answered when it was not. I use Windows 7 for a POP3 account, and Outlook is supposed to give me a preview of new messages
 that have arrived. I believe I have done everything possible to fix this: Opened Options, to Mail, select Display notification, it's set and still no notification. The Preview test works fine; nothing shows up when a new message arrives. I went into Window's
 7's notification icons, and it's there, but not active. When I select "show all", I get a message saying "this icon is not active; it will be shown when it is active."&nbsp; I have also tried in safe mode. Nothing work! I paid a pretty penny for this software,
 and would like for it to do what it is supposed to. Any suggestions work be appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Outlook automatically cuts reply&#47;forward email&#39;s content</h2>
                    I just received my new Mac with Outlook 2011 in it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem was noticed when I responded to one of my team member's emails (a lengthy response to a lengthy email). &nbsp;The email, when received by my team member, was cut/truncated automatically by several lines. &nbsp;We tried this over and over and it still
 would cut the lines off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I copied and pasted the content into a new email and sent it - the fonts changed from Cambria to Times New Roman when my team member received it. &nbsp;All emails were sent/received in HTML format.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any fixes?</div>
                </div>

<div>I've seen things like that in the past with some everactive Exchange servers that are weirdly configured for Web Services (so it only affected Mac users, and not Windows users using MAPI instead).</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately it doesn't seen to have had any effect on my ability to create new folders.</p>
<p>When I open a drive and then open a file folder, I get a menu that has the categories of Organize, Include in Library, Share with, and New folder.&nbsp; In the past, if I wanted to create a new folder, I simply clicked on "New folder" and one was created.&nbsp; This
 function is not currently operating for me on any of my available drives.</p>

            <p>What if it's the first time you've ever used it?&nbsp; I just got my new computer and I already am not liking Microsoft 13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It won't let me make any folders, even when I put a thumb drive in I can't make a folder on it either.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I'd make a folder on my thumb drive, then down load into my documents what I wanted and move them to the folder on my thumb drive and then move that folder into my documents, but I can't even make a folder on my thumb drive like I used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I'm really not enjoying Windows 8, there are so many bugs in it its crazy and on top of that, I have to pay a monthly fee to use the office and word products.&nbsp; Doesn't seem very fair to me.</p>

            <p>Cindy: I am new to 8.1 also, but discovered 2 ways to create a file folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;On the desk top I find a blank area and right click the mouse, which opens a small menu beside the cursor. Then from that menu I&nbsp;select "new" which opens another menu. "Folder" is at the top of mine. Right click on it and a folder appears on the desktop.&nbsp;(But
 I have had no luck as&nbsp;yet&nbsp;dragging files directly from my Word list of recent documents to this desk top folder. BTW, This list of recent documents&nbsp;opens when I left double click on the MSW Office Icon on my desktop.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if I left double click on my "Sky Drive" Icon, which is on my desktop, that opens a larger window with a&nbsp;list of my documents and in the tool bar near the top of the window, in the section marked "new" there is an option to select "new
 folder." I hope this is helpful.</p>

<h2>            Size limit to Office Dictionary &#40;as at 2018&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I wanted to get guidance on the size of the<strong> Word </strong><strong>dictionary</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The only web page in the community I can find out refers to a 2013 item which is no longer online.&nbsp; (<span>Titled:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>Size limit to Office Dictionary?</em> &nbsp;</span> )<br />
<br />
Can someone assist please?<br />
<br />
How many words can it contain / what is the maximum size / and are there any issues I need to be aware of when I am using Word 2013, or my colleagues are on later versions?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Typically on a Windows 10 system)<br />
<br />
Finally, while the above is my actual question, are there any other MS Dictionaries in use within Office or W10, and do they follow the same characteristics?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help<br />
</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, there's no accurate size or limit allotted to a Word dictionary. If you want to get additional information about it's size accommodation, you can contact our
<strong>Word Expert</strong> using this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Select

<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about using another dictionary, you can search on the <strong>
built-in Store</strong> on Windows 10. Here's a sample screenshot of the available application that you can download:</p>

<p>By "Word dictionary" do you mean the user dictionary (CUSTOM.DIC by default or any other dictionary you create) or the spelling lexicon that is built into Office? I don't think there's any information on the number of words in the lexicon or the number recognized
 by the thesaurus. As for the capacity of the user dictionaries, that's undoubtedly limited only by hard drive size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a somewhat useful article that lists some of Word's "operating parameter limitations":
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/211489/operating-parameter-limitations-and-specifications-in-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/211489/operating-parameter-limitations-and-specifications-in-word</a> but doesn't mention user dictionaries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They quite possibly were mentioned in an older article, "<span>WD97: Operating Parameter Limitations and Specifications," but that has unfortunately been taken down and isn't available even through the
 Internet Archive (making me wonder if I ever printed it out for reference).</span></p>

</p><p>As for turbo boost , mine works but not the monitor, not suitable but fine otherwise. I ought add i have a geforce 3gb card and when updating via windows the adaptor wwm caused my drivers to error and crash so i hid that update then after cleaning i started
 over, gone from build to build with a few driver issues but none major, for these i simply went to my publisher site and installed the latest driver for ones causing problems and now all running smoothly, btw check the firewall settings too as mine had most
 blocked and needed allow through the firewall , gd luck :-)</p>

            it seems like I've recovered from most of the damage done by the "upgrade" to 6.84...except for the bl*** buggy messages not opening...got an email response today from Nokia tech support, the gist of which was pretty much "erm, we dunno "...is that also
 part of the quality slip?...this is my first (and, quite possibly, my last) Nokia product, so I wasn't sure what to expect

<p>When you copy/insert slides from other presentations into your current presentation, PowerPoint is liable to include the slide masters and all layouts from the presentation you're inserting slides FROM. These things can multiply like rabbits, making for
 a bloated and hard-to-maintain file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this pop-up is a new feature or just something very few people have run into, but in any case, I'd make a copy of your presentation, open it and when you get that pop-up, let it perform the clean-up.</p>
