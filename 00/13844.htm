<h2>            Apps are not downloading lumia 630</h2>
                    I'm using Lumia 630 from past 2 years. Though Microsoft has not released new updates for phone for long time, It was running perfect. But now I'm having problem in downloading apps from store. It shows pending status all the time. Sometimes returns error
 80070057. Most of the time error is not coming but still apps are not downloading.i tried soft reset, Changed storage to phone, Date and time setting, Region setting, Tried updating my phone. Phone is running perfectly except this problem. I'm using 3G connection.
 Give me solution if any. Plz.

<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">i want your help to delete -(close) my Skype account. I have tried to log in and i revive the message "Problem found bla bla bla". I have changed the password and then i tried again to log in when i informed that the account has
 suspicious behavior and has been restricted or temporarily suspended.</span><br />

<p>I have never accepted any term that will give you the permission to ask MORE personal information to continue using my account or to confirm my account. When i had created my account you asked me for my email to confirm my action, the created account and
 my data. I have given you my email and when i had problem i used my email to RECOVER my forgotten passwords etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now after all that you asked me to give you my phone or you will keep my account and my email connection to account as hostage.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;I dont want to re-activate my account, and i dont want you to have my email.</li><li>You cant serve me the recover of my account as the only "thankful" way to access to my account or to disconnect my email from your not-giving-services.</li><li>You cant serve me that the recover can be only done with my phone. </li></ul>
<p>Karen_E, you can enter your phone number, and be happy with that, but in my country the phone number is connecting with more sensitive personal data that include the Government as service and benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>One more thing, GDPR.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When you determine that my account acts suspiciously you could send me an EMAIL to inform me about that. You didnt do it and now you ask me to trust you and give you for one-time my phone to "recover" what? my account? my-useless-for-recovery-email? WHAT?<br />
<br />
I will give you my phone when i receive an official signed term of your company, as i told to your support when he/she guaranteed that you will delete my phone and the connection with the account after i recover one-time my skype account.

</p><p><span><span>Before we can make any changes on an account, you will need to have full access to it. This means, you need to remove the restriction
 from your Skype account before you can proceed deleting it as mentioned by the other moderator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We understand that your personal information are highly confidential and we vow to protect your account‚Äôs data and security seriously.
 For this reason, we are making sure that all of the account details and other info that you‚Äôre typing in or submitting to us are protected.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We are requesting users to provide a phone number where we can send a code if and only if the account was restricted due to malicious
 sending of messages to other users of the service, thus we put the account on hold to keep it away from doing any further damage.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Due to the above mentioned information, we strongly suggest you to follow the below steps to get full access to your Skype profile:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Unfortunately you can not understand and it seems from your "copy-paste" answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do not you answer what I asked you?</p>
<ul>
<li>When did I accept terms that would require more details than I have already given if I wanted to delete my account?</li><li>When were I accepting terms that, in case of blockage-blockade, you would ask me for more information than I have already given?</li><li>Why have I never been informed that my account has been blocked? You have my email, right?
<strong>When i sign up to your services, you did not ask for phone numbers for security reasons. Just active emails, so dont lie to me.</strong></li><li>Why did you ask me and gave you my email in addition to certification and updating if i couldn't use it for future certification reasons</li></ul>
<p>When I signed up for your services and when I gave my details, I also accepted your terms of use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I'm on your website to get rid of my account blocking and delete it, there is no term to prove your words</strong>.
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(="</span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The phone number you will provide as you go along the process will not be stored by us and will not be saved to your account.")</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have given you my email as a tool of certification and updating and now you are asking for my phone number.</p>
<p>Now you tell me that if i want to disconnect my email from the account I must first sign in to it and this can only happen if I give you my mobile number.
<strong>Why did not you inform me for this when i made the account?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In your country you may not have any problems with having certification codes sent to your phone number by&nbsp;corporations but we have it.<br />
<strong>You push me to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">steal any cell phone</span> just to use this number and open my account in order to delete the email associated with it.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Would you trust someone who would be asking for your cell phone and would simply tell you he would not store it?</strong> Do not be foolish, if I do not
<br />
As for your safety, crackers have a different view from you. I can not risk, information that I associate with my state to be lost, given or sold. You can be good with this, but not me.<br />
<br />
I have other email and other skype accounts that are not blocked. They could act as a guarantee but you do not want it. You absolutely want my phone number and that's enough to seem suspicious.</p>
<p>I cant help you collect more personal information in order to complete my profile without any real guarantees.</p>

            <p>The ‚ÄúVideo from Web Site‚Ä¶‚Äù feature is not currently available in Office for Mac 2004. Mac MVP Jim Gordon recommends the following solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚Äú<i>Copy the URL from the information to the right of the video. Paste that into a web site that can download the file. I know of two sites that do this for free:<br />
&nbsp;</i><a href="http://www.mediaconverter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>http://www.mediaconverter.org/</i></a><i><br />
&nbsp;</i><a href="http://www.mediaconvert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>http://www.mediaconvert.com/</i></a><i><br />
<br />
The insert the movie using the Insert menu, movie toolbar, or slide design placeholder.<br />
<br />
If you download to .mov format PowerPoint Mac will play the video just fine, but it is not cross-platform with PCs.<br />
<br />
If you need to be cross-platform, then choose WMV as the file format, but you also need to install the Flip4Mac QuickTime video codecs (free) so that Mac PowerPoint can play WMV files:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Resizing PNG graphics with VBA in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ariodante  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resizing PNG graphics with VBA in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I want to use VBA in Word 2010 to resize PNG graphics&nbsp;inserted into a doc. But the InlineShapes object doesn't seem to directly support the ScaleHeight and ScaleWidth methods, while the Shapes object does. However, every time I try to run ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(intCounter).ConvertToShape,
 I get an error saying that the specified inline shape doesn't exist -- even though it can be found with ActiveDocument.InlineShapes(intCounter).Select. (intCounter is, of course, dimensioned as an integer and goes from 1 to ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.Count.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions will be most appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>The following sets the size of a shape and of an inline shape to 175% of the original size.</p>

<h3> slickrcbd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset the spell check&#39;s &#34;ignore all&#34; button&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had just opened a document created in a text editor in Word 2003 so I could run it through the spell checker.</p>
<p>While doing so, I had a lot of things to hit the "ignore" button for as they weren't words but codes or special one-use abbreviations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I accidentally hit "ignore all" for a mispelled word that I don't know the correct spelling for, and I couldn't get Word to bring it up again when I ran the spell checker a second time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quitting Word and reopening the file worked, but is there an easier way to reset the "ignore" button?&nbsp; It's not a big deal to quit and reload with 99.9% of the documents I edit, but I recall the final Capstone project for my college degree took quite a while
 to load as it was over 150 pages with lots of tables, diagrams, and a few charts and graphics, and back in 2007 I was part of a collaboration to update the user's manual for a program we supported which also took a bit to load due to there being as many screen
 shots in the manual as a Microsoft Press training book (at least for the MCSA &amp; MCDST for XP, and the MCTS and MCITP for Vista, 2008, 2010 and 7).</p>

<h2>            &#34;My outgoing server &#40;SMTP&#41; requires authentication&#34; enabled by default</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was using a mail service since the first version of Office 365, early 2013 if I remember well.</p>
<p>With time, Office 365 apps have known a lot of improvements and I was very glad to welcome them, but beginning the latest updates of Office 365, I've noticed the email setup experience has changed and the setting "My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication"
 seems to be unable by default.</p>
<p>I remember having configured an address with the new interface, using a another account that supports that settings, then after, went back to the parameters, uncheck that box, changed the account name, address, incoming and outgoing servers just as a workaround.</p>
<p>That worked until the next update where I have no way to go back to advanced email settings as we had before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a way to disabled this setting or it's now mandatory because Microsoft want all old server to be more modern and secured?</p>

<br />
<br />Hello Samba
<br />
<br />What you're encountering is the new "simplified" UI for email account settings
<br />
<br />You can follow either of the two approaches to get to/change the full email settings 
<br />
<br />#1 - Press CTRL+ALT+S - gets you to the Send/Recieve window 
<br />#2 - Select the Group (most people only have one) --&gt; click on &lt;Edit&gt;
<br />#3 - Select the email account --&gt; click on &lt;Account Properties
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />With Outlook closed
<br />
<br />#4 - Open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app
<br />#5 - Click on &lt;Email Accounts&gt;
<br />#6 - Select the email account --&gt; click on &lt;Change&gt;

<h2>            Credentials on delegated mailboxes</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a few issues over the last few days with delegated mailboxes in outlook 2016 home and business.</p>
<p>We are having this issue with 3 completely different domains one working through office 365 and 2 working through on prem exchange 2013.</p>
<p>What is happening is that a handful of delegated mailboxes are constantly prompting for credentials and not downloading all of the emails in the mailbox (though the outlook profile is set to download 12 months of emails if it downloading up to the beginning
 of december.)</p>
<p>I have not been able to replicate this issue on my machine with the same account (using office 365 proplus) and have not been able to replicate it with the same account on a Terminal server running outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that have already been tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened outlook in safe mode and removed all addins</p>
<p>New outlook profile has been created.</p>
<p>New window profile has been created (domain admin rather than user)</p>
<p>Office has been repaired, uninstalled and reinstalled&nbsp;</p>
<p>Permissions to the effected mailboxes has been removed (waited to replicate on users outlook profile) then readded.</p>
<p>Permissions were removed again and readded via powershell</p>
<p>All Windows, office and exchange updates have been installed&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OWA is being used for the mean time to circumvent the issue but they need to use an outlook addin for the bulk of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I started Diagnosing this issue Monday it has gone from 2 users at one office to all but 2 users (one uses a Mac) who are effected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for any help as microsoft will not touch this as we have no support contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mailboxes have been delegated to the account though Exchange so they automap on outlook 2010 and on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other mailboxes have been added since this and it is just 3 specific mailboxes that have the issue. I did manage to find a fix for this from reddit.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So looks like we have a new issues with Outlook 2016 coming up with a password prompt and not taking the correct password. Kinda like the fudged October update. Unsure if this is related to a recent update, but it is something that Intermedia is reporting they
 are getting a high volume of calls on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Here is the registry edit to resolve the Password prompt issue.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
The fix is to create the following Registry keys on affected machine:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\x.0\Outlook\AutoDiscover (x.0 corresponds to the Outlook version: 16.0 = Outlook 2016)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
For Outlook 2016 version 16.0.6741.2017 and later versions, please add the following</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
DWORD: ExcludeExplicitO365Endpoint<br />
value 1</p>

            Hi, If you're having the same problem and your phone is running on WP8.1 OS, try checking if the phone tiles are linked. If yes, unlinked them by opening Phone app &gt; ... &gt; unlinked tiles &gt; unlinked. Once you unlinked them, you will see now phone 2 and
 a tile will be added automatically.

<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to go to go to my hotmail account my computer comes up with an error page. Site could not be reached, DNS address could not be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through similar people's problems who have fixed the issue but none of them have worked for me. Also most of them are responses for PC's so aren't helpful for me</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine on my phone but not on my laptop in chrome on either normal or incognito mode. I've also tried it on safari and firefox and it's the same problem on those too. (I don't have another computer to try it on unfortunately. this is my only one)
 I'm on a macbook air. V10.10.3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access any other site, only hotmail isn't working</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried clearing my cookies and cache and resetting the router on the off chance any of that would work but nothing has helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded the latest version of chrome but still have the same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to access the account multiple times over the past 3 days and once randomly it has let me on and not come up with the error.</p>

    <title>New modem now Outlook cannot send&#47;receive consistently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> circestumbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            New modem now Outlook cannot send&#47;receive consistently</h2>
                    <p>I have a new modem and now Outlook gets hung up when sending/receiving email. This happened over a year ago when we got a new modem. It went forever with no one taking responsibility; finally a technician for my internet provider downgraded my modem and
 it worked beautifully.&nbsp; Sadly, that modem just died.&nbsp; They no long provide the downgraded modem.&nbsp; Just as soon as the new modem was replaced a week ago, I the problem started again--though it is even more serious this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More detail:&nbsp; When I open the Outlook program on my computer and I am connected to the internet via my modem, it works okay for 10-15 minutes.&nbsp; I generally receive all the new emails since my last login and can send 1 or 2 emails.&nbsp; Then, it gets hung up.&nbsp;
 At first, it simply can't send. or receive&nbsp; Then, if I try to do something, like navigate to another folder, it freezes my entire Outlook program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doe NOT happen with Outlook web access--I can even go to the web and send and receive emails via Outlook Web Access while my Outlook program is hung up.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it, I have to disconnect from the modem, wait about 5 minutes, then reconnect.&nbsp; After a few minutes, Outlook will successfully send/receive.&nbsp; Then I have about 5-10 minutes of functionality in Outlook, then it freezes again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also should say that when Outlook is experiencing the hangup, I can switch to my cell phone hotspot and I am able to use Outlook beautifully.&nbsp; I have had a LONG time to troubleshoot this problem and it very clearly is the modem.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone think of a reason that my modem would be causing this problem?&nbsp; That is, any way I might be able to fix this problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Circe,
<br />
<br />I am a independent advisor and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />1. Try to open Outlook in safe mode <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-o...</a>
<br />2. Check for updates <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/instal...</a>
<br />3. Disable addins <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />4. You can also try to repair Office <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please get familiar with Fixes and workarounds for recent issues with Outlook <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-in-outlook-for-windows-ecf61305-f84f-4e13-bb73-95a214ac1230?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fixes-...</a>

            Dear Circe, 
<br />
<br />Please try to repair your Outlook and also please make sure that you have VPN and Proxy disabled. If you are using 3d party AV and you have Windows 10 , please disable 3d party AV and enable Defender.
<br />
<br />Afterwards run these networking commands in a command prompt window
<br />1. In the search box on the taskbar, type Command prompt, press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select Run as administrator &gt; Yes.
<br />2. At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<br />Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.
<br />Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.
<br />Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

<p>I have just finnished my first slide in Powerpoint 2010. A graphical poster that was supposed to be a nice full colour outprint.</p>
<p>This poster contains a 55% transparent image (looks good on screen) but when I print it the effect is gone. In fact, it's gone already at preview...</p>
<p>What can I do to make Powerpoint keep this transparancy effect also when printing?</p>

            If you have read receipts requested by default, then the only way to accomplish what you want is to remember to disable the request whenever you send a message to that person.&nbsp; There's no way to specify an exception by contact.

<h2>            Page Alignment when printing</h2>
                    I have word 10 documents that when I open them are aligned correctly by page.&nbsp; When&nbsp; I try to print them they become misaligned vertically &nbsp;and the part of one page moves to the next page and so on.&nbsp; I have tried vertical alignment set at top, have tried
 adjusting margins, and anything that I could think of on page layout and printer set up.&nbsp; I don't know if this a printer problem or word problem.&nbsp; There are 48 of these documents and hundreds of pages and I cannot use them and I don't have tome to redo them.&nbsp;
 Any suggestions?

            When you buy Office 2010 Hebrew with English.. thats mean the proofing tools for english is included.
<div>but the basic language would still be Hebrew. All the UI would be in hebrew and that cannot be changed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only soln for this would to install a MS office English language interface pack (LIP). But unfortunately there are no LIP's for English.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So you would have to buy a MS Office 2010 English Language Pack. this would cost you an extra 20$.&nbsp;</div>

<h3> derhenning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t use Skype on phone without adding billing information</h2>
                    <p>I created a new account a few days ago.</p>
<p>It works well on the pc in the browser and its own Skype Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the phone however (Android) I can't even normally sign in with my SkypeID.</p>
<p>I need do sign in with my Microsoft Account (which I also didn't want to create but nvm).</p>
<p>Then a message appears, saying that my account is 90% complete and I need to give billing information to "experience the full Skype service" or something.</p>
<p>Without billing information I can't do anything on my phone Skype. Not even see my contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need and don't want to use the Skype landline calls, just the free IM and VideoCalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I use Skype on my phone without adding billing information or without adding any credit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Henning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I live in China and sometimes have to use Skype via VPN if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>I already confirmed my account via (Chinese) phone number because they thought my account got hacked and used for spam.</p>

<p>I read the following instructions for displaying all relationships on a worksheet on a microsoft support site (<a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qjSTPUqN2NcJ:office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/display-the-relationships-between-formulas-and-cells-HP010342448.aspx+%22Excel+2010%22+Trace+precedents+interactive+Formula&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de&amp;source=www.google.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qjSTPUqN2NcJ:office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/display-the-relationships-between-formulas-and-cells-HP010342448.aspx+%22Excel+2010%22+Trace+precedents+interactive+Formula&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de&amp;source=www.google.de</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>In an empty cell, type = (equal sign). </li><li>Click the <b>Select All</b> button.&nbsp; </li><li>Select the cell, and on the <b>Formulas</b> tab, in the Formula <b>
Auditing</b> group, click Trace Precedents twice. </li></ol>
<p>The only problem with this instruction is, that after clicking on the Select All button the Trace Precedens function in the Auditing Group is greyed out so that I cannot click on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what is missing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<h2>            Display Failures Continue to Continuously Continue In Build 14942</h2>
                    <p>It may come as a shock to some Insiders who have had display failures in &nbsp;the form of monochrome or grayscale boxes in the place of any "modern" items generated by Windows 10, since build 14905, but apparently the only known issue for build 14942 is an issue
 with accessing your local intranet. &nbsp;The ignore it and it will go away policy continues, when it comes to the display failure on many chipsets (e.g. Intel chipsets prior to 4400 Express family). &nbsp;So, I am continuing with my collection of chipset and system
 information for posting to Feedback, as many times as necessary to elicit a response from Microsoft. &nbsp;I don't understand the reason for just ignoring a standing problem like this, especially one that is being reported &nbsp;over and over, but I will continue to
 report it to Feedback until we or they find a fix. &nbsp;By the way, the Windows Basic Display Adapter driver is not a fix. &nbsp;Also, as long as the system requirements for Windows 10 remain at a minimum of WDDM 1.0, there is some expectation of functionality at that
 level. &nbsp;So, here we go again.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft did say they were using different platform on Redstone 2 at the beginning of this preview process. It's starting to look like this platform takes some newer chipset &amp; video adapter to do all video. If insiders get more new functions in next couple
 of builds and older chipset/video problem has not been addressed I would think Microsoft just does not consider it urgent enough to address. Microsoft is still rolling out Redstone 1 public builds upgrade slowly. I really think that Microsoft will change basic
 pc requirements if Redstone 2 becomes a better build than Redstone 1 and probably leave some older pc version behind. Some insiders may argue differently but some pc shipped with Windows 7 have had some big issues with upgrading to Windows 10. Many of those
 users decided to return to Windows 7.</p>

            <p>The issue is for all devices that are DX9/SM2.0 limited devices. (So anything around the 945GM era) that uses WDDM 1.0 drivers. No driver is going to change the hardwares abilities and with the graphical issues we are having, it looks like Microsoft flipped
 some switch to render the GUI elements with SM3.0 or other DirectX 10+ render method that the older hardware will never support. Some Intel chips that even supported DirectX 10 may not have full SM3.0 abilities which is why a lot of previous version (31/35
 Express) series may have issues as well, but why 4 series ones work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is where was the announcement made in any of the builds that WDDM 1.0 support was dropped and why is there no fallback for those that are stuck on said hardware (mostly Laptops or business Desktops running with integrated graphics). We should
 have the option for Software Rendering (Which is technically what the Basic Graphics Adapter driver does, however then you loose basic Widescreen Resolution support which is not acceptable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Driver version changes are going to fix this, this needs to be fixed in the Windows build by either reversing whatever artificial forced graphics rendering change is being done for the GUI (Really, why does an OS need to go above DX9 for rendering basic
 GUI elements?) or they need to dial this in that no outdated hardware is forced to install RedStone 2 if this indeed becomes the future case. I can see them taking a sort of OSX approach to sunsetting hardware support, but to do that would require them to
 not allow certain OS versions to come to said hardware (Similar to OSX's current new MacOS that doesn't run on a lot of hardware from 2008/9 and older and cannot be installed on said hardware at all). But if Microsoft forces this update through Windows Update,
 and breaks all of the older devices not in the Insider Preview, that is going to be one **** of a backlash after forcing Windows 10 down a lot of peoples throats that may not have wanted it in the first place, then get burned with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a fan of Windows 10, and understand the risk using Insider Preview on some of my older hardware as a testbed, but I really do hope they get this ironed out in an update or two as there is no reason to force un-support chips even as old as the GMA945
 series as it still runs most graphical elements seen in the Internet world today, and there is no reason a OS GUI should be something that completely becomes unusable for no reason outside of forced obsolescence.&nbsp;<br />

Yea! Intel website shows that chipset adapters are no longer being updated. Intel provides list of drivers for OS- XP to Windows 7. If using that chipset and still getting okay video results maybe the floor for use is WDDM 1.1.

<p>Ok, 14393.447 is at public build even though it may be signed for Insiders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you will find that Paint 3D is only available at 14971, perhaps 1 build prior to that.&nbsp; It is sort of catch 22.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folks that are at a build not offering Paint 3D are ticked off that they cannot get it.&nbsp; The folks at the latest build are ticked off that they cannot get Paint.&nbsp; I am at 14971 and I can only get Paint 3D.&nbsp; I am using Paint 3D without issue.&nbsp; I cannot
 download Paint.&nbsp; I have Paint still available by using the windows.old file that will be short lived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get to 14971, you will get your wish.</p>

            <p>You have to join that device to the Fast or Slow Ring to have Paint 3D available in the Store. You can download and install build 14965 and install Paint 3D from the Store or join the Fast Ring to get build 14971 from Windows Update which has Paint 3D included
 as the default Paint App.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So the quickest way to get there is to first download and upgrade to 14965. However, using these Insider builds is not recommended on your primary computer.</p>
