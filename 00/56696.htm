<h2>            Windows 10 wireless connection issue</h2>
                    I am&nbsp;able to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;to my&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;router after upgrading to Windows 10 on HP ENVY 23 computer.&nbsp; However, I cannot&nbsp;see or connect to&nbsp;a Cisco WAP300N wireless access point.&nbsp; I am able to connect to the Cisco WAP300N on other devices such as&nbsp;iPhone, iPAD,
 and another Windows 10 computer.&nbsp; Any idea why this particular Windows 10 PC does not show the Cisco WAP300N wireless connection point?

            <p>I updated the driver software and I was able to successfully connect to Linksys WAP54G wireless access point on the HP ENVY 23 PC; however, I am still not able to connect to the Cisco WAP300N wireless access point using HP ENVY 23 PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the Cisco WAP300N is operational and configured correctly since I can connect to it on other PC as well as iPad, etc.&nbsp; Do you think this can still be a wireless network driver issue for the HP ENVY 23 PC&nbsp;when running under Windows 10?</p>

            <p>I have a Cisco 300N, same thing happened with my HP EliteBook 1040 G1.</p>
<p>Purchased a D-Link AC750 , worked like a dream and also gave me a Samba USB file share that I use Tablet, phone, PC and laptop,</p>
<p>Upgraded to Win 10 and not only was unable to log into my home WiFi on either the 2.4 or the 5G and also initially the 4G LTE network.</p>
<p>The worst part is that Win 10 then "forgot" my home WiFi, I can see my neighbours secure WiFi's, but not my own</p>
<p>HP Support Assistant came up with some downloads now&nbsp;upgraded to&nbsp;Win 10, Graphics and Cellular OK,
</p>
<p>Cellular is OK as is wired Lan, but still cannot access my home network without plugging in a cable</p>

<p>What version of Windows are you using - if you are not using Windows 7 you are in the wrong place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should make an effort to better describe what "taken over my security" means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to get the same ideas you have already tried you should tell us the things you have already tried and what happened when you tried them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes these AV programs are too embedded in the system for the usual Programs and Features (Add/Remove Programs) to remove the completely.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always start with Add/Remove Programs but their still may be some remnants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nowadays most AV companies have their own program/tools/method to finish the job and the one from Avast can be found on this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't do the job some folks like this free version of Revo Uninstaller which can be found on this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before starting make a manual System Restore Point so you can undo any adjustments if things get worse - then you can restore the system to the original state and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many free third party programs like Revo will make unwanted modifications to your system (browser home page, search engine, etc.) during the installation if you do not pay attention and blindly click through the prompts without checking for any customization
 options so you can opt out of their modifications you don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is your desire uninstall Revo when you are done.</p>

<h2>            How to Get Rid of Error 02B3 at Bootup, Incorrect Drive B Type</h2>
                    I keep getting this message at bootup, when I don't even have an active B drive. I can't see anywhere in the BIOS to fix this. There is a provision for a B drive diskette listed in the BIOS, which is disabled. I tried enabling it also, but I still have
 the error. I have had both Win 95 and Win 2000 on this computer, and the error is still there. It doesn't seem to hurt anything though. How do I get rid of this if possible? The computer is an old Gateway, 200mhz, 256 ram, 4gb hard drive.

<p>
</p><p>3) Disconnect the floppy drive then reboot.&nbsp; Reconnect the floppy, shutdown then restart.</p>

            I am running Win 2000. I tried to reset the BIOS on the computer without success. I then removed the battery for 30 minutes, and replaced it. Is 30 minutes enough to drain down the power?. I still had the 02B3 incorrect drive B error, after booting up.
 I then removed the power and ribbon cable from the A drive and rebooted. I got an A drive error, but no B drive error this time. Both A and B drives were still listed in the BIOS. I reconnected the A drive and booted. I still have the 02B3 incorrect drive
 B type message at bootup, even after disabling it again in BIOS. Maybe this is a factory default message?

            <p>I installed all available updates, and Windows Update reports the PC is up to date.&nbsp; I was hopeful, because one of the updates was for the Intel HD Graphics 4000, however it didn't fix this problem.&nbsp; The monitor is a ViewSonic VX2250, and it is listed by
 name under Monitors in Device Manager.&nbsp; The manufacturer's website does not list Windows 10 as an option in their OS drop-down menu for drivers.<br />
I have restarted the PC with the DisplayPort cable attached to the monitor, but the monitor reports "No Signal" at either of the two DisplayPorts.&nbsp; I tried a Samsung monitor - same issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have another PC of the same exact model which I previously updated to Windows 10.&nbsp; That one is connected via DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable to my Samsung 46" TV which is reported in Device Manager as "Generic PnP Monitor" and it works just fine as my HTPC.</p>
<p>Before upgrading to Windows 10, the compatibility scan reported that this PC and attached monitor were compatible, so I proceeded with the upgrade.</p>

            SOLVED - I purchased a DP male to DVI female active adapter and used it to connect a standard DVI to DVI cable to the monitor instead of the DP male to DVI male cable I had previously been using with W7 and this monitor.&nbsp; If that original cable is bad,
 it is the strangest of coincidences that it went bad at the exact moment W10 was coming up for the first time at the completion of the W10 upgrade, giving me a black screen and "No Signal" message on the monitor.<br />

<h2>            windows registry files missing or corrupt</h2>
                    Hello, I recently received my sister's old laptop, after some upgrades and a paint job, it was ready for an OS. Since it is a 32 processor, I went with Windows 7 ultimate (32bit). I bought the .iso file and mounted it to a bootable USB drive, after the
 installation process, I then went to boot the laptop, It says "Windows unable to load files, the windows registry file is missing or corrupt."
<div><br />

<div>Now that you have my background information, please HELP!!</div>

</div>
<div>1.) &nbsp;what does this mean?</div>
<div>2.) &nbsp;what is the purpose of the windows registry file?</div>
<div>3.) &nbsp;how do I fix this within the realm of "acceptable" microsoft actions?</div>
<div>4.) &nbsp;are there any other, easier ways? :)</div>

            <div><span style="font-weight: bold">1.) &nbsp;what does this mean?</span><br />
Means a file that is critical to booting Windows and providing operating system functions is not working properly and either damaged or corrupt.
<br />
<br />
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">2.) &nbsp;what is the purpose of the windows registry file?</span><br />
The registry stores information about the system, from application to hardware information which keeps your system running smoothly.<br />
<br />
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">3.) &nbsp;how do I fix this within the realm of "acceptable" microsoft actions?</span><br />
You can start by trying the following:<br />
1. Put the Windows 7 installation disc into the disc drive or boot from your USB thumb drive, and then start the computer.<br />
<br />
2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.<br />
<br />
3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
4. Click Repair your computer.<br />
<br />
5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt.<br />
<br />
7. Type sfc /scannow, and then press ENTER. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Try the above and lets see what happens. :)<br />

            Thanks for answering all my questions so promptly and in detail, this was very helpful to understanding the problem that I am having. However, there is an issue. All the other sources that I read said this as well, however for some odd reason, my windows
 7 disk doesn't have the option of "repair my computer". To answer any questions that I foresee:<br />
<br />
1.) No I do not know why I do not have that option<br />
2.) No, It is not the windows 7 recovery disk.<br />
3.) No, I do not have another system's disk that I can use.<br />
4.) I have already installed several times, each time completely erasing the existing files on the hard drive and starting from scratch.<br />
<br />
So, In short, I need another method that doesn't involve the windows 7 installation disk. I am quite computer-y compitent and persistant, so really any methods are possible (as long as there is sufficient directions to walk me through it.).<br />

            <p>Let's see what you can do. Yeah, really odd that you do not have a 'Repair my Computer' option. On any normal Windows 7 ISO-created bootable USB, when we boot via the USB, you should normally see two options: Install Windows (in big font) and just below
 it a "Repair my computer" option.</p>
<p>But if you say that you don't really have one - then I would recommend that you borrow a Windows 7 computer from someone for sometime and create a Start-up Repair Disc from it-</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-system-repair-disc</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Start-up Repair Disc is equivalent to the "Repair my computer" option on the Windows 7 Installation ISO.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Boot your computer via the start-up repair disc and then carry out Steps 5-7 as mentioned by the Microsoft MVP above.</p>

            You said that you bought the .ISO file, Not an installation disk. I'm fairly certain Microsoft does not sell Ultimate .ISO to consumers. Is this a legitimate install?<br />

            Okay, I followed the instructions that you gave me and successfully created a working windows 7 repair disk, but the problem is that I did that on this computer, which is a windows 7 ultimate (64bit) OS, and the laptop is windows 7 ultimate (32bit).
<div><br />
<div>So, I guess what i'm asking is where can I find a windows repair disk for a 32bit system?</div>

            The repair disk will be system specific and need to have specific drivers and configs. To fix your registry you need to boot with an&nbsp; installation disk and to run scannow so your files can be parsed against known good ones. it needs to be an ultimate dvd
 though. There is no getting around it. Ultimate has tons of features no one will use. Spend a bill on a legit home premium and sleep easy<br />

            <p>By saying this you just reduced your chances of getting help.</p>
<p>You will need a 32-bit Start-up Repair Disc, and for that you need Windows 7 32-bit; any edition. While some time ago Start-up Repair Disc ISO (and mind it - Start-up Recovery Disc is free to create; therefore it is legitimate) were available; Microsoft
 forced the websites who gave download links to them to either delete them or put a price on them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try out a search on the Internet though - who knows you might get it from somewhere.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since you have said that it is not a legitimate install - how can you use it? I mean how will you activate it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyways, the source fro where you got this non-legitimate ISO might have a corrupted ISO with improper registry.</p>

<p>Not necessary. I have successfully repaired Windows Vista from a Start-up Repair Disc created on Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>32-bit Startup Repair Discs can be used for all 32-bit editions of Windows Vista and 7; while the 64-bit&nbsp; Startup Repair Discs can be used for all 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and 7.</p>

            win 7 and vista have the same NT architecture but home premium. pro and ultimate have different registry entries an you can't for example even use a SP1 to fix a SP2 XP install with<br />

<h3> remmydarko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor flicker on 1080p</h2>
                    
<p>The monitor I have flickers on&nbsp;certain things&nbsp;when outputted at 1080p. The monitor I have is an Asus ve258q. 1920x1080 res. When I output at 720p there is barely any flicker that is noticeable. Its kind of hard to explain but basically I can still see the
 image fine but its just flickering&nbsp;quite bit in certain spots. When I set optimal resolution in the xbox settings it goes to 1080p. What should I do?</p>

<p>Done allot of research for you and it seems to be a common problem with monitor aka it is faulty. Allot of people tried everything then got a replacement and the problem was fixed. Asus are even aware of the problem so I would request a refund or swap.
</p>
<p>Sorry I could not come up with a easy solution but allot of people have your problem and it is a faulty monitor.

    <title>Skype will not connect calls&#47;disconnect calls&#47;receive IM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy_cs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype will not connect calls&#47;disconnect calls&#47;receive IM replies</h2>
                    When making calls it is taking almost a minute to connect successfully (if at all) and, once the conversation is over, I then can't disconnect - eventually getting a message saying "close skype and reboot". Similarly, when using IM, replies to my messages
 are not being received, although the people I've been reaching-out to have confirmed that they're getting my messages and replying to them. This has only been an issue over the past few days - any thoughts on what's going on? I've uninstalled Skype Preview
 and installed the latest version from Microsoft Store (v 12.1803.279.0) but the problem persists, so I'm assuming it's a service/account issue.

<h2>            Skype is currently unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Support Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Pro on a Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>I have both Skype app from Windows Store and classic Desktop Skype installed.</p>
<p>They were both working fine until the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Skype app from Windows Store I get the following message "Oops! Skype is currently unavailable. Please try again later."</p>
<p>On classic Desktop Skype it keeps trying to connect forever but never really connects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Skype and also deleted the shared.xlm file and the result is the same - it doesn't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help urgently?</p>

<p>Same problem here. Also tried Skype for Web un which it simply gets stuck at 'Getting status...' forever. Tried all the steps from this help</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_windesk-skype_startms-skype_signms/skype-hangs-on-getting-status/c759921c-be16-4927-a020-a99a8dee9315</p>
<p>with no result. Any other suggestions? Well, besides switching to Discord, that is. :)</p>

<p>Yup exactly the same problem here as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything fine until I renewed my Office 365 just yesterday, now laptop doesn't let me log in to Skype. Says the same message everyone else is seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Oops! Skype is unavailable. Please try again later"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, I can access my account perfectly fine online via web browser (go figure!?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find more stressful is the fact that you can't get to speak to a single person at Microsoft about ANY tech support issues! This is frankly the worse tech company I've ever encountered. I absolutely hate Windows, yet I persevered. I should have upgraded
 to a Mac :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... yeah if any one does find a solution, do please feel free to share.</p>

            It seems to be the common windows 10 operation spoiling something with every unwanted update. Some of them may return in the future with an other update spoiling something else. Don't waste time with Microsoft experts assistants. It doesn't work. Never
 did. From mobile windows flight mode lock to speakers disappeared and disks full with unwanted files (recently solved) to mention only some of them I experienced.

    <title>Separate Desktops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamessimpsonsm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Separate Desktops</h2>
                    Does anyone know if it is possible to have multiple Windows desktops open and have them be completely separate from one another, such as, if I were to create a second desktop (using the button the the right of the search box) and delete an icon, say, and
 it not delete that same icon on the other. Is this already a setting that I just haven't found or does this not exist? If not, Microsoft, if you're reading this, please could you add such a feature?

            <p>Unless they've recently changed something and/or I've totally missed something, no.&nbsp; Virtual desktops aren't really "different" desktops, they're more like multiple instances of the same desktop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was hoping to hear that the upcoming Anniversary update would include that type of increased functionality, but it sounds sadly like that's a no-go.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But: if you want your virtual desktops to have different icons, wallpapers, labels, etc., there are third-party programs like VirtuaWin or Dexpot that will support that.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A few other options mentioned in this article:</p>

            Ater taking a look at that article I ses that that isn't really what I'm looking for, what I'm looking for is something that allows the sorts of things mentioned in my original post that works off the existing Windows 10 virtual desktop tool. Do you know
 of any of those?

            Unfortunately, no; that's what I wanted too, something that was system-integrated.&nbsp; I run as little third-party-ware as possible, so I'm not running any of the versions mentioned on how-to geek.&nbsp; I guess for now we're stuck waiting for a future MS update
 that will catch up to the Linux multi-desktop functionality (I've got separate desktop icons and backgrounds on my Ubuntu machine).&nbsp; But hey, the Ubuntu bash shell for Windows 10 is due out this summer, so who knows, maybe they'll surprise us.&nbsp; Right now,
 it seems like they're much more focused on things like pen/touchscreen functionality and web-app developer tools, so I'm not holding my breath on anything.

<h2>            Error igfxsrvc.exe Debug Assertion Failed</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: Debug Assertion Failed!&nbsp; Suddenly this started and causes screen to mess up and PC locks up.&nbsp; Please help!!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure if this had anything to do with my problem but here it goes. &nbsp;2 things:
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;I uninstalled Norton after a 1 year stint and paid for Bitdefender and subsequently installed it. &nbsp;A week before point 2 happened.</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;I connected my laptop to my TV via HDMI and that seems to be when the problem started. &nbsp;Minutes later--if I remember correctly. &nbsp;I got a blue screen mentioning a bios issue or something, it didn't stay on the screen long for me to write it down but
 it came up twice that day and twice a few days after. &nbsp;I may have changed some settings yet I don't remember.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now after about 20-30 minutes, my computer slows down slightly, then laptop screen goes black, then the ratio of the screen decreases, internet goes off, and this Debug Assertion error arises, below is what it says:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Debug Assertion Failed!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Program: C:\Windows\system32\igfxsrvc.exe</div>
<div>File: .\igfxsrvc.cpp</div>
<div>Line: 170</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Expression: &nbsp;SUCCEEDED (hRes)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For information on how your program can cause an assertion...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I mentioned earlier I do remember that my screen went blue and gave me a Bios error or a Bios problem of some sort. &nbsp;However, that has not reappeared in almost 2 weeks now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any other info you need I will gladly provide. &nbsp;Please help!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            impossible de se connecter a se profil</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour, je revient vers vous car la c est ma dernière solution après quoi je revendrais cette xbox..Voila mon souci, lorsque j allume ma console mon profil se connecte bien au live, mais quand je veut faire une partie de mw3 ou autre jeu en live sa m écrie
 que se profil ne peut se connecter ou n est pas autorisé a jouer, j ai vérifié mon réseau et tout est vert connecté et activé .J ai appelé le service en ligne on est resté une bonne heure a faire des manipulations sans résultat et en dernier lieu il pensé
 que cela pouvais venir des port de la bbox mais je les ai appelé en leur expliquant mon problème et ils ont débloqué tous les ports mais sans résultat non plus , du coup je n ai plus aucun moyen de joué en live , si vous pouvez m aider j en serrais ravi ,
 merci d avance .CDT</p>

<p>slt Je précise que j etais gold avant les manipulations de la technicienne mais maintenant je ne vois plus sur mon profil ce que je suis . Je c qu elle a effacé le compte puis l a remis du coup il se pourrait qu elle se soit trompée pendant la manip... ,
 car on a fait pas mal de choses pour trouver la panne sans y arriver . Mais mm quand j essaye de rentrer un code d une carte pré payée cela ne marche pas et quand je vais dans config... &nbsp;pour voir le répertoire du compte ca me dit que je ne peux pas y aller
 et d essayer plus tard . Si c était juste parce que je suis silver l opérateur xbox me l aurait dit mais ca n etait pas le cas au contraire elle a bien vu que j étais en gold

<p>Salut a tous et toutes, le problème est général pour se connecter au xbox live depuis hier vers 23h00. Certaines personnes ont un peu de chance et arrivent a ce connecter avec un peu d'insistance. Donc inutile de changer vos paramètres de connections que
 ce soit au niveau de votre console ou votre Box FAI. Malheureusement il n'y a plus qu'a être patient et que Microsoft règle le problème une fois de plus....</p>

<h2>            Media Center -- Timeshifting&#58; Show lost when changing channels.</h2>
                    
<p>Win Media Center problem. Say you want to watch channel 5 to 1PM, then channel 6. You are watching channel 5, and you pause and get 15 minutes behind. Now, at 1PM you change to channel 6. You should be able to continue watching the last 15 minutes of channel
 5 but it is lost and gone; the timeshift has started over at 1PM.</p>
<p>Programs which don't throw away anything timeshifting: Chris-TV (no longer using it, only for analog tv), and Pinnacle TV Center Pro 5.4 (doesn't work in Win 7).</p>
<p>Could this please be fixed in an update?</p>
<p>Having to stay with the same channel while timeshifting defeats it, really.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>ed, that's a feature that's been asked for for <em>years</em>.&nbsp; Media Center has always functioned how you're describing here.<br />
Will it ever be changed?&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; But, to be honest, if it ever is, it most likely won't be in this version of Windows.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>The closest thing to a workaround that I can suggest:&nbsp; (assuming, here, that you have at least two tuners in the PC) rather than change the channel, record the second channel.&nbsp; That way, you can finish watching the first program, and then start watching
 the second (and, from its start) when you're ready.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />
Chris</p>

<h2>            Inadequate disk space</h2>
                    When I attempt to cut from Explorer and paste to Windows, I get an advice that I have inadequate disk space ... just to cut-and-paste!&nbsp; I've deleted history, etc., etc., basically everything I go through whenever I shut down, but I still get the advice
 that I have inadequate disk space.

<p>Please define what you mean by "Explorer" and "paste to Windows". Explorer.exe is the Windows graphical user interface, often confused with Internet Explorer which is a browser (software used to view the Internet). Please describe from where you are trying
 to paste and to where, giving the paths such as:</p>
<p>"I am trying to paste a file from My Documents to C:\Program Files\Some-Program."</p>
<p>Also please tell us how large your hard drive is and the amount of free space. You can get this information by double-clicking on My Computer and then right-clicking on the icon for your C: drive and left-clicking on Properties. You will get a "pie chart"
 which is easy to read.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App - Lags a lot&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently gone from a potato to a spaceship when it comes to my computer. Everything is lightning fast on my new computer and its about 400% more powerful than my old PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Mail App that comes with Windows 10 is lagging like crazy! We are talking 3 seconds for each letter to show up after typing and same for every mouse-click..</p>
<p>Used the app exactly the same on my old comp even had 4 more accounts synced than now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>App usage is like 60 MB RAM and 2% CPU max.</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting of course.<br />
</p>
<p>What is going on with my new supercomputer? I should't have to need to buy outlook the mail app is enough for my personal usage :sadface:</p>

            Hi Charkel, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />That's definitely not normal behaviour for the Mail app. I'd recommend resetting the app, which will bring it back to it's default original state and should hopefully fix whatever's causing the performance issue.
<br />
<br />Here are the steps to reset it:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "apps &amp; features".
<br />- Select Apps &amp; Features.
<br />- Find the Mail app in the list and select it.
<br />- Click Advanced Options
<br />- Click Reset.
<br />
<br />After you've done this, see if it work properly again. Let me know how you go! Thanks!       
        </p>

<p>Hello Graeme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the instructions and quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to actually have done the trick. Application seems snappy as before now :) I get back if the issue should re-appear after a reboot or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw. weird it did not delete any account data i didn't even notice it was re-installed when I started it after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly Graeme!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Charlie</p>
