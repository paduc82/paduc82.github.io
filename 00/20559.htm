<h2>            Office 365 - Shared Calendar without License</h2>
                    <p>I have just migrated our in-house software (C# UWP app, Azure Mobile App C# Backend) from using Microsoft Accounts for authentication, to using the organization's Office 365 accounts (AAD).</p>
<p>This is great because when there's a new employee, we can just add an account for them through the Office 365 portal, instead of having to make another Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>The issue is this, some user's don't need email, and therefore don't need an exchange license. However, I just hit a brick wall here as I just realized these users do not have access to calendars either. So they are unable to create calendar events from
 within the software unless they are assigned an exchange license, a problem that was not present when using Microsoft Accounts.</p>
<p>Any work-around for this?</p>

            <span>Hi MJFara,<br />
<br />
The calendar feature is a part of a mailbox. So when you didn’t assign an Exchange Online license to a user, the user will not have a mailbox and then he will not have a calendar. If you want the user to have a calendar, you will need to give him an Exchange
 Online license.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</span>

<h2>            Sharing a document</h2>
                    <p>This really should be simple, but I just spent 30 frustrating minutes with support and got no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to Office 365 and am trying to share a document to individual users (I don't want one share link for everyone). I can add people to Share just fine, but it never sends them a link. I've tried it to three of my own accounts. Everything looks like
 it is working, but the emails never arrive. I tried sharing the document directly from OneDrive, same thing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this from within the offline Word document, it didn't work (OneDrive online is syncing fine). So I tried it within the online version, same thing. Very weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this issue? Maybe its a new problem (lucky me). Or any ideas on things to try?</p>

            <p>No error messages. People I add show up with rights to the document, but they never receive a message with a link. I've sent the email to 5 different email accounts and had people check their Spam folder, never received, even after multiple attempts.&nbsp; There
 is also no way to manually send an individual invite as you can't see the link. I don't want to make the document editable by anyone with a link as I want to be able to track who is in the document and remove an access individually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this isn't working for anyone after a recent update?&nbsp; Easy to test, try to share any document (I've tried both Excel and Word documents) to someone's email address and see if they get it.</p>

            <p>sorry it appears to be working for me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The process I used was:</p>
<ol>
<li>click on Share button (or right click on filename and select Share)</li><li>select "Email" option</li><li>insert the email address</li><li>click share</li></ol>
<p>The email showed up in less than a minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If for some reason this process is not working for you, you can go with the manual approach. It takes longer, but gets the job done. You do lose track of individual share rights control.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In step 2 copy the generated link and then create your own email to send them the link.

            <p>Tried exactly that, in both the Windows 10 client and the web version. No email, tried it to 4 different addresses, one at a time. I also don't get a link to copy/paste. The email addresses show up as being shared to, but there is no way to obtain a link
 for them.&nbsp; I've tried this in both Word and Excel. </p>

            <p>Yes, I understood you were trying to have unique invitations. In the OneDrive user interface that comes through the email link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that what is happening is that you are in a location where they are testing an update, one that is not working. Eventually they will figure it is not working properly and either back out the change or find a fix for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since you have said that it is not working for you (while it does for me),&nbsp; right now, the work around is to use the common links.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep trying to find a solution until it starts working again for you and then cancel the generic link and issue individual
 invitations.</p>

<h3> sofspra  say:</h3>
<h2>            16184 and Norton</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a terrible time with the last few Insider builds and 16184 was no exception.&nbsp; I tried at least 8 times.&nbsp; This is on a fine running HP notebook that was always great until these later builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Troubleshooter after each failure and it always found about 4 fixes and it would start again.&nbsp; I even deleted the SoftwareDistribution/Download folder to no avail.&nbsp; I usually start the install and go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I noticed that Norton fired a notice that it had removed a file in the SoftwareDistribution folder likely on a routine scan, the upgrade was not in session.&nbsp; I turned Norton off for 5 hours, ran the Troubleshooter, fixed the 4 problems it always
 finds, started the install and turned in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This AM, I found the HP turned off but upon a new start, it is now at 16184.&nbsp; My conclusion is that 16184 and Norton are not all that compatible once again.&nbsp; I know, a lot of folk do&nbsp; not like Norton, some will say that one should turn off 3rd party virus
 programs, but that is why we are Insiders, I think.&nbsp; For now, I may just tell Norton to ignore the SoftwareDistribution folder.&nbsp; At least I am up to date with Insiders once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let the games continue.&nbsp; <strong>If it is not broken, fix it until it is.</strong></p>

<div>a product type of Md can follow similar rule</div>

<p>All important questions asked by Don in order to help you eliminate MSN altogether. It's easy enough to do if you're using Windows 10 along with Edge which defaults to MSN when you log on to the internet. Here is what can be done if this is he case:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- click on the three dots on the upper right corner</p>
<p>- scroll down to Settings and click on this</p>
<p>- 2nd Option down reads: Open Microsoft Edge with and click on the down arrow inside the box</p>
<p>- choose "A specific page or pages" and put in the URL for the page you want Edge to open (i.e. www.foxnews.com)</p>
<p>- after inserting whatever page you want, be sure to save that by clicking on the little icon of a disk to the left</p>
<p>- now close Edge and restart and see if it now opens to whatever page you want</p>

            <p>No, Live Preview isn't globally available in mac Office. In a few instances you can see changes take place before applying them, but those are few &amp; far between.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar - Time Scale error</h2>
                    <p>Last week, my Outlook for Mac (365 Home) Calendar's time scale in the "Week" view started reporting incorrectly. Appointments are all showing 1 hour later; ie. an appointment with a 5 PM start time is showing at 6 PM in the "Week" view, but strangely the
 problem does not exist in "Day" or "Work Week" view.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The Actual Time reported is correct, but you can see from the image, the scale is off (3:29 PM reports as between 4 PM and 5 PM).</p>

            it's a limitation of the time scale the week the time changes - the scale uses the one in effect at midnight on the first day shown. Use the work week view or day view this week. The problem will resolve next week.

    <title>Moving Onenote 2016 files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Onenote 2016 files</h2>
                    <p>I recently started a new position, hence new documents and files.&nbsp; I began using OneNote 2016 (relatively novice user) to track all my meetings and information, which I accessed via my company laptop (OneNote 2016), my personal iPad (app) and my home laptop
 (OneNote online), storing files on my Office 365 Onedrive.&nbsp; Up to there, everything was fine. However I noticed that my notebooks were not all saved in the same directories; some were in a folder called "OneNote Notebooks" and the other was just "Notebooks".&nbsp;
 I thought it would make sense to consolidate everything to&nbsp;"OneNote Notebooks" and proceeded to do so using file explorer.&nbsp; I didn't delete "Notebooks", I just moved it under the other folder, just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, my notebooks are not all synchronizing correctly! I have updated Notes on my iPad that are not appearing in the target Notebook.&nbsp; I tried to move the files back to the original locations, but that hasn't completely solved the problem.&nbsp; Although
 I've searched online to find a solution, I haven't found exactly what I need:</p>
<p>1) Is there a way to reconnect the notebooks?&nbsp; </p>
<p>2) Is there a way to move notebooks easily?&nbsp; </p>
<p>3) Is there a way to rename the Notebooks, as I didn't choose the most meaningful file names when I first began the new job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate any guidance!</p>

            Ok, the RENAME feature worked perfectly.&nbsp; I'm not sure about the MOVE though; the files are already on OneDrive, but in different folders.&nbsp; I want them all in the same folder and that's where the synchronization issues began.&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Can I download rented movies from MS Store&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duongphan2502  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I download rented movies from MS Store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So to my understanding, I would need the app Movies and TV to browse and watch movies that I purchased/rented from MS Store. I have 2 questions:</p>
<p>1. Can I watch <strong>rented</strong> movies using the Movies and TV app <strong>
without</strong> Internet connection? I assume that I can do so with movies I bought, but not sure for rented ones.</p>
<p>2. Can I download the rented/bought movies as a file (.mkv, .mp4, etc.) and play them using a different app from Movies and TV?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>You can download rentals, but make sure you select download instead of stream before completing the rental transaction.&nbsp; As you cannot change this after.</p>
<p>You can only play the downloads in the Movies &amp; TV app on the device you downloaded the movie to.</p>

<p>The tools for Font and Color themes are on the <strong>View&gt;Slide Master</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office for Mac lacks a user interface to create and modify font themes. You have to hack the XML to do it. Fortunately, a font theme is a pretty simple text file.

<h2>            Access to Excel&#58; Dependent query &#40;on Combobox&#41; has too few parameters &#40;Runtime error 3601&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Query1 that is updated by the comboboxes present in a form. For example, in the first field of the query, the following criteria is applied:</p>
<p>[forms]![Form1]![ComboboxName] Or [forms]![Form1]![ComboboxName] Is Null</p>
<p>
</p><p>This criteria allows me to filter the information when the user specify the Name in the combobox or present all the information if combobox is left null.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Problem</strong></em>: When trying to export Query1 to excel, I get the runtime error 3601 (Too few parameters. Expected 1) when I run this piece of code</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim rs1 As DAO.Recordset<br />
Set rs1 = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset("Query1", dbOpenSnapshot)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Interpretation of the problem</em></strong>: When opening the recordset, the information of the combobox present in the form is not read despite the button to export the data is in the same form.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,<br />
Pedro Sousa</p>

    <title>Excel - Format Cells, Border - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meteor71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel - Format Cells, Border</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Excel for Mac, version number 16.21 (190115), which is the current production version.&nbsp; I have discovered an anomaly related to the use of the Format Cells, Border command which has persisted for the last several versions of Excel.&nbsp;
 When I select a collection of cells in a worksheet and indicate that I would like a thick colored line (e.g., blue) placed around the block of cells with thin Automatic-colored lines placed between the cells, Excel initially executes my command correctly.&nbsp;
 However, when I then re-execute the Format Cells, Border command on that same group of cells and try to change the outside border to a thick line of a different color (e.g., Red), Excel removes the original thick, colored (Blue) line and replaces it with no
 line whatsoever.&nbsp; I must then re-execute the Format Cells, Border command and re-specify my line thickness and border color in order for my command to execute correctly.&nbsp; Should I try to use the Format Cells, Border command to change both the color of the
 exterior border line and either add or delete the lines between the cells, it gets really messy and I have to execute the Format Cells, Border command several times before Excel will finally get my instructions right.&nbsp; I have been able to reproduce this problem
 with several different worksheets, including one that was brand new.&nbsp; Could the Microsoft Excel product team fix this problem in a future release?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said this, I am otherwise very pleased with the current version of Microsoft Excel.&nbsp; It's amazing how much the Mac version of Excel has improved over the last year and a half.&nbsp; I was part of the Office Insider program when I first signed up for Office
 365 for my Mac and found that the Mac version of the product wasn't nearly as good as that I had used with Windows.&nbsp; Kudos to Microsoft for improving Excel for Mac so much during that period!</p>

<p>Hi meteor71,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, I cannot reproduce the issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here are my reproduce steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. I create some cells , four of them in the thick blue line.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e0bc921-f55c-43e0-9d6f-6d1667c48861?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e0bc921-f55c-43e0-9d6f-6d1667c48861?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Then I re-execute the Format Cells, Border command on that same group of cells change the outside border to a thick line of a&nbsp;red color, the outside cell cover by the red lines and insider
 cell still blue.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e08bf2d4-7c1b-432b-a487-b7f59d217d51?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e08bf2d4-7c1b-432b-a487-b7f59d217d51?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my test environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53bb86d4-d57f-438b-8abf-fef7015ca57b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53bb86d4-d57f-438b-8abf-fef7015ca57b?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>My version of Microsoft Excel for Mac is identical to yours.&nbsp; I was able to reproduce your example without difficulty.&nbsp; However, my process (based on your example) is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Reproduce your original table, but with no borders</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82010ca2-4187-4c1f-b562-18b34311393b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82010ca2-4187-4c1f-b562-18b34311393b?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Using the Format Cells command/Border tab, add a blue border around cells C1, C2, D1, and D2 as in your example's Step 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7900be15-a14d-434b-a49f-0f42ed7b7e1f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7900be15-a14d-434b-a49f-0f42ed7b7e1f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Using the Format Cells command/Border tab, expand the outside border from the original four cells (C1:D2) to 10 cells (A1:E2) and change the color of the outside border from a thick blue line to a thick red line, per your example's Step 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a62b8904-1ef2-42c3-b561-c4e5a1d7b0ab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a62b8904-1ef2-42c3-b561-c4e5a1d7b0ab?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;Using the Format Cells command/Border tab, expand the outside border from the previous ten cells (A1:E2) to 18 cells (A1:F3) keeping the thick red line for the outside border
<strong>AND</strong> adding a thin Automatic-colored line for the interior border.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ec57cf6-ea11-4221-8147-292d655b3697?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ec57cf6-ea11-4221-8147-292d655b3697?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;Using the Format Cells command/Border tab, change the color of the outside border from a thick red line back to a thick blue line
<strong>AND</strong> change the interior lines (both vertical and horizontal) to a medium green line.&nbsp;
<strong>As a result, all of the borders have vanished!</strong></p>

<p>Hi meteor71,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To follow your decryptions, I still cannot reproduce the issue.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1-4&nbsp;is the same with yours, but the in step 5 is different. Here is my result:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f00b834-231b-41e1-9ff1-6e58bc52a1af?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f00b834-231b-41e1-9ff1-6e58bc52a1af?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of our reproduce result are different, may I asked could you provide a reproduced video or a OneDrive link&nbsp;via the

<p>Hi Meteor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to reproduce the issue and was not able to reproduce the problem in a new workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a problem that happens only with one specific workbook? Is the workbook saved in Excel (.xlsx) file format or a different format (perhaps the old.xls format)?</p>

            This is not a specific problem which occurs only in one workbook.&nbsp; In fact for my reply to Clark Wang on January 19th, I created a brand new .xlsx workbook in order to replicate his example and then progressed from there as I described in my response to
 him.&nbsp; I don't use the .xls format anymore as I understand that that is undesirable from a security standpoint.

            Those server addresses do not exist, I have been trying for years to get a hold of them to no avail! Told by MSN that no such server exists!@<br />

Best bet is to download Nokia's app for MSN from <a href="http://www.symbianv3.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            There is no such thing as the MSN/Yahoo server address, They don't have a server that you can connect to using an IM app, you would need to go through a server such as yamigo or as mentioned in the previous post download the respective Yahoo GO and MSN
 live apps for Symbian!

<br />
Well the other apps I mentioned are endorsed by Nokia so won't be that bad!

<h2>            32 bit trial of project professional 2013</h2>
                    I am unable to download the trial version of project professional 2013 32 bit version. it downloads the viso proffessional 2013 instead. I need this for a minimester and everyone at microsoft is of no help and answer.microsoft.com doesn't work either.
 i have spent hours on the phone with no help and am behind in class because this will not download. I run office home and business 2013 and is the 32 bit even though my laptop is a 64 bit. i can't take out my office because i need it to do the rest of the
 homework. all i have found is an upgrade for the problem and not a working download to use the upgrade on which doesn't download because the original part is there. Help!

            <p>If you are able to find the 64 bit download of Project 2013, then you do have the option of uninstalling your 32 bit Office H&amp;B and installing the 64 bit version, which would allow you to install 64 bit Project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are you downloading from?&nbsp; Have you tried the technet trials page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-project-professional-2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having a problem with that site, there is a "contact us" link you can use to report the problem to.</p>

<p>Have you asked anyone else in the class for the installation file, or the instructor?&nbsp; The install files are generic, anyone can use and re-use them.&nbsp; It is only the Product keys that are user specific.</p>

            my h&amp;b did not come with a 64 bit option. I have contacted every dept multiple times. have spent about 20 hours or more on the phone with them and feel like i am talking to a bunch of people who are clueless and don't care if you flunk a class that is
 needed and is a minimester . i can't uninstall my 32 bit version because I need it for the rest of the homework. caught between a rock and a hard place and microsoft says buy the $500 program i am unemployed and on disability.&nbsp; no money for groceries or to
 pay all the bills etc. they don't care and offered no help and one place the say to log into doesn't work either. i don't get it. Thanks for the ideas had thought of them already and tried to download it so many times. even let a microsoft agent try remote
 access a nd had to redo&nbsp; my computer because they screwed it up. won't let them do that again<br />

</p><p>Your experience with MS Support sounds typical of what many other people have reported. When things are going wrong, they take a really long time and end unhappily.&nbsp; Sorry...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First question, please confirm, do you currently have access to a Project 64 bit installation file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean when you say your "H&amp;B did not come with 64 bit option"?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you simply are not aware of what you have already paid for (this is a good thing for you).&nbsp; When you bought Office 2013 by default it provided you with the 32 bit installer. BUT, you also have the option of using the 64 bit version too.&nbsp; You simply
 have to download the 2013 H&amp;B 64 bit installer, then uninstall your 32 bit version and install and activate the 64 bit version with the
<strong>SAME Product Key</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you will be able to install the 64 bit Project you have(?). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: did you register your 2013 Product Key with your email account?&nbsp; Try to sign in to the
<span><a href="https://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://www.office.com/myaccount</strong></a><span> page with your email account (and password).&nbsp; If you can, you can download the required
 Office H&amp;B (32 or 64 bit) installation file.&nbsp; If you have not done it yet try this:</span></span></p>

    <title>EMAILS DELETED BY OUTLOOK&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bc2222  say:</h3>
<h2>            EMAILS DELETED BY OUTLOOK&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I started forwarding my Yahoo emails to Outlook about a year ago. When I first did the transfer all of my emails from Yahoo dating back to 2004 were forwarded to Outlook. For safety reasons, I left a copy of everything on Yahoo. And so, I had two copies:
 one on Outlook and one on Yahoo.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I noticed recently that all older emails have been erased off of Outlook AND Yahoo account. I lost everything. I now only have emails dating back to May 2012.
<span style="font-weight: bold">All older emails have been erased by Outlook. </span>
I did not do this, nor did I want to.<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline"> I need all of those old emails back. What is the solution?</span><br />

            I login to Outlook pretty much EVERY DAY. I did not delete anything. All older emails disappeared on their own and I just noticed that a couple of days ago.
<br />
<br />
Also, all folders and contacts have not been deleted. Only old emails have disappeared.
<br />
<br />
I need all those old emails back. How do I get them back?<br />

            <p>I've seen multiple reports here of mail in Hotmail.com or Outlook.com mailboxes inexplicable going missing without warning.&nbsp; I've not seen any reports like that anywhere for Yahoo.&nbsp; Messages being deleted from Hotmail/Outlook.com cannot affect messages on
 another mail service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Yahoo account is a free account and you do not log into it with a web browser&nbsp;within a&nbsp;six month time frame, the account will be deactivated and its mailbox contents deleted.&nbsp; If you forward your messages from Yahoo to Hotmail and then do not log
 into Yahoo again for six months, you'll lose the messages in the Yahoo mailbox.&nbsp;

<p>I have investigated your account and it is working fine on our end. Have you used the archive option of Outlook? If so, please try to locate your emails on your folders or you may try to use the advance search option.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the advance search, please click on <strong>Search email</strong> located on the top left of your inbox. By clicking Search email,
<strong>Advance search</strong> button will appear and please click on it. Specify the dates of the emails that you are looking for. Example Date Between 03/20/2011 and 06/30/2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I have had a very similar issue with yahoo mail.&nbsp; ALL of my emails from 2002 through February 2011 are gone.&nbsp; I can not find any information about automatically deleting older emails, but that seems to be a case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an account that I use everyday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like BC2222, I need those emails for reference and information.&nbsp; I do not understand why they would be deleted without my doing and while plenty of account storage is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not checked my Microsoft/hotmail account yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to retrieve them?&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Clearly, if you have an issue with Yahoo mail, you'll have to deal with it by contacting Yahoo.&nbsp; If you were using a web browser to access your mailbox instead of a local mail client, I'd be very surprised if there's anything you can do.&nbsp; However, Yahoo
 will have to address it.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft office disappeared from my laptop</h2>
                    Everything was fine all day today... Then just a bit ago I opened my laptop and my whole microsoft office was gone. I even went into my documents to open a word document and it couldn't open... I have no idea what to do. I'm not gonna repurchase another
 one when I did nothing wrong.&nbsp;

            Hi to the benefit for other people with a same problem I must say I have overcome this issue. The problem was the new batteries have to be cycled,which I thought I done in the past but I didn't. When buying a brand new battery you must&nbsp; run it down so
 that the phone switches off after a few hours try switch the phone back on and let it go off again this way you run down the battery totally,When the battery is absolutely dead the you charge it up for a 24 hour period and then the battery will be fully charged
 and&nbsp; hold its charge for a long time

<p>Hi Ahmed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One option to consider is simply adding some extra storage space in the form of a memory card. You may try to move your files from the internal memory of your phone to the external memory card. You can also uninstall some unused apps on your phone. In that
 case, it will add up extra space in the internal memory of your phone and you can install the Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need more help regarding this concern.</p>
<p>
