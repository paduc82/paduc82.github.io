                    <p>can't send webpage links to outlook I'm getting this msg We can't connect to Outlook right now. Please try again later.</p>
<p>every time i want to send something from a webpage or link i can't i get this error message but at the same time outlook opens in another window</p>
<p>&amp; is working but does not connect to the page or what i'm working on. this happens every time i want to email anything from the web. this happens in&nbsp;all browsers even windows, internet exployer 8, yahoo, firefox,
</p>
<p>my computer is a &nbsp;Windows &nbsp;XP sp3, &nbsp;internet exployer 8, this does not happen with my other email accounts, just hotmail, with the outlook upgrade.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;it is a pain to go to my other emails &amp; change my preferences to open another email when i'm using the windows browser that upgraded hotmail.it suppose to be easy to send links, webpages, articles, or just to access your email from the browser. i see something
 i want to get back to or just to send to someone &amp; i can't. it's a real pain for me!
</p>
<p>please answer this because it's been happening since i upgraded.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the late reply and for the inconvenience that this issue has caused you. I understand that after being upgraded to Outlook interface, you can no longer send webpage links because of the error message, "We can't connect to Outlook right now.
 Please try again later." The transition from Hotmail to Outlook should not affect the way you send webpage link. Though the new interface requires a higher version of browser so that it will function properly. Let me assist you in correcting this issue. I
 would like you read the thread below for the list of supported browsers for Outlook.com:</p>

            And now I realize that the Fix-it&nbsp; fix I mentioned was not for my problem (can't open email links on webpages) but the reverse (can't open webpage links in emails), so that's why that didn't help me.<br />

<h2>            How do I disable &#40;sound&#41; notifications in Outlook 2013 for Junk email from Hotmail&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2013. &nbsp;I have added my Hotmail account using Exchange ActiveSync (EAS). &nbsp;During email retrieval I get all my Hotmail email synced to Outlook, etc. &nbsp;However, during the sync process if I have only JUNK email (Junk E-Mail folder) then
 I still receive an&nbsp;audible&nbsp;sound notification for new email in my Hotmail folder --&nbsp;although&nbsp;there is no new email in the Hotmail&nbsp;Inbox, but only junk mail in the&nbsp;Junk E-Mail folder.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to turn OFF the&nbsp;audible&nbsp;notification for Junk email in the Hotmail account, within Outlook 2013 (or Hotmail for that matter)?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>No, its not configurable. Sorry. You can turn off sound notifications globally in options and set up a rule to play sounds for new mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETA: junk mail filters first, so a rule that applies to all mail and is first on the list should work (don't use stop processing!)&nbsp;- but it will ding ding ding for every message, not just once per mail pass.

            This answer is UNHELPFUL at all. I have perform these two methods before asking to this community support. The site still keep pop-up every the change of the day or when the computer is turn-on for the first time. It is pop-up using IE, but it will not
 pop-up if I uninstall the IE from my computer. This is must be something wrong with the browser, or the browser has been infected by virus/malware/spyware. I tried to scan the computer, but find nothing. Do you have a better suggestion?&nbsp;

I am having the same issue and have NOT been successful with any attempt at a solution.&nbsp; Popup blocking does not work and I've tried disabling all adons ... not success.&nbsp; So I will hope to follow this thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I;ve tried malware scans and I've even searched my registry ... no luck there either.</p>

            i finally just totally wiped everything and reinstalled firefox<br />
i even deleted my xmarks bookmarks and history and all my extensions and completely uninstalled firefox and reinstalled from scratch<br />
it hasn't returned since<br />
qualifies as a serious issue, imo, though i suppose it is mostly harmless<br />
it is serious because there is no solution, lol<br />
and apparently no help either, though this is likely not the best place for help<br />

    <title>macro to remove the lines around text boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> margaretupton  say:</h3>
<h2>            macro to remove the lines around text boxes</h2>
                    Would it be possible to get a macro to remove all the lines around text boxes in a document.&nbsp; I need to have the lines showing around a text box to enable a picture to be put inside and sized, but once the picture is in place take off the lines.&nbsp; Instead
 of selecting each one and going through the process of removing each boxes lines, could a macro do this for me.&nbsp; I cannot record it, so don't know where to start.&nbsp; Would be grateful for some help please.<br />

    <title>Excel query error after update to version 16.0.6741.2048 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael merkel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel query error after update to version 16.0.6741.2048</h2>
                    <p>After updating to the version mentioned above, I am no longer able to run a query that ran successfully for months before. No other changes were made.</p>
<p>The query now produces an error when trying to filter the date column through [is in year] [This year]. The error is</p>
<p><em>Microsoft.Mashup.Engine1.Runtime.Library+Date+FromFunctionValue</em></p>
<p>When I do the workaround and change the date filter to after the last day of last year (which is limited use), I receive additional errors.</p>
<p>The next step in the query tries to simply round the values in the column to two digits. The new error on this is now</p>
<p><em>DataFormat.Error: Wrong number of arguments used with function in query expression 'round([_].[Mill1], 2, 0'.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting these steps and re-applying them and still get the same error.</p>
<p>This last update is buggy as ****.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.The detailed steps of how you create the query for our reproduce.</p>

            <p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that I can re-create the issue with a new file and a newly created query.</p>
<p>I found through experimentation and luck that the errors disappeared when I ran "Replace errors' for the column containing the date. The previous version of Excel (I am on the deferred channel) had no problems with the error values.</p>
<p>Good that I found the solution, not good that I had to spend a morning solving a programming change that made the program less forgiving or less able to handle data exceptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>This was a previous unanswered thread. I looked under members and no one has the Admin tag next to them. The option to become Admin in the top right corner is not there.</p>

<h3> nevp  say:</h3>
<h2>            cant connect my nokia 6280 to pc suite</h2>
                    hi there,<br />
i have just downloaded the latest version of pc suite to my laptop (version 6.82.21.0) i am using windows xp and service pack 2.<br />
<br />
when it comes to getting connected i plug the phone in to the usb, the computer finds the hardware but the pc suite does not recognise that i am connected.<br />
<br />
i can connect ok to my old computer with the old version of pc suite (6.81.13.0) so my phone and cable is ok.<br />
<br />
is it a software problem with the new version? can i download the old version from anywhere to check this out? if not then any ideas?

<br />

<br />
Do this:<br />
1. Go to Windows Control Panel and open "Add or Remove Programs" application.<br />
2. Select "PC Connectivity Solution", click "Change" and then "Repair".<br />
3. After Repair, restart PC.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Does it help?

<h2>            Comments not printing correctly.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, folks -- I have one comment in cell C2 (on "Page 1").</p>
<p>My sheet is 1 page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Page Layout setting is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&gt; Page Setup &gt; Sheet &gt; Print = "At end of sheet"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Excel adds a page 2 and prints the comment there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Print Area is set to just a few cells around C2, and if I look&nbsp;at it in View &gt; Page Break Preview, there is only Page 1.&nbsp; Why is Excel adding an extra page?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I change Page Layout setting to:</p>
<p>&gt; Page Setup &gt; Sheet &gt; Print =&nbsp;"As displayed on sheet", the comment doesn't print at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help, gratefully appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Lynne, much easy having the example thanks, go to print, page set up, sheet, under comments select As displayed on sheet,
</p>
<p>if you want to see the comment in your print sheet just unhide the comment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the problem was that the comment was set up to be printed at the end of the sheet</p>

<h2>            Multiple PC Synchronisation with Windows Mobile Smartphones</h2>
                    <span>Hello,<br />
                    <span>Hello,<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone can help with this problem.<br />
<br />
I have an issue with an HTC 710 with Windows Mobile Smartphone edition installed, and it'll only let me sync with either the work pc or home pc's outlook! Whenever I change computer, it wants to wipe the data and disable the other computer from syncing with
 it. Is there any way to get round this? I'm using outllok 2003 and Activesync. <br />
<br />
Many Thanks,<br />
<br />
Snowman.<br />

<p>Hi Snowman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment Windows Mobile Devices are only allowed to sync with two PC's, so if you want to use a third PC you will have to delete an existing partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you must use a third party software in order to get it done:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laplink&nbsp;claim their software <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-410873-10390686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Laplink PDASync 4</strong></a>&nbsp;can sync with multiple PC's, so you want to give it a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nuno</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel and Powerpoint not opening after latest Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel and Powerpoint not opening after latest Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Today, I updated my computer with the latest Windows 10 update. After the update was done I tried accessing a PowerPoint and the file did not open up (no error message popped up). I tried Word and Excel to see if there was the same problem with those two.
 Word opened up just fine, but excel has the same problem as PowerPoint. I clicked on the actual app rather than file to see if that would open it, but that did not work. Then I tried right clicking and opening that way but that didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Office and reinstalled it after resetting my laptop, but the problem continued. I then did a repair twice to see if that did anything, and the same problem still occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I should do? I was thinking of doing a system restore before the update next.</p>

            There might be an add on that is not compatible. You can try opening the program in safe mode. Hold the CTRL button on your keyboard and open excel or power point, it will then ask if you want to start in safe mode. Click yes. If it opens navigate to File &gt; Options &gt; Add ons &gt; Click go at the bottom. uncheck all add ons and restart Excel or PowerPoint. See if that helps.

            You will need to update your office. 

1. Open any office application which is working.
2. File &gt; Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now to install the latest update

            Do you get an error when trying to send an email to them?
<br />Do you have them blocked or in Junk mail ?
<br />If you click on Junk on your outlook program and click on Junk email options check the block senders list make sure it is not there blocked. 
<br />you can also in the screen click the tab that says Safe Senders and add also Safe Recipients and add there also.

<br />Running Get-FederationInfomation on any external domain results in the following error:
<br />
<br />Federation information could not be received from the external organization.
<br />    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Get-FederationInformation], GetFederationInformationFailedException
<br />    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : [Server=SERVERNAME,RequestId=342360e4-535c-4489-9452-d747da580fde,TimeStamp=4/18/2018 4

<br />  .SystemConfigurationTasks.GetFederationInformation
<br />    + PSComputerName        : servername.domain.com
<br />
<br />Because of this error, I am unable to create a new organization relationship. So far, I have tried the following:
<br />
<br />Verified it is a local error and not external. I have attempted to get information on domains that I know work correctly for other organizations
<br />Completely removed and rebuilt my Federation Trust as it had been ported from older versions of exchange
<br />Verified that IE on my exchange 2013 server is able to reach <a href="https://autodiscover.TargetDomain.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.svc/wssecurity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://autodiscover.TargetDomain.com/autodisco...</a>
<br />My guess would be that a service is not running correctly since the command fails instantly.
<br />What else can I do to troubleshoot?

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">My Lumia 950 XL appears with a yellow exclamation mark in Windows 10 Device Manager and Windows is convinced that it cannot find a driver for it.
 Oddly enough the connection did work a week ago. What am I doing wrong and what happened to the driver?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried that several times. The problem is that Device Manager does not find the driver when it finds the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Microsoft's support page for the phone has helpful tips like "make sure the cable is connected" but doesn't have a download link for the driver (which apparently doesn't exist).</p>

<p>Also as Jack Cook suggested, remove device from device manager and try attaching phone to a different port(the back ports if it's a desktop) and check if the issue persists. If the driver doesn't download, try searching for the drivers manually on the net
 via device manager.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>No, I never did manage to find a working solution. That's one reason why I still use my Android phone.</p>

<p><strong>I suggest the only practical resolution is that you simply get rid of the phone. It is a disgusting rabbit hole of distress.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the fully updated Microsoft non-Supported 'Flagship' Lumia 950XL in conjunction with my fully updated DELL G7 7588 running Windows 10 Professional. I am also determined to continue using my Office Professional 64 Bit which is a functional reason
 why I purchased the Lumia 950XL; which is also connected to the specifically purchased:</p>
<p>- Microsoft non-Supported HD-500 Dock/Interface (able to use my 60" Sony Smart TV to view rather than phone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/accessory/hd-500/?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0 as well as,</p>
<p>- my Microsoft non-Supported Band 2 (having followed instructions) brainstorm was fitness with phone contact cycling</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000351/band-repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the DELL G7 after I had intended to purchase the Surface Pro 2. However, it became clear doing so would be foolish to invest additional good, hard earned money after clearly, totally poor, Microsoft hardware and incompetent support services for
 all the purchased Microsoft-branded devices. 100% reality is the 100% <span>
Microsoft </span>disinterest in demonstrably valuing it's Revenue Paying Customers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Imagine Ford doing this upon recognizing the Edsel was not evolving as planned. Can anyone imagine Ford stating it would no longer provide fan belts or water pumps as an example to those Customers who purchased their product?That would NEVER have occurred
 let alone been legally acceptable to governments. How do they get away with this now? No Commercial lawyers in the world have not bought Microsoft products like the Microsoft Lumia 950XL?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>That acknowledgement is very good on the one hand, of course, when dealing with children. However, acknowledging the error of his ways does not absolve him of hisresponsibility to those very Revenue Paying Customers who entered into a legal contract with
 Microsoft, who he 'leads' and is consequentially legally responsible for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I find myself being compelled to find a complementary Android device (further cost otherwise unnecessary) as my 950XL which effortlessly works with Office Professional 64 Bit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lumia 950XL now has charge-circuitry challenges (among a plethora of other issues like camera non-function which screws my Skype or WhatsApp Apps) . It discharges while plugged in and not used; even when the WiFi &amp; Bluetooth &amp; Data are turned 'OFF' to
 troubleshoot/overcome the anomaly. I finally did a Full Back Up Hard Reset only to learn it selectively Fully Backed Up items which did not include my WhatsApp. In turn, My DELL G7 obliged me to sync via the displayed QR Code which removed all my (otherwise
 functioning) PC Windows 10 64 Bit WhatsApp and not in fact intelligent synchronization as all my history was deleted (apparently non-recoverable) as well as all, but about 5, contacts. My Microsoft OneDrive via Hotmail personal Cloud backup location shows
 no associated data file to try to recover from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you better than I have been experiencing. Cheers!</p>

<p>I threw in the towel on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>It was bad enough that there were a number of Apps not available,</p>
<p>but when the existing Apps began dropping off (e.g. AmericanAir, USAA, Cadillac, WellsFargo)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was DONE.&nbsp; Now have Samsung S8.</p>
<p>There are a few features I miss from MS, but worth the trade.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the late response. Do you still have the same issue? We'd like to verify if this green patch can be seen&nbsp;when using other phone apps aside from the camera. If the issue is isolate with the camera app only, you may first try resetting the camera
 settings. Otherwise, you may try these basic troubleshooting steps (for Lumia phones running WP 8.1):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Reboot.&nbsp;Press and hold the volume down and the power keys simultaneously for about 10-15 seconds.</li><li>Make sure that the phone's&nbsp;OS is up to date, as well as its system apps: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/software-update/wp8-software-update/." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/software-update/wp8-software-update/.</a></li><li>If the issue remains, you may perform a reset on the phone. As this will delete all your files, creating a backup file is a must. To proceed with the reset, go to Settings &gt; System &gt;&nbsp;About &gt; Reset your phone.
</li></ol>
<p>We'd appreciate it if you can give us a feedback on&nbsp;the status of your concern and the outcome after doing the&nbsp;steps we provided. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past few days, I have been unable to sign in from the OneNote app on mac OS Mojave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any modification I make in the app isn't synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to log in, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The authentication session has expired. Please sign-in again.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I get this message every time I try to log in.</p>
<p>I have no problem to log in online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how to solve that problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warm regards,</p>

            <p>We have two solutions for this issue to be resolved. The first thing you need to do is to reset Windows 10 Store. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Search</strong> or <strong>I'm Cortana. Ask me anything.</strong></p>
<p>2. Type <strong>WSReset</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Right click&nbsp; and then select <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></p>
<p>The second solution is to gain full control over the packages folder. Follow these steps carefully:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open <strong>Run</strong> command or type
<strong>Run</strong> on <strong>I'm Cortana. Ask me anything.</strong></li><li>Enter the following path and then press <strong>Enter</strong>:<strong> C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local</strong></li><li>If in case you can't find the username, click <strong>Advanced</strong> then after that, click
<strong>Add.</strong></li><li>Find folder <strong>Packages</strong>, right click on it then select <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Security window</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Select a principal</strong>, then type <strong>users</strong> in
<strong>Select User or Group box.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Check Names.</strong></li><li>Check <strong>Full control</strong> for <strong>Basic permission section.</strong></li><li>Click<strong> Apply </strong>then<strong> OK.</strong></li><li>Reboot the computer.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have full control over the Packages folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

I am creating some flashcards and want to put the symbol for a short vowel (inverted hat) over them and the symbol for a long vowel (short line) above letters.&nbsp; Is this possible and if so please can you tell me where/how I do it.&nbsp; Cannot find in symbols.&nbsp; Thanks

            You mean these: <b>āǎă</b>?&nbsp;(Copy and Paste these into Word, then increase their size or zoom in to see them clearly.)
<div><br />
<div>The simplest way:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Go to <i>System Preferences &gt; Language and Text &gt; Input Sources</i>&nbsp;and enable the "U.S. Extended" keyboard.</li><li>While you are there, place a checkmark on " Show input menu in menu bar," at the bottom. (This will add a new keyboard-selection menu in the top-right corner of your screen, next to the system clock.)</li><li>Then, in the new menu, select <i>Show keyboard viewer.</i></li></ul>
<br />
Pressing the <b>Option</b> key will highlight the key combinations you can press. The first press will be a "dead" key, which means you then need to press a second key to obtain the combination.&nbsp;For the case above, I pressed
<b>Option a then a</b>,&nbsp;<b>Option v then a</b>&nbsp; and <b>Option v then a</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want a phonetic alphabet, use the<b> <a href="http://ipa.typeit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IPA English</a></b> or the <a href="http://ipa.typeit.org/full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>IPA Full</b></a> online keyboards to type your text, then cut and paste into Word. It's a lot simpler than installing a phonetics keyboard and font.</div>
