<h2>            E-mails deleted on my computer are still on phone even after sync</h2>
                    <p>I have looked at the existing posts but I don't think they address my issue fully.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I first got my phone, if I deleted an e-mail from my inbox, whether on my computer or my phone, after the next sync the inbox would be the same on both devices.
<u>This is no longer the case</u>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>E-mails deleted on my phone <u>will</u> also be deleted on my computer</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes&nbsp;it works the other way round, but not always, e.g. I have just deleted 3 e-mails whilst on my computer, then synced my phone inbox.&nbsp; Those 3 e-mails have gone from my phone too, but I still have in&nbsp;my phone inbox&nbsp;18 e-mails&nbsp;dating from 28-1-14
 to 4-3-14 which have been deleted on my computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My e-mail are obviously being synced as new ones are appearing on my phone, and I have done numerous manual syncs but this makes no difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have not knowingly changed any settings but this is definitely a new phenomenon (not sure just how long it has been going on but probably about 2 months now)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do you have any solutions please?</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            dear alib58,
<div>the mail app on windows phone doesn't really do any syncing with your mail account.when you press the sync button,it seeks for any mails in your mailbox,and if any,they are shown up to you.</div>
<div>when you delete any mail from your phone,then there is syncing and informs the email host on that.</div>
<div>after you delete any e mail from your computer and syncing,the app shows the existing new emails up to your last synced date.it searches only within the two syncing time period.the mails you got in to your phone doesn't get affected by the new syncing,as
 they are not within the time period it searches.</div>
<div>hope that will make you satisfy as the answer.</div>

                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered this problem just few days ago and I can't fix it. It says that the license of my windows 10 is soon to expire. My laptop, when I purchased it, is running on windows 8.1 and I upgraded this to Windows 10. It worked well few weeks ago but
 then I received notifications that the license is soon to expire. Please help me on this problem. Than You.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            VBA code to save a word document</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I am trying to use code to save a Word document with the filename including a cell reference.</p>

            <p>aaaah... wish I'd asked sooner... you can't have those "/" in the filename. &nbsp;Maybe change the date format or remove the "/" by:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">objdoc.SaveAs Filename:=("\\waterplus\dfs\home\Laura.Whitehurst\Desktop\Commission Statement" &amp; replace(shtM.Range("C2"),"/","") &amp; ".odt")</span></p>

            <p>Similarly, if you wanted Y-M-D format for sorting you could use something like</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">objdoc.SaveAs Filename:=("\\waterplus\dfs\home\Laura.Whitehurst\Desktop\Commission Statement" &amp; _</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">year(</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">shtM.Range("C2").value &amp; "." &amp; _</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">format(month(</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">shtM.Range("C2").value),"00") &amp; "." &amp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">format(day(</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">shtM.Range("C2").value),"00") &amp; ".odt")</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Arkadi's solution is definitely shorter, it's just a question of your personal preference for formatting options. One observation- you might want a slight tweak,
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">objdoc.SaveAs Filename:=("\\waterplus\dfs\home\Laura.Whitehurst\Desktop\Commission Statement" &amp; replace(shtM.Range("C2"),"/",".") &amp; ".odt")</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">this adds a dot between each part of the date, so that you don't run into issues with Jan 21 and Dec 1 both having the same filename (1212016), instead you get 1.21.2016 and 12.1.2016</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first option provided above within this reply would give you 2016.01.21 and 2016.12.01 for those two values.</p>

<h3> qwerty1234_833  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the email address associated with my Office 365 University Subscription&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My school provides students with Office 365 accounts for email, SkyDrive, etc. My email address recently changed due to personal reasons, so I was wondering what to do in order to transfer my Office 365 University Subscription from my old email address to
 my new email address. My school's Help Desk said that my old email address will get deleted within 30 days of issuing the new email address.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Therefore, I will not have access to my Office applications, which I paid for. I'm not concerned about the emails, files, other items. That has already been taken care of.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I appreciate any help.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The&nbsp;page the link took me to did not help me. &nbsp;I tried to make an alias in order to delete the old alias. I did receive the verification email&nbsp;at&nbsp;my new email address, except the verify link leads me to the same page the&nbsp;first link took me to.&nbsp;I don't see&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;verify
 my new email address. </p>
<p>I&nbsp;have changed my email address for Microsoft and Office 365 University and&nbsp;received notifications at my new email address, but I still have to log in with the previous email address. I would like to log in with my new email address. I also noticed that
 if someone wants to send me an email the alias is still my previous email address.
</p>
<p>I do like Microsoft. </p>
<p>I took a computer course this past January, one of the books was Microsoft Office 2013 Introductory. I really enjoyed seeing what I could do with these programs.
</p>
<p>Earlier this year I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;my 2012 DELL laptop&nbsp;had problems&nbsp;after I updated from windows 7 to&nbsp;windows 8 as the screen was doing weird things. I called DELL.&nbsp;I&nbsp;found&nbsp;out my hard drive needed to be replaced. After my hard drive was replaced I was happy to
 see I could reinstall both windows 8 and Office 365 University. </p>
<p>I just need to get rid of my previous email address, but it seems there are different areas within the site where my previous email address is still listed. It is a little stressful.</p>

<p>One thing for sure is that you have "FK_ExcurID" enclosed in quotes, making it a string literal.&nbsp; Also, you don't need the "Me." qualifier (and I'm surprised it accepted it).&nbsp; Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Excur_Date]=DLookUp("ArriveDate","tbl_Main","[PKID_Main] = " &amp; [FK_ExcurID])

<p>Hi Dirk, maybe it accepted it after all the relentless hacking I did to it... probably just surrendered :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>in any event, your most welcome suggestion didn't do it either?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know CF is working on that form because it happily displays on another unrelated field on the same form.</p>

<p>Hi Again Dirk, having the utmost faith in your syntax, I re-examined my references, which were wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the correct formula:&nbsp;[ExcurDate]=DLookUp("ArriveDate","tbl_Main","[PKID_Main] = " &amp; [FKID_Excur])</p>
<p>
</p><p>which works! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me how I can express a smiliar line for another box, but based on the above table reference that say's:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If [<span>ExcurDate] is less than [ArriveDate] OR more than [</span>DepartDate] do the conditional formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ExcurDate]&lt;DLookUp("ArriveDate","tbl_Main","[PKID_Main] = " &amp; [FKID_Excur]) OR [ExcurDate]&gt;DLookUp("DepartDate","tbl_Main","[PKID_Main] = " &amp; [FKID_Excur])</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it doesn't seem to work. (double checked the references, all correct)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Ok, I think I figured it out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have a depart date in the table because it is a calculated date in the form's underlying query. So I changed both dlookup table references to the form's query. And it worked a treat!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Working formula:</p>
<p>[ExcurDate]&lt;DLookUp("ArriveDate","Qry_Main","[PKID_Main] = " &amp; [FKID_Excur]) OR [ExcurDate]&gt;DLookUp("DepartDate","Qry_Main","[PKID_Main] = " &amp; [FKID_Excur])<br />
</p>
<p>I realise I have been having in the most part, a conversation with myself. But I leave this all here in case anyone else has a need for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Dirk.</p>

<h2>            How to Connect Nokia E72 to VPN&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hotspot Shield has an awesome free VPN service which works very well on the iPhone:
<a href="http://hotspotshield.com/clientless/iphone/get_started.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://hotspotshield.com/clientless/iphone/get_started.php</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to use this service with my Nokia E72.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Nokia web site suggests, my phone supports VPN. Hotspot Shield VPN service is using IPSec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a tool on Nokia web site which apparently I should use to generate a VPN policy and install it to my phone. It is at the bottom of this page:
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/nokia-mobile-vpn/compatibility-and-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/nokia-mobile-vpn/compatibility-and-download</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched a lot, but I really can't figure it out and make it work :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make it work?</p>

<div><span>I downloaded the tool you pointed out, it looks newer, but actually same way of working. Still can't figure out how to use it with Hotspot Shield service.</span></div>
<div><span>And everytime I try to save the configurations it tells me that I don't have .Net framework 2! However I'm certain I have it. I use Windows 7.</span></div>

<div><span>Have you tried the tool?</span></div>

<p>Hi <span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/CD15120D-F4A1-4525-A634-2DA88CEA5125"><span><font color="#000000">hbazerbashi</font></span></a>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you try the tool with administrative privilege.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I believe&nbsp;your Windows 7 User Access Control is enabled which might be the reason for this behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I request you to right click on the NCT short cut icon and select "Run as Administrator" option and use the tool to generate the VPN policy.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this should solve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>do let me know in case of any issues.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get connected with hotspotshield.com service, you need the correct VPN policy parameters, i.e. GW address and IKE&nbsp;&amp; IPSec configuration details. Then you</p>
<p>can generate the policy and transfer it to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying (unsuccessfully) for some time to connect first and E71 and now an E72 to a Juniper SA (2000) VPN using IKEv2.&nbsp; Juniper has a document for this here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/ive/guides/howtos/How_to_IKEv2_on_Secure_Access.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/software/ive/guides/howtos/How_to_IKEv2_on_Secure_Access.pdf</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried these instructions unsuccessfully on an E71 several months back when the Mobile Client Policy tool was still available, and I'm trying them again on an E72 with the new NCT.&nbsp; However - I'm running into a peculiar issue - I'm following the instructions
 (adapted as well as I can) to the NCT, but when I attempt to save the policy file, I get an error that I have not supplied enough informaion.&nbsp; If I add a bogus VPC file, the NCT allows me to save the VPN configuration, but when I go to the advanced settings
 and return, I can't save the file anymore - same error regarding missing mandatory fields.&nbsp; And of course I have no idea what they are - I've tried putting values in all fields but with no success.&nbsp; Any help with this or has anyone ever actually made this
 work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it would be very helpful if Nokia would document the IKEv2 - SA configuration - just as a guide at least.&nbsp; Juniper SA's are some of the most widely deployed access devices around.&nbsp; And it doesn't seem Juniper or Nokia are in any hurry to release
 the Pulse application and make my life any easier.</p>

<p>Do you have a memory card and how big? If you are just using phone memory, or if you have filled the memory card and spilled over into phone memory, then you could have filled up space that is needed for processing. Check how many megabutes are free on c:
 drive by looking in the phone's file manager.</p>

            It is very simple. Just try to free some memory in the phone by moving some iterms in the memory card or by deleating some iterms that are contained in the phone memory as required by the comand.

<p>I got the same problem with MIRACLEDON. My phone NOKIA 5130c-2 when pressing the music player it always shows "NOT ENOUGH MEMORY". I check the phone memory but nothing there as well as my memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to fix this problem except by sending it to Nokia Store.</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing back to us and sorry for the delay response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it is related to the sign-in with your Office 365 account and as we mentioned earlier data types are available if you have English editing language. When we tested at our end by signing out from Office applications,
<strong>data types </strong>are disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, summarizing all the conditions required for <strong>data types </strong>to be enabled:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Office 365 subscriber.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>English editing langauge.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>Sign in with Office 365 subscription account.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chitrahaas</p>

<p>my doubt is if i am using the student option - is it only for use via online. For offline use do i need to buy microsoft office separately?</p>

            Hi RickMadrigal 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to see if there is a way out. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Jack<br />
<br />
I didn't see the storage card option under sync options.&nbsp; You can't scroll using finger flicks, you have to grab the scroll bar on the right, rather than the window pane to get to the bottom of the sync options screen.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help someone else out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response though.<br />

<br />
If you‚Äôre using a POP account then you can‚Äôt. This is not an Entourage nor Outlook problem.<br />
<br />
When your mail server receives a new message it gives the message a unique ID. This is what mail applications use to determine whether or not to download messages. New IDs get downloaded. Existing IDs don‚Äôt. When mail servers are rebooted or reset in some way
 they often reset the unique IDs. The next time the mail client connects it sees that it has a lot of ‚Äúnew‚Äù messages and downloads them again.<br />
<br />
You can work through this a couple of different ways:<br />
<br />
Edit your POP account settings to delete messages that are older than a certain length of time. Start with five days. If the server is reset then you will only receive the last five days worth of messages again.<br />
<br />
Convert to an IMAP account instead of POP. IMAP is made to synchronize with your mail server unlike POP, which downloads and deletes.<br />
<br />
Trying to use your POP server as an IMAP server by leaving messages on your server is not a good solution.<br />

<h2>            Problem with MSOnline module</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have small script that notyfying users about password expiry. This scipt worked few monts perfectly. Last time ran on 13.04.2017.</p>
<p>I tryed two days ago to run it from hand and I realized that MSOnline isn't on my server (It's 2012R2) - stange...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled login assistant and administration config. Instaled new ones according to&nbsp;https://technet.microsoft.com/pl-pl/library/dn975125.aspx this doc was updated on 20.04.2017 so I think that something was changed.</p>
<p>Today (two days later) same problem. MSOnline module is missing... When I try to install again AdministrationConfig_3.msi I got error "the specified account alredy exist"</p>
<p>second strange problem is that I should download AdministrationConfig-V1.1.166.0-GA.msi&nbsp; but download link gives me AdministrationConfig_3.msi insted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How to fix my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>new info</p>
<p>I uninstaled and installed again "Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant" I got MSOnline module but in "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\" folder not in "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\"&nbsp; - why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doblechecked that I installed 64bit of sign in assistant. </p>
<p>My script working again... but what will happend tommorow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Virus when browsing Mobile Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shayna09---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virus when browsing Mobile Internet</h2>
                    I've googled with no results, but has anyone out there any thoughts on how exposed browsing standard web sites using N-Series phones.<br />
<br />
I browse all my standard sites using my phone, that I browse on my PC. But I'm fully protected on the PC, and there seems to be nothing available for Symbian.<br />
<br />
If there is malware infected on a web-site, it will surely impact you whether via a phone browser or standard IE browser.<br />
<br />
Say, I log into my internet bank url, where's my protection that a key logger isn't sat there on my phone.<br />
<br />
Would welcome any views on this, or suggestions of good software to address this risk.

            A PC/Windows virus will not infect your phone.<br />
<br />
And for most phones today there are no viruses, and even so, no malicious application can infect your phone by just browsing (you have to actively accept a download, and actively approve the installation of the application, and also accept any warnings for
 unsecure software, etc.).<br />
<br />
Do not install applications from untrusted sources, and do not allow other people to install applications on your phone.<br />

<p>I agree with petrib :) so far there are no active cross-infection between a PC and a mobile phone. You can save a mobile malware file in a folder in your PC without harming it. When I say active, if you connect your phone via mobile cable to your virus-infected
 PC, the virus from the PC won't transfer to the phone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Did Windows Phones project and perhaps even Microsoft are dying&#63;</h2>
                    So first Nokia who is much more experience than Microsoft in mobile division (compare Nokia 930 vs Microsoft 950 design) gone with wind in mobile business with Microsoft, than came Windows 10 O/S and unfinished Windows Phone 10 O/S , who is perhaps 70%
 finished and 30% unfinished, than after all HERE apps are moving from Windows Store and Windows Phones, only thing on Windows Phones worth to mention also gone from Windows Phone 10 completely, that mean all HERE apps are gone, not to mention that most of
 the businesses don't made at all Windows Phones 10 or Windows 10 apps, even those state own, so natural question will be, did Windows Phones project and perhaps even Microsoft project are dying?

            Your first post indicates that your system did not use the usual separators, therefor try one of this formulas:
<br />
<br />=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(Exam!B5;{"voucher";"reschedule";"pb";"cb"};0));Exam!B5;"")
<br />=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(Exam!B5;{"voucher"."reschedule"."pb"."cb"};0));Exam!B5;"")
<br />=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(Exam!B5;{"voucher","reschedule","pb","cb"};0));Exam!B5;"")
<br />
<br />And yes, formulas are insensitive for capitals.
<br />

            Hi&nbsp;Krishna MohanPolavarapu,
<div><br />
<div>We need a little more information to help you resolve your issues. Please provide the manufacturer and model of your Windows Phone, your service provider, and the model name/number of your Sony headphones.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some other thoughts is to insure that if the Sony Wireless Headphones are Bluetooth, insure Bluetooth is on and you've completed the pairing process. Settings =&gt; Bluetooth =&gt; On</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, check to see if your Sony Wireless Headphones are NOT Bluetooth, as they might need a special dongle to connect and might not be appropriate to use with Windows Phone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
