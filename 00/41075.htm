            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please share these details.</p>
<p>1. What is the exact error&nbsp;you are&nbsp;getting when&nbsp;you are&nbsp;accessing&nbsp;apps? </p>
<p>2. Are you using a proxy to connect to internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I provide the steps for app troubleshooter, I would like to let you know about basic information before running an app:<br />
&gt; User Account Control settings must be enabled.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> User Account Control (UAC) notifies you before changes are made to your PC that requires administrator-level permission. By default, UAC is set to notify you whenever apps try to make changes to your PC, but you can change how often UAC
 notifies you.<br />
&gt;, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768.<br />
&gt; Requires Microsoft Account. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <strong>Run App troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
Please be informed that Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the Apps troubleshooter.<br />

<h2>            Has my computer been hacked or does it have a virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have received constant messages about low storage in the last two days. An icon appears on the tool bar ( a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark). the message in the window says "Your computer is low on memory. Save your files and close these programs:
 Google Chrome". This has never happened before even with low storage space ( My laptop currently has over 5GB of space) I have checked system apps but nothing new has appeared. I am concerned because my bank account was also recently hacked and money withdrawals
 were happening from Cyprus ( I have since sorted the money issue with the bank).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or thoughts would be great?</p>

            Hi JoeRedahan, 
<br />
<br />If you are concerned about the security of your computer, I would suggest running a Malwarebytes scan, followed by an AdwCleaner scan. These can be downloaded from the below links (they are free, but very good applications for removing malware):
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how these scans go. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            Hi Joe.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />See this tutorial for latest fixes:  <a href="https://windowsreport.com/your-computer-is-low-on-memory-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/your-computer-is-low-...</a>.  Just follow the steps, don't use any downloads or tools from it which are ads.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Joe,
<br />
<br />That popup does not refer to hard drive space at all . . .
<br />
<br />It is indicating you are running out of RAM, not hard drive space and is asking to close Chrome to free up some RAM . . .
<br />
<br />Chrome, like all browsers is extremely RAM hungry, it will eat lots of RAM if you have more than a couple of Tabs open
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />If necessary, click on the Processes Tab
<br />
<br />Leave that open to monitor your resources
<br />
<br />How much of your RAM is Chrome using?       
        </p>

<p>Thank you very much for the reply.</p>
<p>I opened task manager and went to processes. I'm not sure what the figures show so thought it best to upload this pic. At the time only chrome and Task manager were open. I understand that browsers use a lot of R<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc01fe15-d56f-4cb4-ba63-725faf73ca48?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc01fe15-d56f-4cb4-ba63-725faf73ca48?upload=true" /></a>AM,
 this first came up before I installed chrome, when Microsoft Edge was the only browser on the computer. I am just concerned that it is an external program that are showing these messages</p>

<br />Do you know how much RAM you have in your PC?
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager again
<br />
<br />Click on the Memory column Header, so that arrow faces down
<br />
<br />Then when Memory is at a high percentage (80%+) please take another screenshot and we will work out what is causing this<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1776410d-4053-4d25-8f4b-7fcd89ed3b70?upload=true" />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand your concern and will certainly assist you to solve it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For better understanding, please answer the below question(s):</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What exactly happens when you try to remove the device from your trusted device?</div>
<div>2. What do you mean by “just asks me a code”?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We do understand that despite processing the Device Removal from your Microsoft Account, the Windows devices in question remain associated with your Microsoft Account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In that situation,&nbsp;we would advise to process the Device Removal using a different web browser than before.</div>
<div>Preference in that situation would be to utilize Internet Explorer and as a way of eliminating any Add-On conflict try to use the InPrivate browsing mode for the purpose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can start the InPrivate Browsing mode session, by opening Internet Explorer and using the Keyboard shortcut : Ctrl + Shift+ P.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please let us know if the issue persists or you need any further assistance.</div>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>

<h2>            Brand NEW Windows 10 Pro is closing programs automatically</h2>
                    <p>I purchased 3 brand new Windows 10 Pro machines and the first workstation install that I did is now closing programs automatically.&nbsp; I can't have that happening during a tax season.&nbsp; How do I fix this?&nbsp; I have read the other threads but I have not seen a
 REAL solution.&nbsp; This needs to be fixed with no problems or I will be forced to return to Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has been out for over 3 years, I am sure that a solution had to be found by now.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <strong>Lisa Ohio</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to be able to further investigate on this, kindly provide answers to these questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to the PC that may have triggered the issue?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have tried so far?</li><li>On the <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; About</strong>, what's the current <strong>
edition</strong>, <strong>version</strong> and <strong>OS build</strong> of your Windows 10 Pro?</li><li>What are all the apps that are affected to this issue?</li><li>Does the apps close immediately after launching? Or while doing certain tasks?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I would suggest performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong>. This will help us isolate the issue and tell

 is causing the problem after doing a Clean Boot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it out and let us know the outcome by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I am not the computer user and she could not duplicate the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a clean boot.&nbsp; Nothing seemed to happen for a couple of days.</p>
<p>A few days later (surprise surprise) the hard drive did a complete fail.&nbsp; I couldn't even get past the Bios screen.&nbsp; So I returned the computer for a new one.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First you need to make sure that iTunes is not set to run in compatibility mode. To check this, please follow the steps listed below:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Exit out of iTunes.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>On the Windows
<strong>Start</strong> Menu select <strong>Computer</strong>.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Browse to the following location:
<strong>C:\Program Files\iTunes</strong>. (<span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you have Windows 7 (64 bit) browse to
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\iTunes</strong>.)</span></span></span></span> </li><li><span><span>Right click on the iTunes application (iTunes or iTunes.exe) and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Next select the
<strong>Compatibility tab</strong>.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Ensure that the options
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode</strong> and <strong>Run this program as an administrator</strong> are not checked. If they are checked please deselect these options, then select
<strong>Apply</strong>, and <strong>OK</strong>. You&nbsp;should now be able to open iTunes without receiving the error message about iTunes running in compatibility mode</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If these options are already not checked or you are still receiving the error message about iTunes running in compatibility mode&nbsp;then
 you may try modifying the registry and check:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Open the Registry Editor by selecting the Windows
<strong>Start</strong> button, typing <strong>regedit</strong> into the search box, and then pressing
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Browse to the following location in the registry editor,
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers</strong>, and highlight the
<strong>Layers</strong> folder.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Delete the entry for the iTunes application (iTunes or iTunes.exe).</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Exit out of the registry editor. You should now be able to open iTunes without&nbsp;receiving the error message about iTunes running in
 compatibility mode.</span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains
 steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then,
 you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following link.

<p>Renato é hiper confiável sim, sou cliente a muitos anos, já comprei livros, jogos, eletrodomésticos e atualmente uma câmera semi-profissional, o problema que mais vejo é sobre a entrega, pois normalmente entregam muito antes do prazo, coisa de 2 á 3 dias,
 mas há locais aonde já demoraram mais, dezembro comprei um microondas no domingo e na segunda já estava recebendo. Abraço</p>

<p>Ah, mais um detalhe, as vezes tem umas promoções muito boas, mas outras horas tem de ficar esperto porque é só papo, um exemplo o iphone 4 de 8 gb que 1 ano atrás estava 1300, vi um anuncio recente por 1700 e ainda dizendo que tava com 300 de desconto, isso
 que é facada, rs... São do mesmo grupo da Americanas.com... Abraço</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!<br />
</p>
<p>I understand you are getting the “AsusSetup in local\temp folder are missing”.</p>
<p>I believe that the error is from ASUS program. It may be caused by software confliction. Also I suspect that the application has issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Quick questions:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the complete error message?<br />
3. Do face the issue if you boot in safe mode?<br />
4. Which operating system is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>I believe that the error is from ASUS program. It may be caused by software confliction. Also I suspect that the application has issues.</p>
<p><br />
You may also perform a clean boot to see the functionality of the mouse and keyboard.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<h2>            Virtual memory is &#64; 100&#37; if i run a game at a different resolution than the desktop resolution&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey ho,<br />
Two weeks ago i'v re installed my computer. Before one week i re-installed Battlefield 4 and i startet playing. I noticed a error message that told me that there is not enough memory is available. I'v never had this error before. After 2 weeks of testing and
 finding the problem i noticed that everytime i run a game at another resolution than my desktop resolution my virtual memory is linea filling up to 100%. After it reaches the 100% mark, the Windows Error message shows up and it wants me to close the game that
 i'm playing. If i run the game at the same resolution than the desktop resolution or in windowed mod this doesnt happen. If i switch back to the desktop, the virtuel memory is will be cleared again.</p>

    What you can do is delete the email. These bogus award scams have
    been going on for almost three decades in one form or another. All
    they want to do is get as much personal info from you as possible.<br />

<p>Voila ! C'est peu ( mais vue les contenue des jeux .. y'a vraiment de quoi faire pour qui s'adonne sérieusement au genre ! ) mais faut bien se dire qu'il y a même pas un an et demi on avait rien en boite !!!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuite tu cite Strania dans la liste des jeux boites mais c'est un jeu XBLA ! Tout les jeux XBLA sont bien jouable sur nos consoles.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Raiden Fighters Aces</strong></span> aurait du sortir mais a été mis en stand by par

<p>Pour <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Raiden Fighters Aces</strong></span> oui certaines
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Tradewest</span></strong> à été clair :
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Le jeu est mis en Stand By</span></strong> ...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ça a été annoncé sur leur <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Facebook</strong></span>,
 et donc éditer le jeu pour l'<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Europe</strong></span> ne les a
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">JAMAIS</span></strong> intéressé et j'en suis presque sure ... tout les jeux qu'ils éditent
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">France</span></strong> au final ...
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RFA</span></strong> devait être une
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">co édition</span></strong> avec <strong>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Jowood</span></strong> qui eux devait le sortir pour l'<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Europe</strong></span> d'ailleurs ...
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Tradewest</span></strong> nous a dit qu'ils leur avaient été très difficile de bosser avec
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">rien !</span></strong> Bref mieux vaut ne plus y compter ... et crois moi,
<strong>compilation</strong></span> dans leur version <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Arcade</strong></span>, je peux te dire que ce sont des tueries et que le portage sur
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Rageant !</span></strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mais comme je le disais dans le topic dédié, en <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PAL</span></strong> maintenant on a déjà de quoi vraiment se faire plaisir avec déjà
 te faudra une <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">console Jap</span> ou <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Coréenne</span> ... mais bon finalement moi je trouve qu'a part les <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Raiden</span></strong> et les
<strong>Pal</strong></span> dispo sur <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">360</span></strong> !
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eclate toi bien avec ces jeux et hésite surtout pas a venir discuter sur le topic dédié à l'avenir ! ça sera avec plaisir que d'échanger avec toi.</p>

<p>J'ai effectivement acheté Bullet Soul dernièrement, déjà qu'il est region-free, ce que Microsoft devrait TOUT LE TEMPS FAIRE...pourquoi les region-lock existe encore?</p>
<p>Message pour Microsoft: pas de region-lock = plus de ventes! Vous voulez faire encore plus de profits? laissez tomber le region-lock s'il-vous-plaît!
</p>
<p>Microsoft, vous allez être content car vous aller avoir beaucoup plus d'argent! et vous allez faire des heureux pour joueur à leurs jeux favoris sortis seulement au Japon!</p>

<p>Purchased Halo CE Anniversary from Amazon. Redeemed the code for the Master Chief avatar armor (correctly) but I'll be darned if I can find it! It's not in Customize Avatar&gt;Awards and it's not in Avatar Marketplace&gt;Halo Anniversary. If someone could point
 me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

 if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li>
<span>Do you get any error message when it is not detected? If YES, what is the complete and exact error message that you receive?</span></li><li>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If it is correct then it means USB device is not getting detected by your computer. The issue may arise if the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt or if your PC requires an
 update&nbsp;for issues that may conflict with a USB device and Windows. This may also occur if your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt. So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>

            Hi, <br />
I see the picture, but that doesn't help unless I can click on it and it tells me what the problem is.<br />
Please keep in mind we can't see your computer, we need you to be our eyes and hands while troubleshooting.
<br />
If you click on the icon, what is the message it shows?<br />
How long has this been on?<br />
Have you ever had the connection?<br />
Eddie b<br />
