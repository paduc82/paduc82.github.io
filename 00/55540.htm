<h2>            Refund - Forza Horizon 3</h2>
                    <p>When I bought Forza Horizon 3, It took a long time to download, because of my internet speeds. But, when I finally got to play it. It would load through, but then 30 seconds to 1 minute later. It automatically closes on me and I have to go through the process
 of opening it again. It does the same thing for about over 5 times now and I am getting very frustrated, because I paid $50.00 for Forza Horizon 3 for my Windows 10 computer. If no one can help me with my game, then I would like a refund or something equal
 to the amount I paid for, plus the tax too. So, can one of you help me or not? I would not like to see my game go to waste. Nor, do I want to waste some employee's time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Dash.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can reset the game in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features, click on the game, then Advanced Options, then Reset.
<br />
<br />I'd also Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 slows down tremendously&#47;freezes&#47;hangs after being left idle</h2>
                    Ever since a recent update, my laptop would slow down tremendously after being left idle for 10-20 minutes. The screen would go black (just like how it would if you were to set the display to be turned off after a while), and when I move my mouse to let
 me use my laptop again, my laptop would just lock up at whatever I was doing before leaving it idle. I cannot click anything else, because in doing so, my cursor would just become the loading icon, and nothing would happen, so clicking Chrome to open it would
 not open it, but I would instead get the loading cursor. If I were using a browser, clicking something would give me the loading icon, etc. I tried opening a new tab and going to Youtube on that tab, but it would be stuck at loading the page. This would go
 on for a full 20 minutes until everything goes back to normal suddenly. I've tried setting it so that the laptop would never be put to sleep or never be turned off after a while, but the screen would still go black after 10-20 min

            Sorry it took me a while to reply. My apologizes, but I do not know what update I installed which caused this issue. The most latest update did not solve this issue, unfortunately. I did the Automatic Repair, but if I recall correctly, my laptop said there
 was an issue that couldn't be fixed. I also booted the computer into Safe Mode, but surprisingly, the error did not reappear. What does this mean?

<p>Oddly enough, it seems to fix this problem you need to delete the misbehaving library first.&nbsp; Deleting a library does not delete the content of the folder.&nbsp; To fix this problem, open Windows Explorer, right-click on the corresponding library and choose
<strong>Delete</strong>. Click <strong>Yes</strong> when asked for confirmation.</p>
<p>Then, in the navigation pane of Windows Explorer, right-click on <strong>Libraries</strong> and click
<strong>Restore default libraries</strong>.&nbsp; This recreates the library that you just deleted. This option will only restore the default libraries that came with Windows 7.</p>

            That could be the red laser from the disc reading laser. There's not really much else it can be unless you see it on the front of the console instead of green.

<p>Is it an original xbox game that you're playing on the 360? Crash Bandicoot 4 &amp; Crash Bandicoot 5: Wrath of Cortex, are the only two Bandicoot games that are backwards compatible from the xbox to the 360. If it is one of these two games, then you also need
 to download the compatibility program for it to work. That should happen automatically when you start the game if you're connected to the internet. If it's not one of those two games, then it is not compatible to play on the 360.</p>

<p>You need an official Microsoft 360 hard drive,not a original one,too play xbox games on the 360.</p>
<p>Remember a lot of the games from then were made in 4:3 aspect ratio so it wont fill up a 16:9 widescreen tv.</p>
<p>A lot of backwards compatible xbox games ran poorly on the 360 which is why they stopped adding to the list years ago.</p>

<p>Did you purchase your hard drive brand new or from a third party like ebay? Before the 500gb hard drives were made official, there were a ton of knock-offs floating around. So if it was not purchased new, it could most likely be a knock-off and will not
 work with backwards compatible games. </p>

            Open Settings, Personalization, Start and uncheck Show Suggestions in Start. Then go to Accounts and Sign in Options and uncheck what you want there especially on the Lock Screen page. There might be more that needs adjusting like picture passwords. There
 are lots of annoying defaults in Windows 10 that you can change if you hunt for them.&nbsp;

                    <p>A Skype screen telling me I am using an outdated version has taken over my screen and will not let me close it. I have tried to "download the latest version" but that hasn't worked either. I am effectively locked out. What shows up as the "new version" has
 lost all my previous conversations. Help please.</p>

The error message is "Can't find specific file" &nbsp;followed by " The folder does not exist" &nbsp;There have been several threads regarding this issue as you know.

<div>I upgraded to Windows 10 a few weeks ago and this problem began to occur I &nbsp;think after one of the automatic updates. &nbsp;I did undo the first update that it would give me access to but that did not resolve the issue because it
 was too recent. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I didn't do an early restore point so I had nothing to go back to there. &nbsp;I did create another user with Admin and that didn't seem to do any good but it did bring back the Solitaire games which had mysteriously disappeared
 from the Quick Access.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did not take the step of hiding the desktop Libraries icon by adding 4 suggested registry keys.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i think I like Windows 10 but I do a lot of sound editing and i use lots of folders and this is a major problem. &nbsp;I migrated from windows 8.1 which was already on the machine when I got it.<br />

</p><p>Hope I'm in the right Topic/Sub Topic as offered by Windows menu.</p>
<p>I am currently running a genuine Windows 7 Home Premium SP1.</p>
<p>This morning it started with the news that my Windows was not genuine!</p>
<p>Nothing new there for me or for some of you either I believe.</p>
<p>However, on trying to put my product key in to verify my copy, I get a message that 'slui.exe is not found'! So I search for 'slui.exe' and it is not there on my drive??? How do I get this file back please? Damien</p>

<p>merging two Microsoft accounts is not possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest thing to achieve what you want is to link another account. Which will give you option to access email of added account through main account. As far as data migration is concerned&nbsp; I believe you would need to do it manually.
</p>
<ol>
<li>transfer, download,&nbsp;from one account,</li><li>upload to another,</li><li>use one account as primary,</li><li>add another one as linked for the purpose of email,</li></ol>
<p>Hope Microsoft will consider offering functionality for this.</p>

<h3> chocotaku  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer shops and OEM software</h2>
                    
<p>I have questions about the practice of installing OEM software for customers in a PC repair shop setting.</p>
<p>Q. A customer has lost their install media for an OEM version of Windows. They have a valid case badge. Is it legal for a shop to use their own media to install the software, but input the customers' valid Genuine key and activate it for them?</p>
<p>Q. If yes above, how does a PC repair shop legally obtain copies of the OEM software? Is it possible to obtain only a copy of the software without an accompanying key? (The "key" is supplied by the customers' case badge) Many repair shops are forced to download
 pirated and possibly corrupt/infected versions of these softwares for lack of a valid, legal and easily accessible method to obtain JUST the software. If there exists a way for system builders to legally download Genuine Windows without keys I am not aware
 of it, but in the long run this option is a safer solution for end users taking their PCs in for repair.</p>
<p>Q. The purchase of any installation disc is actually for the "key" itself, and not for the software?</p>
<p>I have asked a few sources and they seem to want to dance around these "grey area" questions. I look forward to an official response.</p>

            No legitimate tech would download pirated copies of Windows. I can't give you an "official" response because I don't work for Microsoft but I *am* a professional tech and I can tell you that yes, it is legal to use one's own installation media with the
 customer's Product Key. The license to use Windows is the Product Key, not the physical installation disc. This is done all the time because users frequently lose their own installation discs. One *purchases* the necessary generic OEM and retail installation
 discs to have on-hand for this purpose. As for branded OEM discs, one *copies* them when available or *purchases* them from the OEM (Dell, HP recovery discs, etc.).&nbsp; In that way, one has a library of installation discs for various Windows operating systems
 and different versions of those operating systems. Buying the discs is a cost of doing business.

<p>They are too cheap to offer something that would take away from sales on the new system..if they allowed old games to be played on xbox one then people would just play those games alot and buy some new ones...its a marketing ploy..im sure they could easily
 with their 300,000 servers setup some type of cloud based emulator, but they wont because that will cost them money and not make them money...remember...corporations want the most amount of money for the least amount of work...welcome to corporate america.

            It would not be "without a hitch."<br />
<br />
There's plenty of problems with just "running" a game on the new hardware. While it is possible, keep in mind that the game would not look much better. AA and AF can only do so much.<br />
<br />
It took Sony five years to put a PS2 emulator on the PS3. The high def remakes preceded the emulator for years. Given a choice of paying $10-$20 for a high def remake or just playing the same game with AA/AF, I would rather pay a bit for a remake.

<h2>            Microphone on Skype not working sometimes</h2>
                    <p>I have a Plantronics P620S microphone/speaker.&nbsp; Windows 7 or 10 both recognize it, but won't work with say voice recorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Skype, and have my speaker and microphone set as the P620S, everything works fine.&nbsp; If I have Skype setup to use my speakers as output and the P620S as the microphone, the microphone does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an older model of the P620S and it works fine with Skype on a Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; So I bought 5 new ones, and none of them work as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it's a Plantronics thing, but why does it work one way and no other way?</p>

            It's toggled on (I assume you meant microphone, but both on toggled on)
