<h2>            WIndows Installer folder size is too huge &#40;32 GB&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>My laptop has been quite slow off late. So, I used all clean up tools, optimizing disks, deleting all temp files (system files too) but all was in vane. Then I got to know about "Treesize", I downloaded it and ran it. It is showing windows Installer folder
 is having some 565 files (msi / msp) of total size of more than 32GB. Is there any way to reduce the size by deleting some of the unused (I guess there should be some) files?</p>

<p>I always seem to have between 6 and 8 instances of Edge running on my system. If I try and close down any of them, they start back up again. But as soon as I close the, they don't seem to affect Edge at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Some instances of it are using around 300meg of ram, while several show zero. I have seen it mentioned that extensions can cause this. But this is vanilla Edge with nothing added at all. I started using Edge as it really did improve battery life
 on my Surface Pro 4. But with this issue it doesn't help, and browsers like Firefox or Chrome are using less resources. Thanks.</p>

            Hi Rolando.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will walk you through the fixes for Edge to try progressively until it's fixed: 
<br />
<br />Back up your Favorites first in Edge Settings &gt; Import from another Browser &gt; Export to a File.  If it won't open you can reach Favorites to back them up to an HTML file using the tiny app Manage Edge Favorites here:  <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset Edge in Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Feature, scroll down to Microsoft Edge, highlight it, choose Advanced Options, then Repair, or if that fails, Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try re-registering the app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can reinstall it from this link:  <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mic...</a>
<br />
<br />I would have several other browsers available to choose from on the Task Bar since Edge is a work in progress and unreliable.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  You can import Favorites from each other easily in Settings.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            family safety will not unlock my daughter&#39;s profile</h2>
                    <p>We have been using family safety for over a year. I use the "screen time" section to manage when and how long she is on the computer. Yesterday her computer would not unlock when I turned off the limits. When she clicked on "Request more time" we get a message
 that says her request failed. When we click on "My parent is here" it will not allow me to give her access. Yesterday&nbsp;the message said the computer was locked until 9:00 am today. Today it says it is locked until 1:00 next Sunday. When we restart the computer
 it unlocks for a few seconds, then locks back up.&nbsp; I also removed her from our family profile, but that did not work either. A similar situation is described in the FAQ section, but the answer was to go into her settings and verify her account. I can't get
 into the settings to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my daughter's email password from another computer the day before yesterday, so I'm wondering if it has something to do with that. &nbsp;She has school work locked up in her profile that we cannot access.</p>

                    Hello, i was playing game and suddenly started crashing (GTAV).When i went to windows log it says this:<br />
<br />
Faulting application name: GTA5.exe, version: 1.0.350.1, time stamp: 0x5540cf19<br />

Faulting package full name:&nbsp;<br />
Faulting package-relative application ID:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As i see, clr.dll is from .net framework, so i decided to update it to 4.7.2 (download - install, not from windows update).And when i restarted my pc i got bsod with stop code 0xc0000135, tried automatic repair, system restore, but nothing seems to work (even
 the tools in my cd).So i formatted my pc and having the same error on the game.Can you tell me what to do, before i broke my windows again :))<br />
<br />
Thanks. :)

            Hey there MatejGosev, this wouldnt happen to be the pirated version, would it? Pirated copies of GTAV are very unstable thanks to the Rockstar social club integration, and thats what could be causing your issues.

<p>Because they are two different machines, you might end up having to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if they are not running the editions, it might not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has excellent hardware detection, so, it is likely to reconfigure itself, but you might experience some glitches.<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>For that price, yes it is a good deal.</p>
<p>A couple of items if you have the options.</p>
<p>I would go for the 64bit version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>The RAM should also be upgraded to at least 6GB.</p>
<p>The CPU should be a bit faster and be Quad Core, if available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know you're tired of being of the phone; when you called though, did you go 'up the food chain'? Feel free to ask to speak to the cs' supervisor. Then the next one up if necessary. I do it, and get better service.&nbsp; Just a thought, Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 does not recognise external drive</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using my 1Tb 3.5 drive as an external drive for my laptop by placing it in a casing and connecting using USB3.</div>
<div>Both the laptop and case are USB3 enabled. My laptop is running Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The HDD appears in the device manager but not on my explorer. Hence I cannot access any of my files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas how to resolve this please. According to the device manager the drive is working properly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Dimitris</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It might just need a drive letter assigned... This is usually automatic but sometimes it's not...</p>
<p>Go to Disk Management and check it out... You can assign a drive letter there if needed...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DO NOT do any type of formatting, or any other type of action, if prompted when opening Disk Management...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Disk management can be found&nbsp;in Control Panel... Administrative Tools... Computer Management</p>

            Thanks. In computer management the drive shows as a "dynamic" drive. It's described as "invalid". The only options when I right click on it are: Convert to basic disc, reactivate disc, offline and help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not real sure what that issue is... </p>
<p>Could it have been encrypted from it's previous location, or some how locked?</p>
<p>Does it have a operating system installed on it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is a possibility that there is a compatibility issue with the enclosure and the laptop...</p>
<p>My desktop has two USB 3.0 controllers... One of my external HDDs would work on one of the controllers (ASMedia), but not the other (Intel).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I received a specific error when I tried to connect it though which you don't seem to be getting...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have USB 2.0 ports, try one of them... but if it is showing that it working in Device Manager, it's probably not the USB Ports that are the problem</p>

Hi, i know it's a real mystery. I tried on a USB 2.0 without success. and as you said I don't get any errors popping up when I connect it.
<div>It had no OS installed on it. Only used it for storing files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Only option for now is to downgrade to Windows 7 though I sort of like the look of 8.1.</div>

</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is that it was some how protected in the Win 7 machine... BitLocker or something....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another possibility may be an issue with the enclosure... Do you still have another machine you can hook it to for testing ?</p>

            <p>My problem was slightly different but the solution might help.</p>
<p>My windows 8.1 would not recognize my external drive until I clicked on the start menu, typed in Disk Management, and on the next screen set the Disk 1: to Online instead of Offline (Right click onOffline).</p>

            Thanks for the advice. Instead of "offline or online" mine says "invalid". There's only option to change it to "offline" or "reactivate".
<div>I tried on another Win 8.1 laptop which still failed to identify the drive.</div>

<div>I don't think it's the enclosure as the device appears in the device manager as functional.</div>

            The only way to see more RAM is to install a graphics card and disable your motherboard's onboard graphics. If you do this, you should be able to see all 512 MB of it.
<div><br />
<div>That being said, I will reiterate what I said before...</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>
<div>
You can always purchase more RAM and install it onto your motherboard. Go to crucial.com for more information.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Also, you should reconsider installing ANY "Internet Security" application or suite. They are not necessary (you can easily configure Windows to make it very secure) and they often ruin a PC's performance.</div>

<h2>            LAN keeps on Disconnecting.</h2>
                    Hello, i recently have this problem, my LAN keeps on disconnecting. and when i click troubleshoot, it will be temporarily fixed (Default gateway is not available - Fixed) and for a couple of minutes it will disconnect again. i already tried updating the
 drivers and still, it will disconnect again. tried rolling-back the drivers and still, the same issue. i already did system restore but the problem is still there. cable is fine, as it is still new. i have no choice but to connect thru wifi. Hope someone can
 help me solve this issue. i search thru net and some are suggesting to disable the (power effeciency) on properties of the driver, already did that. but still, the same problem.

            <span>Hi warchiefwyne,</span><br />
<span>if you use third-party firewall / antivirus, try to uninstall it temporarily and try to enable Windows Defender Firewall.</span><br />
<span>Is the PC connected directly to the router or via a hub / switch?</span><span>
</span><span>If possible, connect a different PC via LAN and check if it works.</span><br />
<span>Specify if it is a desktop or laptop PC.</span>

            Hi WFW.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br /> 
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br /> 
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011T5IF06/ref=psdc_13983791_t2_B06XSFPDFX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011T5IF06/ref=psdc_1...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If you presently have less than Version 1903 in Settings &gt; System &gt; About, I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, i already uninstalled malwarebytes. The only av left is windef. Laptop is directly connected to the modem/router via LAN cable which is causing the problem. Ill try tomorrow to bring thie cable to a shop and have it tested if its broken. Though
 i doubt it coz cable is still new. Will update tomorrow. Thanks for the reply. And if its the cable, will definitly delete this post. Thanks.

            <span>Hi warchiefwyne,</span><br />
<span>no, I don't think the problem is the network cable, however it is good to check it.</span><span>
</span><span>You can perform other tests if you want to: 1-Ping the router gateway.</span><span>
</span><span>If the ping is successful, the network cable is ok.</span><span>
</span><span>2-turn off the modem / router by disconnecting the power cord directly from the power source.</span><span>
</span><span>Turn it back on after a few minutes.</span><span>
</span><span>3-move the network cable to another LAN port on the router.</span><span>
</span><span>If the modem is separate from the router, try connecting the PC directly to the modem bypassing the router.</span><br />
<span>4-Take note of the driver version currently in use on the Ethernet network card, visit the PC manufacturer's website and check if a more updated driver is available and eventually download it and then
 install it after uninstalling the previous one.</span>

<span>the ping on the gateway is not successful.</span><span>
</span><span>Try rebooting the router first and try again, if necessary try replacing the network cable.</span><br />
<span>Do you have a modem / router all in one or are they separated?</span><span>
</span><span>Go to Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, select your Ethernet adapter, choose
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart the PC. Windows should automatically reinstall the network card with its appropriate driver. Otherwise, download and install the latest driver version available on the site</span><span>

<p>Hi, it looks like your problem is intermittent, as from my data request you do have a default gateway and all shows as well. Restarting the router should be done properly, it is called power cycling, you turn off your computer, and remove it from the mains
 (if a laptop take out the battery), then press and hold the start button for a few sec's, this drains all residual power. Next turn off the router, and remove from mains, press and hold the start button to drain residual power. Restart the router and wait
 until it shows all led lights, then restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to check the realtek site for an updated driver for your Nic. Disable windows driver updates as they often cause problems:-</p>

<h2>            X Box One parental controls</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to setup some parental controls and time limits on my kids X box One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use it at all, so am having a real hard time figuring out how to set it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My kids have already got profiles on the console. I added my account and a profile onto the console, and added them as family members, but I can't make any changes in their settings to edit exactly what they're looking at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I setup time limits online right? Through the Microsoft web page and accounts/family?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you have set up the family settings like screen time via the family web page, then it should take affect for the profiles you set it up for.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it sometimes is required for the accounts to sign out and sign in again on the console before it takes affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also want to go to the following link to adjust other settings like privacy and online safety settings:
<a href="http://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.xbox.com/settings</a> via the parental account, if all is set up correctly you should be able to adjust settings for the child accounts too.</p>
<p>These settings can only be changed for accounts that are considered Child accounts, if the Date of Birth on the account makes the account an Adult account things might not be editable for the parental account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another source for information can be found here: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/browse/xbox-one/security/Family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/browse/xbox-one/security/Family account</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further questions feel free to ask</p>

<p>Thanks both of you. I'll have a play around with this in the morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they're both in the family account though, do I have to sign in on my account each time they want to use the console, or can they do that independently by signing in on their own accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I've noticed now, and I won't do anything else tonight..</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) They're both registered on the family account as adult, despite my changing them to kids on the Xbox live part in Privacy. Do I need to change this anywhere else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) How can I lock their account settings down so they are unable to change what I've amended?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you change your children's profile, they will not be able to change again because only the adult can make those changes. These changes can only be made on the console.</p>

                    System:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Professional<br />
AMD Phenom II X4 955<br />
4GB RAM<br />
ATI Radeon HD 4770 512MB Video<br />
Samsung SyncMaster 940BW LCD Monitor<br />
<br />
I recently installed Windows 7 on my new system and I notice that there appears to be somewhat of a double image of everything, like a shadow, that appears just to the right of every piece of text, every window, etc.&nbsp; Dark text and lines create the most noticeable
 shadow (i.e. in Microsoft Word, a blinking black cursor will have a gray/white cursor shadow that appears about 2-3 pixels to the right of it,&nbsp; All program windows will have a transparent line just outside the window on the right.)<br />
<br />
I haven't ruled out the possibility that it's my monitor, but as it never has had any issues before and was working fine with my XP machine, I doubt it.&nbsp; I've already tried adjusting just about every display, resolution, and contrast/sharpness setting there
 is, both on the monitor itself and in Windows, with no luck.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any advice anyone can offer.&nbsp; Thanks!

            Have you installed drivers for that monitor? Or maybe you let Windows to choose drivers? The same question about Graphic Card.<br />
<br />
You should try to install drivers from the manufacturer sites:<br />

<h2>            &#39;Allow to connect&#39; missing from Bluetooth settings. Device doesn&#39;t connect1</h2>
                    Device is recognised by the PC but immediately disconnects. The 'Allow device to connect' is missing from the Bluetooth settings menu and the 'allow to connect' is dimmed when the Bluetooth&nbsp; icon is clicked. What is happening??&nbsp; (Most of the suggested
 links to Windows 8 on the Support web pages link to W XP, W Vista, W7 but NOT W8!!) This is a new PC with a new upgrade to W8.1 from W8.<br />

            <p>Hi Jampit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue because of not having updated drivers for Bluetooth or because of driver compatibility issues. Before we start with the troubleshooting steps, I would like to know some information about this issue.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error code or error message, when you turn on Bluetooth?</p>
<p>3. what are you referring by "Most of the suggested links to Windows 8 on the Support web pages link to W XP, W Vista, W7 but NOT W8!!"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try updating the Bluetooth drivers from the computer manufacturer's website or from Windows Update and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Download the Bluetooth driver from the computer manufacturer's website and then try installing it in Compatibility mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the Bluetooth driver from the computer manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install the driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows:</strong></p>

            I recommend you check these methods to repair any Windows problem.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow
