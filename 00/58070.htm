 </blockquote> <p>I figured out what happened. After I noticed the problem and reported it here I joined the Xbox Insider program. While I was away last few days it DL'd and installed a pre-release OS (#1805). So it seems this pre-release has fixed the issue I noticed with the deployed release.</p>

    <title>Permissions to users&#39; folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> readyornot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permissions to users&#39; folders</h2>
                    I got a new computer (Windows 8 Pro) and promptly moved the users' document folders (i.e. My Pictures, My Documents, My Music, etc.) from the small C: drive (SSD) to the large D: drive. I followed the normal process...right clicked the folder, went to
 the Locations tab, and clicked the Move button. Everything seemed to go fine and I didn't receive any error messages. However, the permissions on the new folders on the D: aren't correct because now
<i>any</i>&nbsp;user can access <i>any other users'</i>&nbsp;document folders and files. I figured I'd just go into the folders Security settings to make changes but I have some questions and issues to deal with first.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First, when I try to change a folder's permissions, Windows displays a message that I can't make the changes because the folder's permissions are being inherited and recommends that I disable inheritance to make the change. I'm not versed in how this stuff
 works so I wanted to check with the Community before I start playing with those settings. FYI, it appears that all the folders which go a few levels deep, e.g. D:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\Documents), are inheriting ultimately from the root level folder, which is
 owned by SYSTEM.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second, after I disable inheritance I'm not entirely sure what to set the permissions to so that only the user account associated with the folder has rights to access the content. Here's what's
<i>currently</i>&nbsp;showing for permissions to the folder (FYI it shows virtually the same thing for every users' folders):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Authenticated Users:&nbsp;</b>all rights except Full control</div>
<div><b>SYSTEM:&nbsp;</b>all rights</div>
<div><b>Administrators (&lt;computer_name&gt;\Administrators):&nbsp;</b>all rights</div>
<div><b>Users (&lt;computer_name\Users):</b>&nbsp;Read &amp; Execute, List folder contents, and Read</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I'm not sure which rights I should remove (<b>Authenticated Users</b> and
<b>Users</b>??) and which I should add (probably in the individual user's account??). FYI, the folders are owned<i>
</i>by the individual users' accounts, presumably because I was logged in as each user when I created the folders.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Third, should I do anything to change the ownership of the folders, and would that have any impact on the security and access privileges? I suspect I should leave that alone and just change the access permissions but I thought I'd ask to be sure.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know this is a long message with several questions, and I thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.</div>

            <p>No, that article isn't applicable at all. In fact, it address the exact opposite of my problem...<em>everyone
</em>can access the folders, not that <em>I can't</em> access them. I provided quite a lot of detail in my original post. It would be helpful if you read through that information and responded to those issues and questions specifically.</p>

            SOLUTION ...<br />
1. Download the file: "mod.dll" in http://www.dlldll.com/mod.dll_download.html site.<br />
2. If you do not have the folder tree from "Style Pool" to "Bin", create within the directory "local" folders with the same names EX: "Style Pool \ Bin".<br />
3. Paste the module file "mod.dll" that you downloaded from the website mentioned in the "Bin" folder and rename it with the name "StylePool.dll".<br />
4. Restart your PC.

            Hi Kandy, this does seem to be a bug in the latest version of Skype . . .
<br />
<br />Uninstall your current version and install the Classic version of Skype to see if that resolves this issue . . .
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

            Here is a direct download to classic Skype. It should fix that problem for you, however Microsoft is going to shut classic Skype down Sep 1, 2018. Hopefully by then the New Skype will have the problems worked out.

<h2>            Xbox is taking a long time to start up&#63;</h2>
                    My boyfriend's xbox 360 has been taking a long time to start up lately. I've timed it and it's taking up to ten minutes just for it to get me to the dashboard after signing in. It will turn on and show the xbox logo, but then after that it takes about
 five minutes to bring up our profiles and then another five minutes just to get to the dashboard. It's also been having problems connecting to xbox live from time to time. Any ideas what may be causing this?

<p>Theres possible corruption on your memory device. Go to settings, storage and highlight your device and press "Y". This will clear your cache. If problem persists, go back to settings, memory device and go into every file to ensure there is no files with
 a yellow circle with black "!" in the middle. If there is, delete these files and redownload if needbe. This should clear up your issue.</p>

<p>Thats a long time. Have you tried clearing the system cache? That and possibly disconnecting from your network connection and reconnecting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow this link to clear the cache <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are a few things you could try, the first one I would suggest is to reset your console network settings to the defaults as described in the article below.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../978976</a></p>

<p>Something else to try is clearing the system cache.</p>

<p>Are you able to use a USB drive in lieu of the hdd? Perhaps the hard drive is just going faulty. I had one hdd do the same sluggish stuff before and everytime I could make it to storage under settings and begin deleting the corruption it would either freeze
 in mid deletion or the corruption would return the next time I would boot the console. It kept happening until the hdd caused a general hardware failure known as E68, which relates to a bad hdd. Try a different hard drive or a USB thumbdrive and recover your
 gamertag to the new device. Then boot the console into Xbox live and see if that solves the issue. This will determine if it's the console, hdd or network.</p>

<p>I've had issues like these, what I've tried doing is deleting things on my hard drive that I don't need. Eventually, it starts to take a while to start up and I know it's time to clear some hard drive stuff, although 10 minutes is a very long time. Usually
 for me it seems like my xbox takes 30+ seconds to get to the dashboard, and that's longer than usual.

<p>Hey there Sputnik! &nbsp;Honestly, it sounds like there may be something up with the Hard Drive. &nbsp;We can totally take a look at it for you, if you like. &nbsp;Please try starting up the system without the hard drive in to see if it boots up faster. &nbsp;Then post a new
 thread letting us know how that went and we'll take it from there!</p>

    <title>Win 10 disable auto rotate photos&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markmichelmrics  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 disable auto rotate photos&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 10 auto rotates photos - now when I drag and drop photos to word 10, I have no idea which way they will rotate - all portrait become landscape = as I use many tens of photos per report this is really annoying.
<br />
<br />
With win 7, I could just drag and drop straight into a word table portrait remained portrait, landscape remained landscape.<br />
<br />
can I disable auto rotate? is there another work around as I like win 10<br />

            Starting with Windows 8, the built-in photo editor started respecting the rotation tag set by the camera. So be sure to be holding the camera correctly when taking a photo.

 accidentally I couldn't sign in and also sign out my window account (to local account so that I can sign in the hotmail) as the password has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I recover my Gmail? Do I have to wait for 30 days?</p>

<br />
I have a Dell Inspiron N4110 laptop running Win7 Professional.&nbsp; The laptop uses an Intel Pentium B940 dual core / dual thread processor running at 2 GHz with 4 GB of RAM and 200 GB of free hard drive space.&nbsp; I am recording analog video (NTSC) and stereo audio
 using Roxio's Easy VHS to DVD hardware / software package.&nbsp; Video is digitized in real time by the A/D converter.&nbsp; A 100 minute VHS video produces a 6.13 GB mpg file on hard disk.&nbsp; The Roxio compression process to reduce the 6.13 GB mpg file to less than 4.7
 GB for recording onto a single DVD+R takes about 190 minutes.&nbsp; Is this about a normal time period for my laptop?&nbsp; Is there any other compression program that would be much faster? &nbsp;&nbsp; Would a better laptop with a Intel quad core / 8 thread i7-2860QM processor
 and 8 GB RAM reduce the compression time period significantly, e.g. less than 60 minutes? &nbsp;

            Video DVDs are encoded based on Duration more <br />
than Filesize. Compression may not be required. <br />

A 100 minute video file should fit on a 4.7GB DVD.<br />

<br />
To create a basic Video DVD that should play in most<br />
free standing DVD players...try the following...<br />
<br />
First...read the DVD Flick Guide to familiarize yourself<br />
with the program.<br />
<br />
Open DVD Flick and insert a blank DVD in your burner.<br />
<br />
If your computer's Autoplay window opens....just close it.<br />
<br />
Click the Project Settings button and go to...Video /<br />
Target format...residents of USA...choose...NTSC /<br />
Accept.<br />
<br />
Left click the Add title button and browse to your<br />
Movie Clips and select the ones you want on the DVD.<br />
<br />
You can arrange them by selecting one and then use<br />
the Move Up and Move Down buttons.<br />
<br />
To allow a longer duration on the DVD...left click the<br />
Project Settings button / select Video / open the Target<br />
Bitrate drop window. Choosing a smaller number will<br />
result in longer duration on the DVD. Press...Accept.<br />
<br />
The vertical bar on the left of the screen will indicate<br />
how much compression you need.<br />
<br />
Left click the Create DVD button / OK / Yes / Yes.<br />
<br />
Wait while the DVD is created.<br />
<br />
When the text "Finished Successfully" appears you<br />
may close DVD Flick. Now you can eject your DVD<br />
and play it in your DVD player.<br />
<br />
At some point you may wish to purchase more<br />
advanced software like Sony, Cyberlink, Nero, Roxio,<br />
Adobe, Ulead, etc...but at least this is a start.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<h2>            Error 0x8007045D while copying to NAS</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I have recently created a NAS using NAS4Free. I have formatted a hard drive and been copying over my files however, after working fine for a few days it now gives me an error (below) while trying to copy across a file. I have tried to google the problem
 to find a solution however I have had no luck. Is there anything I can do or is the (old) hard drive just dead?</div>

<div>'An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file. If you continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for help with this problem.</div>

<h2>            Burned DVDs not working&#63; fix&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I "backed up" some of my movies using ConverttoDVDX software. I tried the Avengers and Mad Max. When I play them it is choppy in the beginning and then the audio is delayed to the movie. It works fine on my DvD player, but the XBox One just doesn't want
 to do it. Anyone know why? I am using the Blueray App dpn't know if there is another App to use.</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

            Hi James, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. Please try the following. <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Make sure Outlook Express is not running. </li><li>Open the <em>Recycle Bin</em> on your Windows <em>Desktop</em> . </li><li>Locate the ".bak" files corresponding to the Outlook Express folders you want to recover.
<ul>
<li>The ".bak" file will be named like the folder in Outlook Express. </li><li>To restore a folder called "Archive", look for "Archive.bak", for example. </li></ul>
</li><li>Click on the ".bak" file with the right mouse button. </li><li>Select <em>Restore</em> from the menu. </li><li>Locate the file in Windows explorer and open the folder it's contained in. </li><li>Drag and drop the ".dbx" file corresponding to the Outlook Express folder you want to recover to your
<em>Desktop</em> . </li><li>In the Outlook Express store folder, click on the ".bak" file to be recovered with the right mouse button.
</li><li>Select <em>Rename</em> from the menu. </li><li>Change the ".bak" file extension to ".dbx".
<ul>
<li>If the file was called "Archive.bak", for example, make sure it is named "Archive.dbx" now.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Open Outlook Express. </li><li>If your emails have been recovered, delete the ".dbx" file you moved to the <em>
Desktop</em> . </li></ul>
Also if you do not find the files in the above location search your computer for *.Bak<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! <br />

<p><span>In Windows Vista, you can set Windows Update to automatically install both Important and Recommended updates. Optional updates are not downloaded or installed
 automatically. If you choose not to turn on automatic updating, please make sure that you check for updates regularly.</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Windows Not Responding on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;karen&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Windows Not Responding on Windows 10</h2>
                    I just upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro with the free upgrade about 3-4 weeks ago. I have both operations systems running at the same time, so that slows me down. I didn't have this problem 2 days ago, but now whenever I try to access
 my Windows 10, it either is stuck at a black screen, stuck at the Sign-In page, or, if I'm lucky, stuck at my desktop. The message pops up saying "Microsoft Windows is not responding. It may respond if you wait" or something on those lines. I don't know if
 I should end the Microsoft Windows process. I already tried restoring back to 3 days ago, but it didn't work. The only thing I did was disable Cortana, so I don't know if that did anything to my Windows. Please reply fast!

<p>
</p><p>Can you explain how you manage that? AFAIK it's impossible to have two different Operating Systems running at the same time, unless one is in a Virtual Machine, where you WILL get slowdown unless you have sufficient RAM to run both...</p>

            Apparently I have 7 running in the background, but I just tried to run it and my computer just restarted. But please, I need help with 10. I just get a black screen with my cursor, then I have to wait for the entire screen to load which takes about 10
 minutes, then the welcome page opens up and is looping infinitely with Welcome.

    <title>Can I charge my Surface Book through its USB port&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ross_594  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I charge my Surface Book through its USB port&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I’m overseas and don’t have an adapter to plug in the charger for my Surface Book (bought June 2016). I do have a USB charger. Can I charge the Surface Book through its USB port, or will this damage it?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ross.</p>
