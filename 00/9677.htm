<h2>            Web Feeds OPML</h2>
                    opml files can be imported in Nokia Podcasting<br />
but I would like to import Web Feeds from IE7<br />
<br />
should I read RSS news feeds in Nokia Podcasting or manually add one by one my favourite RSS feeds?<br />
<br />

<p>it has been fixed,&nbsp;thank you so much!</p>

<p>unfortunately I cannot tell in which release of&nbsp;FW the opml import for news feeds (text)&nbsp;has been improved, but for sure it works in 30.011</p>

            Nokia don't provide ISO's most device software can be downloaded from the support pages.

<br />
Because of it being an old discontinued model getting hold of a CD may be difficult. Have you tried using the "contact us" link at the top of the page to see if nokia care can help you?<br />
<br />
If not you will either have to make do with whats on the support pages or wait for someone with an old 9300 to help you.

<h2>            Fuji FinePix A610 - works in Win 8.1, not in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Fuji FinePix A610 digital camera with the latest firmware from Fuji. I DO realize that Fuji considers this an obsolete camera model, but downloading pictures from it via the USB cable has worked on every computer I own, from Windows XP, through
 several versions of Win 7, and even on my Sony Vaio Win 8.1 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a matter of just plugging in the USB cable, starting the camera, and then it shows up in File Explorer, or Photo Viewer, etc. and lets me browse, view, and move pictures at will. I usually import them via Photo Viewer, or just drag and drop them using
 explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, in Windows 10, when I connected the camera, it did the usual "setting up your device" and then the camera shows up in Explorer and Photo Viewer just like always. BUT, even though I can see the camera and the camera's card listed under the camera's heading
 in Explorer, when I click on the card's listing, "External Memory" it says, "This Folder is Empty."</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7db183f1-6128-4a82-8f58-6eb4f63a7b60" /></p>
<p>If I take the card out of the camera and put it into an external card reader it works just fine and reads the files and lets me work with them. Also, it works on any of my other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It DOES show up in "Devices and Printers," but I cannot get it to open "Properties" nor run the troubleshooter, as it gives me this;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4cd6c8b-62df-4118-9669-4e1ada810c25" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But "Properties" doesn't work for anything else in "Devices and Printers" either. So, I know the camera is good, the card, is good, it works on everything else, but just can't read the contents of the card from the camera in windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I also have a Fuji AV100 camera, and an ancient Olympus Camedia, and both of those connect and manipulate their picture files just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Insider Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;you know Windows 10 Insider preview is still in testing phase and some hardware might not work as expected due to incompatible drivers. I would recommend you to install the drivers in compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Download the&nbsp;drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b) Right-click on the driver and click on ‚Äòproperties‚Äô.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c) Click on the ‚Äòcompatibility‚Äô tab and check the box ‚ÄòRun this program in compatibility mode for‚Äô and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d) Click on ‚ÄòApply‚Äô and click ‚ÄòOK‚Äô and run the file to install it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope this helps. </span></span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions for making my Fuji FinePix A610 work with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry that I did not mention in my previous question that I had already applied the Compatibility Troubleshooter as well attempting to install the drivers specifying the compatibility settings manually in every conceivable combination I could devise.
 I also attempted to repeatedly remove and reinstall the driver using both "Run as Administrator" and not, but none of these combinations resulted in any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me carefully restate that; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A) the computer DOES recognize and properly identify the camera as a Fuji A610,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) the camera shows up on both the device manager, File Explorer, and in&nbsp;Devices and Printers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>C) the camera storage card is identified and shows up in File Manager as "External Memory" (and if I remove the card from the camera and force it to use its meager "Internal Memory" it too shows up there but that the problem is still present and identical)</p>
<p>
</p><p>D) the problem is just that when I finally click on the "External Memory" (or "Internal Memory" if I remove the card) to open it, Windows 10 reports the card or memory as "The Folder is Empty."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it IS communicating with the camera, it finds the camera's internal built in memory AND / OR the XD card in the camera, and lets me click on it in File Explorer, BUT it apparently can't read the memory's "structure" and file hierarchy and list or access
 the memory's contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I access this camera on a Windows 8 computer, clicking on "external Memory" lists the subfolders and subsequently the contents of the directories, and finally the pictures on the card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I don't really think this is a driver problem, as the driver self-installs the camera as soon as I plug it in, (and each time if plug it in after I purposely&nbsp;unload and remove the driver) and subsequently "sees" the camera each time thereafter, and it
 "sees" the card inside the camera too.&nbsp; As soon as I plug in the camera, Windows immediately recognizes it and it shows up on the place I mentioned above. &nbsp;I think it's just a glitch in File Explorer that's somehow different in Win 10 than all the previous
 versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, in File Explorer, right clicking on the External Memory and selecting "properties" even correctly identifies the capacity of the card, which is indeed 2GB!</p>

            <p>It seems as if this thread has faded, but repeated attempts to make this work with different "adjustments" have all failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a little additional information; The card also happens to fit into an external card reader that is on the USB bus on this computer. When I insert the card, it is recognized quickly, correctly, and all the stored files are accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some quick screenshots that show&nbsp;drilling down through the sub folders, and the properties of the same card that cannot be accessed and shows up as "Empty" when accessed through the USB port on the camera.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Notice that the properties when inserted into the card reader shows the formatted file system as "FAT" and in the post above, when that card is attempting to be read through the USB port on the camera, the properties shows it formatted as "DCF"&nbsp; Possibly
 this is a lead.</p>

            <p>I know that with the number of Technical Preview users out there now in the millions, they get hundreds of thousands of requests, bug reports, and feedback ideas. I would think that they are having trouble keeping up with it. It's my understanding (perhaps
 flawed) that an entirely different group of MS people read these posts vs. the Windows 10 Feedback posts. Supposedly, those are read right by Win 10 software engineers, and these by Windows general support staff. But, there are so many posts that they have
 had to write an algorithm to help sort out the ones with higher activity levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, may I suggest that you open the "Windows Feedback" app (search for "Feedback" from the start menu) and when it pops up, select "Hardware, Devices, and Drivers" from the menu on the left, then select "USB devices and connectivity" and then either scroll
 down or do a search in the Feedback App's search box for "Fuji".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see this problem detailed there for numerous Fuji camera models. I'd suggest that you "upvote" each of those feedback topics, and and consider sending a new feedback topic specific to your model of Fuji camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The algorithm will flag the increased activity in the topic and hopefully draw some attention from the engineers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for this forum, just our conversation here raises the likelihood that a MS support person might see this post. I am given to understand that it's all about "activity."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for adding your voice to this issue.</p>

            <p>I have Win 10 build 10159, and could not find the feedback app at first. I had to Google it, then using their advice, search for the app from the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I found it, it worked just like it always has. I am not trying to insult you with these "basic" instructions, I'm just not sure if maybe you are having the same trouble getting to the feedback app that I have had, or is your feedback app actually no

            <p>I am hoping that we can get back to the original topic of this discussion, that of the fact that numerous Fuji FinePix cameras seemingly have a problem with the way that Windows 10 recognizes their file system when accessing the memory card through the camera's
 USB data port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously stated, the camera is both recognized and properly identified by model, and shows up in File Explorer, Devices and Printers, and even in the App I prefer to use to download and organize pictures, Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that once you drill down into the the card's file structure, Windows 10 shows it as "Empty" and says it contains no files. Reality is that taking the card out and popping it into a generic card reader shows it with many pictures on it. All
 previous versions of windows all the way back to XP show the files and allow you to download and otherwise manipulate the picture files through the camera's USB interface, so something about the way Windows 10 accesses the USB function of certain numerous
 Fuji cameras has obviously changed. All I'm asking is that someone look into it and put it back the way it worked in all previous versions of Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the newest download of Windows as of yesterday (Version Build 10240), and it still behaves exactly the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help anyone can provide!</p>

            Thank you for posting this. Authentication is a complete mess in O365&nbsp; - conversely in my case the only program that
<em>doesn't</em> require verification via a texted code when I'm outside my co network, is SPD. Apparently Msft is not testing any of this the way they should.&nbsp;

    <title>Access Medium Time - selecting data from table field to form field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lrvs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Medium Time - selecting data from table field to form field</h2>
                    <p>I have started working on an existing ACCESS db that I did not create</p>
<p>There is a table with a field entitled "SHIFT"&nbsp; with a format of medium time and input mask of 99:00\ &gt;LL;0;_</p>
<p>This data is populated from a form with a correspounding field shift (format medium time and input mask 99:00\ &gt;LL;0;_)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The creation of records works well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would just like to enhance by entering checks/balances</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before&nbsp;a new record is created,&nbsp; I would like to verify an existing record does not exist ...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The query&nbsp;does not display correct results &nbsp;when I try to compare the shift fields</p>
<p>[table].shift = [form].[shift].... </p>
<p>
</p><p>it works if hard code #12/30/1899&nbsp; 7:00 AM#</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confused because the form data creates the table data.. </p>
<p>If this question has been asked before could you please reference the answer (I was not able to find it)</p>
<p>Thank you for your help on this matter</p>

            In a query, parameters of date/time data type should always be declared as such.&nbsp; This not only avoids the inadvertent misinterpretation of the parameter as an arithmetical expression, but also caters for regional variations in the system date formats,
 e.g.<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS Forms!frmMyForm!txtMyDate DATETIME;<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM MyTable<br />
WHERE MyDate = Forms!frmMyForm!txtMyDate;<br />
<br />
In code, date literals must be in US short date format or an otherwise internationally unambiguous format.&nbsp; The ISO standard for date notation of YYYY-MM-DD is a good choice, e.g. in a form's module:<br />
<br />
Const MESSAGE_TEXT = "This date already exists in the table."<br />
Dim strCriteria As String<br />
<br />
If Not IsNull(txtMyDate) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "MyDate = #" &amp; Format(Me.txtMyDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(DLookup("MyDate","MyTable",strCritera") Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox MESSAGE_TEXT, vbInformation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End If<br />
<br />
Note that the above code is fine if inserting a new record, but not if editing an existing record as it will identify itself as a duplicate.&nbsp; To avoid this bring the primary key into play:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "MyD &lt;&gt; " &amp; Me.MyID &amp; "And MyDate = #" &amp; Format(Me.txtMyDate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#"<br />

            <p>A few points here. First, you do not have fields on a form, you have controls, that may or may not be bound to fields in a table. This is a subtle but important distinction. Second, you can't compare
<p>
</p><p>Verify: IIF(table.Shift=Forms!formname!Shift,true result, false result)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This expression will result in a column headed Verify that shows whatever you use as the True Result or False Result for every record returned by the query. For example if you use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verify: IIF(table.Shift=Forms!formname!Shift,True, False)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it will show True if the value of Shift in the table matches the value of Shift on the form, otherwise it will show False.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your goal is to make sure that there can only be one record with the Time entered, then set the field on the Table level to No Duplicates. If you just want to test, the use what Mimmo suggested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Dcount function in the Before Update event of the Control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thank you for your replies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data could not be matched due to the focus on the control/field (it was actually blank).&nbsp;&nbsp; The comparison event was occurring before update on the field/control..&nbsp; Once the query was initialized after update, the data matched&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the original purpose,&nbsp; verifying there is not a duplicate record for that date, for that product, for that shift, for that location.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to&nbsp;redesign the existing forms .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for the information on the DCOUNT and basic knowledge of the control fields.....&nbsp; these answers did help me resolve the actual problem</p>

            Yes, once My Phone shuts down there will not be a similar service that you could use to backup contacts, tasks, appointments, pictures, text messages, documents on the phone.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There are services that will let you sync a subset of this information (i.e., you can sync your contacts &amp; appointments directly to your windows live account), but there is no such service that syncs all this data, and includes an archive of the data.<br />

            <p>Yes Microsoft is discontinuing the MyPhone service which is the way that the Windows Mobile device is configured to back itself up to.&nbsp; So there will no longer be any backups made automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to backup, consider using Windows Mobile Device Center to sync your calendar, contacts and tasks to your PC as well as files you create on your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another application to consider is PPC Pim Backup from <a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.dotfred.net</a> which can backup the SMS messages.</p>

<h2>            Unable to view a document, tells me to convert and select a format to make it readable but it just comes up as random letters and symbols &#58;S</h2>
                    A REALLY important document that I need to view is suddenly appearsing with a box that says File Conversion, select the encoding that makes your document readable and has the options of Windows, MS DOC, Other encoding but selected any other the option
 just gives a bunch of sympols and letters e.g.

            That's a bad sign, I'm afraid. :-(<br />
<br />
You could try the Recover Text from Any File converter (in the Open dialog box).<br />
<br />
If it's a *.docx file, try changing the filename extension to <strong>zip</strong>; then see what you can salvage from the components of the zip archive.

<h3> sbuk73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950XL and Bluetooth Pairing with my Gear S2 Watch - It did work, then stopped &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    <p>Set-up the 950XL last night.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The GOOD</strong> : to my surprise it connected to my Samsung Gear S2 smartwatch, I was able to receive notifications, reply to emails from my smartwatch and see calendar sync etc. That was enough to marry the two devices together in harmony.</p>
<p><strong>The BAD</strong>: Obviously while setting up a device you download apps, and do the UPDATES but after XYZ reasons unknown to me my phone no longer communicates with my watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just curious about how it was working one moment and all of sudden it now DOES NOT WORK. I know it's a bonus if they talk to each other happily. I test many devices for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS:</strong></p>
<p>I pair the Lumia to my watch, it shows the pair up number on the watch face and I accept and says it is connected.</p>
<p>On the Lumia it says it is PAIRED but now only stays connected for 3 seconds and goes back to PAIRED state.</p>
<p>I click on it and say CONNECT - it connects and again drops after 3 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHAT HAVE I TRIED:</strong></p>
<p>Deleted and re-added the pairing many names.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Office 2007 Pro - Outlook out of memory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2007 Pro - Outlook out of memory</h2>
                    I purchased Microsoft Office Pro last week and everything works fine except Outlook.<br />
<br />
Outlook will send and receive emails fine. <br />
<br />
When I try to enter information into the calandar and save it I get the following message:<br />
"Out of memory or system resources. Close some windows or programs and try again."<br />
<br />
Outlook seems to work correctly when doing the following things. <br />
1. Sending and receiving emails -- OK<br />
2. Entering and saving items on the contact list. -- OK<br />
3. Entering items into the Task list. -- OK<br />
<br />
My computer:<br />
1. My computer is running windows XP with SP 3.<br />
2. My computer has 2 GB of Ram and 85 GB of free memory left on the boot hard drive for virtual memory.<br />
3. My computer hardware is AMD mother board GA-770TA-UD3 with a 630 Althone processor running at 2.8 Ghz.&nbsp;<br />
4. I uninstalled Office 2007 and then reinstalled it. No effect. <br />
5. I defraged the boot drive. No effect.<br />
6. I have activated the Task Manager and watch the memory usage when outlook is running. It never gets close to even 1 GB or Ram usage.<br />
<br />
I have tried the following things: <br />
1. I installed Office service pack 2.<br />
2. I ran Office Diagnostic - It found no problems.<br />
3. I down loaded Microsoft Guided Help and ran in in the secure mode. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ( I set the virtual memory for a maximum of 4 GB on the boot drive which has 85 GB free)<br />
4. I tried running outlook with the anti virus turned off and it did not fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea as to what is causing outlook to be unable to save any calendar entries?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />

<p>Does this happen even if you start Outlook in Safe Mode? (hold down CTRL while you click the icon) See if this helps:<a href="http://www.officeforlawyers.com/outlook/tsol.htm#safe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.officeforlawyers.com/outlook/tsol.htm#safe&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>If it still happens then the PST file might be corrupted or you might have a corrupted view.</p>

<p>Hello Ben,</p>
<p>I really like you documents and the way they explain how to deal with the different problems. Very nice job.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>I tried each of your suggestions;</p>
<p>1. I started outlook in the safe mode and it made not difference.</p>
<p>2. I ran the /cleanviews switch and it made no difference.</p>
<p>3. I found the outlook1.pst file from the navigation panel by right clicking on the personal folder - properities - advanced - and got the directory location.Then I ran the scanpst.exe file two different time and on the third time it found no problems. --
 This still did not fix the out of memory issue problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did notice that in Outlook calendar when I try to save an appointment there are 6 different file types that you are allowed to save in.</p>
<p>1. *.txt , *.rtf&nbsp; =&nbsp; You CAN save the file with these ending.</p>
<p>3. *.oft, *.msg, *.msg Unicode, *.ics&nbsp; =&nbsp; You can NOT save the file with these ending.(You still get the out of memory error)</p>
<br />
<p>So there are two type that allow you to save and 4 type that will not allow you to save.</p>
<p>Does this give you any other ideas on what might be causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wait...you shouldn't need to save a calendar item in any of those formats. &nbsp;Just clicking "Save and Close" should put it on your calendar. &nbsp;Or are you trying to do something else?</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you're getting the out of memory error in those instances, but first let's just confirm that if you click Save and Close on the toolbar that it puts the item on your calendar.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>You are correct that I get the error message when I just select "Save and Close". I was just trying to obtain other possible clues about the problem by trying the other save options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other bits of information that I noticed ;</p>
<p>1. Looking at the Path and file that Outlook points to I see it is using "Outlook1.pst"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Personal folder - right click</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Select Properties for Personal Folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Then select the advanced TAB</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. It shows the path and file name ...Microsoft\Outlook\Outlook1.pst ( 63,505 kb )</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I got to the folder to use scanpst.exe&nbsp; I see there is another file there also = "Outlook.pst" ( 1257 KB )</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not run the scanpst.exe on the&nbsp; "Outlook.pst" - Should I?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When I tried to install the Office SP2 windows told me that it was already installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a new computer and it has never had any other office products loaded on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I go look in the "Add and Remove Programs" I don't see any service pack indicated next to Office 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do see service packs designations located next to other items loaded on the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0 SP2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Microsoft .Net Framework 3.0 SP2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 SP1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Windows XP SP3</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should Office 2007 display the SP2 next to its name if it's service pack is loaded?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am just trying to look at as many possible items as I can to see if I can find what is causing the out of memory error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for trying to help me solve this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<p>Yes my send and receive emails work correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I can create a new task item and save it with out any problem.</p>
<p>The only choice is "Save As" and it automatically selects the file type as *.rtf</p>

<p>No, for some reason you're still saving as a file item. &nbsp;You just want to click "Save and Close" to save the Task (or Appointment Item).</p>
<p>What if you disable, as a test, Norton Antivirus. &nbsp;I've never seen Norton cause this issue, but I've certainly seen it cause issues with other things in Outlook.</p>
<p>Was this PST file brought over from another machine or ?</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>You are correct I saved it the wrong way. I went back to the Task window and created a new task and then doubled clicked on it and the window opened to enter the information about the task. This window indeed did have the "Save and Close" button and surprisingly
 it worked and saved the information.</p>
<p>I turned off Norton (both the fire wall and antivirus). Then I opened outlook and selected the calandar function and selected a day (in the future) from the calander and entered the information about the meeting. When I pressed the"Save and Close" button
 I got the same "Out of memory or resources" error message.</p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<p>1. My email function sends and receives correctly and I can move items between the different boxes ( inbox, outbox, sentbox, etc.).</p>
<p>2. I tried entering several Contact business cards and was able to save them using the "Save and Close Button" and it save the information.</p>
<p>3. I tried the Task button and made two different task and enter the information and was able to use the&nbsp; "Save and Close Button" to save them.</p>
<p>4. So the only function that will not allow me to "Save and Close" is the Calendar operation. Every time I enter a Calendar event and hit the "Save and Close" button I get the " Out of memory or resources" error message (even with Norton turned off).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put this computer together about 2 weeks ago and all the hardware is new. I did not transfer any of the old PSTs or any other information from the previous computer.&nbsp; I installed Windows XP SP3, Office 2007 Pro (I did not have it mounted on the old computer),
 Photoshop 7, Microsoft Digital Images, Adobe Flash, Adobe Shockwave, Adobe reader, Microsoft Security Essentials (Which I turned off because it seemed to interfere with the Norton and&nbsp; Windows operation), and a few other non Microsoft programs.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>I went to the Start Button - Control Panel - Mail - and made a new profile with a different address -- Then I selected prompt for the profile when Outlook starts.</p>
<p>I then closed the control panel and started Outlook and selected the new profile. The program started and received several new messages for the new address. I then switched to the calendar and selected a date in the future and entered the information and
 then selected the "Save and Close Button". I got the same error message "Out of memory or resources" and it would not save the information.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            What do you think about the new icons &#40;open folder&#41;</h2>
                    The new 'open folder' icons are not that nice. You do not get any read info from these icons. What would be nice is if the folder contained music or video when you move the cursor over it, it would play it automaticly in a little preview window. &nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f339119-f3bf-49c5-aabb-595bcf86f571" />

            I'm not opposed to new icon sets - in fact I've seen some pretty good "metrofied" icon sets on deviant art, but these icons are abysmally bad. I really sincerely hope that this is placeholder art, but my gut tells me it's not. I really felt like these
 icons regressed 20 years.<br />

 Icon.? cause what I see in your screenshot is not what's being displayed in my folder. If I am accessing another feature, please correct me. It is bad enough when I access the charms or Store icons in media, they do nothing or even trying o open Windows PC

<p>make a new folder on your desktop, then put something into it and it will look like the ones displayed, in file explorer they still look like they used to, (other than the small folder tree icons which are also bad)<br />

            Thank you for bringing me up to speed. Sense I have not created a new folder, that is why I did not see this " Ugly Graphics " and I agree it is distasteful in appearence and I am not one bit surprised from Microsoft for them to put it in a preview for
 they also know it is very redundant. I guess I am just one who looks for immediate innovations as looking at it from my perspective would associate it when Microsoft graphic designers go from images DOS to 95 to 98 to well you get my drift..Those are examples
 of change you can feel and be delighted with. I want something to jump out at you and immediately grad your imagination and make you go WOW....

            i agree, visual presentation has a large impact on perception, apple figured this out eons ago, lets just hope Microsoft does NOT ship this uglyness as the final product, i like most of the other stuff they have done with windows 10, if they can make ALL
 the icons one consistent style that is not hideous and fix the black tell you nothing boot and reboot screen its very close to being an acceptable os<br />

<p>So, when it installed you had to connect your device and after it was connected you had to choose what you wanted to sync...right?&nbsp;

<p>Did any of them sync?</p>

<p>A partnership means that you were able to establish a relationship between your PDC and your device so it can sync.&nbsp; When you attach your device to your laptop, if a partnership exists, it will open WMDC and start the sync process.</p>

    <title>Outlook for mac not displaying blank lines in some text format emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay_macuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for mac not displaying blank lines in some text format emails</h2>
                    For some text formatted emails, outlook for mac seems to strip out blank new lines in the quoted reply portion of the email. This is only when displaying the email because I can open up the same email in Apple Mail or Outlook Web Access and the blank new
 lines are still there. And it doesn't occur for every text email. I haven't been able to figure out why it does it for some but not others. HTML formatted emails always display correctly. It's a very annoying problem because it makes the email much harder
 to read with everything compressed together. Has anyone else run into this?

            Updated: I narrowed down the problem. It occurs when someone replies to an email using Apple Mail. That's why only some of my emails have the problem. If no one on the email chain was using Apple Mail then the newlines are preserved. Some something in
 the formatting of the Apple Mail created email message makes Outlook for Mac strip out the blank lines in the quoted portion of the email. And it is still only a display issue since opening the email in Outlook Web Access or Outlook for Windows does not show
 the formatting problem. At this point I'm going to assume there's little chance this issue will be fixed since it's a compatibility issue between Apple Mail and Outlook for Mac.
<div><br />
<div>Btw I was easily able to reproduce this by sending an email to myself with some blank new lines and then opening Apple Mail to reply to the message. When I viewed the reply in Outllook for Mac, the blank lines were removed.</div>

<h2>            What is Normal.dotm&#63;</h2>
                    I have not created any macros or templates, but this designation keeps trying to save my docs.&nbsp; When I exit from a document Word says the document is in use by another user (I don't have any other users) or that Windows closed while the doc was open.&nbsp;
 That is a possibility, but how do I get rid of these annoying notices about Normal dotm.?

            <p>Further to Doug's reply. If you are having this error, it is because at some time recently Word has crashed and this has left behind the lock file which he describes. There will be others relating to any documents that you were using at the time - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the default Templates folder in Word by typing %appdata%\Microsoft\Templates in the File Explorer address bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word will always try and save the normal template if there are any changes to it (or create one if it doesn't exist) when you close Word. By default it does this automatically, which can create as many problems as it solves. You can set the option to prompt
 to save the normal template only when you want to keep the changes ... and you will only want to keep some of the changes. While in that part of the options dialog, also set the option to automatically create backups of your documents. This will retain the
 last previously saved version when you save your documents and can help you recover from document data loss. Save often!</p>

 that it was not available at this time. If you searched it, also no results.&nbsp;

                    I have done everything I know to do. I have removed Bluetooth and reinstalled it ( which came closest to resolving the issue...device flash a whole half of a second before going back to a continuous loop). Is this what I have to live with? I've done everything
 troubleshooting has asked and it says my PC is up to date.

<h2>            WIndows 10 Font Installation doesnt work, also Printing from the browser doesnt work</h2>
                    <p>I would like to post this in the WIndows 10 feedback app but that is nowhere to be found.&nbsp; I see it pop up on rare occasions to ask me a question but I never can find it to report a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently trying to install a new font.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right click
 of the font and then install or pasting the font into font folder produce the same result:&nbsp; a small window pops up for a fraction of a second and disappears.&nbsp; The font never appears.&nbsp; Previewing the font works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a second problem if I log into usps.com and create a shipping label, printing never works.&nbsp; I have to save to a pdf file and print from there.&nbsp; Once windows 10 is released, I am sure there will be lots of complaints about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is installed on a Lenovo Y580 laptop.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The print problem on www.usps.com is a print button there to print your purchased label which is not displayed on the page.&nbsp; The print dialog never appears so nothing happens.&nbsp; You have to use the save to pdf button and print from there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise the
 printing dialog comes up &nbsp;when its available from the ... menu for web pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stumbled across a setting for the feedback app and set it to "always".&nbsp; However it still hides from me.&nbsp; I saw it once and was almost able to input the font problem but then it disappeared before I could finish it.&nbsp; I did create an admin cmd prompt shortcut
 and was able to copy the font into the font folder but it still didn't start working yet.</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Last week I upgraded to Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2010 64 bit and when I synced my phone, it wiped out all my contacts and calendar appointments. I read online that WMDC is not supported by 64 bit version but only by the 32 bit version. So, I uninstalled
 the 64 bit version and loaded the 32 bit version. When I tried to sync the phone, I received an error that said, "Exchange ActiveSync encountered an error. If this condition persists, please contact your System administrator...Support code: 0x85010014."&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, I do not connect to an exchange server- only my local laptop that downloads from a POP server.</strong></p>
<p>Could someone tell me what the problem is with this? I have uninstalled office several times, WMDC several times and reset my phone several times with the same results. I have been working on this for about 1 week. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Ever since Outlook has been inastalled I have had problems with my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariorebaudo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ever since Outlook has been inastalled I have had problems with my hotmail usage.... can I revert back to hotmail &#63; at the moment I cant even sign in to Outlook....</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Hotmail for many years with great success..it has really been very useful. But now ever since the automatic migration to Outlook it has been practically unsusable.... slow not responding... having trouble with opening past emails and their
 attachments..and now I cannot even sign in .Is there any way of going back to Hotmail as perhaps the problem might be that I am using a Samsung netbook&nbsp;2gb ram&nbsp;&nbsp;and it may not have enough capacity.</p>
<p>If anyone can help I would be grateful.</p>
