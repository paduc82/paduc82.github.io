<h2>            Apps not downloading due to slow internet connection&#33;</h2>
                    I have a surface rt and ever since I have downloaded the latest windows rt&nbsp;updates I can no longer download apps. I get the dreaded "your app cannot be downloaded due to slow internet connection". I have already tried wsreset, deleting the software distribution
 folder etc. Nothing works. This occurs with both paid and free apps. The only thing that has worked is resetting to factory defaults and not installing the latest rt updates. That really isn't a solution since I do not like running windows without the latest
 security updates. Any help is appreciated.

<p><strong>Do you have McAfee? It was updated at about the same time and it seems to be the cause of this problem.</strong></p>

<p>You should do the McAfee fix, if applicable.</p>
<p>I had McAfee but the connection started working again of its own accord so I thought I was clear of problems. However, when I checked it said it had been doing routine checks for updates but failed when I told it to do one manually. So staying with McAfee
 without following their fix procedure would have put my PC at risk by not being updated and, as further McAfee announcements have since explained, the application was not referring to its threats database correctly.
<em>Actually, I removed it then installed <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/products/security-essentials/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> instead &amp; my IE response is quicker than I have known it [even though I had had the McAfee add-ons disabled for ages].
</em></p>
<p>I've had to run the McAfee MCPR removal a few times before and it caused a licence problem if the PC was not connected to the internet during the removal. The McAfee support chat had to reset their records to allow reinstallation-reactivation. Here's their
 chat link - <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/LocaleSelect.aspx?lc=1033&amp;sg=TS&amp;pt=1&amp;st=CHAT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If you don't have McAfee then Windows update KB2705219 might also be a cause as uninstalling that has appeared to fix the problem for some users.

</p><p>Thank you for posting you query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows 10 is a new operating system, there might be some driver compatibility issue. In order to identify what exactly is causing the issue, I would suggest you to try the different troubleshooting steps given in the help article below which also includes
 the steps to update drivers. Please follow the link and check if it helps:</p>

            <p>I did what you suggest before I contacted you, without success. Can you be more helpful please? I work in music and your Windows 10 upgrade makes it impossible to work. I also understand that the Realtek Driver has been updated to be Win 10 compatible and
 I've updated that before discovering this problem, so it's clearly something to do with Win 10-.&nbsp;</p>

            I still haven't received a response and have been searching on other forums without success. The problem is driving me nuts and I have not idea what causes it. On all audio, whether from iTunes, internally saved files or any streaming sites, I get regular
 bursts of digital distortion about 2 seconds apart which rise and fall in volume and seem to move from one channel to the other. The bursts slightly interfere with the timing of music so they're actually in the signal path rather than on top of it. Would you
 please respond this time and try to help. Do not direct me to Fix Sound Problems because it doesn't acknowledge that there is one. This only happened once I upgraded to Win 10 and I have unloaded and reloaded the Realtek audio driver and updated to what they
 say is Win 10 compatible latest version.&nbsp;

                    I tried using the Windows upgrade download tool and after the pic restarted it gave me the option to turn the pic off and revert back to Windows 7 or do a system restore. When I tried to do the system restore it said that portion of Windows on my pic was
 locked. I haven't been able to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10. My copy of Windows is genuine, as I purchased it from a Best Buy.

<h2>            Problem connecting to Wifi, no connections are available, windows 8</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have a problem to connect to my wireless connection on windows 8 pc, <br />
I was able to connect to the network before, but after I went to a friend's place and I connected to her network , I can't connect to my network at home anymore. I get the message no connections are available.
<br />
I checked that the airplane mode is off, I installed new driver which worked for a while (and then the same problem appeared as soon as i went with my laptop outside of home), i reinstalled bios, i entered in a safe mode and tried to change some of the internet
 settings but that wasn't possible. So eventually nothing worked. When I was installing the new driver again, I got the message that-notification dll has not been registered, so the program will not work properly-<br />
The new driver that I was installing is Broadcom Virtual Wireless Adapter, version 5.100.82.33, but now it is not even visible anymore (when I go to Contol Panel&gt;Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters)<br />
<br />
Please give me some advice that can solve this problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Greetings,<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Worked for a while and then failed sounds like hardware. Check with the System Maker's<br />
Support, their on-line documentation, drivers, and diagnostics, and ask in their forums<br />
(if any) about any known issues.<br />
<br />
Will it still connect and work properly at other&nbsp;locations?<br />
<br />
Why is my Internet connection so slow?<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</font></span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</font></span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.<br />

Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Left&nbsp;Side click Manage <br />
Wireless Networks - Right Click the Networks - Remove Networks - <br />
REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect&nbsp;To - to logon on to Network.<br />

<br />Here is a thread with a discussion about some potential workarounds that might work. References Windows 7, but it should also work for Windows 10 too:

<br />You can also try the 64 bit driver for the HP Laserjet IIIP by downloading it from the Microsoft Update Catalog:

<br />
<br />I see drivers listed for Windows 8.1, you could download it, install it in compatibility mode, connect the printer to see if it works.

            I can only suggest that you try installing the XP driver using compatibility mode.
<br />Driver download sites may say the driver is for Windows 10 but most often they’re the original driver but labelled as Windows 10.

<h2>            Bluetooth Drive gets knocked offline after going to sleep when I forget to charge laptop</h2>
                    Hi there, I'm currently using an Acer laptop running windows 10. As the subject suggests, the bluetooth drive gets knocked offline when the laptop goes to sleep when the battery is critically low. I am unable to find bluetooth settings in the settings
 page as well as the bluetooth driver in device manager. I have experienced this before and it somehow came back online just as I was explaining the problem to an Acer employee on the phone. Does anybody have a solution and explanation for this?? It's starting
 to annoy me. Thanks!

    <title>Failed to initialize drive for encrypting C drive using BitLocker - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Failed to initialize drive for encrypting C drive using BitLocker Drive Encryption with TPM enabled</h2>
                    <p>When using Microsoft BitLocker Drive Encryption on encrypting C drive after initialized TPM on our server, an error message "Illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion" is prompted. Now we are unable to encrypt C drive.
 Tried to search but there is seldom relevant case as same as our case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>C drive has been encrypted before and decrypted for some reasons a month ago. It seems that some settings are kept in the server even though we have removed BitLocker from feature and clear TPM. Is there any additional step to be performed for clearing the
 registry / historical settings?&nbsp;The OS is Windows server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for help</p>

            <p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>

<h2>            I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t update Super Street Fighter IV to use the Ultra upgrade</h2>
                    
<p>When starting the game, it disconnects me from live, attempts to download a mandatory update, and then never progresses from the ~2% mark. When I cancel and go back to the dashboard, I get a generic "can't log into live" error (with no error code) and am
 told to go to xbox.com/support in order to resolve the issue. Only disconnecting the power from the system seems to let me sign in again, but then I still can't update or play the game.</p>

<p>[quote user="Chill Penguin"]When starting the game, it disconnects me from live, attempts to download a mandatory update, and then never progresses from the ~2% mark. [/quote]</p>
<p>This sounds like the update system cache became corrupted (and will corrupt even more when cancelling the update.
</p>
<p>To (hopefully) resolve this, do the following:</p>
<p>go to the Settings hub on the far right, then to the System tile in the upper left. There go to Storage and highlight your harddrive. Now press Y and choose to clear the system cache.
</p>
<p>After that, try to start the game again. </p>
<p>Depending on the size of the update and your internet connection speed, it is very well possible that the progress bar seemingly "hangs" at 2%. Try to do something else during the download (e.g. make a tasty sandwich or call your mom and warn her about the
 various Xbox Live members that are about to visit her during the online matches where you win against every other opponent. Or closely watch a kettle of water heat up until it boils. Just don't look at the progress bar, as a progress bar that is being observed
 will ALWAYS stall at the point where you observe it!). </p>
<p>I'll cross my fingers that the update will then go through properly. </p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion Arminator.</p>
<p>I should have mentioned that I tried to do that, as well as deleting the Ultra DLC because I thought that may have been the cause.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I just seem to be having many issues with Live. The 360 reports that most Live content is not available to me, cloud syncing takes far too long to complete, etc. So the only solution here was patience.</p>
<p>Thank you though!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft should not dismiss or ignore the Intel DPST issue</h2>
                    Surface customers have been complaining about Intel DPST for years, it is one of the most common complaints. This has been going on for too long now and Microsoft needs to provide a solution. Thankfully, doing so would be easy. A simple toggle switch in
 the display settings or battery settings or even the Surface app would do the trick. Surface customers should not have to tinker with registry settings to get a normal experience on their computer.

<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 screen is changing brightness</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;<br />
after two last firmware updates (related to the pen issue) I have recognized that the screen on my Surface Pro 2017 is changing brightness when I am switching between dark and light backgrounds. For example when I have two web pages in browser with light background
 and with dark background. This affect is in place only when Surface Pro is working by using battery. It is annoying. Do you have any advise?&nbsp;<br />
Many thanks.

            Hello Andrei,
<br />
<br />The Surface Pro has an option for auto screen brightness turned on by default. This allows it to adjust the brightness of the display by it self depending on the brightness of the environment you are on. Would this be what you are referring to? If so, you can easily disable it from the settings application. 
<br />
<br />The option is in: Settings&gt;Display&gt;"Change Brightness automatically when lighting changes"
<br />
<br />Let me know if this is it. 
<br />
<br />I attached a screenshot below.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcec4cc2-e9d2-4083-a397-e98d55fe564b?upload=true" />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is disabled on my Surface Pro.&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, I have made rollback of the firmware update to my last checkpoint. The issue with screen brightness disappeared. However, the pen accurateness is important, so I have re-installed the last firmware once again. After that the screen brightness issue
 came back.</p>
<p>I have opened the case to MS. I have provided remote access for MS support.<br />
After 1.5 h with MS support remotely connected to my Surface the issue is still in place. Till now I have no any explanation from MS.</p>
<p>

 sensor-based) adaptive brightness and Intel DPST is really lame.</p>

<h2>            Changing Windows Vista to XP</h2>
                    I have a new computer and it came with Vista.&nbsp; It is not compatible with my printer.&nbsp; I have decided that I prefer Windows XP.&nbsp; I have the XP disk.&nbsp; Is there any problem in loading XP.&nbsp; I know I have to back up any files I have because when the XP is loaded
 it will over write my files.&nbsp; Advise is welcomed.

            <span>General information about replacing Vista with XP:<br />
<br />
A. On an OEM (HP, Sony, etc.) computer:<br />
<br />
1. Go to the OEM's website and look for XP drivers for your specific model computer. If there are no XP drivers, then you can't install XP. End of story. If there are drivers, download them and store on a CD-R or USB thumbdrive; you'll need them after you install
 XP.<br />
<br />
2. Check with the OEM - either from their tech support website or by calling them - to see if you will void your warranty if you do this. If you will void the warranty, you make the decision.<br />
<br />
3. If the OEM does support XP on the machine, call them and see if you can have downgrade rights and have them send you an XP restore disk. This will be far the easiest and best way of getting XP on the machine.<br />
<br />
4. If XP is supported on the machine but the OEM doesn't have an XP restore disk for you, understand that you'll need to purchase a retail copy of XP from your favorite online or brick/mortar store.<br />
<br />
5. Also understand that you will need to do a clean install of XP so if you have any data you want, back it up first.<br />
<br />
6. If none of the above is applicable to you because you can't run XP on that machine (see Item #1 above), return the computer and purchase one running XP instead.<br />
<br />
B. On a generic/home-built computer (from non-OEM company) - You will need drivers for all your hardware. See the second link below for more details:<br />

    <title>Offline files not automatically syncing when connected to network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_1500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline files not automatically syncing when connected to network</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Pro laptop that is configured for offline files with the users home drive on our network.&nbsp; When the laptop is working in offline mode, the folders appear as they should with the green sync icon present.&nbsp; I can create files in those folders
 fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log back in to the network, the folder does not automatically sync (as it did with Win7) with the network folder.&nbsp; Editing the offline files do not trigger a sync nor does creating new online files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to manually right click on the offline folder and select Sync -&gt; Sync selected offline files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has the ability to automatically detect and sync when connected been discontinued for W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>When connect to network,&nbsp;I modify files at setuped offline location, I found the files just only change at local cache, not save at network directly.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;setup schedule the sync per 5 mins. It can sync correctly.</p>
<p>But the serious problem is&nbsp;when I want to save file after modify EXCEL file,&nbsp;get messege "document not save", I can save it to the other network&nbsp;path that not set offline or local disk only.</p>
<p>Above situation happen at&nbsp;connected network&nbsp;and offline both.</p>
<p>It happens sometime, not always!!!</p>
<p>I get the problem at two computers. one upgrade, the other pure install.</p>
<p>Office version is 2013 STD.</p>
<p>I sure patch all newest for OS and Office.</p>
<p>I disable offline,&nbsp;it work fine.</p>

<p>Para alternar entre os jogos que você ocultou e os jogos exibidos, selecione o ícone de filtro no canto direito. Você pode optar por mostrar apenas jogos visíveis (o padrão), apenas jogos ocultos ou ambos.</p>
<p>Para exibir o jogo que você ocultou anteriormente, primeiro verifique se você está mostrando seus jogos ocultos. Em seguida, destaque o que você deseja mostrar novamente (a ponta do X Unhide aparece) e pressione X no seu controle.</p>

<h2>            Asking to activate Windows 8 but it has already been activated</h2>
                    I have searched all over for an answer to this, but I have come up empty handed and the options I am given are not helping in any way.&nbsp;
<div>
<div><br />
When I run slui.exe 4, I am unable to get an ID for when I call the toll free number given to me. An error always pops up and I am just given a box with a number to call and no ID code. All I have is to tell the representative&nbsp;the numbers below, but all I see
 is &nbsp;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then boxes under that for me to type in when I am given. I am unable to speak to someone either, saying help always makes the voice tell me it needs a number.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried running SLUI 3, as I found this on another questions like this, but I am given an error code 0xC0000022. After that, I am given the same box as before with a phone number to call, but no real way to speak to someone.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Right now, I am unable to even find a phone number to call so I can try and fix this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

            How To Activate Windows 8
<p>Windows Product Activation (WPA) sends an installation ID number to Microsoft before Windows is verified and then activated.</p>
<p>One is an Installation ID, generated by entering a Windows 8 product key, that the computer owner submits to Microsoft, either over the Internet or by phone.</p>
<p>The second is a Confirmation ID, assigned by Microsoft, which is used to activate the operating system’s software.</p>
Activate Windows 8 Using Internet
<p>The easiest way to activate your Windows 8 is to activate it over the Internet. To start the Product Activation Wizard, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. At the Start screen, swipe in from the right side, or hover your mouse in the upper-right corner of the screen to display the charms menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techapna.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f02%2fWindows-8-Settings.png" /></p>
<p>2. Tap or click the <strong>Settings</strong> charm.</p>

<p>4. Select <strong>Activate Windows</strong> (If your Windows is activated successfully, you will not see Activate Windows in the PC Settings)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techapna.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f03%2fActivate-Windows-8-Option.png" /></p>

<p>The product key should be printed on the box that the Windows 8 DVD came in or included in an email you received after buying Windows.</p>
<p>7. Windows will now automatically detects whether the product key is valid. If your product key works, click
<b>Activate</b> .</p>
<p>8. If Windows Activation is successful, click <strong>Close. </strong></p>
<p>If activation was not successful, check the key and try entering it again.</p>
Activate Windows 8 Using Phone

<p>3. Tap or click <strong>Change PC Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Select <strong>Activate Windows</strong></p>
<p>5. Tap or click <b>Activate by phone.</b></p>
<p>6. Select the country/region from the drop down menu, and then click <b>Next</b> .</p>
<p>7. Call the toll free number provided.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techapna.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f03%2fWindows-8-Activation-By-phone1.jpg" /></p>
<p>8. Follow the instructions from the telephone system and write down the confirmation ID.</p>
<p>9. Enter the confirmation ID numbers into fields A through H, in the same sequence as the telephone system provided them. When done, click
<b>Activate</b> .</p>

    <title>Do HDMI cables matter for Audio&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okrane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do HDMI cables matter for Audio&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a TCL P605 recently and it's great. The 4K HDR visuals look dope. However, the audio is giving me issues. You see, I'm using an old Sony 3.1 soundbar that unfortunately doesn't support 4K passthrough. What I thought I could do is plug my Xbox One X into the TV, then use the Audio Return Channel from the TV to the soundbar.&nbsp; When I do that, though, I only get stereo sound and when I try to switch to bitstream out or even just 5.1, I get an error message saying that my receiver doesn't support even though it does. I can't force the audio because to get 4K HDR&nbsp;the settings need to be set to auto.&nbsp;The only solution I can think of is to use an optical cable, which would be more inconvenient, or try out one of those expensive audio HDMI cables at Best Buy or something and see if that helps. Do you guys think that might be it?</p>

    <title>Bug&#58; Using arrow keys in Remote Desktop and VM always highlights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bran.murray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Using arrow keys in Remote Desktop and VM always highlights</h2>
                    <p>I have a weird typing issue. This occurs in Remote Desktop Connection, Remote Desktop Connection Manager, and VMware Player, but NOT in the host/local OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect to a machine via RDP or boot up one of my VMs, using the arrow keys, home key, and end key while typing results in the text being selected/highlighted instead of the cursor moving. The delete key doesn't work at all unless text is highlighted
 first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as if the shift key is automatically being sent to the remote desktop and the VM when I press one of these keys (pressing the Shift key while using the navigation keys doesn't cancel the effect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that temporarily works is to press and hold the shift key for a second or two, then press one of the navigation keys. For that key press only the cursor moves as it's supposed to, but all subsequent key presses revert back to the selecting
 behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Enterprise, 10.0.10586, build 10586.</p>

            I finally figured out what was causing this issue. Having the Sticky Keys setting, "Press one key at a time for keyboard shortcuts," enabled&nbsp;on my host Windows 10 machine was the culprit. I'm not sure how it got turned on, since I never mess around with
 ease of access/accessibility settings, but when I noticed that pressing and letting go of the shift key, then typing a letter resulted in a capital, that's when my spidey sense started tingling.
