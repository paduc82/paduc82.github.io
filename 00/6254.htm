            Do you have the Bluetooth on all the time?<br />
Is the WLAN auto search constantly on?<br />
<br />
If these are left on, they will have a substantial drain on the battery.<br />
<br />
Check to see if these are turned off.

            There are a few battery-saving tips you can apply.<br />
<br />
1) Switch Bluetooth off when not in use<br />
<br />
2) Switch the WLAN search off and only connect to your WLAN when needed<br />
<br />
3) Deactivate software that goes online without asking you<br />
<br />
4) Lower the backlight timeout and brightness<br />
<br />
5) Make sure your firmware is up to date<br />
<br />
The N96 is a new phone so you're probably still busy playing with it :) Once the novelty wears off, though, you should see a marked improvement in battery life.<br />
<br />
The choice of the BL-5F battery already used in the N95-1 was, however, a little controversial. Some say that it was ludicrous to use the same battery as that of another model already suffering from autonomy issues. Others say that improvements to the firmware
 mean that the phone uses less energy anyway, thus compensating for the relatively low capacity (950mAh) of the battery.<br />
<br />
I reserve judgement until I get my hands on my own N96 (this week with any luck). At that point I'll be able to make my own mind up about that.

            Difficult to know why your battery is draining fast.<br />
<br />
How many minutes do you talk per day (received or made calls)?<br />
<br />
How many minutes do you use GPRS or HSDPA or WLAN?<br />
<br />
How many minutes or hours do you use MAPS?<br />
<br />
How many minutes or hours do you play Ngage games?<br />
<br />
How many minutes do you play music or videos?<br />
<br />
How many pictures and/or videos you shoot?<br />
<br />
Try to answer all the above questions thinking about all what you do in between charges and that would give a better picture.<br />
<br />
Also you can try installing, <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/resources/user_experience/power_management/nokia_energy_profiler/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Energy Profiler</a> to monitor the current consumption on your device and post your experiences here.

            Another thing to take into account is the amount of reception you get from your network.<br />
<br />
If the signal is low at any point, the phone tries harder to find a signal, thus using valuable battery power.<br />
<br />
If you are in a low signal area for most of the day, this may be the problem.

            Yes but I still think it would be interesting to know how much usage you get out of the N96 battery.<br />
<br />
Since there's nothing specific in the complaint.

    <title>Why did my Windows 10 phone lose all of the Members in the Groups&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why did my Windows 10 phone lose all of the Members in the Groups&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't ever use outlook.com but I like to keep everything (People, Appointments &amp; Inbox) synced between my home computer that both logs in with my outlook.com email address as User &amp; also has Outlook 2016 set up on it with only my outlook.com email address
 and my temperamental Nokia Lumia 950 phone.</p>
<p>Quite oddly, I don't think that the phone &amp; the PC's Outlook 2016 share the Group aka Category for all of my Contacts aka People.</p>
<p>Why that is, I'll never understand.</p>
<p>But that's a side issue. The main issue here is that suddenly yesterday I found my custom People Groups all had (0 members) and I had to sit in front of my PC with my phone &amp; go thru Outlook's Contact Categories by clicking the icon in the lower left and
 then expand each Category at the top of the list and manually add each Contact in them into my empty Groups on my phone.</p>
<p>What a huge pain.</p>
<p>So, what the heck wiped them all out? </p>
<p>Maybe I accidentally ran my phone down to 0% charge the night before and never knew it?</p>
<p>Maybe the big Mugen 9,300 mAh battery jolted loose momentarily which caused memory lose of only the People Group members but not the actual Groups themselves?</p>

    <title>Prerequisite for Internet Explorer 11 Windows7 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Prerequisite for Internet Explorer 11 Windows7 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Apart from upgrades, I have not installed new programs on my Windows 7 64 bit quad core PC.&nbsp; Several months ago IE 11 64 bit downloaded but failed to install upgrades.&nbsp; A dialog box notes something to do with rejected after security scan.&nbsp; I am now sitting
 at IE 9 after uninstalling IE 11 64 bit in an attempt to reinstall it to fix the problem.&nbsp; The IE 11 Windows 7 64 bit exectuable downloads, runs the installation then finally fails.&nbsp; I am using a second Windows 7 64 bit hex core PC to save downloaded executables
 e.g. msi files etc. and transferring them to the other PC.&nbsp; These transferred executables are surprisingly installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reviewed posts on similar problems with IE 11.&nbsp; A recommendation is to install&nbsp;six&nbsp;KB prerequisites.&nbsp; I searched for the prerequisites in the the PC updates list to find the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>2729094 installed (attempt to reinstall&nbsp;failed -&nbsp;dialog box&nbsp;notes already installed)</li><li>2731771 not installed (tried to install&nbsp;failed -&nbsp;dialog box&nbsp;notes not for this PC)</li><li>2533623 not installed (tried to install&nbsp;failed -&nbsp;dialog box&nbsp;notes not for this PC)</li><li>2670838 not installed (tried to install failed - dialog box&nbsp;notes not for this PC)</li><li>2786081 installed (attempted to reinstall failed&nbsp;- dialog box&nbsp;notes already installed)</li><li>2834140 installed (attempted to reinstall failed&nbsp;- dialog box&nbsp;notes not for this PC)</li></ol>
<p>I can understand why items 1 and 5 were not installed but items 2,3,and 4 were rejected for my PC and&nbsp;item 6 was installed but was apparently not for this PC.&nbsp; I am somewhat confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I temporarily&nbsp;stop MSE to detemine if the anti-malware program is preventing the IE 11 installation?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the possible recommendations.&nbsp; Here are my steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>downloaded "IE11-Windows6.1 -x64-en-us.exe"&nbsp;with save to a folder in my PC to run from there.</li><li>ran the executable while the program was searching for updates.</li><li>when installing was active I temporarily turned off&nbsp;MSE&nbsp;since my understanding is viruses&nbsp;do not attack during an installation.</li></ol>
<p>The program continued to install then&nbsp;followed&nbsp;with a note "restarting programs".&nbsp; Then the&nbsp;surprising note "Internet Explorer did not finish installing",&nbsp; followed by&nbsp;see "Internet Explorer Troubleshooting".&nbsp; Nothing new&nbsp;there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I turned on MSE again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During&nbsp;an attempt to try installing prerequisite KB items again with MSE off, I found contradictory information regarding&nbsp;my previous attempts i.e. as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>2731771 still does not install, noting not for this PC.</li><li>2533623&nbsp;appears to have now installed. (previously did not install,&nbsp;noting not for this PC).</li><li>2670838 dialog now shows already installed&nbsp;(previously did not install, noting not for this PC).</li></ul>
<p>I have not checked the validity of the existence of both these in my installed items list yet.&nbsp; I find the change in&nbsp;dialog reporting to be rather deceptive.&nbsp; I may be lucky, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;may appear that 2731771 is my only remaining item in the prerequisites list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am to believe that a change of heart&nbsp;for a program is possible and I am indeed lucky to be mostly there, do you have any tricks I can use to entice 2731771 to behave itself?</p>
        </p>

<p>If you don't see that, e.g. as shown&nbsp;in msinfo32.exe Loaded Modules sorted by Version, then that would be a problem to try to solve using your current IE9 before trying to get IE11 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that wininet.dll&nbsp; is just a guess about a module version that could have&nbsp;a discrepancy.&nbsp; E.g. a sort by Version ascending involving&nbsp; 9.0&nbsp; would put both the newest version and it (a module which starts with W) at the bottom of a grouping involving its
 version.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the May Cumulative update.&nbsp; I could not find the IE9 update for&nbsp;Windows 7.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;a number of Windows versions listed for IE9 including&nbsp;Windows 6.1 that looks very much like the download for IE11 Windows 7 64 bit e.g. 'IE11-Windows6.1 -x64-en-us.exe'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have missed something&nbsp;in Version aliases since Windows6.1&nbsp;in the executable is applied to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case do I use the Windows 6.1&nbsp;May Cumulative update version?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I was guessing that WU would pick the right one for you.&nbsp; Are you using WU?&nbsp; Perhaps you already have&nbsp;the May update installed but not applied?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OMG.&nbsp; I did not realize that IE9 is no longer supported on your OS.</p>

</p>
<p>Then that would explain why you would not have current maintenance.&nbsp; However, I think it would still be useful to find out how out-of-date your patching would be.&nbsp; Try using msinfo32 Loaded Modules sorted by Version to see what your oldest 9.0 IE related
 module is.&nbsp; Otherwise&nbsp;this makes things more difficult.&nbsp; I guess we should look at the details of each of the failures of installing the pre-reqs.&nbsp; Do you have the logs for those?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just realized that since support ended in January you should at least have that.&nbsp; So maybe I could prove the point I was wanting you to test with that instead of the latest.&nbsp; E.g. provided you find some discrepancy that way it would still support the case
 for trying to fix that before trying to go forward with a new level of IE.</p>

</p><p>A related thing to do would be to download CheckSUR and use it to find out what it thinks may be wrong.&nbsp; However, since IE9 in W7 is now not supported it will probably be telling you it would like you to have IE11 versions instead of allowing IE9 ones.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do use Windows Update.&nbsp; As you say, since IE 9 is no longer supported, it may be that attempts at trying to install Cumulative updates might fail as I am possibly experiencing with installing some KB items.&nbsp; I will try Cumulative updates as well as CheckSUR
 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The local Microsoft store is presently providing free tuneups for customers.&nbsp; I will pick the brains of&nbsp;the experienced&nbsp;Windows IT reps&nbsp;who may be able to shed more light on my problems as well as discuss how to deal with attempting to deal with&nbsp;updates
 in IE 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have been dealing with&nbsp;Windows since 1990 with a somewhat advanced knowledge of PC programming and hardware.&nbsp; However, when it comes to the Registry, how Windows is programmed, and the subtle&nbsp;updates from one version to another, I am without&nbsp;sufficient
 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the long run, it may be better to upgrade to Window 10 to solve many potential problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Windows 10, I need to continue&nbsp;using Adobe Creative Suites and mocha Pro in custom PCs built to&nbsp;increase rendering speed where RAID and SSD drives are arranged
 to minimize a read and write to the same drive at the same time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After discussing my problem with a Microsoft Windows experienced rep he agreed that I should bring my PC back to let them somehow engineer a fix since I do not have special tools to do so.&nbsp; Anyway, I gave it one more try as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started my PC today to find a page recommending I download and install the upgrade to IE 11.&nbsp; I did this following all the processes noted in the dialog boxes that appear to show&nbsp;the whole installation, then another note&nbsp;'starting programs' following with
 a note to restart Windows.&nbsp; After the restart, I started IE to find I was still at IE9&nbsp;by&nbsp;clicking properties in the pull down menu under Tools as well as right clicking iexplore.exe in programs.&nbsp; After what appeared to be&nbsp;false reporting when trying to install
 KB items, the version and installation reporting may be screwed up, perhaps&nbsp;in the Registry or during the installation.</p>

<p>Nobug, just logic. Fixe Costs for tasks aer not associated to any resource so they will not appear in Resouirce Usage which would explain the difference you mention in your question.</p>

            <p>Right, then I misunderstood the point. I do not have any fixed costs that are not assigned to a resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All costs are stricly assigned to a resource of type "Cost", "Work" or "Material".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually think I have spotted a bug in the calculation, because for one resource the sum is wrong by 2 for a number up to a few hundred thousands total.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another situation when assigning multiple resources to a taks, the sum was wrong. I had to remove the resources and assign them again to get it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anywhere one can send a bug-report to Microsoft for Project 2016? </p>
<p>
</p><p>(If I had not spotted this, our budget for the project I am planning would have become very wrong!)</p>

<p>First of all, is your version of Project fully updated with the latest cumulative update? If not, run Windows Update. Note, if you are using Project Online or a subscription version (i.e. Project 365), it is automatically updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add the Fixed Cost field to the Gantt Chart view. Do any tasks have a value in that field? If so, then that is the reason why the cost in the Gantt chart view is different from the summed up cost from the Resource Usage view.</p>

<p>dognhangphuc,</p>
<p>You're welcome and thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user enters a value in the Cost field, it will be interpreted as a fixed cost. Perhaps at some point you or another user inadvertently entered some values directly into the cost field and then later assigned a resource. The initial entry will be interpreted
 by Project as a fixed cost that will be added to the resource cost. However, only the resource's cost will appear in the Resource Usage view.<br />

            <span>What type of email account are you working on (POP3, IMAP or Exchange server email account)?<br />
Automatically adding conference information can be accomplished by two methods, one through VB script or also through customizing the Outlook Meeting entry form.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And for further assistance on the same you may post your query in the following section of Microsoft Community:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No version of Windows <strong><em>needs </em></strong>an antivirus, however, they are recommended for protection and other security related purposes, of course.
<br />
<br />
In regards to Windows 8, you can either install any 3rd party antivirus of your choosing, or enable Windows Defender -
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21962-windows-defender-turn-off-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21962-windows-defender-turn-off-windows-8-a.html</a></p>
<p>Before enabling Windows Defender, do note that you will need to uninstall any current antivirus you're using. For example, most/if not at all modern day computers/laptops come with a trial antivirus installed. Let's say your HP laptop comes preinstalled
 with McAfee as a trial, you need to uninstall McAfee before attempting to enable Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 and Comcast - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woodrows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 and Comcast</h2>
                    <p>I recently switched to comcast as my as my television and internet provider. &nbsp;Prior to that I had a local phone company as my provider (Surewest) here in northern California. &nbsp;I made the switch and things are working - sort of. &nbsp;I cannot remember how it
 was before exactly but it seems to me that on the left side of my Outlook screen I had one main item titled "Outlook", and under it &nbsp;were things like Inbox, Drafts, sent etc. &nbsp;Now it is not the same and is causing me problems. &nbsp;At least, it doesn't seem to
 be an orthodox setup. &nbsp;Now I have my email account listed above word Outlook. I have, in fact, two email accounts and they are both listed above the word Outlook - as opposed to the main one being a part of or under Outlook. &nbsp;Please see attachment below. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I notice that in my email accounts dialog the bottom area seems to read differently than previously. &nbsp;The location entry ends with a .ost extension. &nbsp;I don't remember it being this way in the past. &nbsp;In short, I think things are setup in my Outlook
 2013 in a way that Outlook 2013 may consider unorthodox. &nbsp;I was told at the time I started using Comcast (by comcast) that there were some problems with Outlook and that things may or may not work. I have learned the hard way in the past that when you don't
 have things setup in what your program thinks is an orthodox way, you've got problems, whether you know it or not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has any advice?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to be so long in responding to your your reply. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, I have things setup correctly in the Microsoft forum to have question replies sent to me automatically, but I never received notice that
 someone had actually responded. &nbsp;I stumbled onto your reply by checking the forum explicitly. Perhaps we could address that problem first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account type is IMAP/SMTP. &nbsp;I am told by Comcast that this is just the way they do things at present, so I guess that explains the .ost extension. &nbsp;I have, if I am explaining it right, 2 email accounts. &nbsp;The two email
 accounts end with .ost extensions. &nbsp;But I also have in the farthest left pane something that may or may not be considered an account but simply labeled "Outlook."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there problems with IMAP/SMTP accounts that cause it to behave differently than .PST accounts? &nbsp;I am used to PST accounts, maybe it's just a "getting used to it problem" on my part, I don't know. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, it appears to me, the Outlook folder is not being used for anything right now, except that I created a number of folders under it in the past (before going to comcast) where I save certain messages. Since Comcast
 at present doesn't do Pop3, maybe I should move the Save folders under on of my email (.ost) accounts and Delete the Outlook folder, or maybe just forget about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have learned the hard way that you need to set things up in the way the program your working with thinks is orthodox. Traditionally, for me, this has meant Pop3, but since Comcast doesn't do Pop3 I guess I don't know
 how to set things up in Outlook in the way it thinks is orthodox using IMAP/SMTP. &nbsp;Is IMAP/SMTP roughly equivalent to Pop3?</p>

            <p>An IMAP mail account has its own set of Folders but by default you will also have the default Outlook set of Folders that contain an Inbox,Sent,Calendar, Tasks, People etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you see is correct, there's nothing untoward about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An IMAP account is a copy of what is on the server, a Pop account, by default downloads all mail to the local PC unless you set the option in account settings to keep a copy on the server</p>

 my drive started to fail and I was able to grab my PST files and was shocked to see that my data was in this OST file.&nbsp; My assumption that Outlook was using PST as the local store.&nbsp; Wrong!&nbsp; Now I have a new drive all setup and Outlook 2013 installed.&nbsp; I moved
 my old PST and OST files onto the new drive.&nbsp; Good news all my PST data is fine, but for some reason I can not access my OST data.&nbsp; As Palcouk said you my be setup fine, but this OST change may not be what you and I expect.&nbsp; Apparently the OST file is locked
 and now because my profiles between the drives are different, my new profile will not access the OST data.&nbsp; This is an intended consequence according to what I have read and so that Exchange mail stores can not be simply copied off of a drive and then read.&nbsp;
 As you pointed out our ISP is not using exchange so I really do not understand why my data is in an OST in the first place.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I am not 100% on these details as I am just starting to dig into why I have this issue and how to get around it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that you should remove your data from the OST file as soon as possible and move it to a PST file so that it can be backed up and recovered, when your drive fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless anyone has another idea.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Reason that your data is in an OST file is because MS changed the data file type that stores IMAP information which has some caveats specific to O'2013 and IMAP accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - To restate what Palcouk mentioned, the OST file is a mirror of what's on the server so whenever&nbsp;the IMAP account is configured, a new OST file will be created and the OST file will contain the same info as found on the server (after the first account
 sync) BUT.........................</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - If the IMAP account is&nbsp;the first account configured in the Outlook profile - it will have folders in its folder tree with the additional description of "This Computer Only" (i.e. Contacts/Calendar folders). If the data in these folders is not backed
 up to a PST file on a regular basis - the data in those folders will be lost if the email account is ever deleted from the Outlook profile.&nbsp;This data is not stored on the server and you cannot open an OST file separately - can only be accessed using the Outlook
 profile/email account specifically used to originally create it. Reconfiguring the same IMAP email account in the same profile will
<strong>NOT</strong> re-use a previously created .OST file.</p>

            <p>Thanks Karl, </p>
<p>
</p><p>My complaints are not with you but with MS on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>#1 - To restate what Palcouk mentioned, the OST file is a mirror of what's on the server so whenever&nbsp;the IMAP account is configured, a new OST file will be created and the OST file will contain the same info as found on the server

<p>
</p><p>But......., in my case I setup outlook to remove emails from the server with in a given period of time, so it seems like I have three conditions of this issue that put me in a no win situation, (Comcast/outook/OST file, Ost files not being portable, and
 removing emails off the server)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When configuring my account, it would have been nice if Outlook would have warned me that my data would be stored in a non recoverable store.&nbsp; To have ost chosen for you in spite of how Outlook has been used in the past seems to be a bit of an oversight.&nbsp;
 When you format a drive it gives you the option of fat or ntfs. Could you imagine the shock if the format command&nbsp;just assumed&nbsp;one or the other and not what you wanted.&nbsp; Now I am going to have to spend $100 to attempt to unlock my emails.&nbsp; Lucky me.&nbsp; Not only
 that, I have to spend the extra time to build up a pst file and get outlook to move all new data to the pst store.&nbsp; Seems like lots of work for what?&nbsp;&nbsp;PST was a good store for what I and many others used&nbsp;it for and ost adds nothing but work, complexity and
 risk that I might loose all my emails. With the promise that if my computer is stolen that my windows account is enough security to keep the contents of my emails safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Am a little unclear about something in regards to you recovering your email data? Do you no longer have access to the email account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one other point of clarification in case it makes a difference, yes Outlook stored email data in a PST file for IMAP accounts in earlier versions but a &lt;new&gt; PST file would always be created any time the email account was configured again which would
 then get sync'd to the server. While that still left the original PST file in place, it still would have been advisable to move "old email data" to a separate PST file for things that you wanted removed from the IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of setting up Outlook to delete emails on the server after a certain period of time, that would have been an option for POP3 accounts and isn't an IMAP option in any Outlook version.</p>

            It is a known bug in 14915.&nbsp; You can probably address the NAS drives with their network&nbsp;addresses.&nbsp; The bug is in network discovery and seems to only affect devices where Linux is running; i.e. routers and such.&nbsp; It is heavily discussed in threads elsewhere
 in this forum so it is a good idea to scan the forum or search it before posting yet another thread on the subject.

<p>I'm just adding to my note above. This has not been a problem until this last update. I should not have said NAS, should have said Router USB3 Storage, Linksys WRT 1900 AC. So just to clarify, I have rolled Bld 14915 back to 14905. Problem is gone so it
 is not a router problem. I have put my update on slow as I don't want to lose my backup hard drive access. And yes, I could just directly use the USB connector to this computer but it pretty much defeats the central storage access to all of my computers. I
 think it should have been noted that my other computers connected while this one, on the 14915 update would not. (I had also checked all the usual suspects in regards Network search, etc., just in case you are wondering, all were correct on the 14915 update.)<br />

            It is a known issue.&nbsp; Network Discovery is broken in 14915.&nbsp; It is discussed in several threads in the forum.&nbsp; You could have still connected using the network address.&nbsp; It does involve the router because the WRT 1900 ACS (which I have), like the WRT 1900
 AC is programmed in Linux.&nbsp; I think all routers and NAS devices are.&nbsp; Linux devices are what are not seen.&nbsp;

<p>Since I'm always curious and within my 10-day reversal period I restored 14905. The connection was restored. I also added the Network Address so when I get updated to 14910 I'll have the connection one way or the other. Thanks and yes, the WRT 1900 is a
 Linux device.<br />

            You will not be upgraded back to the build you left.&nbsp; A rollback is recorded in the registry and WU will not offer the same build again.&nbsp; You will get the current build, 14926.&nbsp; (The issue exists in 14926 also, but it sounds like you are prepared for that.)

            Still not working with build 14926 with a clean install from an iso i created from the esd. With build 14926 I cannot even map to my folders on my network drive. I was able to do that on build 14915.

<h2>            Hotmail&#47;Outlook account is blocked because it suspects someone else is using my account</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For the past week, I have been unable to get access to my emails because hotmail/outlook says my account has been blocked. I have followed the steps that many moderators have provided in previous steps to try and recover the account, however times have
 changed and those steps now no longer work. There is no "I suspect someone is using my account" option to choose from.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have submitted two validation forms, both with as much information as I can put on it and both times it has come back negative by the automated system. I have also spoken to three online agents who have only been able to tell me to post another validation
 questionnaire/form (which I refuse to do for a 3rd time as it will be a waste of time), or to post my issue here (which is now what I am doing).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>May I also add that this is a terrible system. How is this the ONLY way in which I can voice my issue. Why is there no option to speak to someone on the phone?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would appreciate if someone could get back to me really quickly, although I am not holding my hopes high.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<h2>            Sharepoint Download&#47;Upload Throttling</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any insight into the throttling on upload and download to Sharepoint?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason when I try and download a file from Sharepoint I'm getting around 100-200KB/s yet to other download test servers I'm getting around 9.2MB/s which is more in line with the bandwidth capability of our internet link.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latency to the Sharepoint server is roughly 150ms, the other download test was done to a site near the same location.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently running on Office 365 Business Premium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>This isn't due to network congestion, doesn't matter if it's a single file or a bunch at a time. Each download seems to have it's own restriction.

            SP has been proven over and over to be much slower than other services so there's no doubt that they are managing transfer times. That would be understandable if they were honest about it but they continually try to blame other factors.

<p>Hi Evolv,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the steps below to see if there’s any improvement for the speed:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In Internet Explorer, click the gear and select Internet Options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select the Connections tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click the LAN Settings button.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Uncheck the “Automatically detect settings” box.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click OK and OK.&nbsp;</span><span>
</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you use other browsers, is there any difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

            Hi epicbadassgamer,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions Forum!<br />
<br />
May we ask, what model of phone is this? Just to isolate the concern, have you tried using your mobile data connection when accessing the said application? If yes, you can also uninstall the YouTube application and reinstall it back.

            Thanks for the information. What we can suggest you to do is to reset the device itself. You can do this by going to Menu &gt; Settings and Phone &gt; Phone Management &gt; Factory settings. And just to avoid data loss, please create a backup of all your files
 by going to Menu &gt; Applications &gt; File Manager &gt; Options &gt; Back up phone memory.

            I got the exact same problem on a newly reinstalled E72, though the same app runs well on another E72. There is actually no network connection problem as all other apps can access the Internet, the app just stops at the Terms and Conditions page and can't
 be initialised. It seems something changed at the YouTube side hence the app just can't locate the network resources it needs for the first run on the device. As the same app can work on other S60 devices, that means just some configuration information is
 missing on the newly installed device. The most easy way to fix is to copy the app's private data from another known-good device. Assume you have installed the YouTube app in memory card (not phone memory), then you need a computer to access the files stored
 on the phone's memory card. This YouTube app is for S60 device, its private data is stored at E:\Private\2000FBBA, where E is the memory card. Beside the subfolder "res", there are some other files in this folder, see below the example. b

<h2>            Cutover Migration</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings</p>
<p>Started a cutover migration 8 months ago. Most mailboxes synced up fine. Then lead to another and too many end users had old office/xp versions so cutover never took place.</p>
<p>Now I am at a point when I want to finalize this. Nothing has been synced in 6 months and there are many users gone as well as new users in organization now.</p>
<p>Should I delete all users and start a new migration?<br />
&nbsp;Or leave everything as is and start a new migration and everything will sync OK with no issues?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advise</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>If you leave the things there, starting a new batch will give you errors as it detects users which have already existed in Office 365. If there are not many mailboxes been migrated to Office 365, you can consider migrate them using pst files and them remove
 the batch.</p>

<h2>            Reconnect Office 365 to a new account.</h2>
                    How can one completely sign out of the entire Office Application on Win.10? <br />
My company(School) has changed their domain name, and now I'm unable to synchronise, because O365 seems to repeatedly remembering my old mail address.

<p>Hi Weshenbach,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my understanding, you want to sign out of an old Office 365 account and use Office applications with a new Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my understanding is correct, first, let us check whether the new Office 365 account is assigned a valid license. Please go to Office 365 subscriptions page with your new Office 365 account and check whether you have<strong> the latest desktop version
 of Office</strong> license, it is necessary to use Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have that license, please contact your IT department to let them assign one to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have that license, please quit all of your Office applications first and follow the steps below to remove the old Office 365 account credentials.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can I change the frequency of how often OAB is published&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>One of our customers is bothered that membership of dynamic distribution groups takes so long to reflects in the Offline Address Book on his Outlook client. He can ofc download a new OAB but that OAB can be over 24 hours old.</p>

<p>Is there a way, in Exchange Online, to change how often the Offline Address Book is built so he can download a version which is more up to date?</p>

<p>Hi Per-Torben,<br />
<br />
Currently, it is not feasible to change how often the Offline Address Book will update in Exchange Online.<br />
I understand that it could be more convenient if there are options or PowerShell commands to control the frequency of the OAB updating from server side, so given the suggestion, you can submit feedback regarding this feature via the link below:<br />
