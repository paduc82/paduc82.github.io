<h2>            Purchase history </h2>
                    
<p>The purchase history in account management completely sucks! I'm trying to view purchases from last and even though the stupid thing gives me the option to go back to 2012, it'll only go back to August of this year. What good is giving someone the option
 when it's worthless?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sorry for the issue you are having. Can you try to retrieve your purchase history from Microsoft's billing site:
<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Transaction?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
commerce.microsoft.com/.../Transaction</a> </p>
<p>At times if you have ever changed Microsoft Accounts that were linked with your Xbox Profile, those don't always transfer to the new Microsoft Account as most tings are Microsoft Account locked. If you need to retrieve from a certain date or from even further
 back and still are not able to get to that specific year. Xbox Billing Support would be able to pull all that information for you. You can chat with Xbox Support anytime here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#3:0:2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a>
</p>
<p>Happy Gaming! :)</p>

<p>Hey Knucklehead......just a suggestion, try using a different browser if you are trying to see the transactions on your account. When I checked on my account using Google Chrome I didn't get any information, but when I opened it on Internet Explorer I was
 able to see my transactions and change the date range. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 annoyances after upgrade from Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wayno-san  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 annoyances after upgrade from Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my HP Omni 10 tablet from Windows 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; Almost immediately I've been regretting it and am considering reverting to 8.1 but want to see if any of these can be addressed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Keeps asking me for password after wakeup from sleep even though I have that option set to "No".&nbsp; I just want a password prompt if I manually lock or upon boot-up.&nbsp; I do not want to use a PIN.. I just want it to work properly like it did in past Windows
 versions. &nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How do I get Metro IE back?&nbsp; Edge performance is terrible (along with all other non-tablet optimized browsers that I've tried like Firefox and Chrome) and nothing worked as well as Metro IE in tablet mode.&nbsp; I can get IE running but not in the tablet-friendly
 Metro mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tons of other annoyances with this new Windows version but the others have already been reported.</p>

            <p>I presently have the tablet set to NOT ask me for a password when it comes out of sleep as per the steps in

Rajeshwari_Patil</a> post.&nbsp; If I use the power button to put the tablet to sleep, then the login screen will appear after a short period of time asking me to type in my password again.&nbsp; If I leave the tablet screen on and let it enter sleep itself it takes
 a much longer time (I haven't fully quantified it but am running some tests) before it forces me to re-enter my password.&nbsp; I believe this to be a bug with Windows 10.&nbsp; I tried both Method 1 (no problems detected) and Method 2 (not relevant) but still the problem
 persists.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's a shame that Metro IE was eliminated since it was by far the best browser for tablet operation and the only version of IE that I actually bothered to use for any period of time.&nbsp;

            <p>OK, I did some more testing and it appears that the password issue likely only occurs if the power button (which is set to put the tablet to sleep, just like the timeout) is used to put the tablet to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I let the tablet timeout and after 12+ hours I turned it on and there was no login window.&nbsp; If I use the power button to put the tablet to sleep, even if the tablet is off for a short period of time, I get the login window.</p>

            Confirmed that login only appears when sleep is entered using the power button, and not via timeout.&nbsp; Still looking for a solution to fix that.&nbsp;

<h2>            Gears of War 2</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently had my status reset to nothing and don't know why or how.&nbsp; I was ranked somewhere in the high 50s and had at least 950 matches towards the "Party like it's 1999" achievement.&nbsp; Now, the achievements that I had already earned are still in place,
 but it's racking up the score as if they weren't, and the 1999 match thing was reset to zero.&nbsp; Also I'm constantly being removed by hosts, like 1 outta every 3 matches.&nbsp; Who is the host, one of the players?&nbsp; An unseen entity?&nbsp; Why do hosts remove players?&nbsp;
 If one of the players is the host, how do I host a match?&nbsp; I sure don't see the option for it.&nbsp; If someone knows a way to recover my stats, that would be wizard.</p>

<h2>            Full version of a game keeps reverting to the demo version.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently downloaded a demo and later that day the full version of the game was downloaded on another profile on my xbox 360. I deleted the demo game since I no longer needed it. When I go into my profile the game will initially show up as the full version,
 but once I open the game it reverts to the demo version. All the other games on the console are able to be played on all profiles accept this one game. how do I remove this Demo for good so that I can play the full version on all profiles besides just the
 profile it was downloaded on?</p>

<p>To solve this issue you should delete the profile where the demo was downloaded, clear the console cache and download the profile again. Follow the step by step instructions</p>
<p>a) To delete your profile:</p>
<p>Go to settings and select System.</p>
<p>Select Storage.</p>
<p>If you don’t connect any external storage devices to your console, select Hard Drive. If you do use external storage, instead select All Devices.</p>
<p>Select Profiles.</p>
<p>The Profiles option is highlighted on the All Devices screen. </p>
<p>Select the profile that you want to delete.</p>
<p>Select Delete.</p>
<p>The Delete option is highlighted on a sample profile screen. </p>
<p>Select one of the following:</p>
<p>Delete Profile Only - This deletes the profile but leaves saved games and achievements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>b) To clear your console cache:</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Storage.</p>
<p>The Storage category is highlighted on the System Settings screen. </p>
<p>Highlight but don’t select a storage device, and then press Y on your controller for Device Options.</p>
<p>Note It doesn't matter which storage device you choose. This clears the cache for all storage devices.</p>
<p>'Hard Drive' is highlighted on the Storage Devices screen. </p>
<p>On the Device Options screen, select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>The 'Clear System Cache' option is highlighted on the Device Options screen. </p>
<p>When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>Note When you’ve successfully cleared the system cache, you’ll return to the Storage Devices screen. You can then press the Guide button on the controller and return to Xbox Home.</p>
<p>c) To download your profile</p>
<p>Press the Guide button &nbsp;on your controller.</p>
<p>Select Download Profile.</p>
<p>Note Not seeing Download Profile? This means that you’re signed in under another profile. Press the X button &nbsp;on your controller to sign out, confirm, and then select Download Profile.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Download Profile screen, select Download Profile.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 ‘Download Profile’ screen showing the ‘Download Profile’ option highlighted.
</p>
<p>Enter the email address of the Microsoft account that’s associated with your Xbox profile. If you don’t know it, see the Lost Account Solution.</p>
<p>Enter your Microsoft account password. If you’ve forgotten it, you’ll need to reset your password.</p>
<p>Note If you have a child account, your parent’s Microsoft account information is required to download your Xbox profile on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>If you use external storage on your console, select the storage device on which you want to save your Xbox profile. If you don’t use external storage, your Xbox profile will begin downloading.</p>
<p>After you download your Xbox profile, you’ll be asked if you want the console to remember your password.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 ‘Download Profile’ screen showing the ‘Remember Password’ option highlighted.</p>
<p>If you want to sign in without being prompted for a password each time, select the Remember Password option.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when you choose this option, anyone who uses your console can sign in as you and use your account information. This includes any credit card information you might have saved.</p>
<p>Leave the Remember Password option unchecked if you want the console to require a password to sign in to your account. This is a good idea if others in your home can easily access your console, or if you downloaded your Xbox profile at a friend’s house.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! </p>

    <title>Surface 2 - Backlight bleed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vernon jenner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 2 - Backlight bleed</h2>
                    <p>I've had my S2 for about eight weeks and absolutely love it. Up until now I've only really used it productivity work (Word, Excel projects mainly). However, with that now pretty much out of the way I've started to "play" around a bit more with its other
 features. I've downloaded a few films / TV programmes, and its these that have literally drawn my attention to some highly annoying bleeding. From what I've read bleeding issues are not uncommon on the S2, but as much as I try to accept what I'm seeing as
 being the "norm", it's annoying the&nbsp;**** out of me, and when watching dark scenes I can't help but be drawn to it. I've attached a couple of screenshots (all underexposed by two stops to try and counter the fact that the screen is so dark, which would otherwise
 result in overexposure) so as to give a flavour for what I'm seeing. Do you think this is acceptable or do you feel I'm in my rights to ask for an exchange? Furthermore, in a couple of areas around the screen there seems to be some flex below the glass, and
 occasionally when I touch the frame (depending on the background/colour) I see ripple effects on the screen. My wife and son have considerably cheaper tablets (Samsung) and don't seem to suffer any of these problems. Views/insights would be appreciated.</p>

            My exchange surface 2 has back bleed at the same spot. As&nbsp;did my previous one. That one was more noticeable, nearly as much as yours.&nbsp;The screen on the replacemen is much better, better colors, then my previous one so I decided to&nbsp;keep it. I think its
 something that all surface 2 have, some more then the other. Next to&nbsp;nearly all surface 2s having loose power and audio buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine itself is wonderful, build quality not so much, especially not for this price range!

            <p>Hi Kozyra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may be due to any of the service that is still being used by the device. I would suggest you to turn off the RT Device completely and then try to disconnect and check if it helps. When you turn off the Device all the services will be turned off,
 and this will help you in this situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further reference, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response, perhaps I didn't make it clear, I am using windows 8.1 on my HP pc and storage spaces will not let me remove two drives. I am not using RT. Is ther a way to get storage spaces to force remove a drive?</p>
<p><br />

<h3> imnotevenjewish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chopper Gunner Glitch</h2>
                    
<p>I hope this thread doesn't get deleted since i'm posting a YT clip. It's not gameplay, but just proof of a glitch i encountered a few minutes ago. It might be one of those 'under very specific circumstances' that treyarch talks about in their update lists
 because i got killed at the same i got in the heli. I get a care package and switch it and get a chopper gunner. Awesome! The guy opens the door and i notice I'm NOT EVEN FACING THE MAP and the heli is jumping up and down. This goes on for a few seconds and
 i finally start seeing some bad guys. But I'm so far away i can't even shoot anyone. So far off that the free roam camera doesn't even reach. Then i go back to facing the opposite direction of the map and jumping up and down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, a waste of a CG.&nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Inl9fdGPBr8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit: can't figure out how to lazy link with the new forum</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>This security update is causing problems. &nbsp;It will not download and stops at 95% hanging Win Update so none of the other patches are installed and there are a few!</p>
<p>I have tried numerous retries, and tried the standalone installer for it, which returns a 0x800706be error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have run on the system</p>
<p>DISM &nbsp;........./restorehealth &nbsp;- No issues found</p>
<p>SFC /scannow - No issues found</p>
<p>The trouble shooters for BITS and Win Update - No issues found</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is now very sluggish and not happy, nor am I</p>
<p>This seems to be a general problem, so could Microsoft please pull the update to allow the others to install. &nbsp;Fix it, then offer it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a work around as I have tried hiding the update but it still pops up and knackers the other installations?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Symon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would help if you could answer these questions in order to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What error message do you receive when you trying accessing any websites?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried connecting the router to the computer using a wire to check if the issue persists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few steps you may try and let us know the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Check the IP address set on the computer and try to ping the Router IP address as well as website and check if there is a connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In the Start search box, type cmd.exe, right click on it and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>- Type <strong>ipconfig /all&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><em><strong>(</strong>This will show the IP address set on the computer<strong>)</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>If the IP address starts with 169.254.xxx.xxx, then you will not be able to connect to Internet. This IP address is called as APIPA.
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>APIPA - Automatic Private IP Addressing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><strong>APIPA</strong> is a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration protocol) failover mechanism for local networks. With APIPA, DHCP clients can obtain IP addresses when DHCP servers are non-functional. APIPA exists in all modern versions of Windows.<br />
</p>
<p>When a DHCP server fails, APIPA allocates IP addresses in the private range 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254. Clients verify their address is unique on the network using ARP&nbsp; (Address resolution Protocol). When the DHCP server is again able to service requests,
 clients update their addresses automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In APIPA, all devices use the default network mask 255.255.0.0 and all reside on the same
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Try the following commands one after the other in the command prompt.</p>
<p><strong>netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt<br />
netsh winsock reset<br />
ipconfig /registerdns<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
ipconfig /release</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer and then check if you are able to connect to the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, manually assign a IP address for the Wireless network and then try to ping the Router to check if there is proper connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Manually assign a IP address for the Wireless network card and then try to ping the IP address of the Router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Press Windows key and the R key and type NCPA.CPL</p>
<p>- Right click on the Wireless network that you use and select Properties.</p>
<p>- Highlight or select Internet Protocol version 4 and click on Properties.</p>
<p>- Select Use the Following IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Router IP address is 192.168.1.1 then try to assign 192.168.1.2 and the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and press enter.</p>
<p>- Close the Network properties window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Open the Command Prompt and type ping 127.0.0.1 and press enter.</p>
<p>- Type ping 192.168.1.1 and press enter</p>
<p>- Type ping 192.168.1.2 and press enter.</p>
<p>- Type ping <a href="http://www.bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.bing.com</a> and press enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the packets sent are equal to the packets received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">This is what's different:</span><br />

In a recent interview with VG247, <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Tim-Willits-Doom-3-BFG-Edition-FPS-PC-Gaming,17415.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Tim Willits said that Doom 3 BFG Edition isn't merely a re-release of something old with added content</a>: it's a complete overhaul of the 2004 slow-paced survival horror shooter. Willits said the studio has returned to its roots with this release, cranking
 up the action so it's not such a gloomy crawl-fest.</p>
<p><br />
Of course, there's more to the BFG Edition than cranking up the action. <strong>Levels have been re-designed to match the pace</strong>, and the team has thrown in
<strong>new textures</strong> to bring the game up to speed on current consoles. Other goodies include
<strong>new lighting mechanics</strong>, the <strong>new eight-mission chapter</strong> called "Lost Mission," and
<strong>bits of Rage tech thrown into the mix.</strong></p>
<p><br />
"It’s not just <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Tim-Willits-Doom-3-BFG-Edition-FPS-PC-Gaming,17415.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Doom</span></span></a> 3 – that’s what we’re keen to make sure everybody knows," Willits said.
<strong>"We’re doing more with Doom 3 BFG than just re-releasing the original. We’ve actually put a heck of a lot of Rage tech into the Doom 3 engine to kind of modernize the game."</strong></p>
<p><br />
As an example, <strong>the team tossed in the Rage input control and checkpoints. They also updated the lighting so it's brighter throughout the game, changed the annoying
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Tim-Willits-Doom-3-BFG-Edition-FPS-PC-Gaming,17415.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>flashlight</span></span></a>, tweaked the ammo, and even implemented the Rage network layer to make it run faster at low latency.</strong> There's also 3D support, and multi-display
 support for the PC platform.</p>
<p><strong><br />
"We went through every single level of the original and things that were really frustrating or not fun, we made them more enjoyable.</strong> So it is really kind of cool for us – especially as we all love the Doom franchise – to go back and rework the game
 in such a way," he added.</p>
<p><br />
Doom 3 BFG Edition has enough small changes to essentially re-introduce the franchise to old and new fans alike. "Everyone’s heard of Doom, but you’d be surprised at just how many people haven’t actually played it," he said.</p>
<p><br />
That said, the interview went on to talk about tweaking the map designs. He pointed out one section in the Alpha Labs that simply had to go because it was incredibly...
<em>not fun</em>. "There was this part where you walk up these stairs, and the stairs fall apart behind you and Imps spawn in front of you," he said. "When we were playing through that earlier this year we were like, 'this is not fun right here…this was a bad
 idea.'"</p>
<p><br />
"We grabbed our young designers and said, 'young designer, this is a bad design right here. How do you think we can fix it?’ and so we fixed it," he added. "You know it’s kind of funny, because most of the guys who worked on Doom 3 originally, they still work
 there."</p>
<p><br />
"One of the guys wanted to go back and up-rez and make the characters look better, and a texture artist said, ‘you know, I never liked those textures, can I go back and fix them?’ and we said ‘sure, go ahead, knock yourself out and fix them up,'" he said.</p>
<p><br />
Sounds like Doom 3 BFG Edition will be an entirely new experience when it launches on October 16. To read the full interview with Willits,

<p>There are aspects as well like PDA and Video Disc locations that are different than they were on the original Xbox. &nbsp;The only thing that sucks about it is like before all people do on Multiplayer is spawn camp which takes alot of the fun of that aspect of
 the game out of it for me. &nbsp;Over all what little of it I have gotten to play of all three Doom titles on the disc I have enjoyed so far. &nbsp;Wish they had multiplayer that was populated for Doom and Doom 2 so I could at least attempt to get the multiplayer achievements
 on those but still like being able to experience the nostalgia of the good old days when games of this nature were not ridden with perks and power ups and took a greater degree of skill.</p>

<p>The original Doom multiplayer is very disappointing on XBLA. The net coding is incredibly bad. Rarely do I ever join a server that runs smooth. It's virtually unplayable! And it's annoying because I've spent an hour in deathmatch and got 50 frags. No achievement.
 Why? Because it was not a 'ranked match'. At least D3 multiplayer fairs better! It's actually a heck of a lot of fun to play!</p>

<p>I was just stating that it would be nice for Doom 1 and 2 multiplayer to be active so I could get the multiplayer achievements. &nbsp;I love the fact that they revamped the whole doom series for 360 because I no longer have a computer capable of running Doom

<p>It's just weapons like the shotgun and chaingun aren't very accurate. Shooting an imp super close with a shotgun will take him out with one shot. Multiplayer though is another issue! Ironically the best weapon there is, is the standard machine gun. I've
 tried using the double barreled shotgun but it's virtually useless for me. </p>

<p>All you need to do is place your targetting reticule over the enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will go red when you've got a "shot".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is the guys are pretty quick and scurry about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're firing in a panic and not hitting them.</p>

            Definitely to the Baulder's Gate. I played that for hours back when it was on Gamecube! Although there are so many dungeon RPG's that would be fun to have BC like Divinity: Original Sin?

<p>The developers of Whacked, Presto Games went defunct in 2002. Not sure if the publisher of the game has the licence rights to it. Microsoft Game Studios (now Xbox Game Studios) so that raises a possibility that it wont be able to come to BC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance 2&nbsp; the developer,&nbsp; Black Isle Studios also went defunct in 2003, the publisher,&nbsp; Interplay Entertainment however is still operating.&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="message-user-info-affiliations-list">
    </ul>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are experiencing issue while shutting down the computer. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict, corruption in the apps or virus infection.
</span></span><span><span><span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. What is the complete error message you get?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Try to check the processes status through the Task Manager</strong> this might help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For information refer to this Microsoft article and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:<br />
<br />
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </span>

<p>

</span></strong><span>and check if the issue persists. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong>&nbsp;appear
 in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue does not appear in safe mode, there could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<strong>clean boot</strong>". A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I realize the inconvenience that you facing in accessing file and will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred if the files are corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1: Run SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>on your PC to determine the presence of corrupted files or folder.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a

<p>Original title: <span>error 2481__</span></p>
<p>Apparently my ups my uninterupptible power supply is not possible to restart from services under administrative tool in control panel as error 2481 and as far as I understand is because the ups is apparently not configured and although I have a manual I
 can't see unless I do a run command how to see if I can get it up and running or configured by the instruction manual as it supposedly says maybe I am overlooking something or my setting for charging up my battery. As I always have to keep plugged into power
 and light goes out after a little always and doesn't seem to be charging the battery onboard my dell inspiron 6400</p>

<p><span>Hi gct_t1000,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Was your UPS configured correctly before you started getting this error?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You receive this error message “Error 2481: The UPS service is not configured correctly” because the UPS service doesn't know which UPS to use.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to re-configure it correctly. Perform the following steps to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps to configure the UPS</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; Click on Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to Power options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 UPS tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Pick
 the manufacturer you want to configure the UPS with.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If your model isn't listed and not fully compatible
 with a listed one, then you’ve to manually configure the UPS by looking at the manual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you find difficulty&nbsp;configuring the UPS to work for your computer, contact the manufacturer who can help you with the configuration of UPS.</span></p>
