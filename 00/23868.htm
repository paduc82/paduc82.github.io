 some files and to have a common storage location. To learn more about OneDrive sharing files, you may check out this

            Dear MAURINERITTGERS-MIGNON ,<br /><br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.<br /><br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users. They also malform their addresses, which hides their domain, but you can still check it in message source.<br /><br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!<br /><br />There are couple of ways to d

<p>I've got the same problem!<br />
<br />
Basically&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">here's what these malicious spammers do! Same spammer different domain but it starts with a from@ This gives me clues
 that it is that same lifeless idiot that continues on and on with different domains Happy Dating &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, Bitcoin &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, Message from your new match &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, Bitcoin &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, Bitcoin &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, Isabelle
 &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;, etc, etc </span><br />
Ironically this is the same person that spams with @<span>departmentusa.club !!! How do I know this? For a period of days I had spams with&nbsp;</span>@<span>departmentusa.club as a domain. Blocking
 it makes no difference as the spammer will change his domain.<br />
<br />
So for a period of days I started getting spam with from@ the domain keeps changing so each time you try to block they can continue with different sets of domains. I should be able to block from@ but alas, this isn't possible.<br />
<br />
After they had given up with from@ now they have started with&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">-Georgia-</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">&nbsp;&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">Georgia-</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">&nbsp;&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">Bitcoin</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">&nbsp;&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">Client

 etc.</span><br />
 their database.<br />
<br />
It is futile to unsubscribe, it just never works. Even if you don't receive the emails from those so called unsubscribed emails. This same person will use different domains to make it look like it is a new spammer. In reality the source of the spammer is the
 same. The moment this idiot gets arrested and sent to jail or can die from a car crash will be the day the spam will go away.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">Used to have this problem for around 3-5 years with my Yahoo email, Viagra junk email every single day! Eventually it stopped
 happening.<br />
</span>In my Gmail account this also once happened, it was in fact worse had like 900+ emails in my junk in approximately a month and on average 300 emails in a week. I deleted my Gmail account. Fortunately Google let you individually delete the Gmail account
 and keep your google account. But Microsoft don't let you delete just your email, you are forced to delete the entire MS account. So you will lose Xbox Live, Skype, Microsoft Office subscriptions, etc. It is a terrible system.<br />
<br />
I'm in the process of changing my primary email and abandoning my hotmail email service after 15 years. Even though I only get around 5-30 emails in my junk mail every day, it is still a nuisance.</p>

<h3> bleak morn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I import an audio file as a &#34;Recording&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    I often record audio with the "Record Audio" feature of OneNote.<br />
<br />
Today I used the "Voice Recorder" app to record some audio, then tried to add it to a Note.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this didn't have the expected result.&nbsp; I wasn't able to play the file via the "Recording" audio controls - clicking on the embedded recording played the file in Groove.<br />
<br />
What I wanted to do was to be able to add the recording to OneNote as if I had recorded it in OneNote, then take notes as I listened to the recording so that they would be time synched to the audio I was listening to.

            Hi <strong>Bleak</strong>,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since the said audio was recorded from a different application, this will not be played when using OneNote. The file type of the audio is possibly incompatible and can't be supported with the record audio features in OneNote app. I'd suggest using the

            When I tried recording with the OneNote mobile app, it stopped recording after about 30 seconds and said it needed to conserve space.&nbsp; The phone had plenty of free space on both on-board memory and the storage card.<br />
<br />
Also, down-side with the app is that you can't interact with notes while recording is taking place.&nbsp; Kind of worthless for meetings. :(

            Sound stopped about a week ago.<br />
Happened once before and I finally got it on again but don't remember how.&nbsp; <br />
I think it was just switching something from "off" to "on" but not sure.<br />
Have tried Sound settings and troubleshooting.<br />
No error message.<br />

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, it shows that the LogMeIn tool is not working properly. This may happen due to Compatibility issues or might be an issue with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you to troubleshoot the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead with the following instructions and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Try the website in Compatibility view</strong> and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refer this link</strong> to turn on compatibility view:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10</a></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Try to reset Internet Explorer</strong> and check</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press Windows logo + R to open the Run dialog box. <br />
b) Type inetcpl.cpl in the run dialog box, press Enter. <br />
c) Now click the advanced tab and then click Reset. <br />
d) Click Apply and then OK. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Disclaimer: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also
 reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refer this link</strong>:</p>

<p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please revert for any clarification on this or any Windows issue. We will be glad to assist you.<br />

            <p>Hi Thanks,</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>compatibility view, no luck</li><li>reset IE, reboot&nbsp;no luck</li><li>reset IE, reboot,&nbsp;compatibility view, no luck</li><li>tried both IE desktop and IE app</li></ul>
<p>On my desktop computer, when I launch a remote computer, Logmein.com downloads a file "setting up computer" (so fast I cant read it). My Surface RT does not download the active X file, or state "setting up your computer" so that when I am logged into the
 clients computer everything "looks" fine, but if I even try to type a letter into a text file on the remote desktop, the keystrokes are ignored, if I click the mouse it re-draws the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that Surface RT is not asking for or allowing the Active X component to download... I'm guessing here, I really don't have a clue...

<h3> pawbmw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Sync</h2>
                    
<p>Been using Active sync for years. Got a new HTC Mogul with WM6. Now it takes 5 to 30 minutes to sync. It will take 3 or 4 minutes even if there have been no changes to either the PC or the Mogul - in other words everything
 is in sync - yet it will take 3 or 4 minutes to tell me so. This is intolerable! Anyone know a fix?</p>

            I'm sorry to say that I don't have a fix but I suffer with you. I have the same kind of problem.<br />
I've got an HTC TyTN and it came with WM5. No problems at all with ActiveSync.<br />
But since I updated to WM6 I too experience really slow syncinh through ActiveSync.<br />
<br />
On a side note, have you tried syncing with exchange through 3G or WLAN?<br />
It's lightning fast compared to ActiveSync syncing through cable...<br />
<br />
Get back to me so I know if it's the same for you!<br />

<p>Some have found that a&nbsp;slow synchronization has been caused by a large number of blank files in \Windows\Temp on your Windows Mobile.

<p>Check to see and if you do,&nbsp;after a&nbsp;soft reset,you should be able to safely delete these files.&nbsp;</p>

            I didn't even have a "Temp" directory under the "Windows" directory. However I have a "Temp" directory in the device root...<br />
Wasn't much in it though. Like 4 files or something. Didn't do anything to delete them. Sync is still slow.

            <p>Hi Gurjit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, can you try the followings and check the results? </p>
<p>1. As a SharePoint administrator, turn on the custom scripts for the tenant following the article:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn scripting capabilities on or off</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Add the affected site as a trusted site in the IE browser. <span>&nbsp;</span>Follow these steps:<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>a. Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Internet Explorer, and then, in the list of results, click Internet Explorer.&nbsp;<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>b. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet options.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>c. Click the Security tab.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>d. Now click on Trusted sites and then click on the sites button.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>e. Enter the Website URL and click on Add.<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span>f. When you are finished, click on Close.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp; </span>Turn off the firewall/proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Check if other user can open site with their account on their own computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p>Best way to fix your&nbsp; N97 is to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do it YOURSELF: Quick fix guide</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>put the phone down on a table and find your self a snack and a HAMMER, open your snack&nbsp; and take a bite, Now this is where the fix begin, hold the hammer above the N97 and then lift it up about 0.5metre then swing it ontop of the N97. Voila!! Once you've
 done so, your N97 problems are now fixed forever. <i>😃</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be warned, it will only worked once, as you can perminantly put it to off mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.<br />
<br />
1. What is the exact and complete error message you get?<br />
2. Did you install all the pending updates?<br />
3. What happens when you try to install KB2267602?<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Method 1: Check the System Date and Time on your computer.</span></strong></span></p>

d. Click <strong><span>Apply </span></strong>and
<strong><span>Ok </span></strong>to save the date and time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Method 2: Run the Windows Update troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may also run the fixit “Windows Update troubleshooter “from the article below and check if that helps.

            <p>Which method of deploying prf-files are you using?</p>
<p><br />
Registry read/access is always required for any user (most often restricted to only the user hive of course). Restricting access to Registry Editor doesn't play a role here unless you are doing user-level reg-file imports to set the necessary keys rather than
 deploying the prf-file or setting the keys via Group Policy Preferences.</p>

<h3> laura43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flight Mode in WM6.5</h2>
                    
<p>I've just transitioned to the LG GM750, and am choosing not to use the LG skins, preferring the Home Screen Customiser available at WM Marketplace.&nbsp; But I now can't find a flight mode switch ... seems I have to go into wireless manager and turn everything
 off which is a pain because I generally keep wifi off, and when I turn wireless back on, wifi comes on too ... and I can't find a widget to act as a flight mode switch anywhere.</p>
<p>Am I missing something easy, or is this right?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

<p>Different manufacturers of windows phones provide different options on the phones. For instance, I have an HTC Touch Diamond2, which allows me to press &amp; hold the call end button to turn on or turn off flight mode.&nbsp; On another phone I have - the HP IPAQ
 Glisten - there's no way for me to switch to flight mode except by going through the wireless manager (the way you've described).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make things easier for me, I've installed a profile manager to the Glisten called<a href="http://www.sbsh.net/products/windows_mobile_pocket_pc/phoneweaver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> PhoneWeaver</a> .&nbsp; PhoneWeaver lets me set up lots of different profiles on the device to handle
 and automate many of the different notification, ringing, communication scenarios I use on my phone.&nbsp; Some of the profiles I've set up are automatic, based on calendar entries or my known schedule (i.e., turn off ringer after 11:00pm/turn ringer on at 7:00am).&nbsp;
 Once nice thing about PhoneWeaver is that it lets me put a small icon on the top of the screen.&nbsp; When I tap that icon, I can select the profile I want to use at that time.&nbsp; I've got a profile set up, called Flight Mode.&nbsp; Selecting that profile turns off WIFI,
 Bluetooth, and the Phone.&nbsp; Then I've got another profile that just turns on the phone.</p>
<p>I'm using Phone Weaver on the HP IPAQ Glisten, but you might also want to check out<a href="http://www.pocketmax.net/phoneAlarm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone Alarm</a> - it's another great profile manager that I've used in the past.</p>
