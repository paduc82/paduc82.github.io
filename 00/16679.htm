<h2>            Wrong font size in composition pane of Outlook 16</h2>
                    When composing a new message or replying, the displayed font size is much smaller than the one specified through OPTIONS &gt; MAIL&gt; stationery and fonts.

<p>The problem seems to have corrected itself as mysteriously as it was created. I held back to reply for a few days just to make sure that the problem was "gone for good". I really appreciate your efforts to help me resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>            How to fix error&#58; The operation could not be completed because of dialog or database engine failure.</h2>
                    We have some mail merges set up in Word that connect back with ODBC to an IBM iseries database.&nbsp; It has worked great for years now.&nbsp; Starting this week, we cannot run the mail merges.&nbsp; When you open the word document and tell it to run the SQL statement,
 it comes back "The operation could not be completed because of dialog or database engine failure. Please try again later. "&nbsp; We have one laptop that it works on, but no other laptop, desktop, or terminal server user can run it.&nbsp; The one that can run it is
 the creator of the mail merge, but if we sign in as him to the terminal server, it doesn't work there.&nbsp;The issue is in 2003 and 2007 word.&nbsp;I am clueless.&nbsp; I have tried all the MDAC updates and registering...none of that works.&nbsp; Anyone have any suggestions?

<p>1. It's always worth checking that you can get the data from a particular source using Excel and MS Query - it can help verify that the DSN is OK, that the Query is valid, and that the users still have access to the relevant data.</p>
<p>2. Can you get the following information, if necessary by opening the Word document on the mail merge creator's machine (i.e. so the document connects to the data source correctly), going into the VBA Editor, enabling the Immediate window (e.g. via the View
 menu), and entering the following commands:</p>
<p>?activedocument.mailmerge.datasource.name</p>
<p>?activedocument.mailmerge.datasource.connectstring</p>
<p>?activedocument.mailmerge.datasource.querystring</p>
<p>2. If it's an ODBC connection, connectstring should either start like this:</p>
<p>DSN=</p>
<p>or like this:</p>
<p>FILEDSN=</p>
<p>3. If it starts with "DSN=", you need to ensure that a machine DSN ("user" or "system" DSN) with the specified name is visible from each machine that needs to open the data source. A user DSN is per-user on a particular machine, and a system DSN is for the
 machine. I don't know exactly how that translates into a Terminal Server environment, but I would guess that everyone shares a single set of System DSNs in that case. If so, and if one has been deleted or altered in some way, the connection wouldn't work,
 but it might from the developer's PC if they have a DSN with the correct name.</p>
<p>4. If it starts with FILEDSN=, you need to ensure that the specified file exists and is accessible to all the users.</p>
<p>5. Either way, you may also need to verify that</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;a. the DRIVER specified in the DSN has exactly the same name as the driver actually present on the machine, as shown in the ODBC Administrator</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;b. the rest of the DSN is correct (that may not be easy to check, and I would leave it till last)</p>
<p>6. Verify that the querystring is correct and that the users have access to the relevant data.</p>
<p>Not sure I can think of anything beyond that, other than the obvious question about "what changes have been applied to your systems?"</p>

<h2>            Access to Outlook and Microsoft Account barred</h2>
                    I've paid for both Office 365 lifetime and yearly package (as first would not load). But access to my Outlook email is being denied and I never have been able to access Office. Microsoft are crooks in my book. I've tried and tried to get help with this
 problem since November 2018. They are keen to take your money but not keen to provide a service. Since I paid for first Office with credit card both my&nbsp; bank details and phone no are connected to account. Yet, still I am barred. I would like a refund! Any
 ideas of how to go about this? Take Microsoft to Small Claims Court maybe? I'd also like to be able to have access to my account, in my name.

<h2>            Discrepancies between the email date&#160;displayed in the Inbox, and the date displayed in the email itself</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I clean-up my mailbox, I find a lot of emails in the&nbsp;inbox or other directories dated "06-DEC-05" which most likely is a date when I had changed of PC and migrated data with an Outlook of that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that a whole bunch of emails are with this "06-DEC-05".</p>
<p>However, when opening the email, or watching it in the reading pane, the actual date of the email can be any date before that. E.g. "22-OCT-03" or&nbsp;"21-JAN-00", etc. -- As if any email prior "06-DEC-05" were 're-dated' at that last date ; as if 2 different
 fields were holding the email date, one for&nbsp;displaying in the box (inbox, sent items, etc. with "06-DEC-05") and one for the email itself, the actual real date&nbsp;("22-OCT-03" or&nbsp;"21-JAN-00")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone would have an idea of the 'why' of this discrepancy, and the 'how' to re-align the 'box' date with the actual real email date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I know my question is strange since all these will end in garbage or archive, but I happened recently to have to retrieve old emails from that time...&nbsp;and not having the right date has been a pain in my research)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for any suggestions</p>

</p><blockquote>What version of Outlook are you using? </blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop outlook is the one from Office 365 - current version is 1701 (Build 7766.2047) slow ring.</p>
<p>Mobile version is the latest available (fast ring).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per these emails dated "06-DEC-05" with the date discrepancy, I had seen some of them a few years ago but did not pay further attention. That's why I believe this discrepancy has been probably created while changing PC or after a crash at that time or&nbsp;something
 alike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about the Outlook database (fields name, etc.) -&nbsp;if I had this knowledge, I guess I'd&nbsp;make a copy of the actual real email date field to the "displayed" field.</p>
<p>Unless there is a program / routine that would do&nbsp;the job in any other&nbsp;way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank-you!</p>

    <title>Mouse Laser Pointer in PowerPoint Presenter View causes erratic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henniemouton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Laser Pointer in PowerPoint Presenter View causes erratic problems</h2>
                    <p>I can get the Mouse Laser Pointer to function properly when a presentation is&nbsp;NOT done in the Presenter View mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But in the Presenter View mode the display of the Laser dot is erratic, it disappears after a few seconds, and PowerPoint has to struggle for about 10 seconds after this to respond normally again to any command.
</p>
<p>I've chatted to the Microsoft experts (3 of them, the last one even controlled my computer remotely) but no-one could solve the problem.
</p>
<p>So my opinion is that this Laser Pointer feature is far from working in Office 365 under Windows 10.
</p>
<p>Or does anyone have a solution? </p>

            <p>Thanks Suvarna for the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running as administrator did not seem to change anything.</p>
<p>I right clicked on the PowerPoint shortcut -- the only place where I could find "Run as administrator" of PowerPoint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "disable hardware graphics acceleration", "disable slide show hardware graphics acceleration" and even both simultaneously.</p>
<p>It improved the situation slightly by&nbsp;stopping the pointer of disappearing and having erratic movements, but when wanting to exit the laser pointer, again more than 10 seconds freezing happens.
</p>
<p>So it is still totally unfeasible to use. </p>
<p>I think Microsoft has a bug to fix here. </p>
<p>And it is important -- I'm pretty sure I'm not the only lecturer being frustrated by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I saw that the "pen" seems to work quite well -- consistent, no retarded exits etc.
</p>
<p>I'm just not sure whether the small dot of the pen (before drawing anything), would be visible on the venue screen.
</p>
<p>This I will only see tomorrow with more than 100 students watching. </p>
        </p>

<p>Don't misunderstand I'm not saying that you are not seeing the problem but I would suspect that there's a problem with your Graphics Card Driver. Make sure you have the latest version offered by the maker.</p>

            <p>Thanks John, but I don't think it is the Graphics Card Driver because the "pen" software is working 100%.</p>
<p>If you are saying&nbsp;Presenter View&nbsp;works as expected on your computer with the Laser Pointer, are you using Office 365 with Windows 10?</p>
<p>By the way, I saw this morning that the small dot of the "pen" before drawing does not show on the venue screen, so using the pen is also not an option for me.
</p>
<p>Kind regards </p>

            <p>I've also tried all of the following, to no avail:</p>
<p>* Another Graphics Driver (Windows 10 should anyway ensure that the latest drivers are installed if I understand this correctly)</p>
<p>* Quick repair of Office 365</p>
<p>* Detail online repair of Office 365</p>
<p>It is not that I can't get the Laser Pointer in Presenter View not to work at all.</p>
<p>The problem is that after using it for a few minutes,&nbsp;the dot&nbsp;disappears for a while, then comes back, then disappears again. It seems to always come back after a while, but of course one cannot do a presentation like this -- I will quickly run out of jokes
 regarding Microsoft software in trying to keep my&nbsp;students interested. </p>

            Both methods are problematic -- the latter however is causing more serious problems -- freezing of the program for like 15 seconds.

<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>If it is the SharePoint site collection recycle bin, then the answer is No. SharePoint online stores the data for 90 days in the recycle bin.</p>

            Why not use TransferDatabase to link to the DBF file, then run an Append query to add the data to your table.

<h2>            Exchange online - accepted mail from subdomain but send email as if it was from domain</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a domain contoso.com (and I have a valid MX record). The server that I use is not exchange online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have decied to use new tenant in Office 365. But, because my contoso.com MX record is forwarding my mails to my original server (not Exchange), I have created a subdomain called subdomain.contoso.com and set up an automatic forward to my email created
 in this subdomain.contoso.com in Office 365. But I would like to send my email from my office 365 subdomain as if it was from my domain. For example: My mail is forwarded to my mail address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in Office 365 tenant, but when I hit reply
 to the message I want my message to look like it was sent from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** even thoug it wil be sent from my Exchange online server and saved in my saved folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It this possible?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sassy_itgirl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, it is impossible. Because your domain contoso.com isn't added to Office 365. If you want to use your domain in Office 365, it is suggested to add your domain to Office 365. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-domain-to-office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-a-domain-to-office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611</a></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family restrictions still active while the settings are off... Need some help.</h2>
                    My child has a Microsoft phone. Via Microsoft Family - Content restrictions I enabled the option that my child need to have adult approval to buy things in the Microsoft store but I do not receive any approval message or what so ever. So&nbsp;I disabled this
 option so we could download apps from the store but this was still not possible. Now I removed my child from the Family account and we still got the same message that it is not possible to download apps due to the restrictions which I already removed.... bit
 frustrating. So I need some help here. Is there some one who can help me? Thank you in advance.

            My child has Windows 8. In the referred section only windows 10 is mentioned. This does not clarify why the initial settings (approval needed) seems to be active in the background, but could this be a reason why, after more then 4 days, we are still not
 able to download anything?&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;hash008, there are two ways to check for firmware updates:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Visit this link: <a href="http://www.nokia.co.in/get-support-and-software/download-software/device-software-update/can-i-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.co.in/get-support-and-software/download-software/device-software-update/can-i-update</a> ... Enter the product code printed inside the battery compartment of your phone, see if the version displayed by the website is greater than the one installed
 in your phone (type *#0000# at the stand-by screen).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Download and install the latest Nokia Software Updater from the Nokia website. Connect your phone to the PC using the data cable, and run NSU. If there's an update to the firmware for your phone, NSU will prompt you to update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the theory part. Something weird happened last night. When I checked the firmware version in the brand new 5130 XpressMusic that I bought for my brother, it said 6.93, and when I checked the latest available in the website, it said 6.65. I do not
 have access to a PC with net connection, so, couldn't try that method :smileywink:</p>

            just wanted to add on the music player is a bit slow compared to earlier version, it takes a few sec;s to play the next song which you'd get frustrated if u tend to search for music most of the time.

<p>The latest Version is 7.97</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all 7.xx firmwares are a little slower and doesn't have screensaver and powersaver options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I would recommend not to update to any 7.xx versions if you are not having any problems with the one you have currently.</p>
<p>Instead Wait for the 8.20/8.30 versions .</p>
<p>They are supposed/hyped to be SUPERB versions with lots of Extra features.</p>
<p>They are supposed to be launched in january/feb 2011</p>

                    I have the autoformat option to replace a double hyphen (--) with a dash turned on, but Word is not doing it.&nbsp; I type a double hyphen, and it just stays there as 2 hyphens.&nbsp; What could cause this?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The replacement doesn't happen until you type the space or punctuation following the word to the right of the hyphens. For example, if you type "this should be a dash--after I type" then the hyphens should change to an em dash when you press the spacebar
 to the right of the word "after". <br />
<br />
If you type a space to the left of the dashes, they're replaced by an en dash instead of an em dash, but the timing is still the same.<br />
<br />
It may also help to remember that the default shortcut keystroke for an em dash is Ctrl+Alt+Numberpad Minus. The en dash doesn't have a default shortcut, but you can assign one if you need it; the combination Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Numberpad Minus is available.<br />

<h2>            Missing Text SMS messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>

</p><p>I got a new phone and when I restored a few on my text message are now missing. It seem like the one's of the people I mostly contact are now gone. I've tried using older backups but still the same thing. I have a case coming up and I really need to get
 these text msgs back.</p>

            <p>The issue continues for me and I fear that my maps are lost forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe the problem is a server being unavailable but that the redirect coding is the issue. &nbsp;I have run some tests on the website and I see that there are coding errors that deal with redirects. &nbsp;As such, if the background info we want (the full
 maps) is moved the Collections cannot find the content. &nbsp;I believe the content has moved and unless someone realizes that it affects a bunch of users who had collections nothing will be done about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a coder or even someone extremely tech savvy so I cannot explain the problem very well and I definitely cannot fix it. &nbsp;Bing Maps, I believe, does not feel that the issue is there issue. &nbsp;They have somewhat implied that My Places is a website created
 by someone other than Bing Maps. &nbsp;Again, I don't really understand everything but I do understand that I cannot access my maps...it is a huge pain...and I will never create them again I assure you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting IE or the browser is definitely not the issue I guarantee you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution please share... I would like access to my maps again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>text per line in onenote 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanls  say:</h3>
<h2>            text per line in onenote 2010</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community:</p>
<p>In OneNote 2010,&nbsp; when working with a blank page - without using note&nbsp;containers- when I type text, the text stops short of filling the entire line.&nbsp; If I try to extend the sentence (number of words per line), the text drops down or wraps around&nbsp;and creates
 a new line.&nbsp; My sentences&nbsp; (text length or characters of information per line) don't fully occupy the amount of space available.&nbsp; I would like to increase the amount of<u> words per line</u> that I can insert while using either a font size of 10 or 11.&nbsp; As
 it now stands, when I open a <u>previously</u> created page to review it, the text starts on the left margin and continues several inches toward the center of the page and then stops, leaving me with a lot of blank unused line space.&nbsp;It's almost as if someone
 drew an imaginary line down the center of the page which prevents you from typing beyond the imaginary line.&nbsp; As a result, I have the entire right hand side of the page "open" and unused.&nbsp;I've tried adjusting my margins but with no luck. My left and right
 page margins&nbsp;are set at 1".&nbsp;&nbsp;If I create a <u>new page</u>, the same issue occurs in that I can type my sentences, but at some point the words stop and wrap down to a new line, yet one can see there is still a good quantity of unused line space available.&nbsp;
 More text per line&nbsp;would help compress my paragraphs.&nbsp; In Microsoft&nbsp;Word, I would simply adjust my font size or perhaps re-set the side margins and the text would spread out.&nbsp; A "large paragraph" would spread out and become smaller in size because I could&nbsp;apply
 more text-per-line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can anyone make a suggestion?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            You can resize the note container to the size you want. Even if you ware working with a blank page, your text goes into a note container.

    <title>Page Viewer Web Part Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pattykovash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page Viewer Web Part Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm aware that others have had issues with getting the Page Viewer web part to work, but none of the solutions have answered my particular issue.</p>
<p>I am using SharePoint 2013 Online. When I add any URL nothing happens when I either hit Apply or OK. I don't get any error messages or any new messages other than the default "To link to content, open the tool pane and then type a URL in the
<b>Link</b> text box." message. After entering the URL in, hitting OK and no changes were made, I go back in to edit the web part and the URL I entered is no longer there. I test the link while in edit mode and the links work. I've tried this in both Chrome
 &amp; IE.</p>
<p>I have limited access, so could that be part of the problem? Usually, if something in out of my permission level, I will get a message. Or if I try to use a web part that is not enabled my the admin, I also get a message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Patty,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, can you confirm the information below?</p>
<p>1. Make sure that the admin has checked the steps below:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; a. As a SharePoint admin, allow<b> Customer Scripts</b> in "Settings" in the SharePoint admin center</p>
<p>It takes up to 24 hours for the changes to Custom Script to take effect. Please verify the situation after 24 hours and let us know any updates. We will provide further assistance then.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; b. As a site collection admin, go to the affected site &gt;<b>Site settings</b> <b>
&gt;HTML Field Security</b> &gt;Select <b>Permit contributors to insert iframes from any external domain</b>
<b>into pages on this site</b>.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; c. As a site collection admin, make sure that the affected user is assigned at least
<b>Design permission level.<br />
</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the affected site &gt;<b>Site settings </b>&gt;<b> Site permissions</b> &gt;
<b>Check Permissions </b>&gt; enter the affected user’s user account to check the user’s permission. Click
<b>Grant Permissions </b>to assign permissions to the user.</p>
<p>2. If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Try creating a new Page viewer web part in a newly created site in other site collections and see if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; b. Do other users, with the qualified permission level in your organization, encounter the same issue?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

<h2>            Cannot Edit a Calendar Item</h2>
                    I am so extremely disappointed with the beta version. Why would you roll out the Calendar beta version if you cannot make any edits to a calendar event. I can edit the basics - name, time, date - but I cannot go in and edit any of the notes that I have
 for my calendar items.&nbsp;

Sometimes that message is result of Windows Access Rights problems. Try using Run as Admin, to start the activation process.<br />

    <title>Ghost space in MWord when using tables - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ghost space in MWord when using tables</h2>
                    <p>I have a word document and am using it to do some tables. MWord is going crazy in this document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I insert a table in a new page 2 and after typing half the page, half my table goes to the following page. There is still space in the same page but MWord insists on cutting my table in half and shifting it to the following page. I cannot do anything in
 this remaining space in page 2. I click on the empty space and it selects the whole table. I do a few other things and my table on page 2 overlays on my table in page 1. I have no idea what is going on and why. This program is driving me crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss as to how user unfriendly this program is. Is there a way MWord can properly format a table so normal humans can use it?</p>

            <p>I downloaded your sample file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears to be that your tables are floating and cover the full width of the page. Thus, there is no room to place on Page 1 the bunch of blank ¶s below the A portion and, at the same time, the B portion of the table. In addition, the long merged
 cell at the left of table B can't split.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you delete them (you may have to Cut the last remaining ¶), the tables will join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve the problem, start by selecting the table, then do <em>Table &gt; Properties &gt; Table &gt; None</em> (instead of Around). Although Around tables (floating) can be positioned anywhere on the page, they can be difficult to tame (just like floating pictures).
 Unless a table needs to be placed in parallel to some text or image, don't use Around, use None and position it by changing its left outside margins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need edge-to-edge tables, using the None setting will require very small margins via
<em>Format &gt; Document &gt; Margins</em>.</p>
