    <title>Autonumber&#47;Linking table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> serendipityww  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autonumber&#47;Linking table</h2>
                    I have three tables (FamilyInfo, FamilyMemberInfo, and PhoneInfo). In each of these tables I used autonumber as the primary key. Then I tried to make a linking table with the 3 primary keys from those tables with each primary key as autonumber. I got the
 message that a table can only have one auto number field. I thought that the fields in the linking table had to be of the same domain as the foreign key in the referenced table. So does that mean that I have to make the ID fields in the main tables as text?

<div>An autonumber is really Long Integer with other special attributes.&nbsp; In your</div>
<div>linking table, you won't be auto-incrementing the foreign key values from </div>
<div>the other tables, so those foreign key fields should be defined as Long </div>
<div>Integer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you do that, by the way, make sure those fields in the linking tale </div>
<div>don't have their Default Value properties set to 0.&nbsp; They should have no</div>
<div>default values.</div>

    <title>How to get a Skype ID&#63; Skype only allows to create a new account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get a Skype ID&#63; Skype only allows to create a new account using phone or email, how can I share my skype id with other people that request it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is ridiculously annoying, I cannot believe the lack of thinking that is going through skype teams..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a personal skype account I created when I was a kid. Silly username, and it is only for relatives. Now, for work interviews I am asked to provide with a skype username so they can interview me. However, when I try to create a new skype account it
 only allows to do so using a phone number or an email address. And once you create that, you do not have a skype name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another additional problem is that I did create a skype account about 5 years ago for a school interview, but I have forgotten the password and I do not have the email to recover it (it was a school email and it was deactivated), now Skype says that it can
 "help" you recover it, but the questions it asks are ridiculous and does not consider you not having access to that email that you haven't used in years, so obviously you can't remember what was the subject line of the last message. (seriously??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, is there anyway to get a skype name now? or is that over?</p>

            I don't quite get the problem. &nbsp;You can't create a new account because it wants an email or phone number? Where's the problem? &nbsp;Just create a new email account and use that to get your Skype account. &nbsp;If you can't create a new email account, you need a
 lot more help than I can give. &nbsp;I just recently created 2 new skype accounts and both offered the option for what name &nbsp;to use. &nbsp;Is this an apple thing? &nbsp;I don't use apple products so I have no idea how they work.

<p>
</p><p><span>I am asking how to get a skype ID. Not a skype account. You know the id or name that you share with people. I have created an account, but only using a phone number, and then people have to find you by name. It just
 happens that there are about 50 people with the same name and last name as I have, so... you understand why Skype name or Skype id is necessary, right? Currently I am getting emails in which say "Hello, liveid:9823rniuj0d3dj03d" or something like that, isn't
 that just silly that it creates an ID for you instead of letting you choose yours? How could you even remember that when you want to share it?</span></p>

            There was a somewhat similar problem I saw where it was an apple-product issue, so I added that last bit.&nbsp; I haven't tried to create an account with a phone number, just an email.&nbsp; When you do that, it lets you choose your Skype Name.&nbsp; You can't kill the
 account, open a new one with a new email, then tie the phone to it?&nbsp; That's my best shot, I don't have that much experience, so sorry if it sounded naïve and ignorant, which obviously it was.

<p>You can no longer create you own custom Skype ID no matter how the account is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simply provide a phone number and attach nothing else you your account, then you would have to use the generated ID.&nbsp; Since I have never created a phone number account, I am unsure whether or not they can find you by your number.&nbsp; I assume they cannot.
 &nbsp; If you created an email account then the (live:) ID will be generated from your email account, which is generally a lot less complex.&nbsp; People can then find you by that ID or your email address.&nbsp; By attaching an email address to your phone number created
 account, people should also be able to locate your account by your email address.<br />

            Yeah according to my latest intent and the other user that responded Techfreak_, creating a username is no longer allowed. That was precisely my question and now complain. How is it that they turned off that extremely useful feature? That's insane..

<h3> mybigvoice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can apps be installed to sd card in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 preview on a laptop and I'm pretty happy with it. I also have a hybrid laptop with only 32gb hard drive running Windows 8.1. The memory is always full as you can imagine and I cannot find a way to install apps to an sd card as they
 always try to go to the C drive. I notice that there are many products on the market with small C drives and sd card slots so this is going to be an issue for many people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is will Windows 10 allow me to choose to put programmes onto the SD card? If not can someone please change it so that it does?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any replies, Andy.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I have Asus T100 with Windows 8.1 and 32GB from 1 month and I already have problems with memory...<br />
However, I bought 64GB SD Card, but it didn't help much, because I found I can't install apps on it... Which I think is a very big problem..
<br />
I hope in Windows 10 installing apps on SD Card will be possible, because it will be very helpfull for many people.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when i login to my internet (the built-in one) it says "Connecting to iCellcom" (Which is my operator).</p>
<p>The Wifi is identified by the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I've installed Opera mini. when i use it it doesnt ask me what I'd like to use (3G or wifi), and I dont want to waste my DATA Package.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to create an access point (i.e. connection profile on the phone settings) matching the name and security settings of your home WLAN network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do following configuration on the phone while you are within range of your home WLAN network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Check your WLAN router settings (refer to it's user manual / getting started guide etc.) for the name of the WLAN network and what WLAN security mode and keys have been defined on the router. Take note of these since you need to configure the same on
 the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. On the phone, Go to Tools (or Control Panel) -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; Destinations -&gt; Internet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Your "Internet" destination probably already has at least one "access point" which refers to your cellular packet data GPRS / 3G connection (iCellcom). Leave iCellcom access point as it is because otherwise you will lose the cellular data connectivity
 as well. In order to make your phone to "use" your home WLAN you need to add an access point also for the home WLAN within the "Internet" destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If your "Internet" destination already has one or more access points refering to the name of your home WLAN network and your phone still fails to connect via this, then it's probably best to remove those home WLAN "access points" and try to create a new
 one from the scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. While you are still inside the "Internet" destination menu, select Options -&gt; New access point</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Allow phone to "Automatically check for&nbsp; available access points" and take a look at the list of WLAN networks that your phone was able to find. If you are within reach of your WLAN network and your WLAN router is up and running properly you should see
 the "name" of your home WLAN network on the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Select the network and your phone should ask you to enter WLAN security parameters, unless your WLAN network runs without any security. Typically security of the WLAN router defaults to either a WEP Key or WPA Pre-Shared key. Enter the correct security
 key when prompted by the phone and note that this must be entered absolutely correctly (Pre-shared key is case sensitive and WEP keys are sensitive to lenght). So if you are unsure of the correct security key's then check this from the router's user manual
 or you can usually chahge the default key's via routers web configuration interface. Note that sometimes default security key's are also written on the sticker under/behind the router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Now you should have a new "access point" defined within the Internet destination. Just make sure that your WLAN access point is higher than your cellular data access point on "list" of access points so that phone prefers the home WLAN connection whenever
 it is available. If needed you the change the priorities of access points via Options-&gt; Organize -&gt; Change Priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Go one level back in the menu so that you are in the list of Destinations (Internet, WAP Services, MMS etc.). Here you can define what is the default Destination (group of access points) that some of the applications (without their own connectivity selection
 settings) will utilize. Select Options -&gt; "Default Connection" and you will be shown a list of Destinations to choose from as well an option of "Always Ask". You can choose "Internet" destination as your default connection for automatic usage of Internet destination
 or you can choose "Always Ask" which allows you to choose manually which Destination to utilize when (some) applications attempt to open up a connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Most likely your phone's built-in Web browser has it's own connectivity selection settings which you can control via browser application's settings menu. Start the browser and go to Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Access Point. Here you can choose
 either choose the "Internet" destination to be used (attempts to connect with highest priority access point available at the time within the "Internet" destination) or you can select "Always Ask" which should allow you to manually choose the connection method
 everytime Web browser attempts to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that when browser is set to "Always Ask" you will be shown a list of those Destinations where at least one access point is currently available. If multiple access points are available within a single Destination phone will try to use the one with highest
 priority.&nbsp; If you ever need to temporarily override the access point priorities within Destiantion (without going to Destinations and changing the priorities permanently) you can highlight the given Destination (at choose connection dialog) and select Options
 -&gt; "Select Access Point". This is where you can temporarily select the "lower priority" access point to be used instead of the highest priority available access point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Java based applications (like Opera Mini) and some of the older native applications,are not utilizing the automatic connection selection logic provided by the Destinations and these applications may either have their own individual "access point" selection
 setting within their own "settings" menus or they will revert to the "Default Connection".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. For Opera Mini and other Java based applications,&nbsp; there usually a way to control their access point selection via to the Application Manager (the one that shows a list and details of all installed applications). I'm not sure where exactly Application
 Manager is located on N86, but usually it's something like Tools -&gt; Application Manager or Settings -&gt; Data Manager -&gt; App.manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are at the Application Manager, go to Installed Apps -&gt; find and highlight the Opera Mini -&gt; select Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Access Point -&gt; Default access point. In case you leave default access point as "None" your Opera Mini should always prompt
 you to select which access point (like your home WLAN or iCellcom) it should use while connecting this time. Most likely your Opera Mini is by default set to utilize the cellular packet data conneciton (iCellcomm) so you won't be provided an option to choose
 your home WLAN network even if it would be available and you have successfully defined the access point for WLAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that If you specifically select e.g.your home WLAN access point for Opera Mini then it will completely fail connecting whenever you are out of range of your home WLAN. Thus it's probably better to set Opera Mini so that default access point is set to
 "None" and select the connection method manually each time starting to browse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another tip related to Java applications connectivity is that under that very same Application Manager menu, you might also be able to control whether paricular Java application will ask for user's "permission" before it connecting i.e. allowed to use networking
 functionality. See Network Access option which has option like Ask Every Time / Ask first time only / Always allowed. Note that "always allowed" might not be available for all Java applications but even choosing "Ask first time only" might reduce the number
 of "permission" queries.</p>

<p>I've managed to prioritize my WLAN connection over my Cellular 3G and to change the built-in web browser settings so it'd ask me everytime how i want to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's only asking me for permission to use the data network (I dont know which one) and not which network to use. why is that?</p>

<p>&nbsp;You're welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've used Opera Mini and just realized that in order to get Opera Mini to prompt which connection method to use you need to set your phone's Default Connection to Always Ask (via Settings -&gt; Connection -&gt; Destinations -&gt; Options -&gt;
 Default Connection) AND also configure Opera Mini's default access point&nbsp; (via Application Manager) to "None".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any experience on eBuddy or Nimbuzz IM clients but based on your description it sounds that those are most likely native Symbian / S60 applications (not Java apps, like Opera Mini) thus they don't have the "Settings" item visible on the Application
 Manager, like Java based applications have. Most native applications either have their own access point / connectivity settings built-in to their own menus or they simply use the "Default Connection" (i.e. connect with "Internet" Destination or allow you to
 choose in case Always Ask).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't have to go through all steps between 2-9 in case you wan't to use other WLAN networks. In these cases you can choose "Search for WLAN" when e.g. your built-in Web browser asks you to choose the connection method. This should show you a list of
 currently available WLAN networks. When you choose a network and enter the security key (if required by the network) your browser should connect through this WLAN network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This situation where phone connects to a new, previously undefined WLAN network, is where the Internet Connectivity Test comes to play (which you had set to "Ask every time" ). When you connect to a new WLAN network and allow the Internet Connectivity test
 to be run your phone will try to determine if this connection actually works properly, providing successful internet connection.&nbsp; If Internet Connectivity Test succeeds your phone will automatically create a new "access point" for this particular WLAN network
 and places it under "Internet" destination. So next time you would like use this WLAN network your phone already has an access point defined and you can use the connection without entering the security key again (or phone will automatically utilize this connection
 in case you have set Internet destination as your Default Connection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know for sure that you won't be using this particular WLAN network ever again and/or don't want it to be automatically saved as an access point, then you can simply skip the Internet Connectivity Test and your Web browser will still connect using
 the network you chose via "Search for WLAN" but permanent access point will not get automatically created. If Internet Connectivity Test is set to "Run Automatically" then you can't skip the test and phone will always create an access point to Internet destination
 assuming that connection via Search for WLAN did provide successful internet connection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks AGAIN!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did what you said - changed my phone's Default Connection to 'Always Ask' and now the Opera Mini does ask me to pick a network to surf with. Thank you very much, you've saved me a lot of money :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the Nimbuzz - I believe it is an S60 app and not a java one (the installation file ends with .sis),&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to configure it through the application itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>My new Nimbuzz settings:</p>
<p>'Default Connection': Always Ask.</p>
<p>Use Wi-Fi when available: Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;I think I'll put the Connectivity Test on 'Run Automatically', If I understand it's purpose currectly I see no reason why I should deny my phone from opening access points to valid WLAN connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I think I'm covered, Thanks a lot!!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I have just one last question. On the App Manager, under Installed Apps, There are many apps like "Brain Challenge", "Brothers In Arms", "Crash Bandicoot", "EA Sports FIFA".</p>
<p>I can see them on the App manager but I cant find them anywhere on my phone.</p>
<p>I didnt install them, that's how I recieved the device (It's new not used).</p>
<p>What's going on with that?</p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am facing problems with my wlan too..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently i updated the latest firmware v21.006 , and problems started showing up..</p>
<p>despite of the good gps locking speed and image recognozition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i am facing a big headache with n86 wifi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>initially after the update whenever i used to connect to the internet , after closing the browser</p>
<p>my phone shows SYSTEM ERROR "OK"&nbsp; and that's it, no other key press can ,make this prompt close</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i used to turn off the message,, later after weeks i bought a wifi router @ home</p>
<p>now i want to change the access point, for that i tried to go to menu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MENU&gt;TOOLS&gt;Settings&gt;Connection&gt;Destinations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here in this menu when i click "Internet" nothing shows i.e i cannot even click</p>
<p>Multimedia msg, WAP services, or anything</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I AM COMPLETELY unable to change or modify internet destinations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i even tried to reset my phone .. no use</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i even tried to select Add new acc pt menu, but then i can see the available things like</p>
<p>wlan and packet data, i chose wlan , then it showed my wifi router name</p>
<p>and so i ried to select but no use, i can only move my cursor up and down but i couldnt select</p>
<p>routers or hidden network</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>only way power off and restart.. what should i do ,,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not sure about N86 but at least on E72 access point priorization goes like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Highlight (move the selection on top of) the access point that you want to prioritize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Select Options -&gt; Organize -&gt; Change priority</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that at this point it may appear that "nothing happens" since there won't be any new menus opening up but pay attention to the left and right softkeys that should now read OK and Cancel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. Move up or down on the list of access points and place your selection/cursor to a position where you want to move your originally selected access point (step 1) to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Select OK to make the actual re-priorization happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Done. Hopefully your originally selected access point has now jumped to it's new position on the access point priority list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>SMS duplicates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SMS duplicates</h2>
                    Almost every time I sync with MyPhone, it seems to duplicate some of my SMS messages. The most obvious are drafts (which tend to be 'unsent' messages that are left in drafts when retrying a SMS send) and every time I sync, it creates another copy.. so
 if I have one, I'm left with two, sync again, then four.. most recently after running the Delete Duplicates I had 2000+ dupes of a single message. It also happens with incoming messages, but not all the time.<br />
<br />
Also, the Find Duplicates for SMS messages is useful for finding these, but not 100%, as it will include other messages that are similar or contain the same text, but happened at a different time (so it's technically a dupe, but not of the original message).
 When the problem I described above happens, the messages always have the same time. I have to uncheck a lot of the 'similar' messages so they don't get deleted on accident. Also, the Find Duplicates will say messages like 'Yes' and 'yes?' are duplicates when
 they're really not.<br />

    <title>Questions about &#34;Release Preview&#34; ring of Insider Preview - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayseedoubleyou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Questions about &#34;Release Preview&#34; ring of Insider Preview - and the consequences of opting out later</h2>
                    Hello everyone! Sorry in advance for the long-windedness of this post!<br />
<br />
I have been an insider since the very beginning, since the very first build, back when it was called "Technical Preview". However this is my first post on the forums about it. I know there are similar threads, but I didn't find one that strikes exactly at what
 I'm asking. So forgive me if these questions&nbsp;strike some as redundant. Also, I hope you'll endure a little backstory first:<br />
<br />
I have two computers running Windows&nbsp;10 - a cheapie off-brand 2-in-1, specifically a "Nextbook Flexx 11" which is running on the Insider program fast ring, and&nbsp;has build 14393.xx installed on it (I can't remember if it's the&nbsp;x86 or x64 version, but with only
 2GB RAM, it's not as important of a distinction as it'd be on more powerful hardware). Then I have a custom-built, DIY gaming PC based on&nbsp;hardware that's decidedly a bit outdated, but still relevant enough to run Doom&nbsp;2016 on ultra settings in&nbsp;full 1080 at
 a little over 30fps. It's based on an AMD Phenom II&nbsp;x4 965 black edition CPU, 8GB DDR3-1600 (1x8gb) RAM, an ASUS ROG Crosshair IV Formula motherboard, and an Asus branded GTX660ti GPU&nbsp;with 3GB VRAM instead of the usual 2GB, and a baked-in 20% overclock. This
 second computer is running Windows 10 x64, but it is -NOT- presently on the insider program.<br />
<br />
I'm more than happy to accept the risks of instability that slow, and especially fast rings present on the Flexx as it's a secondary, or even tertiary device for me. However, I am not comfortable running even slow ring, let alone fast ring on the gaming PC.
 I also understand that my PC, since it's a custom build, will not be in the first round of anniversary update roll out, and who knows exactly when I'll get it? Having had a chance to use it on the Flexx, though,&nbsp;I definitely am super eager to get it, and don't
 want to wait........so, my questions, then, pertain to the "Release Preview" ring of the Insider program.<br />
<br />
1) My understanding of the "Release Preview" ring of the insider program is that it -ONLY- gives you "release builds", and doesn't give you any "preview builds" like slow ring and especially fast ring do. So you're not going to receive any unstable builds,
 and&nbsp;this&nbsp;ring is really&nbsp;only designed to give&nbsp;Microsoft one last&nbsp;crack at boosted&nbsp;user&nbsp;analysis and feedback before mass release to catch any lingering bugs. To the users, the impact is they get the release version a week or so ahead of the masses, and get
 the insider feedback app, but they are otherwise unimpacted by this ring.&nbsp;Is this understanding correct or not? If so, then the next question would probably be moot, as I could likely feel comfortable going on "Release Preview" ring, and just staying there
 indefinitely. However, in case it's not correct, here's the second question:<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp;While I know "how" to opt out of the insider&nbsp;program, I'm a little confused&nbsp;over what's at stake in backing out. I've never had to&nbsp;opt any devices out before.&nbsp;From what I can glean&nbsp;from&nbsp;my reading, if&nbsp;the build you're currently on is a&nbsp;"release build" (I.e.
 14393), then nothing's at stake. You simply wait til the mass rollout to non-insiders is complete, choose to&nbsp;opt out, reboot your machine, and you're done. You're still on the&nbsp;same build, you still receive updates and support, and you don't have to reinstall
 the OS. However, if you're not on a "release build", but on a "preview build" (I.e. 14390 or earlier), and you opt out, then you&nbsp;stone wall yourself. No more updates, no support, an expiration date on the build, and a full reisntall required to escape.&nbsp;So,
 is&nbsp;this the&nbsp;right understanding, or am I missing something? <br />
<br />
If the answer to both of the above is "Yes", then I won't have to ever worry about opting out of the Insider program on the rig anyway, since they'll only be release builds and not buggy previews, but even if I did need to beg off, it wouldn't be an issue because
 once again, I'd always only have release builds, so I'd never have to worry about being "marooned", or having to put all the work into "burning it down and building it all over again."<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking all of this should be apparent. I want Anniversary update immediately, don't want to have to wait an unknown amount of time for it, yet, want to make absolutely certain first that I'm not risking the shipwrecking of "The Biff Elizabeth"
 (.....yes, yes, that&nbsp;actually is what I named my rig....I chose irony in naming&nbsp;the Flexx "McMighty"). If there's any risk of catastrophe, then I'll just have to suck it up, mutter under my breath, and wait my turn in the non-insider waiting line, checking
 for updates with a neurotic persistency. But if this is a safe move on my part, I'll add Biff to the insider program, get my fix a little early, and likely, continue to get future rollouts a little ahead as well.<br />
<br />
So, please let me know, gang! And I'm sorry for taking so many words to ask what is probably such a simple pair of questions. :-)<br />
<br />
Thanks a million!!!<br />
<br />
Cheers!

            <p>I was on Fast Ring for the first 6 months and moved to Slow Ring to work with something a little more stable. I do not know the answer to your question and I think the only way to find out is to do what you think is best for you. It would seem that if things
 do not go the way you like you should be able to get back to where you are as long as you prepare like making a system image for backup and a recovery disk or USB key.</p>

            <p>Interesting. I haven't been super duper active, but I've definitely been contributing here and there over the course of the program. What the 3hrs thing may be is that I just registered for the forums 3hrs or so ago, and I don't believe "JaySeeDoubleYou"
 is how I'm otherwise known to the program. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So that would probably clear that up. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as far as the redirect on the information I'm seeking, a link would be very helpful, otherwise I was hoping to find out soon enough to keep it from being a moot point on the Anniversary Update, so any help along those lines would be awesome!</p>

            <p>Are your computers activated?&nbsp; If they are then you can do a clean install, update, upgrade to any current retail build and&nbsp; not have an expiration date.</p>
<p>If you are on a preview build as an Insider in the Fast or Slow ring the evaluation builds will have an expiration date but you can always move to the retail build.&nbsp; The expiration date of 14390 is in October 2016 but you should have updated or upgraded
 to Red Stone 1 long before that since in mid August there should be evaluation builds for Red Stone 2.</p>
<p>Being in the Release Preview ring on a couple of my computers and on 14393.5 I think that I can opt out at any time after the new release.&nbsp; Just stop getting&nbsp; Insider builds.&nbsp; I will probably stay with the Release Preview ring since it does not have builds
 that will crash my computers.</p>

            <p>Lawrence, and trbogt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both very much! It sounds like a pretty "not much to gain, but not much to lose" proposition. I know that a clean install is not too big of a deal to do, but I guess I'm just lazy enough that I was hoping to avoid the hassle for as long as performance
 quality considerations would allow. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll sleep on it. Given as low as the stakes are, it's not exactly a "fate of nations" decision. But it's also getting to be too late to do it tonight anyway. So that gives me the luxury to wait and see how I feel about it tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, guys! Goodnight!</p>

            <p>Release Preview is always&nbsp;the current public version... you can opt the machine out at any time and it would be the same program as the public uses&nbsp;&nbsp;- one exeption; may be that you would have an early release of a&nbsp;public cumulative update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except maybe these few days before the actual final anniversary comes out into the public machines as you now have the anniversary release and to leave&nbsp;right now would be foolish as&nbsp;it might want you to reinstall the current public 10586 to leave properly.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10</h2>
                    So far so good, impressive install and runs latest AMD display drivers, small glitch while installing but after restart all good, very fast with no trouble so far, new start button will be a winner for old xp users

<h2>            Outlook 365 &#47; 2019 search tool box position</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'd like to have my search box&nbsp; in line with the words "All" - "Unread" like in the following image:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fo365sharepointblog.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f02%2fsearchribbon.png%3fw%3d1109" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Instead I have it in a position like in the following image:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae667c71-178c-4773-85cd-f580de666ccb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae667c71-178c-4773-85cd-f580de666ccb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here it is above the words "Tutto" - "Non letti" (it is the italian translation for All - Unread).</p>
<p>How can I move it? Can anybody post the procedure?</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

<p>You have the reading pane turned off or set to the bottom. The search box is positioned on the right edge of the message list in the single line view. If you want it in the center, you need to either shrink the width of the window or use the reading pane
 on the right. <br />
<br />
If you have a wide monitor and have the pane on the right and are using a wide message list, you can change the View Settings to use the compact view. This is in View menu &gt; View Settings &gt; Other Settings.

            It's always going to be above the All/Unread tabs - you can't change that. Sorry.  (I misread your original post - I thought you wanted it lined up above, not on the same line.)

            That looks like an old build - 1802 is the last build that had the search box lower. I passed along some complaints from other users back in May - the complaint was about wasted space and they tightened it up a little, but left it above the filter button. :(

            Hello Hattie, 
<br />
<br />thanks for the screenshot. could you please try to remove the account and re-add it again? while adding the account back, when you enter your outlook.com email address, it should pick up the server details automatically. 
<br />
<br />If, you would like to add the server settings manually, for outlook.com it will be IMAP Or POP settings. server details are given in below article.

<h3> joeypol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Error 30094-1011 &#40;0&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleague has a Office 365 version installed on his laptop in the English language.</p>
<p>He requested to have another language pack installed. Which I tried to install, but gave me the&nbsp;&nbsp;Error 30094-1011 (0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then deleted Office and tried to reinstall Office 365 via his microsoft account, but when I try to run the installer, it gives me the exact same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've proceeded with a work-around by installing Office 2007, but we want 365 installed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things i've tried in short:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Delete and reinstall office in the desired language</p>
<p>-Disabled firewalls</p>
<p>-Rebooting</p>
<p>
</p><p>* One thing i've noticed on the installer: there is a nr. 32 on the end of the name. Does this imply it's a 32 bit version? Or does the x86 mean it's a 64 bit version?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />Well my recommendation is first uninstall Office 365 manually to remove all kinds of corrupt records installed on your computer, just like the previous Office. Follow the steps below to know how to do.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manually-uninstall-office-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manual...</a>
<br />
<br />After cleaning the activation keys associated with the Office 365 that were previously installed, also clean the credentials from the Credential Manager in Control Panel. I recommend following these steps.
<br /><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/odsupport/2015/05/01/how-to-reset-an-office-365-install-to-the-initial-activationinstall-state/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/odsupport/2...</a>
<br />
<br />Finally decide to install Office 365 and know where to do it and define if the OS of the computer is 32/64 bit to select the correct Office following the steps below.

Greetings Dayamis. </blockquote>
<p>First of all thanks for the help. </p>
<p>Second of all, why is it so hard to delete and reinstall Office... It shouldn't be such a long process. I might just reinstall a clean Windows.</p>
<p>I will be trying to follow these steps. Otherwise i'm just going to pull the plug and do a clean install.</p>

<p>Hi JoeyPol,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for joining in our forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may consider another method (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Option
 2 - easy fix tool</a>) which is more convenient to completely uninstall Office 2016. However, before uninstalling Office, could you please confirm whether there is any antivirus software, proxy or firewall enabled? Please turn them off to see the outcome first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>But you can customize it In (Settings/Update &amp; Security/Backup) by (Add a drive) and use the (More options) to exclude folders to help you from making a bunch of duplicate backups of the same thing you have backed up from somewhere else.</p>

    <title>Inserting Part of a Merge Field Into a Word Document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter berger &#40;pberger&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting Part of a Merge Field Into a Word Document</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon -</p>
<p>
</p><p>At our medical office, we print a page of the patient's demographic information for him/her to review every year or so.&nbsp; The EMR application uses Word for its letter/form functions.&nbsp; In this demographic-info template we have set Word to import the patient's
 social security number, which understandably makes the patient nervous.&nbsp; I'd like to just import perhaps the last four characters, so the patient's SSN (123-45-6789) would show up as XXX-XX-6789.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to avoid any VBA because, if I get hit by a bus, the next person in my chair won't be able to figure it out and maintain it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks to you and to macropod for responding.&nbsp; I&nbsp;<em>suspect</em> it would work, but the apps I'm using don't let me confirm.&nbsp; The background - I'm using a very primitive-but-Word-based mail merge function coming out of our electronic health record app.&nbsp;
 I put in the statement that Macropod suggested, but the EHR app truncated it and I found out that they have a built-in character limit on these fields.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up just going to the printable output form and pasting an opaque rectangle over all of the SSN except for the last four characters.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all for your interest and help.&nbsp; This community has saved me weeks of work over the years!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand that you are getting error Code 31 when you are trying to install network adapter drover on the computer.
</p>
<p>This issue occurs because Windows cannot load the drivers that are required for the WAN (Network monitor) device. Because there is no driver associated with the device, it cannot be removed from Device Manager.</p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the&nbsp;network adapter&nbsp;driver in compatibility mode&nbsp;and check if it helps.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a. Press <strong>
Windows Key + R,</strong> type </span></span></span></span><strong>Devmgmt.msc</strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b. </span></span></span></span>Find the
<strong>Network Adapters Category </strong>and click the <strong>"+" </strong>to the left.<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c. Right click then select
<strong>properties</strong> and select<strong>uninstall</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d. Click <strong>
OK</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>e. </span></span></span></span>Confirm the
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>f. Close <strong>device manager</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, I&nbsp;suggest you to download the network adapter driver from the manufacturer&nbsp;website and install it in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, to install in Compatibility Mode, follow these steps:<br />
<span>a. Locate the&nbsp;<strong>executable</strong>&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.</span><br />
<span>b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span><br />
<span>c. In the&nbsp;<strong>Package Name</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility</strong>&nbsp;tab.</span><br />
<span>d. Click to select the&nbsp;<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong>Windows 8&nbsp;</strong>with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span><br />
<span>e.&nbsp;<strong>Double-click</strong>&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.

<p><br />
Thanks for answering.&nbsp; I also had similar doubts, but saving the query does not help.&nbsp; I saved the query , closed and opened the MDB file and the query was still intact.&nbsp; Only after I run the query few times does this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an error message <span>'query must have at least one destination field: 3066' and that's obvious because the query only contains "SELECT;"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'm very certain that the SQL gets deleted after the DoCmd operation.</span></p>

<div>Something weird is going on. Strange things usually indicate file corruption. Make sure the queries are okay. Then import all objects into a new, blank database. That should eliminate the corruption.</div>

I don't see anything wrong with the query. If it opens in Design View and if you can run it then the syntax is correct.
<div><br />
<div>Although these kinds of lines bother me:</div>
<div>AND &nbsp;Nz(LeaderGroups.DeliveryOrganization, "*") Like Parameter_DeliveryOrganization()</div>
<div><br />
<div>If that field were null the line would read:</div>
<div>AND &nbsp;* Like Parameter_DeliveryOrganization()</div>
<div><br />
<div>No matter what Parameter_DeliveryOrganization() function returns the syntax just doesn't look right to me. Wildcards belong on the right side of a criterion.</div>

            The bootloader on your device is corrupt beyond repair. The only solution is to replace the phone's main board, which a) is difficult to find and b) more costly than a new phone, especially if we are talking about a Lumia 520.<br />

            I thing your suggestion would be that the only solution is buying a new one isn't it?&nbsp; &nbsp;I must be thankful for Nokia Lumia 520 with windows platform, because it consists of several best features on one like other. However I would appreciated for your promptly
 response.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I'm using Autodesk Architecture and their 'bulletinBoard.htm' is just a window showing typical project info but it is in .htm format. &nbsp;I have saved the htm file but either creates a support folder with xml and other file extensions in it or in the base folder

            I was not able to change my Skype profile picture when I followed your directions. At the Skype profile page I clicked on the Skype icon at the top left of the page but all I got was an advertisement for Skype.
