<h2>            I keep crashing when gaming</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pretty new build that was working fine until just recently, while playing a couple of Ubi soft games, other games have been fine. I have run all the recommended tests (ones checking the system and memory, short one only took 30 min or so) and have
 come up with nothing. I have had a large number of different BSOD messages, but today I came across the site you had talking about running the driver verifier, which I did. That was fun, right off the bat I got the driver violation error and ran into a cycle
 of restarting but finally got back in so I thought it was worth a try asking for help. Other then what is in the link I dont know what else you will need, so if you ask I will try and provide it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two of the minidump files as well as the msinfo32 file that was requested in the link below. I dont use any social media stuff, but I think I have them in there ok, your directions were pretty good.</p>

<p>I have a GTX 1080 graphics card. I will take a look at the thread you have linked and let you know how that goes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added later: removing the driver, going to basic windows driver and back to latest driver made no difference. I have also rolled back drivers with no effect. I currently have the most recent drivers installed.</p>

            The verifier Bugcheck was related to Brother Serial USB Driver
<br />Please update/uninstall the related utlity and see if the crashes persist.

<p>OK, I turned the verifier off. I did that through the restore method. I updated my brother printer firmware and utilities. In the device manager it shows I now have a Brother driver. I didn't see anything else specific for Brother and I looked at everything
 in the device manager to try and find a brother driver, I got them all. After I did that I checked to see if I still crash, I do, I have the whocrashed thing installed and here are the last 4 results from that:</p>

The crash took place in a file system driver. Since there is no other responsible driver detected, this could be pointing to a malfunctioning drive or corrupted disk. It's suggested that you run CHKDSK.</span></p>

<p>Ok, I did as requested, it crashed right away on restart but I got back in via the restore method. Then when I was saving the msinfo32 file it crashed again so I also included the whocrashed files from today as well as put the minidump file and a new msinfo
 in the drop at the same link as above but also repeated here. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aquw-iKqX1t5and5ZiCrEp25KFw</span></p>

            Got it. The crash relates to Logitech BUS enumerator(probably keyboard/mouse driver). I remember a while ago, one of their drivers was causing BSOD, so it looks like this might be a similar case. They provided a fix too, which I don't remember.
<br />
<br /> If there are updated drivers for it, please install them. Also, Please ask <a href="https://community.logitech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.logitech.com/</a> for the fix if they have one.

            Hi bumbum267
<br />
<br />Open Chrome
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chrome://flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />That should remove that for you . . .

<br />Set Hardware Media Key Handling to Disabled
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />

                    I just bought a new netbook with no CD drive. I was told I could go to the Microsoft website, enter my key code from the CD I own, and install it that way. Anyone know how to do this?

            I've never heard of doing it the way you describe. I just installed Office on a client's netbook by copying the Office CD contents to a USB thumbdrive (using another computer of course) and then copied from the thumb drive to the netbook. Install by double-clicking
 setup.exe. This is called installing from a "flat file". You can delete the flat file when installation is complete. You could also copy the flat file over the network if you have LAN file sharing already set up.<br />
<br />
Please note that Office 2000 has some incompatibility issues with Vista; Outlook won't remember passwords for instance.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Money Account Issues&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>So, I purchased a $25 gift card and loaded it on to my Xbox 360. I wanted to download the two Alan Wake DLCs and when I tried, the error code '8C010003' came up for both, (and a few other DLCs). This happened yesterday and
 today. I removed my credit card option after looking up the code, but it won't take the gift card money. It shows the Microsoft Money as 'greyed out'. When I go to commerce.microsoft, it shows the money is there, same as on my xbox. In the Xbox store it won't
 take the payment option. </span></p>
<p><span>Is there any way to unlock it or use it? I'm hoping I didn't waste $25 on a gift card that can't be used for Xbox when it says it was...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I clearly don't know what I am doing. I've only had this xbox since March...<br />

 I just have absolutely no idea what it is. The only thing I can find on it with any text is when I hover over the arrow button in it, it then says "Finalize the String". please help somebody!!! using windows 7

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING.</p>
<p>Nobody wants this stupid little window that is on top of everything. NOBODY. Can you please share this with the guy/team who wrote the specs?</p>

<p>I CANT EVEN TAKE A SCREENSHOT OF IT BECAUSE IT DISAPPEARS ON THE SCREENSHOT FILE AFTERWARDS. Do you realize I have to take a PHOTO of my computer screen&nbsp;with my phone to show you this f window ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And don't even tell me to click on the cross to close it. Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I DON'T want to</li><li>IT BRINGS BACK THE MAIN SKYPE WINDOW TO THE FRONT</li></ol>

            Seriously Micah, I appreciate you trying to help me but if you are not going to read my posts it's pointless.&nbsp; I have tried all the USB ports as stated earlier.&nbsp; I do NOT get an error message regarding the Windows Ink Workspace but&nbsp; I mentioned it as a
 coincidence that the problem may have started about the time that that icon showed up on the bottom ribbon.&nbsp; I cannot load the driver for my pen.&nbsp; Windows 10 is preventing me.&nbsp; How do i force acceptance of the driver?<br />

            <p>Since it indicates that the issue is not within the USB ports, it seems that the driver for your Echo Desktop that was installed in your device is not compatible with Windows 10. Although it indicates that your computer is compatible with Windows 10, the
 manufacturer of your Echo Desktop will be the one who will produce an updated driver for it to run properly. Kindly contact the manufacturer of your device for the updated driver and for further assistance.</p>

            So It is not compatible with windows 10??&nbsp; All of the thousands of people using this software have not upgraded to the new system?? Of course they have but only I am having an issue.&nbsp; What else could I examine in my settings that might be preventing the
 driver from loading?

            The Echo and pen and software were functioning properly up until a month ago in Windows 10.&nbsp; So compatibility is not the issue.&nbsp; I did have a hard drive crash.&nbsp; I replaced the drive, and reinstalled windows 10.&nbsp; Could that have something to do with it?<br />

<p>
</p><p>It has nothing to do with the hard drive being replaced. Do you have any known good drivers that you have installed before?</p>

 All in all, there are 32 .DMP files, and I'm not sure which ones would be useful, but the one associated with the most recent BSOD is listed above, so that one can be found quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for the help.</p>

<p>BugCheck 9F, {3, ffffe000d9087060, ffffd001619a1880, ffffe000d771e010}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : usbccgp.sys<br />
<br />
usbccgp.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault. Further<br />
analysis points to rtsuvc.sys Realtek UVC (Webcam)&nbsp;Driver for XP/Vista/Win7/Win8.</p>

<strong>1.</strong> Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Of course update that driver (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />

<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to<br />
see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card
<br />
or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display
<br />
Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow <br />
computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<strong>&nbsp; Run DriverView</strong> - set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (also update the BIOS and<br />
low level chipset drivers)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Group Policy Client service failed sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i have recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 for my desktop. It was working fine for a few days but now I encountered an error message, "The Group Policy Client service failed sign in. The universal unique identifier (UUID) type is not supported.
 " Pressed ok and I am back to sign in page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried searching the solution but all seem to advise some setting changes, which I am unable to try as I could not get past the login page and get to desktop. Any other ways to get around this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Mouse still lagging even after the update in games. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse still lagging even after the update in games.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've installed the update for Windows 8.1 that fixes the mouse lag in some games, then put games that aren't in the list into compatibility mode, disabled their 'display scaling on high DPI settings', run as admin and even added them to the registry , but in
 a lot of my games such as Fallout 3/ New Vegas the mouse will still begin to lag after roughly 10-20 minutes. This will continue indefinitely until I quit the game I am playing, but even then, I have to wait between 5-15 minutes before the mouse fixes itself
 as the problem still continues at the desktop.<br />
<br />
I've searched for a while now and found nothing that works :( I really need help with this issue as I am not even sure what to do any more. Is there any way to fix it or is there another update coming out I should wait for?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could occur because Windows 8.1 introduced changes to mouse input processing for low latency interaction scenarios. Therefore, games respond to mouse inputs differently in Windows 8.1 than in previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the link and follow the suggestion by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/73bbe54c-06a0-4391-a872-06a25d11a165">

I have already added some games to the registry, added the code '<span>NoDTToDITMouseBatch' to each and then entered '</span>Rundll32 apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache' in the CMD but none of it works. I just tried it again with Garrys Mod and the mouse still continuously

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the mouse cursor still lags after making the required changes to the registry, it could be due to some other application as well that is running at the background. Follow the methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot state:
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>“<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong>”</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Follow the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can refer to the section “<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</font></font></font></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a><font><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section:
<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If the issue still persists, check with the next method.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer to the manufacturer website to download and install the latest drivers for the mouse and display device. You need to uninstall the current version and then install the latest versions of drivers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also try these steps to update the drivers and see if works:</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) Press <strong>Windows and X</strong> key together and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">b) Locate the <b>Display adapter </b>device icon. Right click on the driver icon.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">c) Select <b>Update driver software</b>. </font>
</font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">c) Select “<b>Browse my computer for a driver software”</b>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">d) Select “<b>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</b>”.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">e) Select the <b>driver</b> from the list of the drivers according your device model and installed. Follow the same steps for<font><strong> mice and other pointing devi</strong>ces as well.</font></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>f) If this does not work, follow the steps from ‘<b>a’</b> to ‘<b>c’</b> and select “<b>Search automatically for the updated driver</b>”.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please let us know about the results.</font></p>

            Hi Pinaki,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your help, but please stop trying to blame hardware manufacturers for this problem. &nbsp;It didn't exist in Windows 8, 7 or any previous version. &nbsp;It *only* happens in 8.1.<br />
<br />
As for drivers, I'm using a Microsoft mouse (Mobile Mouse 4000) and I'm experiencing the jumping issue in 3D modeling programs. &nbsp;I've checked the drivers for the mouse and my graphics card (GTX 570), and I'm using the latest versions. &nbsp;It's so bad that I'll
 soon be reverting back to Windows 8, as it's nearly impossible to work in those applications with the mouse jumping all around. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>PLEASE &nbsp; FIX &nbsp; THIS &nbsp; PROBLEM</div>
<div><br />
<div>As in a real solution, not some workaround that involves editing the registry and which, in the end, doesn't work at all. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm really trying to tolerate Windows 8, but this has truly become a disaster. &nbsp;</div>
        </p>

            Hi Pinaki.
<div><br />
<div>I'm in total agreement with Chris in terms of not blaming the hardware manufacturer, except if the mouse hardware manufacturer is Microsoft in combination with Windows 8 and 8.1 and a computer that incorporates Intel based USB 3.0 featuring the Extensible
 Host Controller Interface (xHCI).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Even though I am not a gamer, the mouse stutter, and freezing problem has haunted me going back to Win 8. &nbsp;As an individual who prefers to build his own desktops, this problem has led me to test against 4 new x87 Intel chipset mother boards (3 from ASUS,
 1 from Gigabyte) which all support the xHCI and native Intel USB 3.0 with and without third party USB 3.0 providers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried updated drivers. Updated motherboard bios. &nbsp;Even (to some success) replaced MS xHCI Win 8.1 drivers for Intel xHCI (Win 7) drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The one thing I have not tried was a mouse by any manufacturer other than MS. It just did not occur to me that this was a mouse problem per se, as all of my Microsoft manufactured mice work without problems on my Dell laptop (based on a 2nd generation
 core i7 Sandy Bridge architecture). &nbsp;So today, after weeks of diligent effort to solving this problem, I pulled out an early generation Logitech wireless mouse and it works beautifully on the desktop. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tomorrow, I will purchase a new (current generation) Logitech mouse to determine if it too is free from the amlost constant stutter and freeze that I've been experiencing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW, I have not tried any of the registry changes as they appear to be targeted to specific applications (games) and I spend about 95% of my time on the "desktop".</div>

            Hi,<br />
It definitely has nothing to do with my hardware. I never had the problem in Windows 8 or 7. It appears to have changed something for gaming mice as I have experienced no lag at all with a very old Logitec mouse, but that means I have just wasted a load of
 money on a new mouse that I can't use. The gaming mouse I have bought works fine on my laptop which has Windows 8 in games, but it lags on my proper gaming computer which has Windows 8.1. Is it just best to do a Windows 8 refresh or is Microsoft planning to
 fix this in an update?<br />

            Following up on my earlier post, I have since purchased a current model Logitech mouse (M560) and it works equally well in non-gaming WIN 8.1.&nbsp; My conclusion is that the Microsoft mice manufactured for everyday computing are in some way incompatible to
 their own OP SYS (Win 8 and Win 8.1).&nbsp; Amazing!

<div>
I have a Dell Studio 15 laptop, and I upgraded to windows 7 a few months ago. I have never had a problem with the wireless network at home. In fact, it was working properly, and then all of a sudden it was gone. The icon says that I have full connection, but
 there is no internet access. I ran the diagnostic, and windows can't find a problem with it. I've gone from forum to forum trying to figure this out, and I can't seem to fix it. I tried unplugging the router ( a Linksys WRT300N Wireless-N broadband router),
 nothing. I even reset it, now leaving my network vulnerable because it is now unsecured. Nothing. I tried plugging in the ethernet cord, and it also says that there is no internet access. PleasePleasePlease, in layman's terms, help me fix this problem. Any
 help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If it does not work with a wire, then signal strength, or any other thing good or bad that is Wireless probably would work either.</p>
<p>So first, stick with a wire and make it work before you try the wireless again.</p>
<p>First, you have to find out what is Not working.</p>
<p>See if you can connect with a browser to the Router’s menu, instructions should be in the Router’s manual.<br />
Assuming that your Router is functional, if you cannot connect to the menus, then there is No connection between the Computer and the Router and you need to check what is wrong with the computer’s network setting.</p>
<p><br />
Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wire Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg<br />
</a><br />
Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network signal strength or any other thing that is Wireless would work either.</p>
<p>Start working, and if it does Not function, come back with real finding for further help.</p>

<p>Current MDI documents can be opened with OneNote or by adding the MDI filter to Microsoft Office.&nbsp; I suspect Microsoft isn't allowing new ones to be created because they no longer support the document format.&nbsp; I would suggest that you select a supported
 file format (perhaps PDF if you want to create files that cannot easily be changed?) and convert your myriads of MDI files into a supported format.</p>

<p>Was originally advised that Microsoft purposely didn't allow for such installation. I am specifically talking about Win7 64 bit OS. I can read my old files but I need/would like/miss the printer facilities (ie for creating new documents in the format). The
 current thread seems to have got a bit weird and personal. Just asking if anyone can offer practical help or suggestions and wondering if there had been any developments. Is anyone at MS even listening to the needs of many users who have myriads of MDI files
 and don't know of a viable alternative.</p>

<h2>            Family Safety settings not working after recent Windows updates</h2>
                    <p>I've got my machine running windows 10. I have my son's account set up with limits through Family Safety.&nbsp; I've used it to set Screen time limits on his account for months and months, with no trouble.&nbsp; Then in the last several weeks, ever since the last
 big Windows update, and the announced changes to&nbsp; Family Safety, the settings just do not work...&nbsp; I make changes to his account's setting in the Family Safety website, just like I have for months... only now, they do not take affect.&nbsp; He tries to log in,
 it tells him he is not allowed to log in until 5pm (which is what the settings used to be). He is on Winter vacation at school, so I've changed the settings to let him on now, only it just doesn't let him on... I've tried setting the Time Limits to "Off" on
 the family safety website, and STILL it tells him he can't log in until 5pm.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Family Safety was working great.. seems the latest updates have broken it!&nbsp; How can I restore this functionality?</p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC is connected to a domain, family features might not be available. Check with your system admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>remove all the child accounts first </strong>and
<strong>re-add them and check </strong>if it helps resolving the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Refer: </strong><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/set-up-family#set-up-family=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up family features</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to <strong>delete the Child account </strong>and <strong>
create a new and re-add the account in Family.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Refer: </strong><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/add-child-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a child account to your family</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having problems with your Microsoft account, you can try running the
<strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter</span></a></strong></p>
<p>It's an automated tool that can find and automatically fix some problems. It's only available in English, but will work in all languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Keep us posted to help you better.</p>
