    <title>N73 contact name not showing in sms Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N73 contact name not showing in sms Inbox</h2>
                    I got my N73 yesterday and updated my contacts straight away. I have since received a few text massaged from my contact. The first couple of contacts I added via bluetooth from my 6230i, when that person text me the name came up in the inbox. In the contact
 list this contact shows with a telephone logo at the side and once opened the telephone number is underlined. I then transfered contacts via the isync (Mac) bluetooth application. These contacts have no telephone on the side and are not underlined. I have
 received a text from one of these contacts and the name does not show in the inbox.<br />
<br />
Please help it is quite frustrating.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Frog

            I dont think there are any duplicate numbers, but i do know there is deff no duplicate for the contact that I am recieving texts from at the moment, and that is showing no name. As for area code, it says +44 st the front instead of 07, is that correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

any ideas about the underlining of a number and the telephone logo on the side??

<br />
+44 is your country code, so it will appear. add the 44 to the contact number, hopefully this will solve the problem, it solved mine, had that same issue.<br />
<br />
the underlining of the number and the telephone logo is just a feature of the phone. when you add or edit a contact and go into details, you would see a long list of options you can add. three telephone numbers, three mobile numbers, fax, email, etc. nokia's
 phonebook has always been well detailed. one of the things we love.

            I have already got the +44 infront of the number. However the number which had a name attached in inbox didnt. I cant find anywhere how to underline the number and get it to add the telephone logo, apart from sending a contact individually from my old
 phone. However when I did that with one, the name didnt come up in inbox. It doesnt make sense.<br />
<br />
Thanks for ur help, sorry for being difficult.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm facing the same problem..<br />
How ever its only for one number !<br />
<br />
I get a call from that number. But the contact name does not show up. I deleted my original contact and added it again from the Log &gt; Calls Received Number. Still the same problem.<br />
<br />
I have put my country code, area code and then the entire number. Also since I put it from the logs, I assume it should be what the phn will get every time there is a call from that number !<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Prasad

            Here's a list of the main reasons that caller ID fails to work - my bet is your problem is #1: it almost always is.<br />
<br />
1. Duplicate entries in contacts - by FAR the most common cause and unfortunately, the most awkward one to fix.<br />
<br />
If the phone finds the same number against more than one name, it doesn't know which to use so, perfectly sensibly, it defaults to showing the number.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix this is to remove duplicates from your contacts. Best way to do this would probably be in Outlook on the PC, but assuming you can't do that, then you have to find the numbers that aren't working a use the LATEST version of the
<a href="http://mobilesearch.nokia.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Search tool</a> to find the duplicate entries:<br />
<br />
NOTE: when you search, use PART of the number to avoid problems with formatting: searching for +441234567890 will NOT find +44 123 456 7890 whereas searching for 789 would.<br />
<br />
2. Using your international dial code instead of '+'<br />
<br />
Not sure if this applies to all phones, but if you store your number using your county's international dial code (eg: 004412345678990 - WRONG) instead of the '+' sign (+4412345678990 - RIGHT), it can cause problems.<br />
<br />
3. "(0)" area code prefixes<br />
<br />
Only a problem if you synch with MS Outlook. When you specify a country in MS Outlook, it will insert "(0)" into your phone number after the country code - while somewhere in Redmond, Bill Gates cackles - so +4412345678990 becomes +44 (0) 12345678990.<br />
<br />
You need to remove the (0).<br />
<br />
4. 9 and 10 digit numbers<br />
<br />
There has been one report of problems with 9 and 10 digit numbers where one size doesn't work with SMS and the other with calls. Not sure that anyone else has ever come across this.

            the way i fixed it was to clean all my contacts, put my sim in the old phone copy them to the sim then put the sim in the new phone and then copy sim to phone.

            I had the same problem with my new N95 8GB but the suggestion that it may be down to duplicate numbers seems to have worked for me too. The names concerned had both the normal mobile number + an international version with the relevent UK prefix. It seems
 the phone sees the main number and not the prefix, as explained elsewhere, and therefore is confused, so only displays the number. Hope this helps, even if it is a nuisance.

    <title>Omitting Blank Cells In Sort - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macuseronline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Omitting Blank Cells In Sort</h2>
                    I have 50 rows of customers in Column A. Column B has a corresponding invoice amount for 20 of the 50 customers. I want to use VBA to sort on Column B, however, I want the sort to be Ascending, without the empty cells starting at the top. With this code,
 it sorts on Column B, but all the blanks are put on the top of the list. I have numerous rows and the data is not static, so I can't hard code a sort range because the cells that are blank are always changing.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to omit blank cells when sorting?<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My sort code looks as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Columns("A:B").Select</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Clear</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Add Key:=Range("B1:B50"), SortOn:=xlSortOnValues, Order:=xlAscending, DataOption:=xlSortNormal</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Sort.SetRange Range("A1:B50")</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Sort.Header = xlNo: ActiveSheet.Sort.Apply.</p>

            <p>Try recording the following with the VB Macro recorder. This will give you a good code sample to start from.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Turn the recorder on</p>
<p>2. Select the data rage</p>
<p>3. On the Data menu choose Sort</p>
<p>4. Specify the column on which the sort is to be performed</p>
<p>5. Click OK</p>
<p>6. Turn the macro recorder off</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The column you specified should have the sort you described.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding your second question (in the future please ask each question separately), you can have only one macro assigned to an object. To achieve your objective, when the macro starts you would display a simple userform with controls on it that let the user
 options to choose either Ascending or Descending and then run the appropriate code based on their choice.</p>

    <title>Where is ability to add delay on touchpad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paularbour  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is ability to add delay on touchpad</h2>
                    <p>I am jumping from windows 7 to Windows 10, and I missed the Windows 8 step in between, but the internet tells me that there should be an option to add a delay when typing for the touchpad to activate. &nbsp;I keep having my keyboard controls jump all over the
 place when typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got as synaptics touchpad on my toshiba laptop, and as a last ditch effort to try and fix the issue I installed the full synaptics driver for Windows 8.1, in there I set the palm check as high as I can, and also the sensitivity way down, but still have
 trouble with my cursor jumping around when I type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the reason I can't see the option in the mouse settings to enable typing delay(if it is still present in Win10) is because Windows isn't properly recognizing my touchpad as such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe having a toggle over this type of hardware to force windows to decide it is a touchpad. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the interface when I open my Microsoft Word. I can't see texts, menus or anything. However, when I use my mouse to click on the same locations where the original function buttons are, it will perform exactly as it suppose to do. The problem is just
 I can't see anything that I'm clicking, and when I type out words on the document, all the texts are invisible. Is this some kind of bugs? I'm using a student subscription Office 365, the version is Office 16.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Microsoft Excel works normally, start it and click File | Options | Advanced. Select the option "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" which applies to all Office programs. Does that improve the situation in Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If disabling hardware graphics acceleration does not help, try repairing Office; see

<h2>            Comparing data in 2 Spreadsheets</h2>
                    <div>Hi </div>
<div>I'm no excel expert so need a bit of help to create a formula to compare 2 sets of data (one spreadsheet, 2 worksheets)</div>
<div>
<p>I'm trying to compare stock as at April 2018 to April 2019 that I have downloaded from our stock system to see which products have increased in stock since last year</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>However we have new product lines and obselete ones so the lines don't match up (and some of the columns).&nbsp; I need to be able look at worksheet 2018 and if a product description matches a product description in worksheet 2019 insert the quantity into the
 2019 sheet so I can compare the 2 </p>
<p>
</p><p>So in column A or Column B in Worksheet 2018 is the product description.&nbsp; Column C is the quantity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to insert Column C into 2019 worksheet when Column A or Column B in 2018 matches either Column A or B in the 2019 worksheet</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that makes sense - can anyone help me please?!</p>

            IMHO the best way is to use Get &amp; Transform (Power Query) and the Join feature.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-transform-in-excel-881c63c6-37c5-4ca2-b616-59e18d75b4de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-tr...</a>
<br />
<br />But I guess you never used that tool, please watch this video, best explanation I've ever seen. You'll see your task is easy to solve.

            Hi Sarath
<br />
<br />You need to uninstall Office and then install the 64bit version
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of the previous Office Installation:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />To get Office 2016 to install the 64bit version from the website is very difficult, it will keep defaulting to the 32bit version
<br />
<br />Your best option is to download the offline installer, then instead of running Setup.exe, open the Setup folder and run 'Setup64.exe' to ensure you get the 64bit version
<br />
<br />Full instructions for downloading the offline installer for Office 2016, can be found here:
<br />

<p>Generally speaking, changing from 32-bit to 64-bit Office is <em>not</em> an upgrade. It is a change. That you have a 64-bit operating system is not a reason to make this change.</p>

<p>I would have to TOTALLY disagree with this review...wonder if he works for Black Berry???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never had to reset the phone and the batter life is just fine.&nbsp; Phone works like a dream!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GPS works without any add ons.&nbsp; I've noticed with every phone there's always a few people that make it out to be the worst phone on the planet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LOVE THIS PHONE!!!</p>

<p>If you are looking to buy the TREO 800w I highly recommend that you quickly forget and look for something else. You would regret&nbsp;your purchase!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phone is a junk!!! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased it at the end of August 2008 and I had nothing but trouble with it and guess what... Palm support is useless!!! They blame everyone and everything just not their product!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have e-mail issues (you can read my posting <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/WindowsMobile/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=4034589&amp;SiteID=65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to soft reset my phone at least once a day! Since purchase, I had to do a least 3 hard resets!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery life is absolutely useless!!! Even on standby it won't last all day no matter how you set you settings!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPS is not a stand alone as they advertise it!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I could go on and on and on!!!</p>

<p>You are welcome to state your opinion, but just because you had problems with your specific phone does not mean that the rest of us have. I'll give it to you that the GPS is not true stand-alone as it was advertised, but I otherwise think that
 mine is wonderful. And I think that most of those on the 800w board at&nbsp;<a href="http://discussion.treocentral.com/forumdisplay.php?s=e70a5a4a90b010312377b370adcc5b4b&amp;f=199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://discussion.treocentral.com/forumdisplay.php?s=e70a5a4a90b010312377b370adcc5b4b&amp;f=199</a>
 would overall agree.</p>
<p>Regarding Palm's support, they offer a forum on their website at forums.palm.com where their own employees do watch the boards and assist. However, support of the device is the carrier's responsibility so you should be contacting Sprint, not
 Palm.</p>

<p><span>Before you go and spend hours trying to resolve your e-mail issues with Palm here what I have found out!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Treo 800w was built to ONLY support PAID e-mail accounts, such as Yahoo PLUS. If you using your free Yahoo or Hotmail or Gmail account and you have no issues with it according to Palm YOU ARE LUCKY!!!! But not for long, as according again
 to Palm your free account won't work for long, you will start having issues with it within a few months...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, your Bellsouth, or Comcast or any other account won't work fro the get go as those providers won't let you use Sprint's server to access their mail server, as such you can receive e-mails but you will never be able to send.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a piece of garbage device nothing else!</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Treo 800w, as with ALL Windows Mobile powered devices, is "built" to work with&nbsp;<strong><u>all</u></strong> POP, IMAP, and Exchange ActiveSync accounts. It supports all of these standards. What cannot be accounted for is whether or not your
 email host allows for such connections, etc. Yes, "free Yahoo" does not allow POP connections. That's Yahoo's choice, it has nothing to do with the phone. Yahoo wants to you to pay them for that feature regardless of the client that you use to access the account.
 Gmail on the other hand is completely free for both POP and IMAP access if you follow
<a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=78886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
their instructions</a> for setting it up properly. As for ISPs such as Bellsouth and Comcast, it is THEIR choice to choose what levels of service that they choose to provide. Again, that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the phone specifically.</p>

<p>I have been having a problem with my 800w and by Motorola H500. When I set up the Bluetooth connection on my phone it looks like its all set and connected.</p>
<p>When I make or receive a call it either:</p>
<p>- goes to the headset and have no issues</p>
<p>- goes to the headset but the phone drops the Bluetooth connection during the call and I have to pick the phone up to keep the call going</p>
<p>- it does not go to the headset at all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I talked to Palm tech and they claim it is an issue with my Bluetooth headset. I tried the headset with my other phone and had not issue. I have been thru several hard and soft resets and it did not solve the issue.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to check to see what devices are compatible with each other. If you choose not to I wouldn't later complain that they don't work. That's like when someone switches from a Palm OS device to a Windows Mobile device and
 then complains that their software isn't compatible. Yes it is possible that you may be able to pair the device simply because they are both compliant with the same version of the Bluetooth protocols, but compatibility is not guaranteed. Has Motorola tested
 that model headset with the Treo 800w and confirmed that is compatible and supported? I would guess not. Along the same lines, I already had the original Jawbone headset prior to getting my 800w and was not able to use it with my Treo 800w phone. Upon contacting
 Aliph, I was informed that the original Jawbone was not compatible with the Treo 800w. This did not prompt me to immediately dismiss the phone as garbage; I sucked it up and acquired a new headset that IS compatible with my phone.</p>

</p><p>Hi Walbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Go to the sheet and the cell where you want get the sum (for example, in cell C5 to Sheet1). Type = and select the cell you want to add from this sheet (for example cell C7), then type + and select the next sheet you want to add,
 for example Sheet2 and go to the desired cell (for example, cell D9), type again + and click on the other sheet, for example Sheet8 and select the desired cell (for example cell B3) and so on. After you have added all the cells of the diferent sheets press
 Enter to get the result. The formula you created will have to look like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">=SUM(Sheet1!C7+Sheet2!D9+....+Sheet8!B3+....)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">But if data that you want to sum are the same cell of each page (eg in cell E10) then you can use this formula:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">= SUM(Sheet1:Sheet12!E10)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">To get to such a formula you will need to press = in the cell you want to get the result (for example in cell E15 to Sheet1) and after you have selected cell E10 hold down the SHIFT key and select Sheet12. Press ENTER.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I used legacy tools "Text Form Field" to create a table where the student inputs his/her courses, credit hours, and the cost of the courses.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a "Text Form Field" to automatically calculate the total cost of the courses for the year to appear
 at the bottom of the table (that took a while to figure out how to do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the rest of the student's information, such as name, address,&nbsp;degree, etc, I used&nbsp;"Plain Text Content Control". There are also check boxes included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created signature lines by using inserting Microsoft signature lines.&nbsp; One would be used by the student, and two would be used by the supervisors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I would set the restrictions/protections, I would check the box that reads "Allow only this type of editing in the document" and set it to "Filling In Forms."</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the fields and calculations worked perfectly once the protections were enable, except for the Microsoft Signature Line.&nbsp; I was not able to insert a digital signature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, does anyone know how to create a protected fillable form (that includes calculations) that can be&nbsp;digitally signed by multiple people?</p>

            <p>This was my first time using content controls and legacy form fields.&nbsp; From watching tutorials online (granted several of them were a few years old), I used the content controls to create the fields for people to pick dates, and fill in basic information.&nbsp;
 However, I could not find a content control tutorial regarding signatures and inputting calculations.&nbsp; I only used the legacy fields for where people would input the cost of the courses.&nbsp; They worked perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an issue where the calculation would double the total cost of the courses.&nbsp; But I managed to fix that by having the formula divide itself by 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the Microsoft signature line I am having issues with.</p>

            The reason I asked is that, if you used only content controls, you would not have to protect the document for filling in forms, and the signature lines would work as expected. AFAIK, you can do everything with content controls that you can do with form
 fields. See <span><a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls.html</span></a>&nbsp;and<br />

            <p>Do note that content controls and formfields were not designed to work together and you may run into problems when doing so. As Suzanne said:</p>
<p><em>you can do everything with content controls that you can do with form fields</em></p>
<p>However, content controls don't work on Macs, either, and that too may be an issue in your environment.</p>

            Hi  rmgrahm7
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You can sign into the Office portal and download it.
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.
<br />
<br />All devices you sign into and use can install Office under the same account.

<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

<p>Hi Brian,<br />
<br />
It's possible that when your Word 2016 updated, the Office animations were automatically turned on. You can turn off that feature by following the steps on this

<h2>            SharePoint Header text is wrapping in the middle of a word</h2>
                    <p>I have header text that is wrapping in the middle of a word on my SharePoint page. So the word "Provider" breaks after the P so the P is on one line and "rovider" is on the second line (depending on the size of the browser window - it wraps fine most of
 the time but there is a size where this occurs). There is nothing in the code breaking the word and it is only happening with this one word on the page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting it and creating the header again and it still happens. Any ideas on how to keep it from breaking there?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Cliff,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply. The issue was happening in IE and Chrome on three separate computers (that we could access). It was simply &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copy went here with the word Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; - I created it simply by selecting the copy,
 choosing "Header 1" and making it bold through the wysiwyg. For some reason instead of breaking the word before "Providers" it broke the word in half. I tried everything I could think of, scanned the code, deleted and started over and it didn't fix the issue.
 Then another person went in from their computer, deleted it and redid it and the problem was solved. Super weird! Her computer usually shows the SharePoint formatting a little different than mine, so whatever is different with her computer I guess solved the
 problem when she saved it.</p>

                    <p>MS Excel 365 opens blank. No formula bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated to Windows 10 and purchased Office 365 and have not been able to use since the update. Other MS apps work fine.I have tried repairing, uninstalling, reinstalling etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uninstalled again and installed single license MS office 2016 which presented their own errors as well such as super large formula bar and a sheet with hundreds of small columns (no rows)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Must be an incompatibility issue between MS 365 and Win 10?</p>

            Hi ShaunND,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.
