    <title>Windows Mobile 6.5 device.exe error all sound stop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mobile 6.5 device.exe error all sound stop</h2>
                    <p>Since I got my HTC Touch Pro 2 a few years ago, from time to time would not ring at the alarm time or when a sms arrived. After a soft reset it would usually work fine. Sometimes it would also freeze, and a soft reset would be sufficed
 again. Last week, all sounds stopped (sms, alarm, reminder, call income and also a receiver of call would not hear me talking), the quickgps was asking to update location 2-3 x a day, and I started receiving error message of the device.exe. I made a hard reset
 yesterday and all worked well for a few hours until a new device.exe messaged appeared again. I have no apps or other softwares installed on the phone. All my pictures and excel and word documents are all in the memory card. Even if I ask for the phone to
 vibrate instead of ringing for the alarm, it does not work (but it does for sms and incoming calls). I was reading many of the past posts but did not managed to find a solution. Any idea how to solve the problem? Thanks</p>

            Hello. quickgps is an HTC app. Is it uninstallable or part of the ROM? I heard some people have to download it. I would try to somehow disable it or at least the notifications (o<span>pen quickgps from programs, press menu, options and uncheck
 reminder). It appears to be interfering with device.exe, which loads device drivers (e.g. sound). You might also try to disable gps completely to see if that helps. There is a link between that and the device.exe error.&nbsp;</span>

            Thanks Resourceful. As you suggested I disabled the notifications for the QuickGPS, as well the link for tracking when other apps are running (weather, time, location, etc), and putting on manual to any new download of position. I also changed the network
 search to manual, and disabled some other notifications. After a soft reset, all was working well, until after around one hour later, I got the device.exe error again. I notice that after a message of device.exe error if I do a soft reset, the phone sound
 works fine until the next message pops up. Could it be that the alarm clock is interfering on the device drivers? If so, should I disable all alarms in the installed software and install another app that would work as an alarm clock? Cheers

            Hello. It could be a true hardware failure generating the device.exe error or some minor software glitch. But the hard reset should have taken care of any software interferences and you said that you haven't installed any apps. See if turning off error
 reporting helps at all (Start&gt;settings&gt;system&gt;error reporting). I know it is not getting to the root cause but at this point it could be anything. If it is the alarm and it is triggering a sound that the sound card can't generate, then the error will persist
 even with a new app.&nbsp;

            Hi Resourceful. I turned error reporting off, but no luck. The phone continue to work fine after I remove the battery, but after one or two hours the sound stops. One thing that I notice after the hard reset is that 3 contacts appear on my list (may be
 they were there before but I didn't notice as I had not added new contacts for a while) that have strange character, mostly in Greek. First I thought it was generated by the reporting error.m Two of them are easily erased, but one most of the time cannot.&nbsp;
 Once again thanks for your time trying to help, much appreciated.<br />

            Hello. Hmmm. Never heard of that. Hard reset should return to factory conditions and no contacts should be on the device. Did you get the device new or used? The TP2 came with 6.1 installed but did have an official update to 6.5. I am wondering if it has
 a custom ROM installed. &nbsp;I would probably start looking for a new device. I am going to refer you to a couple of specialty sites (hardcore users) specific to the TP2 (you might already know about them). Unfortunately, they aren't very active anymore due to
 the age of the device but it doesn't hurt to post. If you are so inclined, there are options to explore (e.g. reflashing the ROM and even android) if you like to "tinker" with things. Good Luck.&nbsp;

            Hi Resourceful. I got my phone new in 2010, and it is running on Windows Mobile 6.5. The strange numbers in the contact list are not delete because they are saved on the SIM card. I'm going through some of the post on the links you sent. I had seen some,
 but the list is much more complete. I'd like to keep the device because it is quite handy to have the keyboard when I go to the field (I'm a biologist), and also because I try to use all electronics to their maximum life to avoid to much garbage (and climate
 change). I'll try to see if I can reflash the ROM or install android system myself, otherwise I need to look for a technician (not so easy in a small and far away country). Thanks for all your help, really appreciated.<br />

            Hello. Oh, the SIM card. I keep forgetting about that because my cellular provider doesn't use them, at least for storage/activation purposes. I totally agree on your "green" view of things. I have devices accumulating that are perfectly good and I don't
 want to send them off to recycling. As long as they function for you, use them. I used to be pretty adamant about a physical keyboard, too, and I am still pretty slow on the virtual ones. But I adapted. There are some devices with keyboards, yet, so you could
 still upgrade. Don't hesitate to post back if you need any further support, questions about other platforms, &nbsp;or just can't get answers on the other site(s). I am a tinkerer and have done some ROM flashing in the past.&nbsp;

<p>Here is a link for anyone else having the same problem:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/nav-voice-only/bc28fb6c-7b6d-4f7e-a72f-1f9bd23b91c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/nav-voice-only/bc28fb6c-7b6d-4f7e-a72f-1f9bd23b91c5</a></p>

    <title>Using macro to create charts from selection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using macro to create charts from selection</h2>
                    <p>I'm doing a lot of repetitive data work and I'm trying to use some macros to speed things up, but I'm new to macros and VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several data sets, each separated by a few empty rows, in columns A and B. I want to highlight the data I need, use a keyboard shortcut to generate a chart, and then format it to a template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the chart on the same active sheet</p>
<p>I can either highlight the entire range, or even better, select the top A cell and have all of the contiguous adjacent cells included in the graph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this code for inserting a chart:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 127, 1)">Sub</span><span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">&nbsp;CreateChart()</span><br />

</p><p><span>But I've been unable to put them together and make them work for me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried recording a macro, but when I try to use it, it always goes back and uses the recorded data range instead of the currently selected one. I can't figure out how to edit it to use the current selection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Could someone help me figure out how to write this code? Since I'm new it would be great if you could also explain what you are doing if it's not too much trouble.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Edit: If nothing else it would be helpful if someone could tell me how to change the default chart. I can only see how to do it in older versions of excel (maybe only in windows).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

    <title>How to turn off Alt functions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david kovalev  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to turn off Alt functions&#63;</h2>
                    I use Word in two languages. The key combination to switch the language input is Shift+Alt, but when I use Word, the Alt functions pop up any time I switch. I don't use Alt functions, and don't intend to, but I really need to turn them off so that they
 don't break the flow of writing. I tried to google it, but nothing useful is coming up. Help?

<p>Have you tried turning off the options for the Language bar in Windows regional settings? In particular, disable the shortcuts for switching languages. (The screen shot below is from Windows 7.)<br />

<p>I believe you are talking about the Ribbon tooltips that appear when you press the Alt key.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c1b1b08-1ba4-4e9e-91c9-c9fd77cadb5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c1b1b08-1ba4-4e9e-91c9-c9fd77cadb5e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAIK, there is no way to turn these off. I understand that you want to continue to be able to switch keyboards from the keyboard rather than the language bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have modified the keyboard shortcuts to change keyboards on my computer to Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+0. In my version of Windows (10) I have slightly different control panels than shown by Stefan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d40340e1-8857-4527-8089-6b28ec2c5922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d40340e1-8857-4527-8089-6b28ec2c5922" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Those keyboard shortcuts are normally used in Word to directly change the paragraph spacing. Since I do such formatting usually through styles and otherwise use the paragraph formatting dialog, it does not conflict with my use of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not need a keyboard method of switching languages (i.e. can use the mouse) you could use the language bar instead.</p>

<h2>            Emails that Inbox at 100&#37; at other Mailbox Providers are Inboxing at 0&#37; at Hotmail</h2>
                    <p>We use Return Path on a daily basis to monitor Inbox placement for our Campaigns. Over the past month or so, despite our best efforts to root out a cause, Hotmail Inbox rates have essentially fallen to 0% for each seed email. In comparison, across the other
 13 Mailbox Providers we test against, our Inbox placement is 100%.</p>

            <p>OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please realize that we have done this already. Multiple times. And then we finally got a callback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result was an hour long chat with a Level 2 rep named Ruth M. She began by repeatedly asking if she could take control of my laptop to diagnose the issue. I pleaded with her many times that Inbox placement could not be diagnosed in that way, but she
 insisted that she needed to "collect logs" before she could escalate the issue. I finally had to relent and give her control, in violation of our stated security policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a series of dubious steps (including taking screenshots of a modal window that contained header text, using my laptop to start a new chat with a senior engineer), she then proceeded to,
<strong>without warning</strong>, install a network capture tool on my work laptop. I immediately revoked control and asked for escalation to a different engineer. She refused. I then asked to be routed to another group. She refused. I then asked for her manager
 or supervisor. She refused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To say that this sequence of events is the low point of my experience with Microsoft would be a gross understatement. The complete absence of ownership, accountability, or even basic professional competence displayed by this support rep surprised everyone
 in the room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, we have done all the steps. We are an ESP in business for 15 years sending out tens of millions of emails per day that typically Inbox at 98% or greater. So we know the steps.</p>

<h3> evanstreb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create a word document with unlimited margins&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Office 2010, and I would like to create a Word document that has no limits to how wide or how tall I can make it. I don't&nbsp;want it divided into separate&nbsp;pages; I don't&nbsp;want it to only have&nbsp;8.5 inches of width to work with, I just want&nbsp;it to be
 limitless.&nbsp;I only want it to wrap when I do a carriage return. I don't plan on printing this document, so the difficulty of fitting it all within the dimensions of a physical sheet of paper is not an issue. How do I set up my document to work like this?

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I would not use Word for this but Quicken, QuickBooks or some other check-writing/bookkeeping program. While it can be done in Word, possibly as a mail merge, it will not be easy and will consume probably at least a day of time. IMO, this would only be worth doing in Word if you were going to repeat the task many times. Even then, a check-writing program would be far better.
<br />
<br />See the section on pre-printed forms here:
<br /><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/forms.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/forms.htm</a>
<br />
<br />For mailmerge, see <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/mailmerge.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/mailmerge.htm</a>.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />

 @Hotmail on my skype, OneNote, winlive im, OneDrive and my Microsoft acct.&nbsp; it all still works but does not save anything. So I guess i need to create a new Microsoft acct.&nbsp; oh and my win10 uses the Hotmail too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some guidance greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I prefer
 to use Gmail if possible.</p>

<p><br />
Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum. I'm sorry for the delayed response. I'd like to follow up if you still have the Hotmail app on your phone, if it is still not upgraded to Outlook.com app. If yes, then provide us more information for investigation.
 Please answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you encounter any error message on the app? </li><li>Have you tried removing then re-adding your account on the app for troubleshooting?
</li><li>Does the same problem happen if you use a different account? </li><li>How about if you use a different internet connection on your device?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your answers.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>

    <title>Nokia 6500 Slide just turned off and won&#39;t come back on. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 6500 Slide just turned off and won&#39;t come back on.</h2>
                    
<p>I was on the phone to a friend and I noticed that he was starting to break up, I could hardly hear him then all of a sudden it went silent. I thought no biggie, because it's happened a few times. So I turn the phone around to redial and I notice the screen
 is blank, thought it must've turned itself off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I turned it back on, the Nokia loading screen came up, but then it went blank again, then white and it just turned itself off. Before it turns itself off, it's just a blank white screen and I can see the date in the top left hand corner, but nothing else
 loads. The pixels kinda dissolve on the screen too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It beeps a couple of times when the blank screen appears, but other than that it does nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never had any problem like this before, it couldn't have overheated because I was only on the phone for about 10 minutes and my room is cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help?</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's the software, I tried entering the code to do a deep reset, but the screen keeps changing from blank to white and It's not possible to enter the combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can reset this phone without turning it on?</p>

<p>Looks like your phone won't power up properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure your battery is charged.</p>
<p><br />
Firstly remove the battery for at least 5 minutes and then replace and see if that makes any difference. Also try removing the memory card.<br />
<br />
Then try the "3 finger deep reset". With the phone powered off, depress and hold these three keys simultaneously "*" "3" "green phone" and then power on phone using the on/off button whilst keeping the three keys depressed until you hear start-up tone.<br />
This should ONLY be done if the device doesn't power up normally anymore and it wipes everything in the Phone memory that is not part of the ROM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you have a previous backup of your phone, you will lose your data.</p>

<p>I removed the memory card and restarted the phone. I see a new screen now, which is blue and has the date and time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the only problem is that the screen keeps switching to blank and turning itself off before I can do anything.</p>

<p>FYI - I left the battery out of the phone for about 48hrs, just put it in again without having done anything else and it seems to be working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had the phone crash before (it's a bit tempremental, esp if you talk on it for a while and it gets hot), but this serious crash is new.&nbsp; It's a bit of a worry.&nbsp; Needless to say, I'm backing it all up right now!</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I turn on Live tile support for WP7 WHS 2011 connector.</h2>
                    <p>I installed the WP7home server connector software on my phone and the corresponding add-in on my server. All works very well, BUT the Life tile function I can not turn on. I can go to the settings screen, but can't enable the life tile support and also the
 back button does not work anymore and the only way to leave the window is by using the home button. The icon of the tile remains this deafult picture of a 'server'. &nbsp;installed version on the phone is 1.0 (indicated on the about screen, although in the market
 place 1.1.0.0 is indicated). Installed version on the server is (1.0.0.0)&nbsp;. Current OS version on my WP7 is:7.0.7392.0 (HTC HD7). I uninstalled the version on my phone and reinstalled in again, but this made no difference (not in function not in version)</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            What? Performing a system update doesn't wipe or reset the phone. The only app I've seen so far that is removed from the devices is the Xbox Live Xtras app since its functionality is being integrated into the Games Hub.<br />

    <title>nontraditional sort in a form - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            nontraditional sort in a form</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a subform that tracks courses a student has taken, including the year and semester. I'd like to sort as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primarily by Year in descending order, followed by semester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The values for the semester are Spring, Summer, Fall - this is the problem. I'd like to sort this way (taking into account that a student did not attend courses throughout all years):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2013 Summer</p>
<p>2013 Spring</p>
<p>2012 Fall</p>
<p>2012 Summer</p>
<p>2012 Spring</p>
<p>2011 Summer</p>
<p>2010 Summer</p>
<p>2010 Spring</p>
<p>2009 Fall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this was Excel, I could do a custom sort on the semester field - is there any way to do that in Access without programming?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help with this!</p>
<p>Tammy</p>

            I assume that the year and semester are different fields. &nbsp; Create a table Semesters with fields Semester and SortOrder like this --
<div>Semester &nbsp;SortOrder</div>
<div>Spring &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1</div>
<div>Summer &nbsp; &nbsp;2</div>
<div>Fall &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3</div>
<div>Winter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4</div>
<div><br />
<div>Join you Semester field to the Semester field of table Semesters and use the SortOrder fielld for sorting.</div>

 is my name, birth date and address.&nbsp; I cannot provide any email addresses that I have sent emails to - as they ask - because the account was just created.&nbsp; I also cannot provide any Skype names - because the account was just created.&nbsp; Why is my personal information
 not enough? I really need to access this account and am beyond frustrated.</p>

<p>Hello Itamar. Long time no talk.&nbsp;I sold eMicrophones.com almost 2 years ago and have 99% retired. I still have the Toolkit and Macro book up for sale on a new web site. Otherwise am enjoying being a senior citizen with 4 hobbies and lots of travel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not having Windows 10 Preview, could you detail where to find WSR? </p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been modest but undocumented&nbsp;changes to the speech engine&nbsp;since we met at the Vista preview in Redmond in 2006. The WSRMacros is more robust. See screenshot below. However, the WSRToolkit still makes it easier to create macros through the macro
 wizard and to create nested macros to activate multiple commands in a series.</p>

            Dear Marty, Good to hear from you. I have long purchased your application and have been using it to improve accuracy. I also tried to use it for regulating the microphone, but this has not changed much. I am afraid I must report that WSR malfunctioned
 completely when I tested it again under W10 Preview. It simply did not work, whatever I tried to do, and I even could not train a new profile to make it respond more positively. By contrast, DNS 13 (Premium) worked beautifully. This I find quite alarming,
 because if DNS remains the only SR program on the market, it will soon deteriorate as monopolies tend to do. BTW, who is in charge in e-microphones? Anyone I might know?<br />

<p>&gt;&nbsp;I also tried to use it for regulating the microphone, but this has not changed much.
</p>
<p>Microsoft changed something in the audio sub system relating to microphone. In WSR the Setup microphone utility seems to work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; I am afraid I must report that WSR malfunctioned completely when I tested it again under W10
</p>
<p>It must have to do with the Preview version. It will likely be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; By contrast, DNS 13 (Premium) worked beautifully.</p>
<p>Dragon 12 is almost perfect for me and I see no reason to go to 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; BTW, who is in charge in e-microphones? Anyone I might know?</p>
<p>eMicrophones.com was sold to Speech Recognition Solutions. Jon Wahrenberger is the owner.&nbsp;Larry Allen and I have discussed the microphone situation concerning Dragon. We both feel the audio in Dragon seems to handle most microphones almost optimally. 2 1/2
 years ago my wife and I&nbsp;were at a noisy Bat Mitzvah.&nbsp;I dictated an email on my Android Samsung Smartphone with the band playing loudly and people at the table speaking loudly. My wife looked at the dictated text, said there was not a mistake and I should sell
 eMicrophones.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When&nbsp;Microsoft, launched Outlook.com preview,&nbsp;Microsoft shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will
 be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to Garry_V's post to check if you still have on option to switch back to Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            C6-00 Flash player is playing step by step, continuity missing and unable for Fwd &#64; good quality</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is the problem associated with nokia C6-00,</p>
<p>yes the Qwerty keypad with Full touch&nbsp; Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is playing Flash video is not good quality.</p>
<p>Mean to say continuity in playing is missing.</p>
<p>Sound is coming correctly but video is playing step by step(continuity of the Video is like playing photos in slide show).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if You forward or do something like increasing the Volume or something (i.e..) touching any of the players input.&nbsp; :smileysad:&nbsp;&nbsp; :smileysad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video's continuity&nbsp; affected much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the worst then the First appearance.</p>
<p>First appearance is also bad in continuity.</p>
<p>If u touched any of the players input the continuity is even worst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm expecting the Good quality flash video player for Nokia C6-00 for the next software updated(firmware)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls Consider This problem too,</p>
<p>For the next update.</p>

<h2>            Activating preloaded Office suite on new pc</h2>
                    I have a full suite of Office 2007 preloaded on my new&nbsp; laptop pc.&nbsp; It requires an activation code to purchase of course.&nbsp; I already own Office Home and Student which I have on my desktop and it comes with license to activate on 3 pc's.&nbsp; Can I&nbsp;enter &nbsp;the
 activation code from my Home and Student Office into the full office 2007 on the new pc and would that then just give me access to the smaller suite of applications from Home and Student or do I first need to uninstall the full Office 2007 suite from the laptop
 and then install Home and Student?&nbsp; I have no need for Outlook or Access that comes with the full Office 2007 version.

<p>Each Office suite has a unique product key.&nbsp; You can't use the JHome and Student product key on a more complete Office suite to selectively activate some of the apps (although that's a good idea; Microsoft should use it).&nbsp; You'll need to uninstall the trial
 Office suite that was preloaded and then install the one whose license you own.</p>
