<h2>            move accepted meeting requests to a subfolder</h2>
                    <p>outlook 2013 -&nbsp;on an exchange server </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i receive a meeting request and i accept, the meeting request gets moved to my deleted items folder.&nbsp; i know that i can change an option to have that item remain in my inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however, what i really want to do, is to have the mail item move to a custom folder after i accept or decline the invitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have tried multiple types of rules.&nbsp; nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You'll need to use VBA. I don't think i have any samples that do this though.

            <p>I'm not sure if it would be better to use a macro to accept and move (<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook-developer/accept-or-decline-a-meeting-request-using-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/outlook-developer/accept-or-decline-a-meeting-request-using-vba/</a>&nbsp;-
 has the accept part) or one to watch for meeting invites in the deleted folder (ItemAdd event) and move them.&nbsp; ItemAdd is automated but would move invites you want deleted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As an FYI, it's as simple as adding oRequest.Move myFolder to the macro on that page. You will need to dim and set the folder name - 4 extra lines total.

<p>I use a free ad blocker called: &nbsp;&nbsp; Webmail AdBlocker<br />
</p>
<p>It blocks all ads on the right side of my inbox. I do not know if it will block the ads you see at the bottom of your inbox .... but you could give it a try to see if it helps solve your problem. If not, you can easily remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are separate versions of Webmail Ad Blocker for Firefox and for Chrome (be sure to get the version that corresponds to the browser you use ... sorry, I do not think there is a version for IE).</p>

            Adverts on right-hand side of Hotmail screen. I just increased my screen size to 130%, and adverts don't appear. Don't have a solution to adverts at the bottom of the screen. I'm a 77 year old pension who started with computers just 10 years ago. Still
 don't know very much about computers but I manage.

<h2>            Bulk move messages to folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p><strong>Objective :</strong> I want to get to a zero inbox. &nbsp;I want to keep my emails for historical purposes, but need to put them in folders by year.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Setup :&nbsp;</strong></strong>Running Outlook 2016 with office 365 Business.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plan :</strong> I want to move 21,599 emails out of my inbox into folders organized by year. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attempt : &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Create a rule to find move emails from date 01/01/2012 to date 12/31/2012 into folder 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the rule wizard i choose Run this rule on messages already in the inbox.</p>
<p>It runs for 15 minutes without error and nothing happened. &nbsp;My email counts are the same my 2012 email folder is still empty.</p>

<p>I don't care if this is a bug or if there is a limit of some kind, but is there another way of managing these emails? &nbsp;One thought I just had would be to use a gmail account, connect it to my Office 365 via imap and use gmail search and move features, which
 I know works.</p>



<p>Eg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2012, 2013, 2014.</p>

<p>while i would still like to do this in outlook 2016 (or any version) or the office 365 cloud, i was able to accomplish my goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. i install mozilla's thunderbird email applications (just search google)</p>
<p>2. pointed it to microsoft using imap settings (google that too)</p>
<p>3. gave it about 30 min to load all my email (headers only).</p>
<p>4. from the inbox on the left right click and subscribe, this is how you pull in your other outlook folders, click the ones you want</p>
<p>5. right click inbox on the left nav and select search messages (see image for next steps).</p>
<p>6. using the filter box select the criteria you want, for me it was date is before and date is after.</p>
<p>7. click search</p>
<p>8. ctrl-a to select all items</p>
<p>9. click move to</p>
<p>10. select the folder that you previously subscribed to.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=838882b4-5771-442e-9489-79f973012d99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d838882b4-5771-442e-9489-79f973012d99" /></a></p>
<p>in the end it worked, it took about 40 min for all my emails to move and now i have a zero in-box. &nbsp;just need to keep it clean going forward.</p>

<p>I have had to deal with Legacy boot in the past when I had to swap between W7 and W8 era hard drives.&nbsp; Sort of odd that a rollback starts messing with UEFI and Legacy settings.&nbsp; As I recall, Legacy must be set when a W8&nbsp; era PC is using a W7 era hard drive.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that your BIOS load order has changed?&nbsp; When I fry a W10 O/S, I have to go to BIOS to change the load order to load from the USB that I get using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; I try to remember to change the load order back to C. &nbsp; I think my
 HP will default to Drive C if no USB is inserted.&nbsp; However, if I forget to change the load order back to C, then on a new start with a USB inserted, it will try to load from the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried removing all add ons to the PC like USB, DVD, camera cards, etc. &nbsp; For sure, looks like it no longer is pointed to load from C.&nbsp; On a BIOS load, the partitions get re-set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>UEFI installation has GPT partition system whereas BIOS has MBR partition system. Therefore, you cannot repair UEFI installation by booting to legacy BIOS. You must convert GPT system to MBR system first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before all else, what I suggest is, enable <strong>UEFI mode </strong>again and disable
<strong>Secure Boot </strong>in UEFI firmware to see if you can boot now, of course if you have not tampered with your installation to the point where return is impossible. If you can boot to Windows, then you can re-enable Secure Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secure Boot may prevent booting to your previous OS build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>On my Desktop System the motherboard is one of the early ones that had the UEFI Option but I have kept it in Legacy Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you understand the UEFI. Some of the articles I have seen say it is supposed to be better. Is there no way to manage multi boot with UEFI or is it more difficult to repair. Better is supposed to mean easier.:)</p>

            &nbsp;Cal54 in this case "better" for UEFI means more secure.&nbsp; It's pretty easy to turn on legacy mode with most PCs, but there is a bit of a learning curve.&nbsp; Better or not though, it's here to stay.

<p>Thank you for your comments. Sorry to say but I could not quite get if you are mocking or flattering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, UEFI and Secure Boot are two different things, as you may well know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI has many properties that are superior to BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming to what I said, I said <strong>Secure Boot may prevent booting</strong>. I did not say
<strong>UEFI is better but more difficult to rep</strong><strong>air</strong>. If this is what you mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the motherboard has CSM ( Compatibility Support Module ), then multi-booting- UEFI and BIOS together- is possible. If this is what you are referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my desktop, I have one W10 ( upgraded from W8.1 ) on MBR disk ( BIOS-based install ) and another W10 ( Insider Build ) on GPT disk ( UEFI-based install ). They go well in the same computer provided CSM is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My notebook has an early example of UEFI motherboard. It is UEFI compatible but has no secure boot and no CSM. But you can do legacy-BIOS install or UEFI install, not both at the same time.</p>
<p>

            Connect your device to your PC and look to see where it is listed in Device Manager.&nbsp; Remove it, reboot the PC and soft reset the device.&nbsp; Connect again and see if it downloads and installs the drivers.<br />
<br />
If that does not work, try unchecking Advanced Network Functionality (Uncheck the Enable faster data synchronization checkbox located in START/SETTINGS/CONNECTIONS/USB to PC)&nbsp;and then connect&nbsp; via USB to see if that makes a difference.

<h2>            Android 7.0 and access to Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Having just received a new phone, I am trying to set up the Office 365 apps (OneNote, PowerPoint etc) - but whenever I try to log in, I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't connect to the server</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error occurred while setting up a secure connection to the server. The security configuration on the server might be incompatible with this version of Office or your device might be missing the required security certificates for this server. Please contact
 your admin or ask the Microsoft community at http://answers.microsoft.com for help with installing the certificates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching http://answers.microsoft.com, I have found one article that resembles the above error:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2986830.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have following the instructions; identified the certificate used, by logging in to Office 365 from my laptop, exported the certificate and then imported it on the phone - but I still get the error above</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I can log in to the web access Office 365 through Chrome, and it will tell me under "certificate information" that it verified that Microsoft IT SSL SHA2 issued the certificate - but through the apps, no luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone is a Huawei Mate 9 Pro with Android 7.0</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 on Mac OS Sierra Unable To Save To NAS</h2>
                    My Mac OS and Office are both up to date. However, since updating to Office 2016 using a 365 subscribtion, whenever I save a document on my NAS, my whole system freezes. Using the same hardware and OS, I had no problem saving documents on my Office 2011.
 Are there any ways to solve the problem?

<p>Hi E Choi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following tings:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur with all Office 2016 for Mac applications?</p>
<p>2. Check if you can save files to local drive or OneDrive/OneDrive for Business. We want to know if the issue is only related to NAS.</p>
<p>3. Is the issue only related to saving operation? Will system freeze when you edit the file?
</p>
<p>3. How do your Mac connected with NAS? </p>
<p>4. Open Word&gt;click Word on the top bar&gt;About Word&gt;capture a screenshot of the pop-up. Meanwhile, click Apple icon on the top bar&gt;About This Mac&gt;capture a screenshot of your Mac OS version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi E Choi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not able to find my answer but i will do it here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue occur with Words ans Excel (the 2 that i use) (I use MS Office 2011)</p>
<p>It works to open and save files to iCloud Drive, seem to be related to NAS</p>
<p>It occurs as soon that i try to open a file (Words or Excel) (double clic the file and it crash)</p>
<p>My mac is connected as reference user to the NAS and hard wire (Cat 5 ) via Ethernet</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to work fine with El Capinan, but my hard disk crashed and replaced it. Reinstall Sierra and reinstall MS Office. The problem appeared at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can open and save any file to the NAS with any other program. (Acrobat, Aperçu...)</p>
<p>On an other iMac computer now with El Capitan, it works fine. Can open and save files to the NAS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to be a problem between Sierra and MS Office!!</p>
<p>Thanks to try to solve the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Denis</p>

<h2>            shadow blank page</h2>
                    When I open a Word or Excel document, a blank blue&nbsp;page&nbsp;launches behind the opened file as well.&nbsp;When I close the file that I'm working on, I have to click the shadow page to close it as well. It doesn't seem to affect anything but it's annoying and I'd
 like to&nbsp;stop it from popping up.

 using something like Excel and have a file open and then choose Close, the file will close, but Excel will still be running and you could open another file or work on ones that were still open. If you choose Exit, all files will be closed, and the application
 will stop completely. When closing or exiting, you will be given a chance to save files that you are working on.</span></p>

<h2>            Preview 15031 will not install</h2>
                    <p>Preview Build 15031 in downloading and failing in a loop. It started giving 0x8024200D so I deleted the install folder and the windows\softwaredistribution\downloads folder. Then it fails with 0x800704c7. I then ran sfc /scannow. There were no errors. Update
 still failed so I ran dism &nbsp;/online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and it fails with 0x800f081f stating something about a valid source could not be found. tries the upgrade again and now getting 0x800700b7 solid. Went into settings - Update &amp; Security and tried
 the Contact support link but it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used msconfig to disable all non-Microsoft services and task manager to kill all startup items. Same error. I have ran many online malware scans and other malware detectors. The only AV installed is Windows Defender and I see no symptoms of malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea where to go from here? Any idea how I can start a chat with support since the link doesn't work?</p>

            <p>You can't chat with support, Previews are not supported, all you have is you, this forum and some others on the net.</p>
<p>What build are you currently running? How did you install it? What system make and model are you running on?</p>
<p>If you run anything older than 15025, download the ISO for this build from the insiders download and perform a clean install. Check if all goes well with 15025 and proceed from there.

            Thanks for the reply. I haven't installed anything new. I'm having a couple issues with this build but issues with previews are expected. I've never had update issues before and this is proving to be a tough one. I'm going to P2V the laptop so I can try
 some more aggressive stuff without worry.

<h2>            IE 10 with windows 8 and yahoo mail compatibility issues</h2>
                    <div>New mail yahoo says my browser is not compatible, keep getting this message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
You're almost there, but your web browser doesn’t support the newest version of att.net Mail
<p>Upgrade to a faster, more secure version of a supported browser. It's free and it only takes a few moments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Firefox</a>
</li><li><a href="http://downloads.yahoo.com/p/att/ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Internet Explorer (for Windows)</a>
</li><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safari</a>
</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>

<div>
To return to a previous version of att.net Mail...
<ul>
<li>Just this one time, etc...</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initially yahoo mail worked, like on the first day (after first boot of a new laptop or fresh install of Win 8 on all my 4 PC/desktop/laptop) and doesn't work the next day. I don't want to return to a previous version of att.net mail and really want to
 use IE10. I'm really liking IE10 if you can get Yahoo mail to work this will be my main browser! Right now, I had to go back and install Chrome for all my web browsing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already tried disabling add-ons and tried turning on and off the compatibility view.</div>
</div>
</div>

            <p>Here is the fix to get yahoo email( not the classic)</p>
<p>1.Try to access the site, my response was&nbsp; OOPS! do not close that page.</p>
<p>2. Go to tools, then compatibility view settings.</p>
<p>3. The web address for the new AT&amp;T webmail should be displayed.</p>
<p>4. Hit add ,and the new email should display. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked for me, apparently AT&amp;T and Microsoft&nbsp; cant figure out anything</p>

<p>Glad it worked out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key to remember is that you have to do the activation in the States. </p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: each year you have to go back to the PBX or where ever you bought the key. If you do an auto renew it will most likely be at normal retail price. In other words, turn off auto renew on the MyAccount webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can buy more than one product key at a time.</p>
<p>You may activate up to 5 keys at the same time to extend your subscription for a maximum of 5 years at a time.

            <p>You might have to force the installation to start, you do this by </p>
<p>1. Press the windows key (the key that has the windows logo) on your keyboard and the R key thus winkey+R</p>
<p>2. The run window will pop-up with open: and an empty box.</p>
<p>3. copy and paste "C:\$Windows.~BT" with or without the quotation marks into the run pop-up window empty box</p>
<p>4. Press ok</p>
<p>5. The C:\$Windows.~BT folder will open just double click on setup and follow the steps slowly and make sure you choose the option for keeping your files when asked, and you should be fine.</p>
<p>6. Hope this helps.</p>

            Make sure all your drivers are up to date. I was having a issue that sounds about the same. Video card driver was out dated. Once everything was updated it installed just fine.

            <p>I had this issue. The answer is to download the Media Creation Tool and select the Version-like x 64- and burn it to DVD, Then run the DVD and get Windows 10-the biggest mistake you will make if you are a Windows Insider!</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are not a Windows Insider and are trying to get the "Give Away Anniversary Edition" that program is over! There is no more FREE Windows 10. If you get on Goggle Chrome and find the Anniversary Edition", it will not give you a Free Electronic Activation
 any longer. The time has pass and gone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can get Windows 10 by joining Windows Insider-the biggest mistake you can make!</p>
<p>&nbsp;I talked with a IT Professional and he said he tried them both and when back to Windows 7 because the load time was 3or more time faster than Windows 10. He said Windows 10 was a down grade!</p>

<h2>            Outlook Needs Password</h2>
                    <p>Details: Windows 10 Pro 64 bit using Click-to-run office 2016 32 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had 3 instances of users stating that outlook keeps asking for a password in the bottom right corner. When I click on the box to input credentials the dialog box disappears instantly. I have done repair, uninstall and reinstall, deleting profile,
 and mess around with the registry and nothing has worked. The only thing that has worked for me is to do a OS reinstall. I have a network with over 50 users and 3 have already had this issue so far. I want to get ahead of this issue before more have this issue.
 Please any input would help me immensely.</p>

<p><span>Hello notbydesign029,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given your situation, have you changed password recently? The expired password is a possible cause, I suggest you sign into
<a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 portal</a> and check if it prompts to change password.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, have you turned on MFA (multi-factor authentication) for your Office 365 organization? If so, you need to turn on ADAL (Active Directory Authentication Library) for your Outlook 16 clients, or you
 may need to enter app password to sign into Outlook. For more information about MFA, you can refer to:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up multi-factor authentication for Office 365 users.</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, I also suggest you set the below registry key to 1 in below path, some users who have similar problem with you solved their problem by this. You can give it a try see if it can help:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Open <strong>Registry Editor</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Path:&nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity</span></p>
<p><span>3. Key:&nbsp;DisableADALatopWAMOverride (DWORD)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For your reference: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/3126599/outlook-prompts-for-password-when-modern-authentication-is-enabled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/3126599/outlook-prompts-for-password-when-modern-authentication-is-enabled</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: Please backup the registry key before you modify it.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem persists, please provide us the following information at your convenience for further checking:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. A screenshot of “outlook keeps asking for a password in the bottom right corner”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your Outlook version. You can view it via
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am looking forward to your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hi Mel,<br />
<br />
This issue may be hardware or software related, given you were able to use your phone for few days and have confirmed with the network operators that there is no issue with their services. To verify if the issue is software related, we suggest that you perform
 a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">
soft reset</a>. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're just here if you have further questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Usually it should show the location of the last uploaded files, you may optimize Internet Explorer and then check.</p>

<p>Note : Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This
 includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</p>

            That didnt do anything, reset all my stuff so now I gotta reset everything but still goes to my documents as default when I go to upload my next item. Chrome remembers and opens up the pictures folder again why wont IE? I thought it used to in the older
 versions.

<h2>            Word doesn&#39;t save files to my default save folder</h2>
                    <p>Using Office 2010 on Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set my default save folder (File --&gt; Options --&gt; Save --&gt; Default file location) to the network server that I've been assigned. But when I create a new file and Save or Save As, Word wants to save it locally in My Documents.</p>

            <p>Word certainly should be able to save by default to a network directory, at least it does so in my test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can verify that the location setting has been saved in your registry. Using regedit.exe, open the key&nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Options and examine the value named DOC-PATH. It should show the correct path, either in \\server\folder
 (UNC) format or as a regular Windows path for a mapped drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the path is missing or incorrect, you might have a permission problem in the registry that prevents the Word options dialog from writing the correct value (the local My Documents folder is the default if the value is missing). Try some of the links from&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=repair+registry+permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=repair+registry+permissions</a>.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook for Mac &#40;Office 365&#41; Using 125&#37; of CPU</h2>
                    Nice update to the program, as least as far as the UI is concerned, but the CPU of my 2013 MacBook Air (running Yosemite) is blasting at 95-125% almost constantly. Activity Monitor doesn't indicated anything else is the issue. And, for the first time,
 the cursor — on occasion — won't even allow me to click on another program. Waiting five or more minutes frees up enough resources to move along, but the fan is going full tilt all the time and killing the battery. Obviously not ideal. Any ideas?

<p>
</p><p>Exit all programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Under applications right click on Microsoft Outlook &amp; go to show package contents) Applications/Microsoft Outlook/SharedSupport/Outlook Profile Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a new profile, and set as default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Open outlook &amp; quit/exit Outlook after it opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat the above &amp; set the previous/main profile as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fixed the CPU usage problem. I tried deleting the new profile that I created &amp; the CPU usage went up again.</p>
<p>

    <title>Access multi-user split database user conflict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tukatz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access multi-user split database user conflict</h2>
                    <p><span>I have built an app for recording plant purchases at my Master Gardener plant sale. Each purchaser gets the next sequential ticket number and plants being purchased get sale records related to that ticket number. I
 have a form with the ticket number on it and it has a subform for recording each plant being purchased. Plants have a label with a bar code that is scanned. Focus then moves to a quantity field. When you tab out of the quantity field the next sale record comes
 up with focus in the bar code field. When you have entered the quantity of the last plant there is a button you click on the main form for the next client. That button retrieves the next ticket number into the main form and sets focus in the bar code field
 in the subform.</span></p>
<p><span>I have split the database because it will be a multi-user system. The back end is in a shared folder on my Windows Home Server and I put the front end on both my laptop and my wife's laptop. We tried to click the Next
 Client button simultaneously to see if there would be a conflict and there is one. One of us got clean results, but the other got an error message that focus could not be set in the subform. While it is unlikely that two users will click that button so close
 together in the production world, if there is something I can do to preclude this error I would rather do that.</span></p>

<p>I'm guessing the problem might be resulting from a conflict in the acquisition of the next ticket number, resulting in a key or index violation.&nbsp; If so you might like to take a look at CustomNumber.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />

This little demo file illustrates a number of approaches to generating sequential keys.&nbsp; The 'Sequential Numbering' option should suit your purposes.&nbsp; This is based on Roger Carlson's well known solution, with a few modifications of my own.&nbsp; In the event of
 a conflict or conflicts occurring the ProductID value is incremented until no conflict occurs.&nbsp; Provision for 'seeding' the next number to be used is also available.<br />

            If using the Record Locking option does not solve this problem, I'm not sure that Record locking is the problem. But if it is, then you only other options are to a) use a different data store, like SQL Express or b) code your own record locking by storing the currently used recordID in a table someplace and checking to see if its opened.

            I had a tooth extracted today and I'm afraid I'm too fuzzy to work through what you posted, Ken. Did I mention that the PC that gets the error unable to set focus in the subform gets the same ticket number in the main form as the PC that does not get an
 error. If one has 23 and the other has 24 they both get 25.

            How is the ticket number being computed?&nbsp; The fact that it is apparently being duplicated suggests that it is not designated as the primary key or a candidate key, the latter by being indexed uniquely.&nbsp; One or other of these is essential.&nbsp; From this it
 follows that steps must be taken to handle the key or index violation.&nbsp; My CustomNumber demo, to which I referred you in my last reply illustrates how this can be done without prejudicing the integrity of the database by premature saving of the record.

<p>Ticket_Number is a primary key. When the main form is opened, or when the Next Client button is clicked, the max value of Ticket_Number in the Tickets_Master_T table is fetched and the Ticket Number field on the main form is set to that max value plus 1.</p>
<p>I have attempted to use the idea of a second table that acts as a control and created the table Seeds_T with a single field Seed. When the max Ticket_Number is incremented it should not be equal to the max value of Seed in the Seeds_T table. If they are
 equal it is because two PCs have fetched max Ticket_Number 'simultaneously' and the one that was 'earlier' has already added another record to Seeds_T with Seed equal to Ticket_Number.</p>
<p>The one that was 'later' and finds the two max values equal must add one more to the main form Ticket_Number before adding another Seeds_T record.</p>
<p>This is the code for the open form procedure.</p>
<p>
Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
&nbsp; DoCmd.GoToRecord acDataForm, Me.Name, acNewRec<br />
&nbsp; Me.[Ticket_Number] = DMax("[Ticket_Number]", "Ticket_Master_T") + 1<br />
&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenTable "Seeds_T"<br />
&nbsp; DoCmd.RunSQL "insert into [Seeds_T] ([Seed]) values (Me.[Ticket_Number])"<br />
&nbsp; DoCmd.Close acTable, "Seeds_T", acSaveYes<br />
&nbsp; If Me.Dirty Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Me.Dirty = False<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, when it tries to set Seed equal to Me.[Ticket_Number] it prompts me for a value for Me.[Ticket_Number]. Obviously that statement is not correct, but I have not been able to figure out how to fix it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To handle a key violation error in the event of a conflict with another user I'd recommend that you use Roger Carlson's approach of trapping the key violation error in the form's Error event procedure.&nbsp; This, with a few amendments, is illustrated in my demo
 as the 'Sequential Number' option.<br />
<br />
The reason you are currently being prompted for the ticket number is that you are not concatenating the value of the Ticket_Number control into the string expression as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO Seeds_T(Seed) VALUES(" &amp; Me.Ticket_Number &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDb.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
<br />
However, if you trap the key violation error, as my demo illustrates, you should not need a 'control' table.&nbsp; Error handling like this is an integral part of a well designed database.</p>
