<p>Just started getting this message while sending Outlook emails. Nothing changed on my end, and the emails I am sending are simple text emails to single recipient, with no links or attachments. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2016, but to no avail.
 Any help or guidance? Please help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few reasons why you are getting that error message. It is possible that you already reached the maximum limit for sending an outgoing email. We suggest that you check the reply of JMH (MS-MVP) on this

            Thanks. I don't think this scenario applies, since this is my personal account and I only send a few (5-20 at the most) emails per day. Have verified via SMS and never been notified of hitting any limits by MS. It was also a few email accounts that I could
 not send the emails to, while it worked for other email accounts. And I cannot still send to those email accounts. Could it be the recipient email, or is it a selective issue on my side?

<p>This exact same thing is happening to me. Started last Wednesday mid day. Never a problem in a decade. I am a paid member as well. A tech from Microsoft remote controlled my computer for 4 hours on Thursday with no solution. They had an engineer call Saturday
 but I missed the call. He then sent an email but when I reply to him I get the same failed sent message! LOL
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is killing my business and costing me thousands a day right now. Hopefully someone figures this out. There must be more of us.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have changed nothing before this problem started. This same failure occurs when sending from my iphone as well. Some addresses work but most do not. Some I have emailed many times before over years, some are new email addresses. PLEASE HELP!</p>

            Have not solved the problem. The agent in my case (via chat) tried some basic fixes, but wanted me to buy a premium care, so they can get in my computer and solve it. Didn't make sense to pay for something, whose origins are unknown. Also read that sometime
 the last MS update causes unknown errors like these to pop up. In Windows-10, however, I don't know how to uninstall the last MS update to validate that. So, still waiting for the rep to come back and reply/solve the issue.

<p>Sounds like we had the same agent! Yes they made me buy premium as well and no fix. I will look and see if and when there might have been a MS update. I am using 7 for my business machines. I don't normally do updates and don't believe there as been one
 in a while. </p>

            I just checked and the last MS updates were 4/13/17... The problem for me didn't start till the 26th. I am on email all day everyday so I am sure I would have noticed it the day of the update. Did they mention what part of the update might be the problem?

            I guess, the MS update (no mention of which update) may not be an issue, or is it possible the issue got triggered a few days later? The random nature of this issue is making it difficult to diagnose and solve. The least MS could do (there are plenty of
 these cases online) is to investigate and reach out with a fix. Waiting for the week to start to see if MS Support picks this up.

<p>I agree. This is killing me since I run two businesses from my outlook account and this is the busiest time of year for both.

            So, this morning I tried sending those returned mails and they went through. Nothing changed on my end, except that I let Outlook alone overnight and think through how unreasonable it was to selectively reject certain emails. Jokes aside, the problem seems
 to have been rectified and I hope it stays that way. Unfortunately, I don't have deeper insights into the fix.

            I am getting this as well. &nbsp;When I got the trial version it was almost instantaneous I was able to begin creating documents/editing documents. &nbsp;I clicked "install" well over an hour ago and there is no indication anything is happening, but it still says
 5 of 5 installs available. &nbsp;When I try to open a document, it says "We're sorry, WINWORD.EXE can't be used right now because Office is busy. &nbsp;We're either updating or helpin gyou add or remove some programs. &nbsp;You can try using WINWORD.EXE again after we're
 done. &nbsp;It shouldn't take long." &nbsp;Okay. &nbsp;When will I know it is done? &nbsp;I thought maybe something happened and the install got interrupted, so I tried to click install again and it said it was busy with another task. &nbsp;I'm fine to wait, but want to know how long
 I should expect it to take (waiting over an hour so far)....and, how will I be alerted that the install is complete and I can begin working?

            Hi, HELP<br />
<br />
I'm having no luck converting files from AVI to MP4 to play back on the Nokia N95 - I have bought a movavi video converter 5.3 and, on the basis of this discussion, an imtoo mp4 video converter<br />
<br />
In imtoo there is no exact match for the recommended conversion mpeg4-avc/h.264 codec.<br />
<br />
Sometimes with movavi part of the file plays, sometimes only the audio.<br />
<br />
With imtoo the best I can get is audio.<br />
<br />
There must be a simple solution to this problem - where am I going wrong?

            okey, this may be a bit too late to reply to your problem<br />
anyway. I use tunebite convert problem. I convert .avi to .3gp and it works just fine. you can use any converter application that allow you to convert file to .3gp.<br />
<br />
I hope its help

            There's no need to convert AVI files for N95. Download DivX mobile player, or CorePlayer or Smartmovie. And you can play AVI, DIVX, XVID videos without transcoding.

<h2>            Using BuildCriteria&#40;&#41; function Where Field Is Null and Is Not Null</h2>
                    <p>MS Access 2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I love the BuildCriteria feature; however, I would like to use it to create the criteria for filtering out null fields or only showing if the fields are null.&nbsp; I have the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sOpenCriteria = BuildCriteria("CompleteDate", dbDate, "''")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Filter records where CompleteDate is Null</p>
<p>&nbsp;and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sOpenCriteria = BuildCriteria("Priority", dbText, "&lt;&gt;''")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Filter records where Priority is not null</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then I would run this to open a form with the</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm sDocName, acNormal, , sOpenCriteria</p>
<p>
</p><p>I receive a Data type mismatch in criteria expression when it tries to perform the DoCmd.OpenForm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Cannot print from Publisher 2013 to a Canon iPF825 large format printer</h2>
                    <p>I have had problems printing from my Windows 7 and now Windows 10 computer in Publisher 2010/2013 to the Canon iPF825 large format printer.&nbsp; When I select that printer all it says is "connecting to printer" and never goes any further.&nbsp; On this site I found
 that someone else had asked the same question but they were using Windows 7 and Publisher 2016.&nbsp; The moderator gave a fix and I tried using Publisher in Safemode and tried to print but the same message is displayed when I select the iPF825 "connecting to printer"
 and never goes any further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can print fine from Excel 2010/2013 to the Canon iPF825 large format printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other solutions?<br />

<p>Word is set up by default to save an autorecovery version of your document every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>So if you close Word (through the Task Manager if necessary) and restart it,it should show you the most recently saved autorecovery copy, and you won't have lost more than 10 minutes of work.</p>
<p>For the future: it is a good idea to save your document from time to time while working on it (Ctrl+S is the easiest way).</p>

<li>Have you checked the microphone gain settings?</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it works:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the article ‘Cortana says “I wasn’t able to connect to get you set up. Make sure you have a network connection, or try again in a little bit.”’ from the link below and check if it helps:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to try to turn Cortana off and then try turning it on back and check if she talks. Refer to the steps below to turn Off and On Cortana:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Cortana</strong>. </li><li>Click the <strong>hamburger</strong> button in the top left of the window.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> and click on off.</li><li>Follow the same steps to turn it on.</li><li>Check if issue persists.</li></ol>

                    <p>I have created linked server from&nbsp;SQL server 2008R2 to MS ACCESS DATABASE 2003. The test connection was successful but while trying to access the tables. I am facing the error "Cannot obtain the schema rowset " DBSCHEMA_COLUMNS" for OLE DB provider " Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0"
 for linked server " ACCESS DATABASE". The provider supports the interface, but returns&nbsp;a failure code&nbsp; when it is used ("Microsoft SQL Server, Error : 7311).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am the DBA, I am able to see the tables, the user is able to see the linked server but not the tables.&nbsp;I have provided sysadmin access, but still the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me out here. Done a lot of research but could find proper point of contact.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 open doc from web link super slow</h2>
                    
<p>We have 1 user with Word 2016 on Windows 10. Intermittent when she clicks a link in browser to open a word doc it will take up 30 seconds or more to open in local Word. Sometimes it will open in word very fast. The size of the docs are small. Couple pages
 of text with no pictures. It's on a site that none of our other users have this problem with. The PC build she is using is only a month old. If we right click and download the doc it is very fast and then will open in word very fast. I have turned off all
 the Windows 10 background privacy apps.</p>

    <title>Office365 Activation Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott soto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office365 Activation Error</h2>
                    <p>Office365 products started asking for me to Activate but only on this PC. Then it just stopped working all together now when I try and activate it I get the following message for any Office365 product, onenote, Word, Outlook etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't connect you.</p>
<p>Looks like we can't connect to one of our services right now. Please try again later, or contact your Helpdesk (that would be me) if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>0xCAA70004</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for some time now. There is nothing wrong with this machine and on my other work machine (laptop) it works fine. So 2 things here, 1) This seems to be an issue with Office365 and something MS should look into this is happening more
 and more in our company. 2) Microsoft needs to take a page from Apple and stop upgrades/feature updates and the like and have one cycle where they FIX THESE ISSUES! This is ridiculous to have to go through this and so far MS support has been absolutely no
 help what so ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed Office365, did a complete removal using the O365 removal tool. I have removed all temp files and rebooted many times I have tried launching outlook in safe mode, as Admin etc. Nothing. What we have seen in the past is that wiping the users
 profile on the computer fixes the issue but that is just the worst fix ever. Get your crap together Microsoft and fix this stuff. We pay REALLY good money for this stuff its time it started working like we would expect it to!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Scott,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you are having these troubles. Have you tried using the 'Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365' tool from Microsoft? This can be found on the following Microsoft website: <a href="https://support.office.com/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/article/unlicensed-p...</a>
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,
<br />Nathan

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query. I apologize for the inconvenience and glad to know the issue is resolved now after the troubleshooting. Please be aware that the support here is 24 hours 365 days. If you encounter any issue, feel free to post your query and we are
 here to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to summarize that the issue here is resolved by creating new user profile and deleting the old one as uninstallation and reinstallation of Office do not resolve the issue. We can conclude that the issue may be caused by&nbsp;invalid cached credentials
 or external DNS resolving issue. You may check <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Outlook/Outlook-2016-error-0xCAA70004/td-p/136962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> with similar issue. Some users resolved it with <a href="https://diagnostics.office.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365</a> which Nathan has already suggested. It is a tool you can employ to avoid going as far as to delete user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you have any ideas about Office update, I'd like to invite you to submit your feedback by clicking File &gt; Feedback via any Office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>This is not a DNS cache or resolving issue, fact is it happens for people who work in the office and for those whom never work in the office the same problem happens. Yes, creating a new windows profile does fix the problem, that lead's me to either a system
 file that gets replaced, a Registry entry that is bad (this is my best guess here) or some other profile related issue. Our DNS is perfectly fine and I don't believe for one minute that everyone that works for our company remotely or locally have DNS issues.
 Also I have checked with MS support and our DNS records for Office365 is setup exactly as it should be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is, this is happening more and more and its NOT an issue on our side it is a software issue with Office365 and MS needs to own that and fix it. Also they need to spend one feature release cycle fixing issues rather than providing features people
 could live a little longer with out. I am tired of dying from the thousands of little paper cuts like this one. I know software is hard but take some time and fix this stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are also having an issue that many others are having where users are randomly being told that there office is not activated, simply waiting it out and it goes away sometimes it takes a reboot but this is another example of where bad software is creeping
 in and needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply. I have been swamped. We tried everything nothing worked, even deleting the user profile and recreating it. Finally wiping the drive and reinstalling Windows10 Pro seemed to fix it. So add this with other Office2016 issues and many
 many issues with Windows 10 pro (including pulling back the 2018 fall feature update) and you can see why MS needs to halt all new features and hire a full time staff to test and QA this stuff and get the code back to where it needs to be. This is exactly
 why MS is loosing ground to the likes of Chrome OS and Mac OS its time to get the code right and then move forward. Users would appreciate that way more than they would new features that exist in broken code. If we developed code like this we would be looking
 for new jobs this is just horrible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on MS get it together!</p>

<p>Please see the reply by max green.&nbsp;<span>That maybe greyed out due to privacy settings, so check Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy then Feedback &amp; diagnostics (down on the left). What is that set to? Needs to be Full data and frequency to automatic. If
 you cannot change the privacy in settings change it in the registry as max green has mmentioned.</span></p>

<p>This solved the issue for me. Thank you Max</p>
<p>But how did it get greyed out in the first place?</p>
<p>Another of the many mysteries of Redmond.</p>
<p>NB If in doubt, following Max's instructions, if you select to enter "decimal" then entering "3" will automatically give you the hexadecimal you need in the key.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you all for replies</p>
<p>My PC still has no Ovi Suite Installed, or PC Suite</p>
<p>i've downoaded the Ovi Suite From the Nokia website, the setup of 98.62MB size</p>
<p>i've started the installation and before the end it gives this error</p>
<p>i thought it might be from norton 360 v4, so i disabled it&nbsp; and uninstall all what is installed from the Ovi Suite, restarted and tried again while the norton disabled but the same error happens.</p>
<p>i want it for my Nokia 5800 XPress Music, i will try to download PC Suite and Install it</p>

<h2>            Outlook Light</h2>
                    My Outlook switched on it's own to Light and now emails do not open and the only thing that works when I click on it is Help so I can't even try to switch it back to Normal view and my personal folders are missing. I am using Firefox and it is up to date.
 The regular Outlook version opens in Chrome. What can I do?

            Hi Lori
<br />
<br />Log into your outlook on firefox open a second window and copy the below url into the other window while still logged into outlook. It will bring you to the page to uncheck light version. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/owaversion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/options/o...</a>
<br />If looking for the setting
<br />Within the light version find your options menu. Click on The gear if you have options there then click on it under General Light version Uncheck use light version. If you get the Settings with search type in light and click on Outlook on web version and uncheck use light version. 
<br />I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask questions and let us know how it goes.&nbsp;
<br />Regards,&nbsp;

    <title>No back button dropdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russellgillchrest  say:</h3>
<h2>            No back button dropdown</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 8.1, which forced me into IE11, now I can only navigate backwards one page at a time. Windows File Explorer has the drop-down arrow next to the forward and back nav buttons. That went away with IE 9, but you could right click
 the buttons for the list of recently visited sites forward and back. Now, in IE 11, the right click function seems to have been removed as well. I'm trying to find a way to get IE 10 back since disabling and re-enabling IE 11 hasn't worked. Due top other upgrade
 issues, I can't revert back to Windows 8 without formatting my HDD and losing everything. Is anyone else having this issue with IE? Anyone know how to fix it if possible?<br />

<p><span><font color="#000000">3. For those of us who have been using IE for ages, We'll remember that up until the release of IE 9, there was a drop-down button next to the back and forward buttons that you could click to see the pages you had navigated to
 and from in that window in that session. File explorer in desktop mode still has such a button, see below.</font></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently I'm not allowed to include screenshots in my replies. Essentially they were shots of the upper left hand corner of File Explorer and Internet Explorer. Side by side you will notice next to the back and forward arrows in file explorer there is
 downward pointing triangle that is not present in the internet explorer GUI. That is the button I am referring to having been removed in IE 9 that was present in IE 8.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you look at the GUI for explorer and the GUI for IE 11 you see that there is no drop arrow next to the left and right arrow buttons in IE. With IE 9 that little feature was removed. The work around was to either right click on the back and forward arrows,
 or hold the left click button to get the drop-down list of past pages.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In IE 11, it would seem that even those work arounds have been removed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your Alt+Arrow key option is the same as clicking on an arrow button once to move one page in each direction. IE 11 doesn't seem to have a feature where I can quickly navigate from the page I'm on, to one that I visited 5 sites back. I don't want to have
 to click arrows till I get back to the page I'm looking for. It's actually pretty amazing that MS would remove the feature completely after getting so much flak for removing the drop button going from IE 8 to 9.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm hoping it is a problem with my IE 11. If not, it's no longer my default browser.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have removed and re-added the Internet Explorer 11 feature to my OS. That didn't change the GUI.</p>

<p>The function was particularly important on some sites which appeared to lock you in to their page by making multiple references and having to go back up to 10 times. Surely this must be a bug as the function is so useful and no one in their right mind would

            You are making the assumption that MS programmers are in their right minds aren't you? These are the same people that failed to consider that there should probably be a desktop only function in Windows 8. I mean, doesn't everyone want their 27in desktop
 monitor to be like their 7-9" tablet screen? Let's make an operating system that has capabilities in terms of making HDD, RAM, and processing power six generations ahead of the hardware, but design it for devices that are and will be too small to take advantage
 of it for at least 3-5 years.<br />
<br />
But I digress, the important thing here is that MS is aware of my displeasure over this potential glitch. If it isn't a glitch, hopefully you can rectify it before Firefox or Chrome become more natural to me than IE.<br />

            I'm guessing that since I've clarified my issue and you haven't responded that MS is just going to play ostrich on this one? Your update to 8.1 cleared my restore points so I can't even go back to Windows 8 and IE 10 without doing a clean install and calling
 MS to deliver an absurdly long code to activate. Can't even be bothered to at least explain why MS decided to remove a feature? I mean seriously, I can even skip back over multiple pages in Safari on my iPad by leaving my finger on the back arrow. On a mobile
 device with IE11 I can't. IE11 is the only browser that doesn't have such a simple and convenient function.

My statement in regards to the right click function was specific to the change from the drop down box in IE 8 and older that was replaced by the hold-left-click or right-click in IE 9 and 10.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the short cuts/menu items. Those were the kinds of workarounds I was asking about. It doesn't change the fact that something that was once a 1-click function has now been replaced by either a cluttered sidebar, or a multiple click/keystroke function.
<br />
<br />
As in my last post to thread, it's a function that is present in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, but no longer in IE. Less user friendly is still less user friendly. It's like Microsoft's going backwards. The metro screen reminds me of Win 3.1, and IE is becoming
 more of a pain in the butt than it's worth.<br />

            Don't know whether anybody has found out why&nbsp;this IE11 problem shows up. I have&nbsp;two PCs, both upgraded to Win 8.1. One PC&nbsp;allows right click on the IE11 back/forward buttons to see the history, and the other doesn't. On the one that doesn't, if I run IE11
 with "-extoff" then&nbsp;the right click does work to show the history. So on my PC it looks like it could be an add-on problem, but I have tried disabling&nbsp;all the add-ons but to no effect.. So my answer (hopefully temporarily) is to run "iexplore -extoff". Anybody
 got a proper long term fix?

Now see look what you did. So I tried the -extoff function and that didn't work for me. But I figured lets screw around with all of the settings one by one and see if I can figure this out. I turned off protected mode, and holy banana splits, my right click
 function has returned. Really Microsoft? You guys couldn't answer this question 4 months ago? Enabling Protected Mode in IE 11 disables certain accessibility features? Are you freaking kidding me? Any who, thought I'd share that with you and see if that's
 the difference between your two PC's. If it is, we may have just solved the conundrum.<br />

    <title>Make images and gifs smaller in Yammer feeds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Make images and gifs smaller in Yammer feeds</h2>
                    <p>I would like to change the size of images and gifs&nbsp;as they appear in Yammer feeds because as it is one image/gif takes up practically the whole screen. I would like them to appear about thumbnail size so people can click on them to expand, but otherwise
 they don't take up too much space. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be changed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Its saying my login isn&#39;t recognised</h2>
                    
<p>My college has just told us all that we can use this for free, so i signed up and installed it onto my mac. The icons for word, powerpoint etc are all there on the toolbar but when i go to click on them to open up the software it opens up this page saying
 " how would you like to get started " it gives you three options&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Enter you purchased product key&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Sign into an existing office 365 subscrption</p>
<p>3. Try office 365, including office for Mac</p>
<p>Since i have already signed up i choose the second one and when I put in my user name and password (which is the same as my college login as requested) it says sign in failed but it is correct ?????</p>
