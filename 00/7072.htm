<h2>            Web pages stopped working in IE 11 but work OK in Chrome</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started having problems opening some webpages in IE 11. These same pages work fine in Chrome. One of the sites is clickfunnels.com - I am using Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 with IE 11 v11.0.9600.18665.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I just get a white screen - no error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, this is not just my computer - clickfunnels was able to replicate it and some of my customers have notified me that it does not work on their computer either. Seems to be only the IE 11 version/Win 7 combination mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start telling me to clear my cache and all that, let me say I have already tried all that stuff. I tried every setting imaginable within IE 11 too.&nbsp; I also tried the -extoff option. Nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, other than the obvious question, how can I get this website to work with my setup? My other question is... do you think this is a IE 11 problem or a compatibility problem with the websites? IF it is a compatibility problem. I need to find out exactly
 what is not compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bill</p>
<p />

<h2>            Hundreds of my Zune songs claim to have &#34;no usage rights&#34; &#40;DRM&#58; Yes- invalid license &#40;has no usage rights&#41;</h2>
                    First off, I have a current and up to date Zune pass which doesn't expire for a few months. A few weeks ago my computers hard drive was&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;damaged and needed replacement. After a long wait I have finally done just that. I recently re-installed
 the Zune software for my computer, which is Windows 7 64 bit if that is relevant, I connected my Zune HD to my computer and chose the "copy to my collection" choice for my entire library and the&nbsp;sync&nbsp;proceeded as normal. After it's completion I noticed that
 my entire library couldn't play and when I was signed in and attempted to play a song it would remain on "opening"&nbsp;indefinitely. I reset my DRM and deleted and re-copied the songs to my collection.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Later the same thing happened but the software began to fix the DRM status of my songs. This process was very lengthy and has now stopped entirely leaving roughly 500 songs which are unable to play. The "Content Type" is indicated to be either: Zune Pass-
 Expired, No Usage Rights, or Status Unknown. Despite this when I examine the songs properties each song, under DRM, says: DRM: Yes-invalid license (has no usage rights). I'm truely lost here and would just like to be able to play these songs. Does anybody
 have a solution to this problem?<br />
<br />
P.S- I'm not sure if this is relevant but songs I have actually purchased were unnaffected, and those were all MP3 files. The songs that can't play are entirely WMA.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I do?</div>

Arrrghhhh.....DRM, the pain... the pain....
<div>Here's what is going on. &nbsp;DRM as you probably know is copy protection. &nbsp;It works like this. &nbsp;A DRM'd song is encrypted, and comes with a license file. &nbsp;The license file has the decryption key, and contains usage rights (the right to burn a CD or not, for
 instance.) &nbsp;The license file is tied to your PC and is installed in one of the windows sub-directories. &nbsp;Without that license key, the application cannot decrypt the file to play it. &nbsp;So... when you copy the track to a new PC, &nbsp;or replace a hard drive, etc.,
 that license gets left behind.</div>
<div>But, if there is a license server, you can sometimes recover the license. &nbsp;That 's what happened to your zune pass songs... they slowly recovered when you logged into your zune account.</div>
<div>Your purchased tracks that are wma have DRM as well. &nbsp;But the zune market has dropped DRM from purchased tracks, and gone all MP3 now. &nbsp;(MP3 cannot support DRM.) &nbsp;Before the transition, you could 'restore' your DRM'd purchased tracks from the marketplace....
 you had to have this feature so you could upgrade PCs, replace hard drives...</div>
<div>But, those files are now gone, and the record labels do not allow suppliers to restore MP3s (not zune not amazon, not iToons... and probably not anyone. &nbsp;you don't need this feature because you can back them up by copying them to a CD, a back up drive,
 etc.)</div>
<div>You can try calling zune support to see if you can get replacement MP3s, but I doubt they can do it.... this drm problem comes up over and over and I don't recall anyone saying they were able to get them replaced.</div>

<h2>            WU doesn&#39;t show AMD driver at all</h2>
                    <div>I installed the preview yesterday and since WU is not showing or updating my AMD drivers.<br />
The only driver it installs is the Microsoft Basic display adapter.</div>
<div><br />
I was able to install 15.200.1023&nbsp; engineering sample by downloading it from the forum of
<a href="http://forums.guru3d.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.guru3d.com</a></div>
<div><br />
However with these drivers tested on multiple games it comes with micro stutter, it's like lag but offline. Frame rates are OK.&nbsp; It makes driving impossible, for example in GTA. Because it stutters for a second wich causes me to suddenly crash into another
 vehicle.</div>
<div><br />
After removing this driver it goes back to the Microsoft Basic display adapter</div>
<div>
<p>-I enabled fast ring =&gt; went to build 10130<br />
-Uninstalled Microsoft Basic display adapter -&gt; it will reinstall the same driver when scanning for hardware changes<br />
-In device manager, update driver, search automatically&nbsp; =&gt;Windows has determined that the driver software is up to date(same as when the manually downloaded driver was installed)<br />
-Under system properties, Device installation =&gt; was by default active (Do you want Windows to download driver software and realistic icons for your device?)<br />
-Stopped the WU service, renamed the software distribution folder under c:\windows and restarted WU service =&gt; nothing.<br />
-WU reports everything is up to date and no updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>It just refuses to fetch a driver from WU and I'm running out of idea's.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p>Current build: Win 10 Pro X64 10130<br />

            Important! Make a copy of your file before you run such a macro!
<br />
<br />Even hidden names have a meaning and are responsible for the functionality.
<br />E.g. the Solver create hidden names. If you remove them, your existing Solver model is gone in that sheet / file.

<h2>            My phone&#39;s screen is cracked and i can&#39;t put the password.</h2>
                    OK, i've had this nokia lumia 1520 for like 8 months (it's the second one, basically for the same reason) and is cracked on the bottom left corner. It dropped from approximately 1.5 feet high, i was sitting on a bench. It was a slow fall, or that's how
 i remember it. Anyway it got cracked in the stupidest fall of them all. I could use it for a while, even tho the buttons for back, home and search didn't worked.&nbsp;<br />
I don't remember when i put the password, but at the time, i still could use the rest of the screen. Now i can't press numbers like 7,8,9,0 or the delete button.&nbsp;<br />
I was wondering if there's any app or program where i can kind of "mirror" my phone in the pc so i can put the password and unlock it. I still use it for making calls with the help of cortana and i can press "answer" when people call me. Because it's locked,
 i can't check my photos that i don't want to lose.&nbsp;

            <p>Do you mean that the Austere Quote thumbnail doesn't appear in the Text Boxes gallery, or do you mean that it is there but nothing happens when you click it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word out-of-the-box, that text box is stored as a building block in the file&nbsp;<strong>C:\Users\&lt;your name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Document Building Blocks\1033\14\Built-In Building Blocks.dotx</strong>. In turn, that file is automatically copied from
 the installation location at&nbsp;<strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Document Parts\1033\14\Built-In Building Blocks.dotx</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the Austere Quote text box was accidentally deleted from the building blocks. Any changes (additions, deletions, or redefinitions) of the building blocks are stored only in the copy in your Roaming profile. You can restore the building
 blocks to the original state simply by closing down Word, deleting the copy or Built-In Building Blocks.dotx from that Roaming folder, and then restarting Word. The file from the installation location will again be automatically copied to the Roaming folder.</p>

<h2>            Copy and paste in excel 2007</h2>
                    I copy and paste my baking statement on to excel. But it inserts a extra row (horizontal line) into the sheet. So if&nbsp;my statement has&nbsp;25 entries it takes 50 lines in the sheet; everyother one is blank.&nbsp;To delete these empty&nbsp;lines takes&nbsp;about 30 seconds
 each. I do not have this trouble with any other cut and paste situations, only from my bank statement. Also even skipping down the sheet takes forever. I have other sheets with much more information and have no trouble at all manipulating data, same computer,
 same software.&nbsp;

<p>Well, you would have to talk to your bank about the extra line,&nbsp; good luck.&nbsp; More important is to find an easy Excel solution.&nbsp; Are the extra rows blank?&nbsp; If so highlight all the rows of data in one of the columns with data and press F5, Special, Blanks,
 OK.</p>
<p>Then press Ctrl+Minus&nbsp; (Ctrl-) and choose entire row.</p>

            I will try that. All blank lines are blank. I just tried to erase 5 empty lines and the CPU usage is about 75% with only excel and IE open. And excel just gave a statement on top saying its not responding. Arg!!!

<p>1)&nbsp;Figure out what is causing the extra line and try and remove it before pasting it into your worksheet.&nbsp; Typically, this will be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>So, 2) use Paste Special and try different options include 'unicode text' or&nbsp;'html text' or the various other options you see.&nbsp; Sometimes this will work.</p>
<p>If not, 3) is to sort on some column that preserves the row order.&nbsp; Say, your bank includes a transaction number column.&nbsp; If it does, it will typically be a sequential number that goes up by 1 for each transaction.&nbsp; So, select your data set and sort on this
 column.&nbsp; The blank lines will all move to the top (or the bottom).&nbsp; Just select and delete them.</p>

            I just checked and the blank rows are "merged" and to unmerge the lines takes about 45 seconds each!! I'm not sure if I understand your potential solution. I have to highlight the empty row and then&nbsp;press F5?

<p><br />
That's easily solved.&nbsp; Create your own unique sequence number column.&nbsp; In a new column enter =ROW() and copy it down to all the rows with data.&nbsp; Now, select this column, copy, and then paste special | Values only.</p>
<p>Now, sort on *any* column that contains data in every row.&nbsp; The rows with blanks will all be together.&nbsp; Delete them.&nbsp; Now, resort on the column you created.&nbsp; Finally, if desired delete the column.</p>

            Method 1: Open file location<br />
<br />
Windows 8 Start Screen - Right Click - Open file locationMaybe the easiest way to go, would be to do a search for Outlook in the Start Menu, right click on it and from the context menu that pops up choose: Open File Location.<br />
<br />
This will open a File Explorer window with the actual location of the Start Menu shortcut. You can copy and paste this shortcut to your Desktop or right click on the shortcut and choose: Send To-&gt; Desktop (create shortcut)<br />
<br />
Extra Tip: You can use this location to create a Start Menu toolbar in Windows 8 as well. Right click on an empty space on your Task Bar and choose Toolbars-&gt; New toolbar… and point it to the following location:<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\<br />
<br />
Method 2: Pin to Taskbar first<br />
<br />
Another way to go would be to pin Outlook to your Taskbar first. Having Outlook pinned to your Taskbar might be something you want too anyway.<br />
<br />
To pin Outlook to your Taskbar, right click on Outlook in the Start Menu Search Results and choose: Pin to Taskbar.<br />
<br />
Once you have Outlook pinned to your Taskbar, make sure that Outlook is closed. Then hold the SHIFT button and choose: Send To-&gt; Desktop (create shortcut)<br />
<br />
When Outlook isn’t closed, you can still achieve the same by first right clicking on the icon and from the list that pops up, right click on Outlook 2013 (or whatever your version is) while holding the SHIFT button and choose: Send To-&gt; Desktop (create shortcut)<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, this will also work for every other application of course and you don’t actually have to pin it to your Taskbar first if you have the application running already.<br />

            <p>Hey Lsb188,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try creating a new user profile as an administrator level account (not to be confused with the administrator account which you have already references) by following the steps provided here:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a user account</a>&nbsp;(Be sure to select the "Administrator" option instead of "Standard user")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then log into the new user and try to alter the location of the Temporary Internet files&nbsp;to see if the changes stay after logging out and back in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

<p>I appreciate you efforts trying to fix the issue.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

2. Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>. You must run the command prompt in Administrator level<br />
3. On the command prompt type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit enter<br />
4. If everything went okay and no errors where found, restart your computer and try updating again<br />
5. If errors where found, try to fix it using DISM.<br />

            Doesn't really matter. Search the Store for VLC player or just go <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and get it. It's free, been around for years, and does more than WMP did, and the DVD Player you're talking about is next to worthless.<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>You should be able to do this by applying the conditional formatting twice. Remember to highlight the range before defining the formatting.</p>
<p>First define a rule for top 2</p>
<p>Conditional Formatting, Top/Bottom Rules, More rules, then change the value to 2 and set the format appropriately (green)</p>
<p>Second define a rule for top 1</p>
<p>Conditional Formatting, Top/Bottom Rules, More rules, then change the value to&nbsp;1 and set the format appropriately (blue)</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Yle Areena problem with Nokia E7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_fin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yle Areena problem with Nokia E7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few users from our company has used Yle Areena application in their new Nokia E7 phones, but after few days the application has stopped to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the users explained that when he got his E7 on wednesday Yle Areena was working fine.</p>
<p>During the weekend he used WLAN connection to watch Yle Areena. Suddenly on sunday Yle Areena didn't start anymore. He tried to use the same WLAN as before with the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the Yle Areena application is starting for few seconds, then the screen goes blank (black) and application closes itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have added and removed several access points from the phone settings, but the result is the same: Yle Areena is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone has Anna version and we have uninstalled Yle Areena from the phone and then reinstalled Yle Areena back to the phone. This doesn't help us in this problem.</p>
<p>It looks like the phone doesn't get anykind of connection while it's starting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have ideas what could help us in this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the same problem. Even before Anna update.</p>

<p>The solution was three-finger-reset and installing ovistore and ovimaps manually...</p>

            Hi, that was a fast answer. Thanks!<br />
<br />
How long did it work after that three-finger-reset?<br />
<br />
How do you make that three-finger-reset for E7?

<p>volume down + camera + menu (power off - power on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that some QT-specific things might not work. Last time the OviSuite installed OviStore automatically (and also symbian anna files), and I guess everything is now there (OviMaps I think came with anna, so no need for reinstalling it). First time I made
 this in the summer, I need to use some beta lab applications to get first ovistore and then via ovistore to get ovimaps, socially and some other apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easiest way is of course to get it re-flashed in nokia store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yle Areena is still working, but first time I had to do it again, because the problem was in a backup and after getting the setup back the problem was back...</p>

                    <p>My Office 365 Click to Run clients are not updating.&nbsp; I've read that the updates flow down from MS automatically.&nbsp; I've also read that it comes down from Windows Update - Where you have to move the switch "Give me updates from Other Microsoft Products" ON
 - thus making it "Microsoft Update".&nbsp; I've also been led to believe&nbsp;that it depends how you installed OFFICE.&nbsp; We have a GPO that has "Give me other Microsoft Updates.." grayed out in the OFF position.&nbsp; I believe that's why it's not working...&nbsp; I'm going to
 ask to have that GPO removed but I want to make sure that's the problem.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span>Hi OLD,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that the administrator controls the updates of the Office 2016 applications you installed. Generally, if you install the Office 2016 applications from the Office
 365 portal, you can see the update option in the Account page (File&gt;Account).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1671f57-10d3-4cd9-ad82-1942faccca25?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1671f57-10d3-4cd9-ad82-1942faccca25?upload=true" /></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can’t see the option, it may be because that the administrator in your organization uses GPO to disable the options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please update a full screenshot of the Account page in your organization for our clarification.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Calculated fields always use the sum of the fields used in the formula, so totals will only be correct if you add or subtract fields and/or multiply fields with a constant. All other functions (minimum, average) will cause incorrect totals.

            <p>But Jim's reply was not to <em>you</em>... It was a reply to the other user (Axel W) who hijacked the thread back in October. AFAICT, you have not even posted a question anywhere in either Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2011 [v14.6.0] is compatible with OS X 10.11.x provided you keep the Office software current. Microsoft will continue to provide updates &amp; support for that version until it reaches end-of-life. I haven't seen a published date, but my
<em>guess</em> is that it will be supported for at least another 18 months.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Answering the online verification form is our only way to recover Skype accounts. Since you’ve mentioned that you already answered the form and
 still unable to recover the account, we do not have any options left for this. You may
<a href="https://signup.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">create new Skype account</span></a> to continue Skype services or answer the form again.
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Click here</span></a> to proceed to the online recovery form.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate you for being with us for many years. I am upset to know that this is happening to you. I am looking forward to your full understanding
 for this matter. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.
