<h2>            Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 not registered</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0 'Not Registered' issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows 10 (W10) for some years now, Microsoft Access (MA) for 10-15 years, using Visual Basic (VB) programming since 2003, and Microsoft Visual Studio (MVS) for many, many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year, I took on Microsoft Office 365 (MO365), paying about £80 per year for it, and was getting on great with it, and all my old databases worked well (.mdb databases). After taking on MO365, I started two new databases, which had the .accdb extension,
 presuming this was me getting up to date with my database skills. These too worked well and I was really pleased with the results I was getting. These were using this ACE.OLEDB.12.0 provider, not a choice I'd made however, but this was what MVS2018 came up
 with when I was establishing my new Data Sources. Everything worked well with it and I was delighted and so I decided to develop any future databases along this route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently however, I lost my hard drive and had to reinstall MO365, MVS2018, and all the other software I was in the habit of using, quite commensurate with the loss of a hard drive. Having gone through all these processes of downloading and reinstalling
 the software, when it came to getting back to my database development with MVS2018 and MO365, this was when I hit this problem with the provider, and my progress is stalled until I find out how to get this provider installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is:- "Is this an MVS2018 problem, or an MO365 issue, and whatever it is, how do I get my provider back?".&nbsp;</p>

<p>I appear to have found a solution to this issue by accessing the site Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/downlode/details.aspx?id=13255). This appeared as part of a 12 page document which, fortunately,
 I printed off. However, the Author and source of the document did not print off with the rest of the document, and I don't know how I got to the document in the first place. As a result, I cannot acknowledge and thank the Author, very much to my regret. However,
 I will try to retrace my steps to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The essence of the fix was to go through the redistributable download and then run it. This resulted in the ACE provider being installed and registered, so now I'm hopefully going to get back on track with my work load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to this contributor and when I find out who you are, hopefully I'll be able to thank you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you one and all.</p>

<h2>            How to get rid of the KNCTR virus</h2>
                    I have tried shutting down the virus from the hidden icons and uninstalling from the programs and it is still there. I even re-downloaded the virus in hopes the file would come back so I could get rid of it and it hasn't worked.&nbsp;

<h2>            100 Gig Exchange account, but having issues with Outlook 2016 at 50 Gig</h2>
                    <p>Even though my Exchange email account has available storage up to 100 Gigs I am having issues with Outlook on my desktop as soon as I hit 50 Gigs. &nbsp;I get errors telling me the size is too large and I cannot move emails to subfolders and other tasks. &nbsp;I have
 had to wipe out my OST file and allow it to redownload in order to even be able to use it and in the meantime archive. &nbsp;What's the point of the larger box size if Outlook will not work with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insights?</p>

<p>Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to increase the size of the OST file.&nbsp; There is a reg key in this KB to control it,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/832925/how-to-configure-the-size-limit-for-both-.pst-and-.ost-files-in-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/832925/how-to-configure-the-size-limit-for-both-.pst-and-.ost-files-in-outlook</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PST key was not there so I added it first.&nbsp; Then you would need to create a new DWORD key&nbsp;MaxLargeFileSize and set it to a Decimal of 102,400 I think for the 100 GB size.&nbsp; It converts to Hex as&nbsp;19000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to mention is that Outlook currently supports 50GB OST files.&nbsp; We will be testing soon to add official support beyond that but not there just yet.&nbsp; We have had some other cases on this and know that we can increase MaxLargeFileSize to 100GB and
 that does work though.&nbsp; The other option to stay officially supported is to keep your mailbox under 50GB and use an Online Archive to move old data to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used this converter to check,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter</a>.</p>

    <title>Eraser button not working only in OneNote 2013 Desktop Version&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;amy&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eraser button not working only in OneNote 2013 Desktop Version&#63;</h2>
                    I understand that this question was asked multiple time before, but I didn't find any helpful answers. The eraser button on my dell active stylus has been working on the onenote metro app, but not on the desktop version. When I press down on the eraser
 button, rather than erasing, it continues to draw. I don't have the convenience of using the eraser button on my pen in the desktop version because of this =/ &nbsp;I know for sure that I selected the 2 button option when I first started using the desktop version,
 so I don't know what's going on. Any help would be appreciated!

            <p>I'm going to guess it's a driver issue with the Dell Active Stylus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote doesn't know anything about hardware buttons on styluses (stylii?) it just accepts the input it receives. Have you tried reaching out to Dell support on that?</p>

            <p>So, I came across a solution that sometimes works. It's super inconvenient, but it leads me to believe that it IS an issue with OneNote not playing nice with the stylus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To erase you need to have your palm placed on the screen while the pen is out of its active area, push the top button, and while your palm is still on the screen, touch the stylus on the screen and you'll see the "eraser" cursor icon activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite odd how this doesn't work in Onenote 2013/desktop, but functions just fine in word, powerpoint, onenote app, windows journal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd certainly appreciate a fix by the Office team.</p>

</div>
I am importing from a db records for analysis in .csv file. One of the numbers is 20 digits and is critical. When importing it translates it into an E+ formula in the cell and replaces the last 5 digits with 0's in the display field.
<div><br />

<div>How can I display and use the original value of 20 digits????</div>

            If it's actually a number, and the digits are critical, you're pretty much out of luck. Excel, like nearly all spreadsheet programs, stores numbers and calculates using IEEE double-precision floating point values. That standard provides 54 binary bits
 in the mantissa, which equates to about 15 decimal digits. You can't get any more precision than that out of XL's calculations or numeric storage.
<div><br />
<div>If what you really have is a 20-digit string, and aren't doing calculations on it, import it as Text (in the third pane of the Import Text wizard, click the column header and choose Text).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have to do calculations, you could import the values as Text, then break up the string into parts and perform calculations step-wise, but it's a bit of an effort.</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 send&#47;receive disconnects my intenet connection</h2>
                    Issue: Outlook 2010 send/receive disconnects my internet connection!<br />
<br />
As an IT Tech Support professional I'm stumped by this issue!<br />
<br />
I direct connect (cat5) my PC thru a Telus ActionTek router (192.168.1.254).<br />
My local PC has a DHCP address that works fine for all other software requiring Internet access.<br />
(I even set a static local IP thru my router and tried all sorts of settings for my network adapter for gateway/DNS, etc)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm using Outlook 2010 with Outlook Connector 14.0.6123.5001.<br />
Windows 7 Enterprise.<br />
All patches are up to date.<br />
My Outlook profile syncs my @live.ca account.<br />
I also have a local PST file I move mail to/from (closed that and issue still exists).<br />
<br />
I have re-created my Outlook profile many times. Works initially then fails.<br />
<br />
Outlook Sync Issue messages only state: <br />
Unable to sync folders (I also removed any personal folders so only default folders exist)<br />
Network Failure<br />
<br />
Please advise?<br />
<br />

I completed the simple activities as listed in your recommendations as below:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-sync-error-there-was-an-error/97654ad0-1179-4f0a-afa7-12ed379951a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-sync-error-there-was-an-error/97654ad0-1179-4f0a-afa7-12ed379951a4</a><br />
<br />
To confirm:<br />
<br />
I removed current Outlook profile.<br />
I un-installed Outlook Connector, rebooted, downloaded same version I have (14.06123.5001) and installed.<br />
Deleted .ost files in App Data/Local Profiles........<br />
Re-created profile:<br />
It sync's one time only.<br />
Exited Outlook, even re-booted.<br />
Opened Outlook....same issue......Outlook disconnects Internet Connection.<br />
<br />
Please advise ASAP!!!<br />
<br />

            Per my last note: Outlook 2012 Sync Issue message is as below.<br />
<br />
As an Exchange Administrator, I have resolved issues like this by re-creating a new mailbox and migrating users email data.<br />
<br />
Can you do the same?<br />
<br />

Outlook 2012 Sync Issue message:<br />
<br />
DP Note: Network operation failed during Outlook sync. Does not happen with any other applications.<br />

<h2>            DLOOKUP value in footer control based on control value in the header</h2>
                    <p>I am working on an Access report. The control in which I want to use the DLOOKUP function is located in the footer section of the form. I want the matching comparison to look at a control in the header section of the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to look up the value found in the AnnualBudgetAmt field in table tblBudgetedAmounts that matches the [Budget #] found in the header control.</p>

<p>
</p><p>=DLookUp("AnnualBudgetAmt","tblBudgetedAmounts","[Budget#]")</p>

            <p>The third argument to a Domain function like DLookUp needs to be a criterion to select which record to look up - a valid SQL WHERE clause without the WHERE. Try</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DLookUp("AnnualBudgetAmt","tblBudgetedAmounts","[Budget#] = " &amp; [Budget#])</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would probably be best to avoid using special characters like # (which is a date delimiter) in field or control names, and it may be necessary to remove the ambiguity (is [Budget#] a field, or a control, or both?) by renaming the header textbox to something
 like txtBudgetNo:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DLookUp("AnnualBudgetAmt","tblBudgetedAmounts","[Budget#] = " &amp; [txtBudgetNo])</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the [Budget#] field is of Text datatype you'll need to delimit it with ' marks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DLookUp("AnnualBudgetAmt","tblBudgetedAmounts","[Budget#] = '" &amp; [txtBudgetNo] &amp; "'")</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a spreadsheet with data – row 1 is a header row, and autofilter is on.
</p>
<p>In the same workbook I have a userform with a combobox – when the userform loads I want the combobox to load with the same values as the filter for column C on the worksheet.</p>
<p>Something like –</p>

Why&nbsp;are you trying to avoid&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>I believe you are correct, no such property exists.</p>
<p>Here you go:</p>
<p>Sub UniqueValuesInRange2()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rng As Range, c As Range, col As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rng = Range("C5:E19") 'EDIT TO PER YOUR REQUIREMENTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each col In rng.Columns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; col.AdvancedFilter Action:=xlFilterInPlace, Unique:=True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set col = col.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each c In col<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Loop through unique values...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print c.Address, c.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next c<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.ShowAllData 'Clear the filter<br />

<h2>            Cannot connect to windows 7 machine with RDP 2.1.1 with a non-admin account</h2>
                    We've been using RDP 2.1.1 for quite somem time for our home Mac users to connect to their Office XP PC's. We upgraded some PC's to Windows 7, and now the users cannot connect to their machines.&nbsp;
<div>When they try, they get the message " The credentials that were used to connect to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx are incorrect. Please enter your credentials again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've checked all settings, and&nbsp;verified&nbsp;that the user is a remote desktop user, and checked for an update to the RDP Client. I can connect with an admin account with no issues...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sure, it could be a setting on the PC, but here's the weird bit...If I use CoRD with the same non-admin account, it connects right away with no issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a setting I'm missing in RDP 2.1.1?&nbsp;</div>

                    I am having trouble since updating to Windows 10 opening .docx files. I get the message: Word experienced an error...check file permissions, free memory etc. Can not OPen and repair or use text converter. What I can do is covert to PDF (looks normal) and
 then Save as Other: Word 97-2003. I get a perfectly readable doc. So it seems not to be a corrupt file. THere must be some setting that I can fix?

<h2>            making links in Word blue&#63;</h2>
                    I copied text to a Word document that included lots of hyperlinks. The links were preserved fine, but word doesn't display them in hyperlink "style". That is, the links are underlined, but they're not blue. It's straightforward to change the style of an
 individual link, but there are several hundred in this document. I don't want to manually change the style for all of them. Is there any way to tell
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all</span> the links to adopt hyperlink style? That is, Word knows they're links. They're underlined. I can click on them, and they link fine. But I want them to look blue!<br />

=============================================<br />
If your default paper size is set to 11x17 in Printer Preferences...<br />
(from control panel...not just in Publisher).&nbsp; And...Publisher is <br />
not recognizing the fact that 11x17 is the Publication size.....<br />
there is a good possibility that your Printer Driver requires an <br />
update.<br />
<br />
Check all the screens in Printer Preferences / Advanced / Etc...<br />
sometimes there is more than one place to select default paper <br />
size.<br />

            Go to settings&gt;network &amp; wireless&gt;mobile &amp; sim&gt;sim settings. You should find the option to change the network connection speed there. Also your carrier must enable 3G for your device for you to get high speed networks.

<p>You did a great job when you add a panorama mode.</p>
<p>But why retouch photos after the shooting? That's bad. Retouching ruin everything, colors, WB, sharpness, saturation, contrast and qualities.</p>

<h2>            Backspace deletes two characters - Word for IPad</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>So I am working on a document on my IPad with the app Word. Everytime I make a mistake and use backspace, automatically two characters get deleted. This only happens in the Word app so I am assuming it must be something with the app itself but I cannot find
 a way to change the Word Settings at all.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs due to some components of your Word being corrupted. We suggest that you reset the app on your iPad.
</p>
To resolve this issue, following these steps:<br />
<ol>
<li>Close all the Office for iPad apps. To do this, press the Home button on your iPad twice, swipe to find each Office for iPad app, and then swipe the preview screen up to close the app.</li><li>Go to iPad <span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.</li><li>In <span><strong>Settings</strong></span>, tap to select <strong>Word</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <span><strong>RESET</strong></span>, tap <strong>Reset <strong>&lt;Word&gt;</strong></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated if anything comes up so we can further assist you. </p>

<p>Maybe I should add that my IPad is old and only has IOS 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed the app. And I tried to reset it. This did not work as there was no way to do it in the settings.</p>
<p>Therefore I deleted the whole app and downloaded it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started a new document and everything was fine. Then I downloaded a document from the internet and started to work in it and tried it again.</p>
<p>And again backspace deleted two characters instead of one.</p>
<p>So my problem still remains.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information that you have provided us. Since making a new document doesn't create a double space in between words, it means that the issue isn't with the Word app but with the downloaded documents or iOS itself. We suggest that you contact
 Apple support in regards with this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if anything comes up so we can further assist you.</p>

 It shows the following buttons: Back, Next, New and Cancel.&nbsp; When I click on next it does not move to the next page.&nbsp; What can I do to&nbsp;fix the issue?</p>

<p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the post. May I know where you initiate the new migration batch, from the EAC (Exchange admin center) in an Exchange server or Exchange Online? It's feasible to initiate the move in both places. So you can check if it's available to create
 the new batch in both places. Besides, please make sure you have created the migration endpoint and enabled the MRSProxy service instructed in the following article.</p>

<p>
</p><p>And if the issue persists, may I have a screenshot of the problematic page?<br />

<p>Hi Marvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot.&nbsp; I have been migrating accounts for well over a year with no problem.&nbsp; When I click on the next button it just sits and does not advance to the next screen.&nbsp; I also had another administrator to test on my machine&nbsp;and&nbsp;it worked.&nbsp; Not
 sure, what is causing the issue with my account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking a look at this issue.&nbsp; Marcus</p>

<p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot see your screenshot since the image won't show up if you just copy and paste in the post. Please insert the image via the button.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0d8e38a-0c5d-45f9-95ef-3911baf4c5c0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0d8e38a-0c5d-45f9-95ef-3911baf4c5c0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since another admin account works well, it could be related with your account configuration. You can check if your account has the right permissions to perform the move request via the following article. Also, you can sign in EAC in another computer
 to check if it recurs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can try to use the following PowerShell cmdlet to initiate a new migration batch to check if it works.</p>

<p>I have a workbook containing multiple sheets.</p>
<p>A macro in this (active)workbook opens other workbooks from time to time and copies data from them into this one. The first character of the name of the other workbook being opened determines which sheet the data will be pasted into in this one.</p>

<p>You either need to give us more info or show us you code or both.&nbsp; Are you copying the whole sheet and replacing all the data in the target sheet or are you adding the source sheet to the target workbook as a new sheet? Or are you copying a range from the
 source WB to and appending it to the target WB?</p>
<p>You could record the process and post the code telling us what changes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your suggestions so far.</p>
<p><span>Apologies for not giving enough info. On this question.</span></p>
<p><span>I have 12 workbooks for each of 5 schools, i.e. one for each month of the year. (So 60 workbooks)</span></p>
<p><span>These workbooks are all named using the convention: AYYYYMMMSCHOOL_ID where A = School identifier</span></p>
<p><span>Each of these workbooks has, amongst others, a sheet named “SCHOOL_DATA” which contains data in 12 columns, JAN – DEC. It is this data that needs to be copied and pasted “AS Value
 Only” into a Workbook named “Multi_School_Rep.xlsm”<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">into the appropriate School’s worksheet</span> in that workbook.</span></p>
<p><span>These sheets are named ASCHOOL_DATA …. ESCHOOL_DATA and these five sheets are exactly the same as the source sheets, “SCHOOL_DATA” in the individual school workbooks.</span></p>
<p><span>When the update macro is run each month (from Multi_School_Rep.xlsm”), the new data from the individual school sheets would over-write the previous data in the appropriate school
 sheet in “Multi_School_Rep.xlsm”</span></p>
<p><span>The code I have made does not work since it does not handle the variable filenames properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for the input.</span></p>

<p>I think to give you a solution, we need yet a little more information.&nbsp; You say the workbook naming convention is "AYYYYMMMSCHOOL_ID"&nbsp; Can you give us an example for a real school?&nbsp; Is the A actually just the letter A, or is it something else?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I understand things correctly, the "A" is literally "A" and "SCHOOL_ID" is literally that also, so the only thing that changes in a workbook name is the "A" ( to B, C, D and E) along with the YYYY and MMM portions.&nbsp; I'm also assuming the the MMM portion
 of the of the workbook name takes the form of "Jan" (or JAN) through Dec (or DEC).</p>
<p>I'm also thinking that in the 60 monthly workbooks, the data on the SCHOOL_DATA sheet only has data in one of the 12 columns on that sheet, as appropriate for the month in question as indicated by the workbook's filename?</p>
<p>I think we can start with JACKPOT's code as a basis and come up with a solution.&nbsp; I'll work at it and either edit this post to include the code or add to the thread if you have responded with more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've added this code that might even do the whole job for you, if not the parts within the<br />

entries may help you with building up the needed sheet name.</p>
<p>Here's my code - it assumes that all of the workbooks involved are in the same folder together.</p>

<p>Hi and thank you for the help so far.</p>
<p>Yes, you are correct the changing elements in the file name are only the "A ...E", the YEAR and the MON (JAN, FEB, etc.) the rest of the filename is always the same.</p>
<p>The data in the individual school SCHOOL_DATA sheets as well as that in the destination sheet will contain data which can change from month to month for all the months to date.</p>
<p>So, if we are now updating MAR the destination sheets would contain data for JAN and &nbsp;FEB immediately prior to the current update.</p>
<p>On updating for MAR we need to overwrite the saved JAN and FEB&nbsp;which may have changed, and also add the new MAR data so that we now have the latest data for year to date, month by month, for the first 3 months of the year.</p>
<p>To clarify, each of the month columns contains data for that month only which may be changed in coming months, so we need to over-write the previously saved month to pick up any changes after that month end.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Ok, I didn't realize we needed to update previous months also, so the code above doesn't do that.&nbsp; I will modify it this evening to deal with that requirement.&nbsp; Have to make changes to:</p>
<p>Find the Jan column on the 2 sheets, then determine the highest row number used in any of the columns we're going to be dealing with.&nbsp; Once that's done we can then define a rectangle area to copy over instead of the single column the code is copying at this
 time.</p>

<p>OK, here's my final code.&nbsp; Testing with just a little data shows that it works when everything is as expected.</p>
<p>Before starting, make a copy of the '<span>Multi_School_Rep.xlsm' workbook to work with, since it is the one that is going to have the code placed into it and the one that will get changes made to it.&nbsp; We don't
 want to lose your existing data if I'm wrong about anything of significance.&nbsp; Probably not a bad idea to simply make a dedicated testing folder and copy all of the existing files into it for the tests and work in that folder.</span></p>

<h2>            Converting Powerpivot 2010 to 2013 striping slicers</h2>
                    I am trying to convert a working 2010 Powerpivot workbook to 2013, but get the error "We found a problem with some content. Do you want to recover etc etc.&nbsp; If I say yes the workbook opens with ALL the slicers removed.&nbsp; The log file shows this.&nbsp; I'm guess
 pivottable cache means some pivots have been removed as well. i did successfully convert a smaller workbook previously.&nbsp;&nbsp; any suggestions appreciated as only reason I'm thinking of upgrading is to work on this workbook.<br />
<br />

            I'm not sure i understand the answer. Firstly as I said I have already converted one workbook to Excel 2013 so I wouldn't have thoguht it was a version problem although maybe that is because it was simpler.<br />
<br />
I am running Powerpivot 2012 version&nbsp; 11.0.2100.60.&nbsp; Is there a newer version I need to upgrade to before I can upgrade to Excel 2013?<br />

            I see there is an SP version 3129, but remember having problem upgrading to this before.&nbsp; If I install the 2012 SP! version of powerpivot in Excel 2010 and open my workbook I get this error<br />

Reading the link I must say I do get "unable to initialize database errors 3 times everytime I load the workbook.&nbsp; I just click OK and seem to be fine.&nbsp; As far as I am aware i created this workbook in the 2012 version, had one failed attempt to upgrade to SP1
 so uninstalled and went back to first version so don't think I have created anything in a newer version which the error implies.<br />
<br />
So assuming I need to complete the step to SP1 upgrade before the 2013 upgrade what does the rror above mean and can I get round it by maybe deleting the Latlong table and recreating it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            After a lot of messing around i have managed to install Powerpivot 2012 SP1 with the cumulative hotfix 3 version 11.1.3349.0.&nbsp; As far as i can tell this is the most recent version before Excel 2013.&nbsp; I have manged to get my workbook to load without any
 errors when I open powerpivot window.<br />
<br />
However when I open this workbook in Excel 2013 it still gives me the same&nbsp; "problem with content error" that strips the slicers if i say continue.&nbsp; Also it hasn't actually converted the workbook to 2013 as if i click on insert slicer it says it needs converting.
<br />
<br />
Completely stuck now so any advice appreciated.<br />
<br />
