                    Windows modern apps are not closing when they are maximized. They can be closed after clicking the restore down button though. Pressing Alt+F4 doesn't work both ways. This is for every app, incl. the PC Settings app. Issue also reported on Windows Feedback

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new 9860 Build, the apps have reverted back to their Windows 8.1 bahavior, except for a couple of items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Alt+F4 is still disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hidden&nbsp;Black title bar is back and works the same way it did in 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Full Screen option, and use the 'X' button on the hidden Title Bar, this will Suspend the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have used the App Commands to go Full Screen, the only way to fully Exit the app is&nbsp;to use the Exit Full Screen in App Commands and then click the 'X' button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Hi Ronnie, i think i can't understand exactly what you said. &nbsp;As far as i can understand you, and from my experience with the new 9860 build, i think that there are 3 modes, &nbsp;minimized, maximized, and full screen. In the maximized mode when I click on
 the X button, the apps are NOT closing and i have to click on the restore down &nbsp;button which is located right on the left side of the close button (the so called X button) in order to be able to close the app. If the app is in maximized window mode pressing
 the close &nbsp;button has no effect. I have &nbsp;not tested in full mode.

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The confusion comes from the new way that Modern Apps have been changed. It's not easy to explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before this Win10 Preview, (Windows 8.1) the Modern Apps always opened in full screen. This is larger than Maximized. There was a hidden Title Bar that only appeared when the cursor was moved to the top of the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 10 Preview all of the Modern Apps open in a traditional Maximized window. You can move the window around, resize the window, or use the same 3 buttons at the top/right corner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the App Commands at the top/left of the screen (3 dots) and select Full Screen,&nbsp; then you get the same full screen window that we saw in 8.1. This includes the hidden title bar that behaves the same was as it did in 8.1. If you use the Close button
 in this state, the app will close, but it is still kept in memory (Suspended).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this Full Screen mode you can move the cursor to the top of the screen and the title bar will appear. You can use the&nbsp;Minimize button at the top right "
<strong>-</strong> " to minimize the app to the Taskbar. Use the second, Restore Down&nbsp;button&nbsp;at the top right to return that window to the same Maximized state it was in when first opened. If the window is back to the Maximized state, then the Close button
 will completely Exit the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases, the Alt+F4 button is disabled in the version of the preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

            Hi again, now i am sure that you have misunderstood me, but maybe i didn't said you what happened clearly enough. I know that when the app is in full mode when i click the close button the window of the app closes but it's still active in the task manager.
 This is not my problem, my problem is that in this new 9860 build when the app is in maximized mode clicking on the close button literally doesn't do anything. The window of the app stays opened as if i haven't clicked the close button. It stays opened. I
 have to click the restore down button and then click on the close button in order to get the app closed. I am 99% sure that this is not the way it should be acting. I don't know how if it can be closed in full screen mode, but it certainly doesn't close in
 maximized mode. I'm writing this from my 8.1 OS so i'm going to reboot to Windows 10 and see if it continues to behave that way.

                    I haven't used Skype for about 3 weeks and when I opened it a few days ago I found that in my recent chats appear a lot of 'conversations' that weren't there before. those conversations are with hotmail accounts that I've blocked over the years. what's

            I would direct you to chat with a live agent from Skype Support to get your account checked. (This is not a bot support but staffed by human agents)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

</p><p>The Change Working Time dialog is for editing calendars.&nbsp; For example, you can edit the Standard calendar and add your company holidays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are trying to change the scheduling calendar for your project.&nbsp; If that is the case, you will need to do the following two steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click Project &gt; Project Information.&nbsp; Click the Calendar pick list and select the scheduling calendar for the project, then click the OK button.</li><li>Double-click the timescale bar (at the top of the Gantt Chart pane) and then select the Non-working time tab.&nbsp; Click the Calendar pick list and select the SAME calendar selected in the previous step, then click the OK button.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>When you go into the change working time dialog and drop the drop-down list and select 24 hours, all you have done is select that calendar for inspection and possible editing, and also possibly copying it to make a new custom calendar. You haven't yet applied
 that calendar to anything (the project, or tasks or resources). Then when you have exited the dialog, after maybe editing the calendar or not, you haven't changed anything in the project plan. If you want the 24 hours calendar to become the project calendar,
 you have to go to project, project information, and assign that calendar as the project calendar to replace the standard calendar.</p>
<p>The next thing is, do you really want to do this, because the standard calendar is a pretty good calendar to use as the project calendar.</p>
<p>When you are understanding how to apply different calendars to tasks and/or resources, make sure that you select a date/time format in file, options, general, which displays the time as well as the date, or it will become a bit confusing.</p>

 to wake up the monitors (not sleeping) the computer will not respond and the only way is to manually shutdown the computer. All previous builds have worked. Latest drivers for Video Cards.</p>

</p><p>Additionally, when powering on the computer about 1 out of 3 times the computer flashes the Windows Flag and immediately powers off, next attempt powers up as normal (HP Z220 16gig RAM)</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Power Management is as yet somewhat rough. I find it best not to use Sleep at all (as it simply does not work on 2 of my systems). You may find things better if you turn off 'Fast startup'. It gets reset to 'On' after each upgrade so you will have to
 check it after each Upgrade (after checking the issue still exists, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's somewhat hidden but you can find it under the old <strong>Control Panel-&gt;System and Security-&gt;Power Options-&gt;Choose what the Power Buttons do</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            Well your posting really did specify just how you wanted to turn them off and since sleep is a common way of putting monitors into sleep mode, as I haven't ever seen a way a PC will turn off monitors notice
 power up and power down issues have been caused by the Fast start up at least give it a try by un clicking it.

<p>&nbsp;When I try various 3rd party methods to put them in power save mode, one of the monitors flashes, 2 turn off. When I attempt to wake up the monitors (not sleeping) the computer will not respond and the only way is to manually shutdown the computer. All

<p>Don't know but when you say <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">power save mode</span> that is the same as Seeping mode to me. But if the monitor is actually shutting down there is no software way to start it again without pressing the Power button on
 the monitor.</p>

 them.&nbsp; Prior to the Windows 10 Creators update, the messages were then automatically deleted from my phone - there was a setting along the lines of "delete messages when deleted from server".&nbsp; I've not been able to find that setting since the update.&nbsp; I tried
 turning off Sync for email, but the setting won't stick - it always turns itself on again.</p>

<p>Hi Ian</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Outlook Mail for Mobile on my phone looks nothing like the screenshot you posted, and if the POP options exist, I haven't been able to find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC, I've got Outlook 2010 set to delete messages from the server when I download them (by unchecking "leave a copy of messages on the server" in Advanced Settings). What used to happen before the Creators Update is that the messages would then be deleted
 automatically from Outlook Mail on my phone.&nbsp; Since the update, messages are not deleted from my phone.&nbsp; Some might argue that that's a good thing, but it's not the way of working I'd got used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the end of the world, because I can delete messages from the phone manually.&nbsp; However, if you or anyone else can tell me how to get it done automatically once messages have been deleted from the server, I'd be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&nbsp; Tim L</p>

    <title>6060 headphone use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> __ed__---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6060 headphone use</h2>
                    
<p>I know it is an old phone but it still works great. I would like to use a headphone that includes a mic boom, with this phone. When I plug it in it says Enhancement not supported. Can I download some app or change the settings to support the headphone or
 is it not going to work no matter what? TIA.</p>

<h3> mikeyvu  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off the setting that makes the phone read everything out to you&#63;</h2>
                    Ok so first off I have a Windows phone 8X and I was messing with the settings and I turned on something that made it to where the phone would read whatever was on the screen. I'm now trying to turn it off but I couldnt figure out how to scroll. It simply
 read what was at the bottom of the list. I remember that when I turned it on it said "Hold volume up button while tapping the home button twice to turn off". Well I did that and the voice stopped reading everything out but now I cant do anything to the touch
 screen. The volume and camera button still works but I can't do anything else. I desperately need help on how to fix this as soon as possible please.&nbsp;

            <p>So you turned on Narrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Narrator is found under Settings/ease of access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct that it did say to turn off Narrator hold the volume button up and press the Start button</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/use-narrator-on-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/use-narrator-on-my-phone</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So this is the key part to read:</strong></p>
To turn off Narrator
<p>Turn off Narrator at any time by pressing and holding the <span>Volume Up</span> button, and then pressing the
<span>Start</span> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f6bb2095a-8baa-4fc5-b4ae-4745107b1070%2fhardware-icon-start-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button. Don't release the
<span>Volume Up</span> button until Narrator tells you that it's turning off. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just as an FYI, I tried it for the first time to test it. Initially I had just a little difficulty but then I carefully pressed and kept the volume up pressed then with it pressed I windows button (Start button) with just a light press (tap so to speak)
 and it turned it off.</p>

<p>Eric, you've linked to an article about the MS Truetype Font Pack, a product that came out in 1992 to supplement the native fonts supplied with Windows 3.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's some reason you feel this information that's QUITE out of date (2016 minus 1992 ... do the math) answers Dea's question about Office 2016, please let us know.&nbsp; Otherwise, do everyone a favor and delete or correct your answer.</p>

<p>True.&nbsp; But w/o a more specific question, the answer's more like a book chapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the fonts installed by Office 2016/any edition are either TrueType or Opentype fonts.&nbsp; OpenType fonts can contain font descriptions in either TrueType or PostScript/Type1 format.&nbsp; Since Office no longer supports Type1 fonts, I'm willing to bet large
 sums that MS has distributed ONLY OpenType+TrueType fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, though, if a font appears in the list of available fonts in PowerPoint, it's TrueType.</p>

<h2>            outlook calendar won&#39;t sync with ical therefore iphone</h2>
                    For some reason yesterday i discovered all my bookings in my calendar in my iphone disappeared after syncing with my laptop. &nbsp;I recently got an iphone 4 and am using Outlook 2011, and it has been syncing without issue for at least 2 weeks. &nbsp;My calendar
 in Outlook still exists but the calendar in ical is the same as my iphone, i.e. nothing.... The sync services seems to be set up. &nbsp;The only thing i did differently yesterday is my Outlook was running slow so i closed everything and restarted my computer, normally
 i don't close Outlook or shutdown my laptop. &nbsp;So i expect it had something to do with that. &nbsp;I see most of the question posted here are for new devices. &nbsp;Any suggestions??

            <p>Are you using Mountain Lion (10.8)? If yes, this is very unfortunately expected as Sync Services are depreciated in that version of the System.<br />What we'd need for this sort of things would be proper iCloud support, but MS still hasn't implemented the necessary CalDAV support we need for that (and it would provide support for the Google calendars as well at the same time).<br />&nbsp;If that's an important feature for you, I would strongly encourage you to use the Help &gt; Send Feedback command from within Outlook to let MS know, and help them prioritize future development.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corentin</p>

            Hi BarbaraMacDonald3
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your calendar question.
<br />
<br />I believe what you are looking for is something similar ike the To-Do List.  If this correct, the calendar does not have that feature since it is a calendar and will only show events.
<br />
<br />I hope this answers your question.
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi BarbaraMacDonald3,
<br />I’m Linnell I'm an Independent Advisor,
<br />I categorise mine when completed Right click on the event and select categorise or manage Categories so you can set Categories that would work for you. 
<br />There is a topic in Uservoice you may want to add to for crossing off  events off when completed.

            If you are unable to uninstall, verify that you have all updates via a WiFi connection. If there are none, then if it were mine I would consider a hard reset and start fresh.

<h2>            Autoplay audio the 2nd time a slide is viewed</h2>
                    <p>I have a ppt presentation with audio files that play automatically when a slide is viewed. It works fine the first time I visit a slide, but if I return to the slide later (which is almost certain to happen), the audio does not play unless I exit slide show
 mode and go back into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get the audio to play (from the beginning of the sound file) every time I visit a slide?</p>

<p>The audio is attached to a slide. It's supposed to play while the slide is showing, but not when I move to another slide. Again, it works fine the first time a slide is viewed. However, if I go back to a slide I've already seen, the audio doesn't play.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can work around that by going to the slide, pressing the left arrow key and then the right arrow key, but that's awkward, especially since this will be on a display at a conference booth and visitors will be driving the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 7 slides with audio, and each has the issue. The each audio consists of a 3-7 minute song. I thought the problem might be that I moved away from a slide before the song finished, but I tried letting a song play to the end and it didn't help.</p>

 more folders in Address Book than there are in the side bar (and they all contain the addresses, groups, etc&nbsp;they should so they must be stored somewhere).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is to have the same folders in the sidebar, because I can't move&nbsp;contacts around, etc, (or at least I don't know how) in Address Book. If you have any idea what I may have done to cause Outlook to appear to delete them without warning,
 that would also be useful, as I spent a considerable time yesterday more or less recreating what I had before but with little confidence that nothing is mislaid, missing or duplicated. Also, if I don't know where they are still stored there is some risk that
 I will inadvertently delete the ones that are only in address Book. All suggestions welcome!</p>

            <p>I have now had time to try this. I started the Scannow process, which entered the Verification phase. The counter got up to 87%, and then stopped counting. The PC obviously thinks something is still running (I tried to restart after nothing had happened
 for 30 minutes,&nbsp;but it wouldn't let me), but with no messages I have no idea whether it is doing anything useful. I guess I'll leave it for a bit longer, and if nothing has happened eventually I'll have to reboot and then see if I can start scannow again.
 Any suggestions welcome.</p>

            <p>OK, that is helpful to understand. I had trouble setting up IMAP and making it work sensibly so I'm&nbsp;using POP settings, and backing up contacts periodically, which would explain the 'this computer only'.&nbsp;That works fine for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't understand what dictates what folders appear in the Contacts side bar. They are not the same as the folders in Address Book, which is what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have another example of this problem. I have just set up another email address on my laptop which uses Outlook 365 and Exchange Server (I work as a contractor on projects for different companies so have to use whatever they want), and on doing this
 ALL the contacts folders in the sidebar have disappeared, except for a new 'contacts' folder, LinkedIn and three (but not all) of the 'This computer only' folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;should be able to recreate them from my backups, but as they are still there in Address Book, I think this will just result in a lot of duplication and potential confusion (I will never remember to update all copies). As far as I can tell, I can't manage
 the contents through the Address Book dialogue, so have no way to avoid that. As a last resort, I could&nbsp;uninstall Outlook and start again from backups, but that seems a somewhat risky and blunt instrument, and I will probably just have the same problem again
 later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>If you have added a Ex mail account, if you click the Contacts/People icon in the lower left of the mail OL screen, a separate view of People/Contacts will open, in the left pane under My Contacts there should be separate folder listings for any Ex or Pop

            <p>Thanks for your interest in this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going into the Ex mail account. When I click contacts people, I get a side bar, but no 'my contacts' (there is a 'your contacts' which may be what you mean but it only contains addresses set up in this account, not anything else.) In any case,
 I would not want to have to access them through this account where most will not be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Address Book is not a folder itself, but it must be getting its data from somewhere. If I knew where, and how to edit the source data, that would go a long way to solving the problem. I used to be able to do that through the contacts side
 bar, but I can't if it does not show the data! I never had this problem with older versions of Outlook.</p>

<h3> bonnietallarico  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending email newsletter from Publisher 2013 through Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I have installed Publisher 2013 on my computer and I run Outlook 2010. I want to be able to send an email newsletter from Publisher but I've been told that I can't if Outlook and Publisher are different versions. Can I "downgrade" by Publisher 2013 to
 Publisher 2010 so I can use this feature?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>( I had the trial version of Publisher 2010 on my computer and it worked fine. I waited until Publisher 2013 was launched before I purchased the program as I thought there would be other new features. Unfortunately, the feature that I needed (email newsletters)
 now won't work because I have Outlook 2010 on my computer (installed in December 2012) and I'm not buying a whole new version of Office 2013 just for this issue.</div>

<div>Thanks for your help !</div>

            Once you install the Publisher 2013 or Office 2013 you will be able to use all the features. Use it for the 30 day trial and see this works.

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but this doesn't really help. I did use the trial version of Publisher 2010 for 30 days and loved it but waited for Publisher 2013 to be launched this month before making the purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My trial version (Pub2010) worked with my email but now&nbsp;it won't&nbsp;as I use Office 2010 &amp; purchased Pub2013. If I had known this was going to happen, I would have purchased Pub2010. Downloading the trial version of Office 2013 is only going to work for 30
 days and I'm not willing to buy a whole new version of Office 2013 for a computer I just got a month ago&nbsp;&amp; just installed Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I'm stuck using a 3rd party campaign program which I really didn't want to do or sending my Publisher files as PDF attachments (which I didn't want to do either)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate your reply. Thanks for trying to help me find a solution !</p>

<p>On many occasions during lengthy back and forth emails between me and a client, it seems when the email thread gets too long, Outlook can't send a reply out and it gets stuck in the Outbox.&nbsp; Sometimes if I copy and paste the thread into a brand new email
 it will send, but this is really a pain.&nbsp; I don't get any send/receive errors or anything.&nbsp; Any thoughts to help resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Feel free to ask any questions.</p>

<h2>            Outllook 2016 for Mac&#58; use a Gmail account as Exchange account</h2>
                    <p>I have followed the instructions reported&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Set-up-an-email-account-in-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-86bd232e-0422-49b5-9b60-d1c5f1109f40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">at this link</a>&nbsp;in order to configure an Exchange
 account in the Outlook 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to add a Gmail account as an Exchange account.</p>
<p>I don't want to use IMAP because I want to synchronize also the Calendar and the Contacts.</p>
<p>So I have tried to configure it as an Exchange account, setting the "Server" field to "m.google.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account seems to be correctly recognized: the description and the full name are correctly resolved, but it doesn't work:&nbsp;no synchronization, no errors, nothing happens.</p>
<p>The account has not the green icon: it is visible a yellow icon instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is missing? I have left the advanced options of the Exchange account as default.</p>
<p>How to make it works like in Windows OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi AlessandroC85,<br />
<br />
Based on my knowledge, it’s not feasible to set up a Gmail account via Exchange in Outlook for Mac. And like you mentioned, the calendars, notes, tasks and contacts cannot be synced when the Gmail account is configured via IMAP in Outlook for Mac. Here is a
 relevant article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Can-I-sync-my-Google-account-with-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-ba24d6df-992f-4e9f-b13f-db45ae51559a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Can-I-sync-my-Google-account-with-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-ba24d6df-992f-4e9f-b13f-db45ae51559a</a><br />
