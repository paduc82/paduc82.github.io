<h2>            Buttons on a continuous subform</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with the buttons on a continuous subform not working correctly. I will give you the background then explain the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an invoice form which is made up of three subforms which are all continuous forms;</p>
<p>-one to select the order (named suborders)</p>
<p>-one to select the product on that order (subproducts) </p>
<p>-one to enter the invoice details (subshipments). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Each subform is bound to the relevant table, and this form works perfectly for entering invoices. What I am trying to do, and what I thought would be relatively simple, is to take the qty shipped (in subshipments) and subtract it from the qty outstanding
 (in subproducts). I have tried using an update query, with a button on the shipments form and a macro in the on click event to open the query, then requery the subproducts form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my query, I have the criteria set to order number and item ID in the subshipments form must match the order number and item ID in the subproducts table. I have tried various permutations of this, using table values to match table values, and form values
 to match form values, but I'm not sure which I should be linking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that setting the criteria to 'the data in the subshipments form must match the data in the subproducts table' is the correct version as this does sometimes work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that sometimes I get 0 rows updated, sometimes I get the correct outcome (the qty outstanding is reduced by the correct qty) and sometimes I get 1 row updated, but with the incorrect qty. What I think is happening, is that despite which button
 I click on, it is only looking at the data in the first row of the subshipments form. Which is why sometimes the order number and ID match, but if I am trying to ship a different qty, it still only takes the number from the first entry. There does still seem
 to be times where it doesn't follow this pattern, and I just get 0 results returned so I am thoroughly confused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure that I've explained this very well so if you need further clarification or I have missed some important information then please let me know!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'd have to see your query to help with this. Can you post the SQL of that query? Or perhaps post your database somewhere and provide a link so that we can download and review?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you requery or modify your subreport's Recordsource or Filter properties at any time? This could cause the subform to focus the first row.</p>

<p>This is not the best idea. As a general rule, we don't store calculated values and that's what you are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should have a query that sums the quantity shipped by order and items. something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT OrderNo, ItemID, SUM(QtyShipped) As Shipped</p>
<p>FROM Shipments</p>
<p>GROUP BY OrderNo, ItemID</p>
<p>ORDER BY OrderNo,ItemID</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then calculate the Qty Outstanding by taking the qty Ordered and subtracting the Shipped from that query. You can do this in the controlSource on your form or you do it in the Recordsource of the form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is the SQL:</p>
UPDATE Sales_orders_add_cookers INNER JOIN Shipment_link ON (Sales_orders_add_cookers.Cooker_ID = Shipment_link.Item) AND (Sales_orders_add_cookers.Order_number = Shipment_link.Order_number) SET Sales_orders_add_cookers.Qty_outstanding = [Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Qty_outstanding]-[Shipment_link]![Qty_shipped]<br />
WHERE ((([Forms]![Invoice]![subshipments].[Form]![order_number_box_shipments])=[Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Order_number]) AND (([Forms]![Invoice]![subshipments].[Form]![Item_box_shipments])=[Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Cooker_ID]));<br />
<p>
</p><p>I know that it's not normally the best idea to store calculated values, but as this is a stock control database, and the qty outstanding needs to be shown in multiple forms, surely it is better to have it stored rather than having to calculate it each and
 every time? I assumed that calculating the value each time was more for 'one off' values, like calculating order totals on an order form not for more complex scenarios like this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I wanted to go into a customer file and view their current orders as well as the qty outstanding for each, is it not easier to just look up one value rather than have to look at another table and all corresponding records to see what has
 been shipped?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I am aware that you know far, far more than me on this so I'm not saying that my way is right, I'm just trying to understand why it is wrong!&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>.................surely it is better to have it stored rather than having to calculate it each and every time?</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No.&nbsp; Computing the value whenever needed guarantees that it is correct.&nbsp; Storing it leaves the database open to the possibility of update anomalies, thus putting the integrity of the data at risk.<br />
<br />
For an example of the <em>basic </em>methodologies of inventory computation, allowing for other movements out of stock than sales orders, and periodic stock-takes you might like to take a look at Inventory.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
I emphasised the word '<em>basic</em>' above.&nbsp; Inventory management in an organisation of any size is very complex and goes far beyond the scope of my demo.<br />

<p>I agree with Ken - you should never store a value that can be calculated from root values. I work with a very large ERP system that does exactly this - stores those calced values - and we have a never ending problem with those values being improperly managed.
 They're slowly working through their system and replacing all the instances where those values are used with the calculations needed, but it's taking time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, your WHERE clause looks wrong. You're essentially stating that the query should return records where a value in your FORM is equal to the value in another form. You should be comparing the values in your recordset to values in the forms:</p>
<p><br />
WHERE ((([Forms]![Invoice]![subshipments].[Form]![order_number_box_shipments])=[Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Order_number]) AND (([Forms]![Invoice]![subshipments].[Form]![Item_box_shipments])=[Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Cooker_ID]));</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that should instead be something like:</p>
<p>WHERE (([Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Order_number]=[Forms]![Invoice]![subshipments].[Form]![order_number_box_shipments]) AND (([Sales_orders_add_cookers]![Cooker_ID]=[Forms]![Invoice]![subshipments].[Form]![Item_box_shipments]);</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may not have the parentheses right in the second one, but that looks more correct to me.</p>

<p>As Ken said, its wrong because it leaves you open to update anomalies. If you calculate the value on the fly you get the most up to date and accurate info. In a relational database one of the principles is that data should exist in ONE place and ONE place
 only. this is one of the reason you use expression to calculate data. You can reuse the expression wherever needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With modern day computers, performance is not a big issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't feel bad, the mistake is a common one made by database novices. its a question that we have answered many times.</p>

            What EXACTLY are you putting in the ControlSource? If you are getting a #Name error, it means that Access can't resolve to names in the expression. Make sure you have defined the names being used and that they are spelled correctly.

<p><span>Hi Canbeamer,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When deploying Office, you create an installation package of the source files used to install Office. The source files are different for 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Office and are different for each of the update channels. Because of this, you will likely
 need to create multiple installation packages to support the different architectures and update requirements in your organization. For example, to deploy to two channels and both architectures, you create four packages:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Semi-Annual Channel for 32-bit</li><li>Semi-Annual Channel for 64-bit</li><li>Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) for 32-bit</li><li>Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) for 64-bit</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For details on which architecture to choose, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/article/Choose-between-the-64-bit-or-32-bit-version-of-Office-2dee7807-8f95-4d0c-b5fe-6c6f49b8d261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Choose the 32-bit or 64-bit version

<h2>            problems getting BCM 2010 contacts to sync with windows live.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to sync my ~2000&nbsp;Business Contact Manager 2010 contacts with my new WP7 phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I understand that I have to first sync to my Live account and then the contacts will be uplifted to the phone.</p>
<p>I have the Outlook Hotmail&nbsp;Connector installed and a Live ID set up as an account in my Outlook 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I kick off the sync via the BCM synchcronize facility (File&gt;Business Contact Manager&gt;Synchronize identifying the BCM business contacts folder) I get a series of messages saying something like "such and such a field exceeds the&nbsp;X character limit".&nbsp; For
 each of these&nbsp;messages I click the option to automatically truncate the fields.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;I get a message saying something like "Business Contact synchronization cannot begin. One or more email addresses are not in a valid format. Email addresses must be in the
 format Fred.smith@ xyz.com".&nbsp; The sync fails to happen - I get no contacts onto my live ID and so none onto my phone.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me to resolve this issue?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have just 'up'graded from Android to WP7 and am having REAL difficulty getting my new phone to integrate with Outlook !&nbsp; I am seriously beginning to wonder if I have made the right decision....&nbsp;&nbsp; does it have to be so hard and difficult?!</p>

            <p>Hi stobbo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you check if contacts are syncing fine from your Windows Live ID (<a href="http://www.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.live.com</a>) to your Windows Phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What exact steps are you following in Outlook itself to sync your contacts? What happens if you enter a test account manually in the Windows Live Contact folder on your Outlook? Is that syncing fine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc A.</p>

            <p>Hi Marc,&nbsp; thank you for your interest in helping me.</p>
<p>Windows Live to Windows Phone 7 sync is working - that much I have been able to prove.</p>
<p>I have proved this by&nbsp;<em>copying</em> contacts from Outlook to WL which then find their way onto WP7.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is with <em>synchronising</em> Business Contacts Manager contacts from Outlook via the Outlook Hotmail connector &amp; WL to WP7.</p>
<p>The exact steps are (from Outlook 2010)</p>
<p>1. File&gt;Business Contacts Manager&gt;Synchronize&gt;Start Synchronising Business Contacts</p>
<p>2. Select Windows Live account</p>
<p>3. OK</p>
<p>I then get the following messages</p>
<p>1. a Business Contact Manager&nbsp;notification message saying&nbsp;that synchronisation is starting/has started.</p>
<p>2. A number of&nbsp;Outlook Hotmail Connector Messages interspersed with each other:
</p>
<p>&nbsp; - "The 'Business City Address' exceeds the limit of 40 characters. Type fewer characters or click OK to delete excess characters".&nbsp; Since I cannot tell which record the message relates to&nbsp;I just hit OK.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; - "The 'Business State Address' exceeds the limit of 40 characters. Type fewer characters or click OK to delete excess characters".&nbsp; Again, since I cannot tell which record the message relates to&nbsp;I just hit OK.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - "The company name exceeds the limit of 40 characters. Type fewer characters before you click OK or excess characters will be automatically removed."&nbsp;&nbsp;- ditto - &nbsp;OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- "The text exceeds the limit of 1024 characters. Type a shorter amount of text or click OK tohave a local copy different to the one on the server."&nbsp; - ditto - OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - "The business postal code exceeds the limit of 40 characters. Type fewer characters before you click OK or excess characters will be automatically removed."&nbsp;&nbsp; - ditto -&nbsp;&nbsp;OK.</p>
<p>3. then I get A Business Contact Manager for Outlook message&nbsp;"Cannot start Business Contact synchronisation.&nbsp; One or more email addresses are not in a valid format. All email addresses must be typed in the following format: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and nothing gets synchronised to WL.</p>
<p>If the email address format validation is really the problem then I wonder what email address formats Outlook Hotmail Connector does accept.</p>
<p>Do I have to include the single quotes from the message in all my email addresses (as in the *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'&nbsp;of the message) to get it to work ?!
</p>
<p>Or is the problem that a number of the email addresses of my contacts (all of which are valid and active email addresses) are in formats different from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; For example I hold (because they are what my contacts have as email addresses) numerous valid
 email addresses in formats such as:</p>
<p>a) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>b) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>c) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>d) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>e) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>f) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>...and so forth.&nbsp; I am alarmed that&nbsp;Outlook hotmail Connector might not be able to cope with anything other than&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** !&nbsp; I am not even sure why it should care since all it needs to do is pass the email address it is given on to WL....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?!</p>
<p>Rgds, Andy</p>

            <p>This is&nbsp;indeed very&nbsp;sad.&nbsp; I have come out of a five year&nbsp;hibernation (ATnT Tilt)&nbsp;to have to upgrade my phone.&nbsp; I wish to stay in a Microsoft business environment but they Microsoft is are not making it possible it seems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;iPhone synced perfectly but I do not want to live in their world.&nbsp; The phone&nbsp;seamlessly brought in all POP and account, contact, calendar too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the many other&nbsp;phones I have bought and returned over the last three weeks have performed to any reasonable expectation with Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every Android or Windows&nbsp;phone&nbsp;presents&nbsp;similar issues of truncation.&nbsp; Samsung, Nokia, whatever.<br />
<br />
To me this is suicide on the part of Microsoft or any partner.&nbsp; I can not&nbsp;by a Microsoft Branded&nbsp;Phone that protects my years of devotion and effort?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some in Microsoft explain that it is the Phone Manufacturer not the software that is causing the truncation issue. I can only&nbsp;assume the cheep skate cellular providers have purposefully truncated the number of characters to back down to protect bandwidth).&nbsp;
 Or is it the other foot?&nbsp; There is uncalled for harm occurring .... this is clearly obvious for me and I am sure to countless other Microsoft Outlook power user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have taken great time in relating my experience to each person in every corporation&nbsp;I have dealt with in order&nbsp;to make a better&nbsp;experience for those behind me.&nbsp; Reality Check:&nbsp;I have told them the harm they are doing to my business&nbsp;perhaps was perhaps
 an&nbsp;act of omission?&nbsp;I don't think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can any company&nbsp;be proud of this implemented limitation?&nbsp; The collective harm it is causing business has to be astounding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No way are these&nbsp;ignorant&nbsp;acts of omission on the part of Microsoft&nbsp;or their Partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the lifeblood of our US economy an alive able to work business person.&nbsp; This&nbsp;lack of consideration by either Microsoft and their partnering phone makers and service providers smacks of RICO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have invested thousands of hours of careful protection of my clients&nbsp; never believing that I would someday be forced to publish their contact information to a "Cloud" just to&nbsp;sync as I can with ActiveSync. That is just one of many other lamentations.<br />

That card doesn't support DirectX 12, so no matter how many drivers you download it will still be 11.2, adjusted your resolution to fit the spec's of your monitor.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that is very risky, what if 2 or more people have the same forename? However, Let's say your names are in col A and the age in column B you can use this ARRAY formula; see below for how to enter it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the name you're looking for in D1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>=INDEX($B$1:$B$20,MATCH(D1&amp;" ",LEFT($A$1:$A$20,FIND(" ",$A$1:$A$20)),0))</p>

</div>
<div>I just got an email, seemingly from Outlook saying 'click here' or my account will be closed. Most of the content was blocked so I assume it's spam but also don't want my account to be closed. Anyone have the same email? Is it spam?</div>

Most likely a<b> Phishing Scam.</b><br />
Best ignored.<br />
Don't click on any links.<br />

<b><br />
Treat with great suspicion any email that asked for personal details....{ User Name, Date of Birth, Password etc}</b><br />
Microsoft does not ask for such details.

Most likely spam.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div><strong>Its a scam.&nbsp; A well known and long running one.&nbsp; Microsoft will never ask for personal details (they already have them) and will never cold call you. &nbsp;Nor do they send
 out anti virus messages</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that&nbsp;</span></em></div>

<strong><br />
What should you do if you receive a questionable email?</strong></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>DONT CLICK ON LINKS, Dont go to web sites that are suggested, dont give access, or volunteer information</b></div>
<div><strong><br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate the information.</strong><br />
Take some time and check up on the information. Often sites like snopes.com can provide information on known chain letters and other scams and untruths.&nbsp; Do not click on links within the mail, but do go to that companyâ€™s website, and contact their customer
 service reps via phone or online to verify the validity of the email.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report suspicious activities.</strong><br />
If you think someone has accessed your Outlook.com account, that the Live ID sign-in page looks fraudulent, or you receive an email that tries to confirm a password change you didnâ€™t authorize, change your password immediately by going to: http://account.live.com.
 Next, help ensure your PC has not been infected with a virus or malware by running a free full-PC scan.</div>
<div><strong><br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help the Outlook.com team identify new scams.</strong><br />
Click on the Junk button in Outlook.com and select â€œJunkâ€ or â€œReport phishing scamâ€ to report it to the Outlook.com team. Whatever you do, do not reply back to the sender.</div>

            Your code should refer to the Option Group rather than the option button. I would recommend using Select Case rather than If.

<br />Select Case Me.[Your Option Group Name]

<br />    DoCmd.OpenQuery "Query1"

<h3> shyguy80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 10 UAC</h2>
                    Ok so recently I started to get a strange problem. I tried to research it, but there wasn't much out there. While I was browsing, IE decided to crash and recover. I exited out of all the tabbed windows I had open, then once I tried to get back into IE
 the UAC popped up. I tested it and it shows up every single time I try to open IE. Restarted the computer to see if it would fix the problem, but didn't. After some troubleshooting, I narrowed it down some. The only time the UAC pops up is if IE is pinned
 to the taskbar. I placed a shortcut on the desktop, executed the file from the directory and no UAC. This problem only popped up after IE crashed. Ive had it crash before but not the UAC problem. so now my question...whats the fix? I prefer to have it the
 way it was before. I had it pinned and it worked fine before.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you recently installed any add-ons such as toolbar or extensions to the browser?
</p>
<p>2. Have you try to remove the Internet Explorer shortcut from the taskbar and repin to check the issue?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. Perform the steps provided here and check the results.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>

            I havent installed any add-ons recently. I have removed the taskbar shortcut and put it back, but the same problem happens. I tried a shortcut to desktop 'then' pin it to the taskbar and it works, but then there are 2 instances of IE in the taskbar, which
 I dont want. I used the 32 bit IE and it works, but same 2 instances of IE in the taskbar. I also have deleted history and reset settings and it didnt fix it. Internet Explorer works fine, its just the UAC that bugs me every time I launch IE. I have had IE
 crash plenty of times before when I have numerous tabs opened and never had the UAC problem come up. It only started recently with no change to anything on my computer, or IE for that matter.

<p>I moved your post to the Windows section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are add-ins that allow you to customize keyboard shortcuts. Here's one:&nbsp;<a href="http://officeoneonline.com/ppsctmgr/ppsctmgr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OfficeOne Shortcut Manager 8 for PowerPoint</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also assign commands to Quick Access Toolbar icons. Each QAT command can be run with a key combination of Alt + the QAT button position. So if a command is fifth in the row, then
<strong>Alt + 5</strong> will run it. Please post again if you need help creating custom QAT buttons.</p>

    <title>Embedded Videos won&#39;t play in IE 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heartland86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedded Videos won&#39;t play in IE 11</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I use IE 11 with Windows 8.1, desktop version.&nbsp; Whenever a web site has embedded videos, the browser refuses to play them or even show that they're on the page at all.&nbsp; This particular site is a forum, so the only way I know of to play the videos is
 to go to the quote button and paste the URL in the tube tags into a new tab.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm blind and I use a screen reader called Jaws for Windows, so I need instructions that will work with the keyboard in order to fix it.&nbsp; I can go on this site or any other that uses embedded videos using my other computer that has Windows 7, but when I
 showed this site to a sighted friend who is an expert, on 7 anyway, he said it looks like I have no flash, even though I do.&nbsp; When I tried to update flash, it just says that flash is integrated in IE 11.&nbsp; YouTube vids play fine if I have a link, even though
 they're now playing in HTML5, which I prefer, and a radio station I listen to online plays&nbsp;in flash.&nbsp; The only thing I can't play is embedded videos.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way I can downgrade bak to version 10 of Internet Explorer?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hello seemanthinib ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing&nbsp;to this forum.</p>
<p>To answer your two questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. While typing a message try to change the language (by clicking on the globe icon) to a different
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; language and back to the preferred on. That should fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The availability of the speech for phone accessibility depends on both region and mobile operator. If this option is unvailable either it is not provided in the region/country where you reside<br />
or your mobile operator does not support this functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adrian St.</p>

    <title>Outlook Calendar missing info - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morris sych  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar missing info</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to a new computer, windows 10 and Office 2016 Home and Business from a Dell computer (2011 model year), Windows 7 and Office Pro 2010. I moved all of my PST files over from the old computer. Got all my emails and most of my address book (it appears
 that some of my saved contacts may have disappeared). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bigger issue is none of my calendar info came over as the calendar was completely blank. I had to export from the old computer file info and import it on the new one, but this only gave history back to July 2017 and NO earlier. I need the earlier stuff
 for history searches etc. Also it did not bring over any reoccurring items, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did not the calendar info come over with all the other info in the PST file and/or how do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi HowSol,<br />
<br />
In the same crashes encountered on the previous version you've to attempt to repair corrupt files system by running
<strong>SFC /SCANNOW</strong> at boot, so that will repair system files and fix the launching modern apps issues.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<p>InArray will always be Dim'ed 1 to something as Variant<br />
InArray will never contain duplicated values<br />
N will be Dim'ed as Long and always be less than the number of elements in InArray<br />
The output should be an array Dim'ed 1 to N</p>
<p>When the output array is returned, I want to insure that it also has no duplicates.</p>
<p>I have something similar as a sub, but it uses worksheet cells to shuffle and select the subset.</p>

            <p>I'm not 100% sure of your setup... you say InArray will be an array Dim'med 1 to something seeming to mean it is created in VB code, but you are asking for&nbsp;a worksheet formula to pass it into the UDF? Anyway, maybe you can make use of the function which
 I know works in code when you pass it a single-dimensioned array (RandomSampleArray will be an array with the same lower bound as the array passed into it and will contain N elements)...<br />
<br />
Function RandomSampleArray(InArray As Variant, N As Long) As Variant<br />
&nbsp; Dim Cnt As Long, RandomIndex As Long, Temp As Variant, TempArray As Variant<br />
&nbsp; Static IsRandomized As Variant<br />
&nbsp; If IsEmpty(IsRandomized) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Randomize<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IsRandomized = True<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; TempArray = InArray<br />
&nbsp; For Cnt = UBound(TempArray) To LBound(TempArray) Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RandomIndex = Int((Cnt - LBound(TempArray) + 1) * Rnd + LBound(TempArray))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Temp = TempArray(RandomIndex)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempArray(RandomIndex) = TempArray(Cnt)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TempArray(Cnt) = Temp<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; ReDim Preserve TempArray(1 To N)<br />
&nbsp; RandomSampleArray = TempArray<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Note that I made the function take care of issuing the Randomize statement call once per session (Randomize should only be issued one time per session so as not to compromise the size of the random numbers Rnd will make use of).</p>

<p>hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i recently bought a new nokia 2730 classic. the very first time i switched it on, it turns off without me doing anything! i turn it on and after a while, it switches off by itself! it's my fault that i did'nt test the phone before buying, but what do i do?
 the nokia care centre charges 35euros to check it?? but i just bought it! what can be wrong?</p>

<h2>            Changing default font and bullet point settings on PP</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I want to change the default setting on PowerPoint 2013 to Calibri 24 and also get rid of the automatic bullet points - but I rarely create new powerpoints, I just update existing ones. Even though the existing ones are all in Calibri 24 they go back
 to a bigger font etc if I cut and paste in, or make any alterations.Please can someone tell me how to change this? BUT - I am useless at computers and need&nbsp;very simple step by step instructions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why Powerpoint didn't come up as an option on the Categories list either, so I chose Windows instead. What should I have asked for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks </p>
<p />
