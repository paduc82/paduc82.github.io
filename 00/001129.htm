            Hello guys,<br />
<br />
Having read about your discussion about windows live messenger for N96 I thought i'd throw in a few things.<br />
<br />
First off the windows live messenger isn't out for the N96, Like few of you here who has an N96 I have purchased one aswell and I tried various different forums and went into the download but I still have no success for the messenger.<br />
<br />
As for those of you who are looking for the .sisx file, it is possible to get it, the tip is if you can get hold of an N95/N95 8GB,<br />
<br />
1 - Download the 'Nokia Download' software onto your pc and install it.<br />
<br />
2 - Once installation has finished connect the N95/N95 8GB to your pc then run the 'Download' program from your PC, wait till the application detects the phone.<br />
<br />
3 - After this process is done, in the 'Download' program you will see a tab for 'Applications' click on it and you will find the 'Windows Live I.M' click on it and download it.<br />
<br />
4 - After the download has finished look at the bottom right hand corner of the 'Download' application, you will see a status bar showing you how much has been downloaded or if it shows the bar is full it means its fully downloaded, if this is the case then
 you will notice that it is automatically installing the 'windows Live I.M' into your phone however you have to cancell it by pressing the 'X' button located beside the status bar as mentioned before.<br />
<br />
5 - Once you cancel the installation you can either leave you phone connected to your PC or disconnected but the next step is on your PC find and select your user folder on C: drive then go to 'Appata/Roaming/Nokia/Nokia Download!' then you will see two files
 in .sisx one is called 'Nokia Internet Service Support Pack 1' (This file is to be installed into you phone before Windows Live I.M to support messenger) and the second file is 'Windows Live I.M' which should be installed in to your phone after the 'Nokia
 Internet Service Support pack l') you can install both files in the order explained into your phone buy connecting your N96 to your PC and double click on the files one at a time then run the installation or transfer both files directly into your phone and
 install it that way.<br />
<br />
I have actually tried this myself but I had no luck in being able to install either of the files because I keep getting an error messages but if anyone else wants to give it a try then do so, if you have any luck with your N96 then post us the outcome here
 please.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is the N96 is not recognising the 'Signed Certificate' which is encrypted into the 'Nokia Internet Support Pack 1' file hence why I or anyone else will have trouble installing it. Remember without the 'Nokia Internet Support Pack
 1', Windowes Live I.M will not install into your phone.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long essay guys but that was the process from my experience and I hope Nokia and Windows Live do something about this to make the software available for the N96 soon.<br />
<br />
Bless to all.<br />
<br />
SiD

            IT WORKS...<br />
<br />
just so you all know.. you need to update your firmware to latest version 11.018..<br />
<br />
However Windows live is working you don't need to install the dev.sisx as it's already built in..<br />
<br />
I have one minor gripe... you have to pay £1.50 a month for using windows live!! grrrrrr microsoft RIP OFFS!!!!<br />
<br />
Anyway just thought I'd let everyone know that it works cos as soon as I got this phone this has been one of the main things I've been waiting on to work..<br />
<br />
Enjoy

            On purchase of my N96 I did have quite a few probs with Messenger. Firstly the built in app didnt work, so I then scoured the net for a new version.<br />
<br />
After a while I came accross windows live messenger and as stated in an earlier post microsoft wanted £1.50 a month to use it.<br />
<br />
So I then used an app called ebuddy, which is for use with all the netowrking chat sites from ICQ to Facebook.<br />
It works okay, but sometimes is a bit slow and undelivered messages became annoying.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I did manage to find a version of messenger which when installing did not request the £1.50 shenanigans.<br />
I would just try searching around, it took a while but eventually I found messenger that would run!

            you can force a sync by going settings&gt;system&gt;email+accounts then hold on Microsoft account and touch the pop up Sync

    <title>Disabling backlight when receiving SMS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disabling backlight when receiving SMS</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until recently, I've been able to leave my PPC5 running MDA Compact II so that the backlight doesn't illuminate when I receive SMS messages.&nbsp;
Now when the phone is set to silent the backlight comes on whenever I receive SMS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the notifications section of&nbsp;sounds and notifications, I've set the 'New text message' event to play sound only, with the other 3 boxes (display message on screen, flash light for... and vibrate) unchecked.&nbsp; I'm sure this is how it was before,
 but now everytime I receive an SMS it lights up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how I disable this function again, please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hello maxwurr, try this download xplore from this site <a href="http://lonelycatgames.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://lonelycatgames.com</a> install it then open it then go to the menu in it then tools then messaging. There you will see the image then try to delete it if the delete option is not there then move the image then delete it. Or try this save the image file
 by using the save option in messaging then try to delete it from gallery. Try and reply.

<p>Hi Philippe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Internet Explorer, there is a setting wherein you can configure what shows when you restart your computer or the app itself. You can configure it to start up with your home page by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>With your keyboard, press <strong>Windows + R.</strong></li><li>Type "inetcpl.cpl" then press <strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>In <strong>General </strong>tab, under the <strong>Startup </strong>section, select
<strong>Start with Homepag</strong><strong>e.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Thanks Katrina for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is: Why does Windows reopens automatically Internet Explorer after reboot if it was not closed before the reboot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this is a new behavior after the installation of 1709.&nbsp; Can this behavior be disabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Before you do anything else, try restarting by closing down and let it restart as normal then go to windows update and see whether it tells you the latest update was successful. Sometimes you have to do this two or three times then hopefully it should resolve
 itself ( it worked for me).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also look online for windowsgeeks.com you might get help there. All the best. Rab</p>

<h2>            Transferring music from PC to a Nokia 6600 fold</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys. So I bought my Nokia 6600 fold last year. I used to transfer music from my PC to the phone all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, however, I had to delete everything from my memory card (where everything was auto saved) including the music. I am now going from the phone's memory and want to get my music back on there. I tried to transfer the music across, &nbsp;but without the
 installation CD (which I've lost) I can't do anything. Is there anything I can do, or an update I can download somewhere?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime I connect the phone to the PC using the cable, I'm only able to transfer photos across. I'm not able to literally "drag and drop" songs across because there is no icon for the mobile phone, in My Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Add &#39;Pages&#39; to Word - similar to &#39;Sheets&#39; in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I maybe out there, but thought I would like to see a 'Page' option for Word. I LOVE excel and have multiple sheets to each workbook&nbsp;all the time.&nbsp;My thought is, I have several Word documents that are similar but I don't want them in one big continuous Word
 document. If I could just have one document with various 'Pages'&nbsp;or 'Document'&nbsp;tabs (sheets) that I can easily select&nbsp;regardless of how far down I&nbsp;am in one&nbsp;document&nbsp;. I know that I can add cross references or a table of contents (and you may have other options)
 to a big, combined document but I pictured the ability to quickly tab to the next item/document and work on it.&nbsp;This way I would only have one&nbsp;Word item to find/search for/open but&nbsp;have my multiple&nbsp;'Pages' (for lack of better terminology). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;still in Office 2010. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So I found the 1st screenshot on google images more to show what the file printout button looked like, but OneNote online definitely had a File Printout feature because I've been using it for the past year and a half and it was fine up until today when I
 went to insert some files as printouts and the button was gone.</p>
<p>

<p>I must correct myself. It existed in the past. And some minutes ago while I was looking again into OneNote Online it reappeared, for Word or PDF files.</p>

<h2>            New Outlook opens too many new tabs -- any way to control this</h2>
                    <p>I recently switched to the "New Outlook" (January, 2019) on the web and every time I click on the email button or calendar button, instead of switching between the two, Outlook opens a new tab for that function. So, before long I have 6 or 7 tabs open for
 Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable this so it just switches between the various functions within the one single Outlook tab I have open?</p>

            Dear CFA24,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />When you are accessing another part of the service (OneDrive, People, Calendar etc) it opens it in a new tab. Unfortunately, there is no setting to disable it. 
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with this, all I can suggest is to submit your feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a>

it tell me no action requiered, as service or pilote is not compatible yet, but not much information about which one, i'm ok to remove some pilotes depending on what they are.<br />

<h2>            Remove bitcoin emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am sure this has been asked before; but what is MS doing about the continuious emails received by these "BitCoin" virus type emails????</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bdf4608-5703-4d6e-9a00-6baa14495f7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bdf4608-5703-4d6e-9a00-6baa14495f7c" /></a>No
 matter how many times I use the phishing tool they continue.&nbsp; When i try and "Block Sender) within the JUnk options it states "Domain or Email Address" is not valid....</p>
<p>Surely MS is smarter than this!!!</p>
<p>

            Yep, I'm in the same boat, currently having to clear about 40 bitcoin and gambling-type spam every day.&nbsp; It's getting really tedious now - I wish these people could get caught and jailed.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure MS could do something about it, but of course they
 just won't.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sure, the spam goes to the spam folder, but I still have to check the spam folder for missed emails, and I'm really tired of trawling through a ton of trash.&nbsp; This huge amount of bitcoin spam is relatively recent, it's been snowballing over the past 8 months
 or so.

<p>Hi - Can anyone help me with how/where I can find the Ringtone of:</p>
<p>Land Down Under</p>
<p>by Men At Work</p>
<p>I'm worried about some sites offering it that will keep charging after I download this to my phone - I only want this particular song.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Normally there is no subscription&nbsp; for Ringtones.. Once you download and install in the phone there should not be recurring cost..</p>
<p>Its for the Callertunes that some operators offer.. there is recurring charge..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So.. search and download from any site...</p>

    <title>Change Notification Recipient For Password Reset Request - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnkanyiha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Notification Recipient For Password Reset Request</h2>
                    
<p>Our Office 365 is not enabled to allow users to do&nbsp;self-service password reset. This means users use the password request process which generates a notification email to the admin. I would like to know which role manages the admin to receive this email.
 We are transitioning roles, and even though i have been assigned the Global Admin role, i am not receiving these notifications. The current Admin has custom admin role and continues to receive the notification instead of them coming to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> In Office 365, only Password admins, User management admins and Global admins can receive the password reset request notification emails.<br />
<br />
If we have all the three types of admins above in your organization, then only the Password admins will receive the notification emails.<br />
<br />
If we only have User management admins and Global admins, then only the User management admins will receive the notification emails.<br />
<br />
If we only have Global admins, then the Global admins will receive the notification emails.</p>
<p>So as a conclusion, the priority of receiving the password reset request notification emails is:
<br />
<strong>Password admins &gt; User management admins &gt; Global admins</strong> .<br />
That's the reason why you as a global admin didn't receive those notification emails.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> If we already have Password admins, and we want to make sure&nbsp;other
<strong>customized administrators</strong> can receive the notification emails, we need to ensure&nbsp;they&nbsp;are also assigned the
<strong>Password admin</strong> role.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
James</p>

    <title>Powerpoint draw shape issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callumgamer123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint draw shape issue</h2>
                    <p>I am running Powerpoint 16.16.6 on my MacBook Pro (2013).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to draw a freeform in powerpoint (i.e., a curved line or freeform shape) I simply get a diagonal line automatically in the center of the slide. It does not give me the option to custom draw my curved line by clicking successively on the screen
 as you normally would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted and re-installed Powerpoint/Office 365 multiple times to no avail. This problem just seems to have come on suddenly and there is little in the way of an online 'fix' to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Conditional Formatting Doesn&#39;t Stick</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I recently setup Outlook 2010 for a client of mine so they could have one calendar that they all share. &nbsp;I accomplished this by setting up a Windows Live Calendar and using Outlook Connector. &nbsp;It works great. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>My only concern is conditional formatting. &nbsp;They want to be able to color specific events certain colors and we found that conditional formatting accomplishes this task very well. &nbsp;However, at least once a day the conditional formatting rules we setup clear
 themselves and we have to re-input them. &nbsp;I don't think it's an issue with Outlook Connector as I experienced this in the calendar even before I installed Outlook Connector. &nbsp;This happens on both Windows XP Pro and Windows 7 Pro machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to why the view settings (Conditional Formatting) go away, but it's going to be very frustrating for my client if they have to re-input those settings everyday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also test the OneNote Clipper from our side and find that new name of notebook won't update in it, we test in Chrome and other different browsers as well but get the same result.

<p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusion. The feedback tool within OneNote clipper is another option to send feedback to the developers. I'm sorry for not pointing it out. You may share your feedback by using both of the 2 methods and to let OneNote developers know about
 this. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Continuous break with columns still jumps to next page</h2>
                    <p>I am using continuous section breaks to start a new section with columns. &nbsp;However, often it jumps to the next page nonetheless. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like it is doing this to create a minimum amount of column on the first page.&nbsp;For example, a new page will start if I have less than half a page space left where I start the columns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to force the column section to stay on the starting page? &nbsp;I have tried keep lines together in paragraph format but no luck. I have even tried page break before on the first paragraph of the new columns, but that still does not work!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi OzFrog,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you cannot sync podcasts from your computer to your phone using Windows Phone App for Desktop. What is the make and model of your phone, please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please check your USB connection? Is the USB cable the one included with the phone? Also, please try different USB ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your phone have an SD card? If so, try removing the SD card and then syncing again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try removing and reinstalling the Windows Phone App for Desktop. You can download it here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
