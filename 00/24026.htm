<h2>            New Android Phone - Now No Outlook Contacts</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my phone to a new Android. &nbsp;I am using the Outlook Mobile App for Android, but the new phone doesn't recognize any of the contacts that it did in the old phone. &nbsp;I import business stuff from my Gmail, and personal stuff from my Hotmail,
 so switching one OR the other isn't feasible, I need them both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the Outlook contacts list imported to the new Android phone?</p>

            Just connecting your Android device to your Outlook.com account using the Accounts&gt;Add account path in Settings should do the job. It does for me.

            <p>Contact syncing trouble with the official Microsoft Outlook app is a recognized problem from Microsoft as the default Android mail app set up with a "corporate account" or a 3rd party mail app such as Nine appear to have no trouble adding or editing
 contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will caution you that Android contact managers (including the stock Android) contact manager do funny things with contacts if one has the same outlook.com account connected in multiple apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it has been my experience that you have to choose your mail app carefully to use with Outlook.com -- as you can only choose one if you want the contacts to display and sync properly. &nbsp;And for me the official Outlook app is a no go, as it won't
 sync contacts properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you use either the default email App or Nine. &nbsp;I have tried both, but I am using the default app because for my purposes it isn't worth paying the $9.95 for Nine. &nbsp;Nine is probably the best outlook app for Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft acknowledges that they have problems with contacts and their official Android App. &nbsp;I am sure they will probably fix it -- eventually. &nbsp;Shame on Microsoft though put putting out such garbage when other apps work properly.</p>

            I see what you mean Pbike. &nbsp;Whether the app can find the contacts seems to be unreliable. &nbsp;Sometimes it will access them, sometimes it will not. &nbsp;This does
<strong>seriously</strong> limit its utility.&nbsp;

    <title>Where does Word 2010 store different settings and customizations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where does Word 2010 store different settings and customizations</h2>
                    Does anyone know where I can find a comprehensive list of where Word stores different customizations and settings?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Several settings that stick on my home computer, such as ribbon customizations of which tabs to display, view ruler and Table View Gridlines reset to factory default.&nbsp; Style sets disappear, and AutoText disappears, QAT buttons I've added disappear, etc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I know some things are in templates, some are registry, I've heard of policy level settings...&nbsp; I've found lists for older versions of Word but nothing for Word 2010.&nbsp; These resets happen each time I either close Word or log off (varies by setting).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'd like to know where the different settings come from so I can help our IT department figure out what's wiping them out on a setting by setting basis.&nbsp; People are really frustrated with the resets.&nbsp; Thanks so much!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Office and providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, the custom settings are not retaining when Word is closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I have a quick question:</p>
<p>Is the computer connected to a network or domain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, you may also post your question in Word IT pro forum for better suggestions:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/word/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/word/threads</font></a></p>

<h2>            SmartLinks - cannot link to a SharePoint site&#47;subsite</h2>
                    
<p>I've been researching this for several days and have hit a roadblock.&nbsp; We have an ADFS 2.0 infrastructure, and we're an O365 customer with an E3 license.&nbsp; I'm attempting to create a SmartLink URL to a SharePoint Online site that is under my "root" tenant
 site collection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>- My root site collection URL (masked to hide company name):&nbsp; <a href="https://companyname.sharepoint.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://companyname.sharepoint.com/</a></p>
<p>- Site I'm attempting to create a Smartlink to:&nbsp; <a href="https://companyname.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/Pages/home_new.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://companyname.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet/Pages/home_new.aspx</a></p>
<p>If I create a SmartLink using the instructions in the link below, the link works to access the root&nbsp;site collection&nbsp;URL.</p>
<p>- 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/sso/358-using-smart-links-or-idp-initiated-authentication-with-office-365</p>
<p>I've attempted to use instructions found on the following pages to point that SmartLink to the<span> /sites/intranet/Pages/home_new.aspx</span>.&nbsp; None of these have worked</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>As your test result, you can see the URL has been encrypted, so we not able to use this feature. And as far as I know, the smart link feature has been removed in the latest version of Office 365 ADFS.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>So...what you're telling me is that I'm lucky the Smart Link that points to the root site collection works at all?</p>
<p>I had read that MS wasn't supporting SmartLinks in ADFS 3.0, but I had hope since we're still using ADFS 2.0. &nbsp;We will likely change to Okta or OneLogin for federation in the near future, but I'd love this functionality now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyone who has successfully built SmartLink for this scenario with the starting point of the encrypted URL?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook Cannot Sign or Encrypt this message because you have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wraithtdk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Cannot Sign or Encrypt this message because you have no certificates which can be used to send from your e-mail address.</h2>
                    <p>I use Comodo email certificates to sign all of my emails. I have four addresses, each with their own certificates, and I have never had any problems. In fact, I've sent four emails
<strong>today</strong>, all signed, without issue. But all of a sudden, I just tried sending an email and I recieved the following error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Microsoft Outlook Cannot Sign or Encrypt this message because you have no certificates which can be used to send from your e-mail address.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't change anything, and none of my certificates appear to be expired. It just suddenly stopped working. I'm stumped! Help me out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Never did figure out the cause of this; but unfortunately I have limited time, so I&nbsp;just created a new profile, and that seems to have done the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only&nbsp;clue I can offer to those who, inevitably, will stumble upon this thread (greetings, future people, do we have flying cars in your time?) looking for answers to the same problem, is that in my new profile, under the e-mail security panel, "Publish
 to GAL..." is there on the left of "import/Export" and "Get a Digital ID;" while it is NOT available in the broken profile. Whether this is related or not, I may never know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all that tried to help.!</p>

We are all trying to tell you that we are not changing the attendees, the location, or the time of the meeting. We are changing the notes. the Save changes without sending updates feature has been available in Outlook for YEARS. It was, therefore, a normal

<p>I tried to reproduce the issue you encountered on my side but failed. I wonder if you are using an older version of Outlook. You can try to check if your Office clients including Outlook need to be updated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open one Office application client, such as Outlook.</p>
<p>2. Go to&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Office Account</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under Product Information, choose&nbsp;<strong>Update Options</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Enable Updates</strong>. Or if updates are already enabled, click&nbsp;<strong>Update Now</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue might be related&nbsp;the add-ins, I suggest that start Outlook in safe mode following below mentioned steps and verify the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Hold Windows key + R.</p>
<p>* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</p>
<p>Outlook /safe </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: There is space between Outlook and /</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Outlook works in safe mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.</p>
<p>b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. </p>
<p>c) Close the Office program and restart it. </p>
<p>d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

            I am using Outlook 2016. None of the workarounds work. In fact, once of the people answering questions told me that this feature has been removed. We would like it back, please.

<p>Hi Malora,<br />
</p>
<p>I did further investigation and consulted the related team. According to my test, in the latest version of Outlook, the option "save but not send update" will show up when we modify the note in the meeting. If we modify the notes in the meeting again, the
 option won’t occur. &nbsp;As far as I know, this is a feature change during the Outlook update. &nbsp;And the option "save but not send update" would not be suggested to be used in Outlook in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, I do suggest you submit feedback in <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook for Windows UserVoice</a> where there is a dedicated team monitor the request of the users. They may bring back this feature based on the user impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

<p>Will there be a new Nokia Booklet? Maybe with 4G and the new AMD Zacate? Because the current one is so slow, zacate would be perfect for it. I would love to see that.</p>

            Nokia has not announced anything so all you can do is wait and hope.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't make another booklet now that the market is shifting towards tablet PC's.

<p>Fair enough, just don't hold your breath waiting for one!<br />
<br />
With the original not selling very well and the netbook and laptop market predicted to drop rapidly this year the chances of a new booklet are looking very slim.<br />
<br />
Your best bet for news and rumours is to read various nokia fan blogs etc as they will have the information before it appears on this site. We aren't allowed to discuss new rumoured products here until Nokia has actually announced them.</p>

<p>I predict the new AMD Fusion platform will give the netbook market a boost this year and the next because there will now be competition between AMD and Intel on the netbook market, there was only intel before, this gives the consumers better<strong>
</strong>performance for a lower price. And devices that can run HD stuff is always attractive, and one reason why people dont want Nokia Booklet is because it cant play HD very well. Amd Zacate can run HD and some games with no problem and it is both cheap
 and cold and doesnt use much power. I think it would be foolish for Nokia to not release a new one. Well this is why i want to see a New booklet incase anyone is wondering. I dont want to upset anyone and I dont want to make this topic a debate :smileyvery-happy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i guess you're right that i can only hope for a new one!</p>

<h2>            WIndows 10 Upgrade issues - my solution</h2>
                    <p><span>I’ve had a problem upgrading every build of Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It would always crash or encounter a problem during the install and rollback to the previous version.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In one upgrade it would get to 88% then encounter an error and rollback.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the upgrade from 9926 to 10041 it would get to “PC Settings” phase (30%, 0%), and then bluescreen followed by a rollback.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In both my cases the root problem was caused by the fact that the strange 350Mb RAW partition at the start of the disk had somehow been assigned a drive letter.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once I removed the drive letter using Disk Management, the upgrade finished successfully.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In the latest instance, I installed 9926 to an unpartitioned SSD (240Gb, Corsair Force 3 SSD) where the installer created 3 partitions of 350Mb, 222.79Gb and 450Mb.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Immediately trying to update to 10041 failed with a crash in ks.sys, rollback and error 0xc1900101-0x30018 displayed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Removing the bogus drive letter and <span>&nbsp;</span>retrying the update led to a successful update to 10041.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I haven’t seen this solution anywhere so I’m throwing it out there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Hopefully it will be of use to someone.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hi KevinFoster3,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have full space on your mac machine and still have this issue, first please check if this issue is related to the Disk utility permissions, please follow the steps below and
<span>&nbsp;</span>try to repair it then check if it can make any difference:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1.Open Disk Utility, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.Select the startup disk from the list of volumes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3.Click the First Aid tab.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.To check permissions, click Verify Disk Permissions. To repair permissions, click Repair Disk Permissions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, you can also try to temporarily disable the “ Time Machine “ on your mac, and then try to import the identity file to outlook for mac 2016 again, then see if the issue disappears.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If all the suggestions above don’t work, it is recommended that please contact our dedicated support channel for outlook for mac via clicking
<strong>Help &gt; Contact Support</strong> in the outlook for mac menu. The dedicated engineers there are focusing on outlook for mac related issues and they would give you some further assistance.</span></p>

                    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop and Groove Music Player is not showing Artist images in it</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10 build 1709 and lastest version of Groove music (Version which came with the option of setting artist image as desktop background)</p>
<p>All of the album arts are being displayed properly and also my Artist info is not incorrect</p>
<p>Artist images are being shown on other apps such as VLC media player</p>

<p>I reset Groove and unselected the option to automatically update artist/cover data. Now I have at least about half the artists with images.<br />
</p>
<p>If I enable the above option, then Groove takes up to 80% CPU power and deletes all artist images (EXCEPT those I once downloaded from MS Store, they have their image no matter what).</p>

                    I format a cell in excel to display as *Wednesday, March 14, 2001" so that when 3/14/10 is entered it displays as formatted. When I mail merge the cell into Word 2007 it displays as a number ie. 40445 instead of Friday, September 24, 2010.<br />
How do I get Word to merge the day,month,date,year as formatted?

            <p>Either connect to the data source using DDE (Check Word Office Button-&gt;Word Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;General-&gt;Confirm File Format Conversion on open, go through the data source selection process again, then when "Confirm Data Source" shows, check "Show All" if
 you only see "OLE DB Database Files". Then find and select the DDE option.</p>
<p>But DDE is not recommended, requires Excel on your system, and can only reach the first worksheet in the book.</p>
<p>In this case, the fact that you are seeing an "Excel day number" rather than a date in Word suggests that you may have mixed data types in your date column in Excel (that is at least one possibility - see http:\\tips.pjmsn.me.uk/t0003.htm for further info)
 in which case you should try to ensure that all the rows have dates in them. When they do, the following has a chance of working...</p>
<p>Don't bother with that DDE stuff. Connect as normal. Make sure your dates are coming through as dates (although they will probably be in US date format. Then re-impose the date format you want by using format switch in Word - in this case, use Alt-F9 to
 display the field codes so you see something like this:</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD mydate }</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD mydate \*Mergeformat }</p>
<p>change it to&nbsp;</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD mydate \@"DDDD, MMMM D, YYYY" }</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD mydate \@"DDDD, MMMM DD, YYYY" }</p>
<p>then Alt-F9 again and try previewing the data.</p>

    <title>Can there be some tighter restrictions on Advertisements&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1337 64m3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can there be some tighter restrictions on Advertisements&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As far back as June of this year, on three separate Windows 10 PCs (two older, one brand new) I have been experiencing some odd behavior and I have narrowed it down to Skype trying to load advertisements using HTTP or HTTPS connections. I would get security
 alerts when skype starts up or when it tries cycling through ads saying that one or more of the security certificates of the chain of websites its browsing is not valid. This is concerning that through the chain of sites or domains its hopping through to grab
 certain advertisements there are some domains (usually the second to last or third to last in the chain) that does not have valid security certificates (outdated, unverified, or mismatching). The last thing I want is the advertisements in skype to be a portal
 for malicious advertisements or other security risks getting onto my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am for now temporarily blocking Skype ads out of concern of the safety of my computer. Unless if I can get some genuine assurances confirmed by third parties that this security issue is being addressed I will continue blocking the ads. I know Microsoft
 as a company needs to make money but I would have thought that the departments involved in Skype Advertising would be more selective of their ad providers and periodically do screenings for things like this. Because something like this could be exploited for
 someone to use your product maliciously to spread unwanted programs or infections and it would make the company look bad if this wasn't addressed before it becomes a serious problem after being made aware of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot list off hand which ads specifically trigger these alerts of invalid certificates because I do not allow the web traffic to go through from the alert prompt. But I do know that in my experiences I have seen some advertisements promoting what appeared
 to be like less-than-legitimate products or services.</p>

Occasionally, you may see advertisements for other companies in Skype (if you're using the free version of Skype). Advertisements help keep Skype free for millions of users, and these advertisements will not disrupt your Skype experience in any way.

                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got issues with my camera on my Lumia 640 Dual Sim for 2 weeks now. The problem is that it shows only a blurry image. If looking into the camera on the back of the phone, there seems to be an orange/brown slimy substance under the glass. I've already
 contacted the Microsoft customer support but I haven't received any answer yet which quite annoys me. I still have a warranty on the phone of 1 year as the phone was bought last year in June or July. What shall I do? Thanks for your answers in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Žan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and

Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset try to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:
<strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before
 performing a hard reset.&nbsp;<strong> <br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows 10 </strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; Update and security &gt; Backup &gt;More options &gt; Back up now.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Go to Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;
<strong>Backup &gt; Apps + settings &gt; </strong><strong>Back up now.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If performing a soft reset and hard reset didn't work, we suggest that you use the<strong> Windows Recovery Tool</strong>. Please see the following steps below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by downloading and installing&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool</a> (for Windows 10, 8.x and 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9101dcb-61b7-4791-b8aa-d2b1044eae75" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure to restore your phone using&nbsp;Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect&nbsp;the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).</li><li>After a few seconds the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.</li><li>After a few seconds more the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the '<strong>Install software</strong>'/'<strong>Reinstall software</strong>'&nbsp;button to flash your phone</li></ol>
Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Note!</span> Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you installed a 3rd party antivirus (such as Norton, McAfee, Avast, AVG, or others)?<br />
If so that will disable Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
Also you could have malware :<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do&nbsp;a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect
 as&nbsp;the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with
 these to an extreme overkill point.<br />
<br />
How do I find and remove a virus?<br />

<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN&nbsp;it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not
 does not mean you should not check with the other methods below.<br />

When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />

Then restart the computer.<br />

Hope this helps. <br />

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
If you want to remove your Live ID and replace it with a new one, you have to hard reset the device and enter the new Live ID details in the Emails and Accounts section in Settings. Remember that you will lose all data on the device and all apps that you have
 bought with your old Live ID have to be bought again as they are tied to your Live ID.

<h2>            Unable to Install W10 via a DVD</h2>
                    <p>I was unable to install W10 9841, x64 from a burned DVD. I downloaded the ISO and burned it a second time, just in case the first one was bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I booted the system and pressed the Enter key to boot from the DVD. It started and nothing else happened. The access light for the drive, on the front of the system, never went off. After about 10 minutes the entire screen turned orange, with thin beige
 pinstripes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That system is an x64 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that system I then installed W7 via the same method and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>For me this problem was solved by changing the boot sequence so the DVD was not booted as a UEFI DVD device. Instead i did go into bios and put the actual dvdreader as first bootdevice.</p>

            Try disabling Secure Boot as well when moving your Dvd drive first in boot order. That should do the trick.

    <title>Insert page number of a Word bookmark in an Excel file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Insert page number of a Word bookmark in an Excel file</h2>
                    
<p>Hey gang,</p>
<p>Here's one that's got us scratching our heads.&nbsp; We have a certain phrase in a Word document which needs its page number referenced in an Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; We need this cross-referenced in case the Word file is edited and the page number changes.&nbsp; Here's
 our thought process so far:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Insert a bookmark where the target phrase appears in the Word document.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Copy and paste the bookmark in the Excel document as a hyperlink.&nbsp; This will appear in the Excel file as the bookmark text.</p>
<p>3. Instead of the bookmark text (e.g., "Chapter 5") appearing in the cell, we need to automatically show its page number (e.g., 3-41).&nbsp; The page number may change as the document is edited, and there are dozens of these references, so it would be impractical
 to change the page number by hand.</p>
<p>4. Profit!</p>
<p>Clearly, step 3 is where we're hung up.&nbsp; We can't link directly to the page number field because it might change if the file is edited.&nbsp; Or am I reading this wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>I guess I have the bookmark and the cross reference to it on the same page.</p>
<p>What you are probably going to have to do is to access the Word file and use the .Information(wdActiveEndPageNumber) attribute of the .Range of the bookmark to get the number and set the .Value of the Cell in Excel to the value that it returns.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing this issue installing multiple programs, I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I suggest you to check whether the&nbsp;Windows Installer service is started.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key R key</strong>, type <strong>Services.msc </strong>and press ENTER.&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;Double-click <strong>Windows Installer </strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Set the <strong>Startup </strong>type of Windows Installer to <strong>Manual </strong>
<br />
4.&nbsp;Click <strong>Start </strong>to start the service. Note down the error message if any.
<br />
5.&nbsp;Click <strong>OK</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I suggest you to try the next step and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer to do that follow the steps provided below.</strong><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Windows key + R key</strong>, type <strong>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER</strong>, and then click OK. Even if you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs. <br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press <strong>Windows key + R key</strong>, type MSIEXEC /REGSERVER, and then click OK. Even if you&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you run this command, the operation is complete. <br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try your Windows Installer-based application again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I am a OneDrive Advisor to help you.!
<br />
<br />What is exactly your problem.? 
<br />
<br />I would suggest to upgrade your onedrive with a clean installation following the steps below:
<br />
<br />Before start I would recommend to create a local back up, just copy the onedrive folder and paste it in a safe place with a different name.
<br />
<br />Unlink OneDrive by click OneDrive icon, choose Preferences, then About, click Unlink.
<br />
<br />Remove the app by following these steps:
<br />Open the Applications folder.
<br />Drag the blue OneDrive cloud to the trash.
<br />Remove the additional OneDrive files (excluding the back up fosler).
<br />Press Apple (COMMAND) + SHIFT+ G in finder, or use Terminal.
<br />Go to /Users/&lt;name&gt;/Library/Containers
<br />Find the 2 folders
<br />com.microsoft.skydrive-mac
<br />com.microsoft.SkyDriveLauncher
<br />Drag them to the trash.
<br />Remove the locally stored OneDrive folder.
<br />If you installed with the default settings, there will be the OneDrive folder under your name.
<br />Drag it to the trash.
<br />Now, you can re-install OneDrive from <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/New-OneDrive-sync-client-release-notes-845dcf18-f921-435e-bf28-4e24b95e5fc0#mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/New-On...</a>

<p>Thank you Liliana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is not be able to sign in to OneDrive after fresh installation.</p>
<p>On setup screen, it asks to sign into OneDrive with my email address. After typing it in, hit sign in button, then it comes back to say "we don't recognize that email address".</p>
<p>I have followed your instruction above to start clean installation but I could not find 2 folders for skydive.</p>
<p>Am I following your instruction correctly?</p>

            I just installed OneDrive and signed in with my existing account, which is different from the one I started using for work.&nbsp; It recognized my personal email address. I still don't understand why the other address is not recognized...

Hi Yoshi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am glad to hear that you can signed into OneDrive with your personal account.</p>
<p>
I would like to explain that OneDrive app is used to sync OneDrive or SharePoint, you can get more information about this:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-files-with-the-onedrive-sync-client-on-mac-os-x-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync files with the OneDrive sync client on Mac OS X</a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As you are using gmail address and meet the issue, I need to confirm if you have sign up the gmail address as a Microsoft account.</p>
<p><span>If not, we can</span><span>’</span><span>t sign into OneDrive.</span></p>
<p>
I suggest you sign up the gmail address as Microsoft account via the following link:</p>

</span></a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
If this is not your situation, I want to confirm if you can access to OneDrive web with the affected gmail account:</p>

<h2>            Bing Ads Editor Will Not Post Changes</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest Editor (11.23) installed with my account loaded. When trying to post any type of change, whether just one or multiple changes, Editor hangs on the "summary of changes" window and goes no further. I've uninstalled
 and re-installed Editor several times, and the same issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a PC with Windows 10 Pro. Anybody else experiencing the same issue? Any suggestions to make this work?</p>
