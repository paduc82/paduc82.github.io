<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Can&#39;t send to new addresses</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded to Outlook 2010 today. I can send and receive most emails fine. When I type in a new email address that I've never sent to, (and some that I have sent to before), it gives me an error "The operation failed."&nbsp; It doesn't even appear to try to send
 the email, it just sits there with my email opened and this really descriptive error over the top of it. ughh And it definitely does not go into my Sent folder.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the email to be sent to the email address that I enter without it deciding for me who I can send it to and who I can't?</p>
<p>Really frustrated....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best way to do it is to designate your old file as the file Outlook should use as you create the new profile. Outlook 2010 provides that option. If you ever have to create a new profile again, be sure to use that option.</p>
<p>Since your profile is already created, you now have a new, empty PST file. To use your old one, open it in Outlook (File &gt; Open &gt; Outlook data file...) You can then set it as your default in File &gt; Acount Settings... &gt; Data file. Restart Outlook, then R
 click and close the empty PST file the new profile created. You may have to enable the Contacts Folder as an email address book so the address book service will work, and you'll need to reset any rules to the new location by stepping through them.</p>

<h2>            Issues with Skype and webcam</h2>
                    <p>Greetings~</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having a rather 'annoying' problem for a while, I believe it happened with one of the updates to skype PROGRAM... NOT&nbsp; the Windows 10 App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem #1</span>: Upon finishing a Video chat with ANY of my contacts, either singly or in a group capacity,&nbsp; &nbsp;and logging off&nbsp; of Skype AND closing the program completely (Right click on System tray icon and choosing
 Quit) my Web cam light stays illuminated, and will remain illuminated until the&nbsp; procedure/workaround mentioned below is done OR I power down or restart my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Workaround that I have done</span>: The ONLY way that i have found to alleviate this issue (apart from powering down or restarting my computer, which is rather inconvenient especially if i have to do it after EACH
 video chat) is the following procedure:&nbsp;</p>
<p>( ---&gt; =&nbsp; mouse click in below procedure)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Usually done while still logged in but sometimes I forget to do it and have to log back into Skype again to complete this procedure)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>---&gt; Tools at top of Contacts window ---&gt; Options---&gt;Video Settings ---&gt; Save ... Webcam light goes out and stays out till next video call and then the procedure has to be followed again&nbsp; upon completion of each and every video call .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it has been recommended to use the App rather than the Program itself.. I have TRIED to use the App .. while it&nbsp; HAS alleviated webcam issue the issue .. I dont personally care for the interface or lack of functionality that the program itself has
 .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: windows 10 64-bit (Desktop computer) Fully up to date.</p>
<p>Skype Version: 7.40.0.151</p>
<p>Webcam : Logitech HD 720 HD C270 (with fully updated software from Logitech)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any other information is needed feel free to ask and I will supply info as needed.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Set your default audio communication device in Windows 10 to something else.&nbsp; You can leave your settings in the desktop application alone. See if the problem disappears.

<p>Techfreak~</p>
<p>&nbsp;How would changing the audio communications device&nbsp; be relevant to the webcam ??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for reference my default audio communication device is my Logitech G933 Gaming headset for microphone and sound ONLY when in Skype. Which has always been the way it is set no matter what headset I have had.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEVER have had my webcam set to be the default communications device at any time. Unless, this is what you are meaning for me to do ??? IF that is the case then it would be entirely pointless for me to have a headset with a microphone ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in normal programs(not using skype) the Sound device is my Sound card with external speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you however for your advice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any time I have seen lights stay on for webcams it is due to the mic/audio half of the webcam still being accessed. This could be a third party program accessing the mic&nbsp; or an issue with the install or the hub in use. Having other devices set as the default
 or default communication device, sometimes resolve the issue. Other times you may have to remove all traces of the webcam install and drivers and try a reinstall. To see if it is tied to the audio portion simply disable your camera under recording devices
 and see if the light goes off immediately. This disables only the audio portion of the camera.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not own a c270. I own a c310 and c920 and tested them out with that latest driver package. The light does not remain on after a video call regardless of Windows settings. You may want to try out your camera on another computer to see what happens.<br />

<p>Techfreak~</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well... the Microphone on the webcam IS NOT selected as any device whatsoever.. matter of fact it is "disabled" in recording devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the latest driver package.. I uninstalled the software and driver data COMPLETELY and reinstalled it after downloading the package from Logitech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have a video chat today with a friend of mine and the same thing happened with the webcam at the termination of the video chat .. and I had to do the same 'workaround'&nbsp; to get the light to go off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as testing on another computer .. not possible. Don't have access to a second computer .. at least not easily.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry... but as I mentioned in my initial post... </p>
<p>
</p><p>This did NOT happen&nbsp; until a SKYPE SPECIFIC&nbsp; update ....&nbsp; this was not happening with any updates with Avast or any other program ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I had mentioned in my previous reply...&nbsp; with regard to Avast.... the webcam shield is NOT&nbsp; available in the edition of Avast that I have .. so why would it put any reference in the 'driver stack' for the webcam ???&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only that but... if it WAS&nbsp; .. would it not cause my webcam to not work at all ??? At least that is what I have been reading about the webcam shield.. is that it would&nbsp; cause the webcam to NOT work at all and would be blocked completely. Which is why
 IF the Webcam shield can be configured they recommend turning the shield off within the Avast program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My webcam works fine, other that the fact the light of the webcam stays on at the completion of the video chat.. and then I have to go through the workaround i mentioned in my very first post to get it to shut off.</p>

<h2>            Delegates and meeting requests</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a user that is using Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.&nbsp; He has delegates set up and on some meeting requests he is getting the message:&nbsp; "This meeting is not in the Calendar; it may have been moved or deleted".&nbsp; This is only happening on some meeting
 requests.</p>
<p>He says the following:&nbsp; "If a delegate of mine sent a meeting request on behalf of my boss (who she has the calendar access for), it's going through okay, but other meeting request are showing as "this item has been moved or deleted".</p>
<p>We have tried the following:&nbsp; Tools &gt;&gt; Options &gt;&gt; Delegates.&nbsp; Changing the setting to My Delegates and Me from the first option.&nbsp; It worked for a bit then he started to have issues again.&nbsp; Tried a new MAPI profile.&nbsp; His previous MAPI profile used cached
 exchange mode, in the new profile I created I turned off CEM and still the issue is not resolved.</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>2. Alert message from hotmail that someone try to login my account.</p>
<p>3. hotmail locked my account and need more info to recover.</p>
<p>4. I can't remember what info I had filled in since the start up email. It's so long time.</p>
<p>5. When I try to recover by filled more info about sending email subject, who are I sending email to, or what folder that I create in the account. Every time I send recovery form, always have email send back to me subject "unmonitored Automated Mail" from
 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and ask me to fill in the recover form again. I thought I fill in more than 6 times already.</p>
<p>6.What sould I do more to recover this account? I need this account because it use for receive PO from all of my customers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try Contact Answer Desk but it didn't work. It came back in the same way that I try before. Is it another way to recover the account? And I didn't understood why Microsoft block this email? I just only login with another computer in the office. If it's sensitive
 security to protect the account, in the future how can I buy the new computer???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your helpful.</p>

<h2>            First column in spreadsheet doesnt update on second spreadsheet using &#34;&#61;Sheet&#33;A1&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The first column of spreadsheet A should also be on spreadsheet B within the same file, to do this I use "=Sheet!A1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that works fine, but if after applying the formulas I edit the original first column again, the second spreadsheet doesnt automatically update.</p>
<p>I have heard from other people that their spreadsheet&nbsp;does update automatically, so it's probably a setting somewhere that dictates when stuff updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me where I need to check this? I'm Using Excel 2010</p>

            <p>Thanks but the automatic is already selected. The problem isnt that the cells arent updated, because whatever is changed on the cell also occurs automatically on the second sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that whenever I add rows on the first spreadsheet, these are not taken automatically&nbsp;into account on the other one. Should I possibly use another method e.g. freezing the pane&nbsp;and replicating it on the other spreadsheet, instead of using "=Sheet!A1"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because obviously whenever I add a row in the original sheet, the changes dont occur on the second spreadsheet (B) if there is no Formular&nbsp;for it to grab the data from spreadsheet A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Oh, I understand more now.</p>
<p>What you need to do on that second sheet is use</p>
<p>=Sheet1!$A$1</p>
<p>The $ sign makes each part of it 'absolute'.&nbsp; So when you add a new row 1 on Sheet1, the formula will still look in (the new) A1 instead of automatically changing to A2.&nbsp; Since only rows seem to be involved, you could actually use&nbsp; =Sheet1!A$1&nbsp; which would
 make only the row absolute instead of both the column and the row.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you, yes this is what I need. But how do I drag the formula down on spreadsheet B?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I manually enter ='Tracking List'!$B$2 and then manually do it three times changing the cell (='Tracking List'!$B$3, ='Tracking List'!$B$4) and drag down then I just repeatedly get the first three cells. I dont want to have to manually add the Formular
 for each cell, how can I drag the formula down?</p>
<p>Also, if once adding this formula and I add a new line in the original spreadsheet A, then spreadsheet B automatically jumps one cell so that the added row is again excluded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting a reply I remain,</p>
<p>

            <p>There is almost no way around the changing of the formulas when you insert/delete rows on the referenced sheet.&nbsp; Excel is always going to adjust the formulas.&nbsp; I don't necessarily think that's right, but that's the way it is.&nbsp; But I said 'almost no way'...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can use INDIRECT() and a little math.&nbsp; INDIRECT() takes a text string and treats it as if it were an address.&nbsp; Let's say that your first formula, ='Tracking List'!$B$2&nbsp; goes into a cell on row 2 of the other sheet.</p>
<p>Enter this formula:</p>
<p>=INDIRECT("'Tracking List'!A" &amp; 1+ROW()-1)</p>
<p>and now drag that down the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this discussion, let us say you are going to put these formulas into column X.&nbsp; But it could be any column.&nbsp; I'm using X to clearly distinguish cells on this 'other' sheet and the ones on your Tracking List sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things to note:&nbsp; First, notice that Tracking List is enclosed in single-quote marks, so the formula is starting out like:&nbsp; =INDIRECT(&nbsp; "&nbsp; '&nbsp; Tracking List'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but without the spaces I've just shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second:&nbsp; the 1+ROW()-1&nbsp; is calculating a row number.&nbsp; If we put that first formula into&nbsp;X2 on the 'other' sheet, then it evaluates to&nbsp; 1+2-1&nbsp;= 2.&nbsp; We need the math like that in case you fill it up to row 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we wanted the formula in X2 to pick up the value from 'Tracking List'!A1&nbsp; we would change the math portion to become:</p>
<p>=INDIRECT("'Tracking List'!A" &amp; ROW()-1)</p>
<p>ROW() is going to return the row that the formula is in, so it evaluates to 2-1 = 1&nbsp; and gets us the information from Tracking List!A1.&nbsp; You just have to play with that math to get the first formula right and then fill down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the formula you entered in the other sheet to get 'Tracking List'A1 was put into row 9 on this other sheet, then you would start with:<br />
=INDIRECT("'Tracking List'!A" &amp; ROW()-8)</p>
<p>since ROW() = 9, then 9-8 = 1 is the result of the evaluation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you change the name of sheet 'Tracking List', you have to change it in these formulas: you could either edit one and fill-again, or select them all and use Edit --&gt; Replace (with "look in formulas") to change them all to the new sheet name.</p>

            <p>DO NOT READ THIS unless there is a very strong chance that your users may change the name of the 'Tracking List' worksheet!&nbsp; It will only confuse you and I don't want to do that.&nbsp; If there is little or no chance of them changing that worksheet's name, go
 with what I gave you above, because this all leads to a very ugly formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if there is a strong chance of someone changing the name of 'Tracking List' then this would get your INDIRECT() formulas to automatically change the name of the sheet when they do that and continue working without having to edit the formulas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CELL() function can be used to return several different pieces of information about a cell on a worksheet.&nbsp; By using the "address" parameter, we can get it to tell us what sheet a cell is on, but we have to dig into the returned information to get it.&nbsp;
 Also, you want to reference a cell on the original sheet that won't be deleted (as in delete a row or column where the cell is that you're referencing)&nbsp; So I've picked 'Tracking List'!A10 as that cell for these examples:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the entire ugly formula - followed by a breakdown of its parts:</p>
<p>=INDIRECT("'" &amp; IFERROR(MID(CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),FIND("]",CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),1)+1,FIND("'",CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),2)-FIND("]",CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),1)-1),MID(CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),FIND("]",CELL("address",'Tracking
 List'!A$10),1)+1,FIND("!",CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),2)-FIND("]",CELL("address",'Tracking List'!A$10),1)-1)) &amp; "'!A" &amp; 1+ROW()-1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We start off with INDIRECT(" ' " &amp;&nbsp; without spaces - this gives us the first ' if it is needed (Excel will ignore it if it is not needed)</p>
<p>Now, that whole IFERROR() section with all of those MID() and&nbsp;FIND() functions in it: this is simply digging out the worksheet name all by itself from what the basic CELL("address",ref) function is returning throughout the formula.&nbsp; We need the IFERROR()
 because we have to get a good result whether or not there is a ' in the returned value, and the first try is for CELL() to return a result based on there being ' in the formula, which may not be true.&nbsp; Because this is a true formula, the references to 'Tracking
 List' in the formula WILL automatically change to the proper sheet name if a user changes it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, after all of that we have</p>
<p>&amp; "'!A" &amp; 1+ROW()-1)</p>
<p>which completes our INDIRECT() function with the needed column and row reference again.&nbsp; Like before the math of the 1+ROW()-1 part may need to be adjusted depending on which row you start in on the second sheet (the one with this formula in it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;I said, all of this may (and probably is) overkill and much more than you need.&nbsp; But I thought I'd offer it up just in case.&nbsp; While this does give you a set-it-and-forget it formula, it is also going to have an impact on speed/performance - how much impact
 depends on how far down your worksheet you have to have formulas like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other alternatives such as putting the whole IFERROR() portion into a single cell somewhere and just referencing that in our INDIRECT() formulas - that way the calculation of the 'Tracking List' sheet name only has to take place one time, not 10s
 or 100s or thousands of times.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your time and efforts, we are slowly but surely getting there ;-)</p>
<p>At least the name of the spreadsheet wont be changed, since for my own use at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make things more difficult, I'm using the german version. So this is what I entered:</p>
<p>=INDIREKT("'Tracking List'!C2") </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the use of the $-sign is, so I removed it. Can you please briefly explain what this absolute figure does (in row/column) or if this doesnt apply on "indirect" any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I drag that down the list, I still only get the same values. So I manually had to change the cell number on each of the formulas and that provisionally worked (I can now enter rows on first sheet and it amends as required).</p>
<p>On the german version, I could not find a similar word to ROW (eg. Reihe) except SPALTEN. When I tested this I got "the formula contains errors" window "SPALTEN(Matrix)", so I guess that's the wrong word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think we're nearly there, thanks for your help.</p>

<p>and according to that the word to use is ZEILE</p>
<p>So if you put this in any cell on any sheet</p>
<p>=ZEILE()</p>
<p>It should simply return the row number that the formula is in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry about the $ sign in these INDIRECT() functions.&nbsp; We are actually creating a reference that will not change no matter how many rows you add/delete on the other sheet.&nbsp; But we are making the ROW part of the reference flexible so you can drag your
 formula down the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You just need a little change to your formula and you should be on your way:</p>
<p>=INDIREKT('Tracking List'!C" &amp; 1+ZEILE()-1)</p>
<p>Remember that the&nbsp;&nbsp; 1+ZEILE()-1 </p>
<p>should be set up in the formula to adjust for the row that the formula is in!&nbsp; So if your formula is in row 2, then it will work (and continue to work as you fill it down the sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>======</p>
<p>A little about absolute references.&nbsp; Let us say that on a sheet you had a sales tax&nbsp;or value added tax rate in cell A1.&nbsp; In column B perhaps you have amounts of sales.&nbsp; In column C you want to calculate the tax on the amount of sale.&nbsp; A regular looking (relative
 addressing) formula for the sale in B2 would look like this:</p>
<p>=B2 * A1</p>
<p>However, as you drag that formula down the sheet, B2 changes to B3 and that is ok, but the A1 also changes to A2, which is not what you want to happen.</p>
<p>If you change the formula to </p>
<p>=B2 * A$1&nbsp; </p>
<p>then as you drag it down the sheet, only the row reference for column B will increase, the row for the rate in column A remains 'absolute'.&nbsp; If you also needed to copy the formula over to some other column on the sheet, then the A would change since it was
 relative, but if you entered the formula as</p>
<p>=B2 * $A$1</p>
<p>then both the column and row references for the tax rate cell are absolute and don't change.&nbsp; So if you copied your formula over into column E, Cell E2, it would change to become</p>
<p>=D2 * $A$1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps with the understanding of relative and absolute.&nbsp; Here are a couple of web pages with more detailed explanations, with pictures even!</p>

            <p>OK next issue: on the Spreadsheet B I only have Columns A-D that are to replicate the same cells on Spreadsheet A.
</p>
<p>After those first four colomns that are now updated automatically and correctly,&nbsp;I enter more data on that line&nbsp;myself manually. Therefore, every time a row is entered on Spreadsheet A, the remains of the row are obviously not moving with the first four
 columns together on Spreadsheet B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I somehow link the remains of the row in Spreadsheet B to the front cells, so that they are not mislined when a new row is added on Spreadsheet A? (maybe you already mentioned this above so that the whole row is connected, but I am not an expert in Excel
 so sorry if I didnt understand that part).</p>

<p>I'm trying to generate a query where the criteria can be a number list with an undetermined number of values. So the criteria might be<strong>13 OR 17</strong>; but it might also be

<p>If you can write a query to produce the numbers then use it as a subquery.</p>
<p>SELECT FieldA<br />
FROM TableA<br />
WHERE FieldB in (SELECT NumberField FROM TableC)</p>
<p>In query design view, under the number field enter the criteria as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN (&lt;&lt;Text of your query&gt;&gt;)</p>
<p>Your subquery must return only one field for this to work.</p>
<p>A second option is to use your query as a table and join it to the table in another query.</p>
<p>SELECT *<br />

<br />
The <span style="font-weight: bold">shortcut you use to access the IE</span> is the real victim. Go to properties of the shortcut, in the target location you will that the target has been set to

just remove everything behind the second quote, i.e. make it like<br />

    <title>VBA Find error when not found - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VBA Find error when not found</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 lists and I am finding from the first list all of the occurances in the second list and then returning another list from the first.&nbsp; If that makes sense, haha.&nbsp; The problem I am having is that if Find does not find a match then the code stops.&nbsp;
 What I need it to do is if it is not found then go on to the next one in the first list.&nbsp; Below is a part of the code.&nbsp; I am thinking there should be something simple added to Find to say if not found then next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c = 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'ARC Level of Care<br />
c2 = 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Room Type</p>
<p>LOCr = 2<br />
LOCc = 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Room Type<br />
LOCc2 = 9&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Room Type</p>
<p><br />
'Room Type</p>
<p>ws1.Select<br />
Do While ws2.Cells(LOCr, LOCc) &gt; ""</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ws1.Range("C2:C10000").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Find(What:=ws2.Cells(LOCr, LOCc), After:=ActiveCell, LookIn:=xlFormulas, LookAt _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:= _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; False, SearchFormat:=False).Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r2 = ActiveCell.Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ws1.Cells(r2, c2) = ws2.Cells(LOCr, LOCc2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r3 = r2 + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While r3 &gt; r2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.FindNext(After:=ActiveCell).Activate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r3 = ActiveCell.Row<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ws1.Cells(r3, c2) = ws2.Cells(LOCr, LOCc2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOCr = LOCr + 1<br />

            <p>Without rewriting your code, you need to first test if anything is found before doing something.&nbsp; So in pseudo-code:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Dim C as Range</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">'Go to next loop or step or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in your actual code, there is almost never a reason to Select or Activate anything.&nbsp; Just refer to the object directly.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Outlook data file cannot be accessed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Using Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p>I had to have my hard drive recovered. When I got it back the copmuter recognized it as E drive and not the former G drive and Outlook couldnt automatically find the .pst file. I opened the file thru Outlook. When the account opens, I have no Send/receive
 button on the top of the Home screen. When I go to the Send/Receive screen and select send/receive, I get send/receive error. When I click on the send/receive error at the bottom of the page, it opens up the box (image attached) saying "Outlook file can not
 be accessed. The connection works as the test message passed. </p>
<p>How do I get the file accessed?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/605186cd-9b00-45d0-bcce-580ea1732d79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/605186cd-9b00-45d0-bcce-580ea1732d79" /></a>&nbsp;</p>

Ctrl+&gt; or Ctrl+&lt; increases/decreases in increments as listed in the Font dialog.</p>
<p>
Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] increases/decreases in 1 point increments.</p>
<p>
Ctrl+7 and Ctrl+8 have never been a default command, so if you used it, you must have remapped the shortcuts on that particular machine.</p>

<h2>            Is Skype Classic version 7.41 really no more&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Could someone at Microsoft confirm that the Classic Skype version 7.41 is truly deprecated and that we are advised categorically to upgrade to Skype version 8.25?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The organisation I volunteer with depends on Skype communication and members of our Team were very akin with Skype Classic 7.41. However, if the classic version has gone in to history, we will take up the new version and carry on.</p>

                    <p>Hello! &nbsp;I just grabbed the preview intending to try things out, and start learning to handle it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One big hitch though, Settings does not launch. &nbsp;No error messages, and I'm also unable to attempt to run updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet explorer, project spartan, updates, and signing in from Cortana also have the same issue. &nbsp;The only things that work are programs that aren't by Microsoft, ironically. &nbsp;Google chrome here, and videogames play fine too. &nbsp;The "element not found" errors
 are occuring for anything system related that wasn't in 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any known issues or workarround to issues like this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand after installing Windows 10 Technical Preview, you are unable to access settings, Cortina and Microsoft apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the below step and check if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the desktop press Windows flag key +R and type netplwiz and click ok.</li><li>This will create user account window.</li><li>Select add and then select sign in without Microsoft account.</li><li>Type a name and password and create a local account.</li><li>Now sign in with the new local account and check if it helps.</li></ul>
<p>We are basically creating a new user account to check if this problem is occurred due to a corrupt user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check and keep us updated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This left me with some really interesting results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially all of the problems were resolved. &nbsp;I was able to begin an update, and to access settings. &nbsp;However, the first time Spartan attempted to run all of the symptoms my original account was experiencing reflected in the new one. &nbsp;I allowed the updates
 I started to complete, then restarted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, my original account now operates properly after the update,
<em>until</em> Spartan is launched. &nbsp;If spartan is launched, the account encounters "Element not found" errors when launching windows functions until logged out, or restarted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: &nbsp;The issues actually reliably appear over time, giving me short bursts to look through the settings upon logging in. &nbsp;The errors return immediately upon attempting to use spartan, or after several minutes.<br />

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0c263c2d-f37a-4bb3-83f9-76d81a91c661" title="BHALCHANDRADAVE">
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it's possible. If the people you want to call are also using Skype, you don't need to pay for anything as long as both ends are connected to the Internet and are using the Skype&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you intend to call mobiles and landlines, you need to have <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/skypecredit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype Credit</a> or a <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA331/what-are-the-different-types-of-skype-subscriptions-and-pay-as-you-go-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
calling subscription</a> on your account that can cover the cost of calling for the country where the person you want to reach is residing. Remember that our call rates are the same wherever you are calling
<strong>from</strong>. They only vary depending on where you are calling <strong>
to</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check the available subscriptions and pay-as-you-go rates&nbsp;for USA, please follow the below steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Skype <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype to Phone webpage</a>, search USA or click the USA flag.</li><li>All available calling options will be displayed after clicking USA. </li><li>To check the rates for pay-as-you-go option using Skype Credits, click <strong>
See rates</strong>. If you intend to avail a calling plan instead, the price of the subscription will appear inside the box.</li></ol>

<h2>            PowerPoint 2011 for Mac Macro Trouble</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I not a happy camper. &nbsp;Last week I purchased Office for Mac 2011 because MS claims to have added back support for Macros. &nbsp;I've been using the 2004 version till now because the 2008 version did not support Macros at all.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>My problem is that I have a lot of Macros and a dozen that I use very frequently. &nbsp;With the 2004 version I have some toolbars with buttons to execute my most used Macros with a single click. &nbsp;In 2011 it isn't possible
 to add macros to a toolbar in PowerPoint, but it can be done in Excel. &nbsp;I think MS just dropped the ball on this. &nbsp;Does anyone know a way to execute a Macro in PP 2011 without having to select it from the scrolling list? &nbsp;I've reported this to MS tech support,
 but they were no help.</span></strong></p>
<p>A related problem is that Office 2004 had an AppleScript "Do Visual Basic" command that is not present in 2011. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to execute a Macro from VisualBasic in 2011?</p>
<p>Finally, the .run command of Visual Basic does not compile in PP. &nbsp;I've copied code from the MS VB website that includes this command and it gets a compiler error! &nbsp;You'd think that MS's regression testing would at least include a simple compile test of
 their own sample code. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rats! &nbsp;At this point PP 2011 is useless for me and I really would like the performance improvements that it offers.</p>

<p>You can add macros to a toolbar or create your own toolbar using visual basic, ideally in an add-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works pretty much as it does in 2004 or the Windows versions.&nbsp; This'd be a starting point:</p>
<p>Create an ADD-IN with TOOLBARS that run macros<br />

<p>As I understand it, the 2011 ribbon is off-limits.&nbsp; Can't customize it manually or via code, other than the minor adjustments the UI allows us.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia 302 won&#39;t even let me type my PIN</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, my Nokia 302 is now&nbsp; 4 months old. A month ago it started to get frozen</p>
<p>from time to time, only responding to the on/off key. Now I can't even type my PIN. On the login screen, right</p>
<p>after booting and&nbsp; before I type anything it says "Code too short" again and again, It looks as if the OK key was constantly pressed.&nbsp; Did anyone have this problem before? Any help from the experts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many,many thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Yup. it is supposed to. You need to consider what apps we are talking about. If you have an email account and delete it, all the information for it would also be deleted, including the attachments. Potentially those mails and&nbsp;attachments are on the server,
 depending on the mail protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have opened those attachments in one of the Office products, you can save them to the phone for posterity (save as, onto the phone), or I suspect they are subject to the above. Can't uninstall the Office products. In Office there is a 'place' called
 email (attachments). I expect that is just a pointer to the attachment within the e-mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your attachment is a pdf, and you open it in one of the readers, it is stored in its own sandbox. If you uninstall the reader, yes, the files library associated with it goes away.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly with other applications that let you save stuff locally, if you uninstall, the files go with it, unless it specifically has the ability to interact with system programs. There are some photo editing things that work with the built in photo storage,
 and some of the cloud storage apps can interact with the Office file storage, sort of like an attachment.</p>

    <title>onedrive document has reverted to an older version even though - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> help needed pretty please  say:</h3>
<h2>            onedrive document has reverted to an older version even though autosaved</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anyone could help me. I consistently worked on a document for a couple of days in onedrive word, which as far as I am aware auto saves on a regular basis for you. I have logged back into the document and it has reverted back to the original file
 that I opened from an email and began my editing on. I have looked in the version history and nothing is coming up on the day that I worked on it all day and night and the versions prior to that are all the original ones. This is for a uni paper that has to
 be in soon and a lot of work has gone in to it which I cant afford to lose, does anyone know what could have happened? All my other documents seem fine so I am utterly confused why this one is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated so thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Please provide more information to help you better:<br />
<br />
1) Did you download the Word attachment from email and uploaded it to OneDrive?<br />
<br />
2) From where are you accessing the Word document? Is it from OneDrive or email?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span>

    <title>E71 contact&#47;menu issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steff_x  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71 contact&#47;menu issues</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I got this phone in November, a while after turning it on (maybe a couple of days), the phone menu freezes up and when i select 'menu' from the home screen, it cannot display it unless i turn the phone off then back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, just in the past couple of days, my phone has stopped recognising names in my contact list, particuarly in texts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when it first started, it would just come up with the phone number for a couple of messages, go back to the contact name for a couple, then go back to the number. i don't have the number duplicated anywhere and it was only happening with one particular contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried deleting the contact then adding it again, and it worked for a couple of messages then went back to showing the number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then, this morning it started to do it with another contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>has this happened to anyone else? anyone have any ideas on either of these problems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>-steff</p>

<p>Usually, the phone displays the number and not ID when those contacts are duplicated. Either saved both on the SIM and phone memory, or the number has been entered for different contacts. Try using the Search function in your phone by typing in a given number
 to see if it's duplicated or not.</p>
<p>If your phone freezes, it's best to update its SW via NSU. Make sure to make a backup beforehand though, so you can retrieve it later. &nbsp;</p>
