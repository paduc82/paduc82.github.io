<h2>            Hotmail account was hacked.</h2>
                    <p>Need help. My hotmail account was created a long time ago, barely use it aside from facebook, and even that got my FB account hacked too. There's an alternate email in my account @mail.ru which obviously is not mine!<br />
<br />
I've gone through all the steps providing name, birthdate, province, postal code, the 2 passwords I had before, (don't have skype, xbox) I can't find any sent emails from friends and family only one that's been received from 2009. I figured I might as well
 try but that did not work. Keep getting the message <br />

</p>
<p>Simply being redirected back to the form, but it never worked. There's nothing more I can provide. I can't find someone with anymore sent emails, no skype no xbox. What else can be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but can anyone help? I tried asking other friends to help as well, but cannot find a solution to this anymore. I can't even log into my FB account anymore and all those private information has been stolen from me.</p>

            Hi, Jelo Sen.<br />
<br />
I've already read all those. Like I said, I've already filled out those forms.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"<span>"&nbsp;Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your ownership using the information that was provided. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal

<p>
</p><p><br />
All the information I have gathered up are the passwords I've used since before, and one email that I've received with the subject and the date (not sent). It's asking me for sent ones. As stated above I haven't been using this email to do anymore sending.
 Just receiving on notification FB, etc. No skype, no xbox. What more information can I provide when I've already filled out what I can and it won't even accept it?</p>

hi! u can use data cable CA-42 for transferring your photos using PC Suite or IR (if ur PC supports), card reader will be no use for u since ur fone has no mmc slot...

<h2>            Being spammed with emails</h2>
                    I'm being emailed(always in junk folder though) at least 5-7 times a day. They are all from different email address but all tend to look the same(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). All of them
 just contain 1 link. Is there a way to stop this? Is there a rule I can setup to have them automatically deleted?</span>

            Thanks for the reply. The link didn't really show me how to setup a rule for this situation. It just said to edit rules if your not getting emails you think you should be. Any info out there on what each rule really does and how to use it so I can set
 one up for this?

We're limited on our response&nbsp;ref your issue since we do not know the file name, directory, history of your computer, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let's assume that this is a new, first time install of MSE and see if the generic fix for MSE install issues will help:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/i-cant-install-microsoft-security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windo<span>ws.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/i-cant-install-microsoft-security-essentials</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What operating system and service pack? MSE requires XP (32 bit version only) with
<strong>SP3</strong> installed, Vista or Win 7…</span></p>
<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>A
<b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure you have removed <span>&nbsp;</span>all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re not sure which security apps may have been on your computer try a scan with this security application detection/removal tool:
</span><span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>When running Appremover:</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>First, run the Remove Security Applications scan and then run the Clean Up A Failed Installation Scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You
<b>may</b> need to uninstall/reinstall MSE.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>You should be able to remove MSE from Control Panel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any problems uninstalling see: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a></span></p>

    <title>iphone and outlook 365 calendar showing different times when accepting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfran177  say:</h3>
<h2>            iphone and outlook 365 calendar showing different times when accepting calendar appointments from websites</h2>
                    <p>I have office 365 outlook calendar on my PC and that syncs with my iphone calendar.&nbsp; If I create an appointment on my outlook calendar it syncs and shows up at the same time on my iphone.&nbsp; Same is true if I create an appointment on my iphone then it shows
 up at the same time on my outlook calendar. No issue.</p>
<p>The problem is when I am on a website and it has a feature to add the appointment to calendar.&nbsp; Examples being Evite.com, Punchbowl.com, SignupGenius.com, my hair salon etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;These websites all have a feature that you can add the event to your calendar
 (all details are pre-populated, you just accept the event to your calendar) - very handy.&nbsp; It's come to my attention that if I add the event to my calendar thru my iphone, it initially appears at the correct time on my iphone calendar but on my outlook calendar
 it shows up at an incorrect time (5 hrs earlier).&nbsp; At some point, the two calendars sync and it then changes the iphone to match the outlook, so now both are incorrect.&nbsp; Although this "sync" does not occur immediately as other changes would typically sync
 within a minute.&nbsp; It appears to happen at some later time (I haven't figured out what the trigger is).&nbsp; &nbsp;If I add an event from a website to my calendar thru outlook, it appears at the correct time on both my outlook and iphone calendar.&nbsp; So this appears to
 only be an issue with website calendar events added thru my iphone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, this only occurs with events generated by a website and accepted by me.&nbsp; Not events that I manually create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched thru all known settings on both my phone and outlook and all of my time zones appear to be set to the correct New York-EST.&nbsp; &nbsp;I use Office 365 and my phone is an iphone 7 with iOS 12.1.2. My iphone date &amp; time setting is set to "set automatically"
 with the Time Zone designated as New York.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you encountered this issue and is there a known fix or settings change?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Jfran117,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please kindly note that Outlook for iOS is not synchronized with your Calendar in your iPhone directly. Outlook for iOS just keeps the same with Outlook on the Web. So let's try to change the time setting in the Outlook on the web to see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign in to Outlook on the web.</p>
<p>At the top of the page, select Settings &gt; Mail.</p>
<p>Under Options, select General &gt; Region and time zone.</p>
<p>Under Region and time zones settings, select the time zone you want to use as your iPhone shows.</p>
<p>Select Save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the time zone has been set the same as your iPhone. I suggest that set the time 5 hours ahead and check the result again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

    <title>Not Receiving E-mails From A Few Companies &#40;Best Buy, Lids, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stavros27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not Receiving E-mails From A Few Companies &#40;Best Buy, Lids, Amazon&#41; That I was Previously Receiving</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running into an issue where I was once subscribed to receive emails from a few companies, then used the option in those e-mails to unsubscribe when I no longer wanted to receive them a while back. Now, I am looking to be able to get e-mails from these
 sites again but haven't had any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The e-mails in question are from the following sites:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lids.com</p>
<p>Bestbuy.ca</p>
<p>Amazon.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is that I subscribed to Best Buy and Lids on my work related e-mail address and have been receiving e-mails from them, but I would prefer to have them going to my personal e-mail again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am using an *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' e-mail address in Microsoft Outlook 2013</p>
<p>- My junk mail preference is set to 'Low'</p>
<p>- All 3 domains are in my safe sender list</p>
<p>- I have zero blocked domains/e-mails from in list in the junk menu</p>
<p>- I have verified that none of these e-mails are going into my junk folder</p>
<p>- I verified that there are no rules set for these e-mails to go into any other folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also logged into my accounts on all 3 websites and unchecked/rechecked and updated the options to receive promotional e-mails from them. I also have re-added my e-mail address on the sign up pages for Lids and Best Buy multiple times, along with e-mailing
 the websites to ask for any other help. The only thing they could do is add my e-mail to their mailing list, which has not solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to summarize, I was signed up and receiving e-mails from these sites in the past but unsubscribed. Now I want to be able to get their e-mails and cannot receive them on my hotmail e-mail account. My separate, work related e-mail is currently receiving
 the Lids and Best Buy e-mails but I only signed up with that e-mail to test it out, and to be able to receive the e-mails while I fixed the issue with my primarily e-mail address.</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me solve this issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            <p>I am not very familiar with spam utliities, but I know that I haven't purchased anything like that. I have a feeling that this has something to do with the anti spam law that passed in Canada last year where companies had to have clear opt out links in their
 e-mails, but I can't imagine that opting out of their e-mails would be permanent if I wanted to receive them again in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can test out on my computer to figure out why I am not receiving these e-mails?

            I have received e-mails when buying from the sites and when items have been shipped. I have e-mails saved from Lids and Best Buy from August 2015 confirming purchases. It is the promotional e-mails that I am not receiving. I called Best Buy support today
 and explained the issue in detail. I will post a reply when I hear back from them.<br />

            <p>So I heard back from Best Buy a week ago. They said their privacy manager confirmed that my e-mail was added back to their list and that I should be getting e-mails again, but I have received none.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up a Yahoo.com e-mail address recently and decided to subscribe to Best Buy &amp; Lids to see how quick I'd start getting e-mails there. I got them within a day or two. Still nothing on my original e-mail address.</p>
It worked this morning, so this might be a good enough solution for now. I am still curious about how they weren't able to fix the original issue.
<p>
</p><p>Are there moderators or anyone associated with Microsoft that can look into it for me from the Outlook side?</p>

<h2>            One Drive &#47; File Locked for Editing by Me Supposedly</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a problem recently with my Word docs on OneDrive. I will open up a file, do some work, try and save to one drive and get a file upload failed message, followed by a line that the file is locked for editing by me.&nbsp; I have no idea how I
 would lock a file for editing even if I wanted to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been dealing with this problem by simply renaming the file; however, I find this practice to be fairly annoying and would prefer to know how these files are getting locked in the first place.</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - I believe I am working with regular OneDrive, but the account is the one my school gave me, so it might be a different account type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - I have OneDrive desktop installed on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 - It happens now to every office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 - Funny thing is now OneDrive is simply removing the files after I close them. I have to go online and restore the file from the trash bin, only for it to end up there again after I finish editing once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I know you offer those things for students so they buy your products once they grow out of university, but this only makes me want to steer away from any and all office products once I get to buy my own software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another issue where the school account will just disappear after a few hours from one of my computers. Making me have to remove the old folders and sync everything again. For as much data as I have this is ridiculous and seems completely not
 necessary. </p>

<p>Hi AnnikaKlein,</p>
<p>Based on your description, do you mean to sync your iCloud calendar to the Outlook 2016 for Mac? If yes, please note that Outlook 2016 for Mac currently doesn't support the CalDAV or CardDAV internet standards. This means that it's not possible to synchronize
 your iCloud Calendar or contacts with Outlook 2016 for Mac. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Is-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-compatible-with-Apple-iCloud-c9c67e41-274f-4527-ae5e-ea1003d89fc5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Is-Outlook-2016-for-Mac-compatible-with-Apple-iCloud-c9c67e41-274f-4527-ae5e-ea1003d89fc5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we have this feature in the Outlook for Mac client. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature by clicking the smiley face in the upper right corner of the Outlook client.</p>
<p>Understanding your experience helps us to make our product and service better for you and others. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Word 2007 Macro with Math function</h2>
                    <p>Trying to create a protected document for use in small business. It is a contract form for services. Service charges are agreed to at time contract is emailed to client. I want to add a check box to allow client to select and add additional services, if
 needed, and have the charges automatically added to the original service fee and provide a total prior to signing and returning contract. Is that possible? Is it difficult? I'm a novice at best.</p>

<h2>            Nokia MAPS USB problem...</h2>
                    
<p><font>hi... it's me again with a different problem...</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>these past few days, whenever i tried to open Maps, there's always this "message" popped up, saying :
<strong>please disconnect USB to use Maps.</strong></font></p>
<p><font><strong><br />
</strong></font></p>
<p><font>i can understand if this "message" popped up when my C7 was connected via USB to my PC. but this also popped up when it was not connected via USB.</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>what should i do so i can use Maps again ? the last time this happened, i had to *#7370# the phone...</font></p>

<p>Firstly, just to clarify are you using Ovi Maps v3.06 with Anna upgrade upon your C7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, is map data installed upon either E:\ Mass memory or F:\Memory card?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having the exact same problem, and it was driving me crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(After upgrade to 3.08, Maps would tell me "Please disconnect USB to use Maps" every time, even when it wasn't connected)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I've managed to figure out a fix, so here goes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect phone to PC</li><li>Hunt around for a folder called "cities"</li><li>There should be 2 folders there called "lock_maps" and "lock_dev" - delete both of them</li><li>You might struggle to delete "lock_maps" in some cases, because it might be corrupted</li><li>In above case, re-connect the phone to PC in "Mass Storage Mode"</li><li>Fire up the Windows console (cmd.exe)</li><li>Go to whichever drive the phone is mounted on (say E:) and run "chkdsk /F"</li><li>It'll throw up some scary looking questions - answer "Y" or "Yes" to them</li><li>A final question should be (paraphrasing) "Some error was found with the directory
<strong>lock_maps</strong>. Convert folder to file?" - Answer "yes" to this as well</li><li>After it's done, go the the E:\cities fodler again - <strong>lock_maps</strong> should now be a regular file</li><li>Shift-Delete the **bleep** out of it</li><li>Restart Ovi Maps and enjoy.</li></ol>
<p>I hope this helps other people who stumble across this issue as well!</p>

            I found out, that by renaming the lock_maps folder, you get rid off the problem. It's useful when on the road and can't connect the phone to computer.

            Hi - thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
The issue still occurs in safe mode, so I did not run the 'Fixit' solution.<br />
<br />
I reassigned the "Save As" shortcut key from F12 to F11 and the problem seems to have been resolved. I suspect I'll soon find out about the unintended consequences of my actions as the solution seems a little idiosyncratic.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />

            Are you using an IMAP account? The calendar &amp; contacts are stored in a folder named 'this computer only' and the folders are only on the local computer.  Did you delete the account from outlook? If you deleted the account, the data is gone. Sorry. 
<br />
<br />The only chance you have is if the old data file is on your computer. Go to %localappdata%\Microsoft\outlook - is there a datafile named for your email address there with a last modified date right before you reloaded outlook?

<br />I had to reload my Outlook 365 but lost my contacts, and calendar data.  How do I recover it?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />If the email account to which your contact/calendar data belonged was configured as an IMAP account (contact/calendar folders would have had the added words "This Computer Only" in the folder description), then unfortunately that data is lost unless you explicitly made a manual backup of those folders by exporting them to a PST file.
<br />
<br />To mitigate this from occurring in the future, suggest one of the following two approaches
<br />
<br />Option #1
<br />
<br />#1 - Create a new PST file in the profile 
<br />(go to Home ribbon --&gt; &lt;new items&gt; --&gt; &lt;more items&gt; --&gt; &lt;Outlook Data file&gt;
<br />#2 - Go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab 
<br />#3 - Select the PST file just added --&gt; Set it as the default data file
<br />
<br />Once the above is done, the default contact/calendar folders will be stored/maintained in the PST file which doesn't get deleted if Outlook (or the email account) is ever re-installed
<br />
<br />Option #2
<br />
<br />#1 - Create a free Outlook.com email account
<br />#2 - Add the email account in Outlook 
<br />#3 - Go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; select the OST file for the Outlook.com account --&gt; set it as the default data file for the profile
<br />
<br />This approach enables sharing contact/calendar data across multiple devices where the account has been configured.

            <p>I found that there are now 2 places to make these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Properties which opens "Command Prompt" settings</li><li>Defaults which opens Console Windows Properties</li></ul>
<p>I found that I can get settings to stick by pinning to the Taskbar and launching from there.&nbsp; I have it default to an Administrator Command prompt, by right-clicking the Task bar icon, then right-clicking the shortcut that pops up to change its properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;After
 launching, I can change both Default and Properties and the changes stick if launched from my pinned task bar icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I launch from the Start menu, it has other retained settings, so they must be saved per shortcut somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/744c9f3a-bd30-499e-929b-dbc8f5bea072" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I found the Start menu shortcut here:</p>
<p>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\System Tools</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT (again):&nbsp; If you go to C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe and launch it from there, it creates yet another set of saved settings.&nbsp; Seems each shortcut (and whatever gets created when launched from system32)&nbsp;saves its own settings.</p>

            <p>That's the same way it works in Windows 7 and 8.1.</p>
<p>Doing a SHIFT+Right-Click "Open Command Prompt Here" required another set of settings to save, separate from the shortcuts.</p>
<p>Admin and non-Admin Command Prompt were also separate settings.</p>

<h2>            When would a blocked account be deleted&#63;</h2>
                    i had an email account that i lost the password years ago. The account was created in random details, so there was no way for me to retrive the account. After trying a few attemp, the account got blocked. I read online that an inactive account will be
 removed after a year. I was wondering if an account is blocked, do it account as an inactive account? Coz after this many years, when i try to logon the account, it still shows that the account is blocked. So how come the account didnt get removed?

            I had the same problem but I found out that it only stores your last 5 or so passwords. If you change your password 6 times it will let you reuse the old one. At least that’s how long it took me maybe it was more but you get the idea. Now I have my old
 password again.

<p>This was engineered to be bad UX...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It suggests that it's there for protection, but we all know why it's really there.. Combined with the "Suspicious activity on your account! You must change your password now! You have no other option!" The user should be warned not to reuse a password, but
 why force it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many accounts are inactive due to forgotten passwords?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Inability to create an IMAP account in Outlook on Android</h2>
                    We have a PixelXL and an Office 365 home account. Outlook is installed on the Android Pixel and connects to Exchange just fine and to a GMAIL account fine. We also have a host for our own domain and receive email there as well. We have tried repeatedly
 to set up an IMAP account with our email host to no avail on one Pixel. On the other Pixel ( both have PixelXL's) my wife is unable to set up an IMAP account for her email. We have tried advanced set up, selecting proper ports, etc. No joy. My phone connects
 to the same email server just fine. There is something about her Outlook configuration on that phone that is preventing a connection. She can connect fine on her laptop using Outlook and the same settings. Microsoft tech support keeps telling us they are getting
 configuration errors when they try to check the mail server but my phone works fine on the same server as does my desktop and laptop. The mail server does not use SSL and I know Outlook looks for a secure email connection firs

<p>We tried all of the above and nothing resolved the problem. The solution was to remove Outlook from the Android phone and reinstall it. At that point we were able to connect to the email server that was problematic before. Something about the first install
 of Outlook created an issue that could only be resolved by reinstalling the product. A bit frustrating since MS Android support didn't suggest that early on when none of the other solutions worked but at least things are now functioning properly.</p>
