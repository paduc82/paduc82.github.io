<h2>            Can I PREVENT workbook sharing&#63;</h2>
                    A colleague of mine posted this question to me earlier.&nbsp; It seems simple, but I don't know if it's possible.&nbsp; I'm very familiar with all the other protection options (e.g. protect workbook, sheet, etc.).&nbsp; But can you physically prevent someone from just
<b>turning on</b> Workbook Sharing?&nbsp; Meaning I don't want that "Protect and Share" or the "Share Workbook" buttons to be an option at all.&nbsp; I'm using Excel 2010.&nbsp; Thanks!

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to disable the option
</span>in Excel.</p>
<p>However you may search online for any Macros(VBA) to disable this option in a particular Workbook. You may also post your question in Microsoft Office Programming forum mentioned below for suggestion
 on how to create a VBA code for the same:</p>

<h3> why wont this thing work  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible it was moved, renamed or deleted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running windows 10 pro and word for office 365 mso 32 bit. I store documents to onedrive, which then syncs to my computer...when it's functioning properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For two days now, I try to open files and some of them won't open. I get the error message "Sorry, we couldnt' find https://[one drive account]/[file path]/[document name]. Is it possible it was moved, renamed or deleted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't been moved, renamed or deleted. It is not currently attached to an email draft or in the outbox. There is seemingly no reason why the file can't be opened. Yesterday, after about 4 restarts, I was able to get into another document, but then couldn't
 save it, because I kept getting the other annoying error saying the the filename contained invalid characters...it didn't.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for all the trouble it has caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the error message is about the file you trying to open, I think you could check the file in OneDrive Online: If you are a business user, sign in Portal:&nbsp;<a href="http://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">portal.office.com</a>&nbsp;and
 click OneDrive icon. If the file does has some problems, we know the issue is caused by OneDrive. If the file is fine, you can try download it to your local drive and open it with Word, see if the error message still pops up. This way we can know whether the
 issue is on OneDrive or Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask how did you open the document? In File Explorer or in Word &gt; Open? What if you open it in File Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If OneDrive is causing these issues, here is an article about fixing OneDrive issues:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-onedrive-sync-problems-83ab0d8a-8400-45b0-8dcf-dc8aa8a6bcf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix OneDrive sync problems</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the error messages you mentioned seem to related to the file path. If only files stored in OneDrive have these errors, you could try to change the OneDirve file path. To do this, you will need to unlink your PC first, which means all the files downloaded
 to your local drive will need to re-download from OneDrive again. Sorry for the inconvenience, but if you would like to try:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4028633/windows-10-change-the-location-of-your-onedrive-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change
 the location of your OneDrive folder</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to share any update with me at your convenience. I also want to confirm some basic information for further support:</p>
<p>1. The OneDrive version and build: Right-click OneDrive icon on the taskbar &gt; <strong>
Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> About.</strong></p>
<p>2. Office version: <strong>Word</strong> &gt; <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> &gt;<strong> About</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7462c5a8-6669-4950-be66-d8963fb0b807?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7462c5a8-6669-4950-be66-d8963fb0b807?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3. Windows version and build: press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> &gt; type <strong>
winver</strong> &gt;<strong> OK</strong></p>

<p>We are working in Word 2003 and have encountered a new error message. The solution we have used is to open the file and do a Ctrl+A to copy all the contents and drop into a new document. This new document can be edited and saved without a problem.</p>
<p>However, can anyone tell us what went wrong with the original file to produce this "read-only embedded font" message?</p>

<p>Hello there. I'm a new user but I noticed this problem because something similar happened to me a while back. The support answer above answers the question really well. To stop the error from happening again though you may need to aquire the font used by
 the user who sent it to you. In my experience Word is subsituting a font because it doesn't have the specific font installed on your computer.</p>
<p>Hope that was helpful :). All the best</p>

    <title>Clicking in Excel Selects Multiple Cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew_86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clicking in Excel Selects Multiple Cells</h2>
                    <p>I've seen this question asked so many times, but never an appropriate answer to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:&nbsp; I click on a single cell.&nbsp; Excel highlights 3 to 4 cells vertically (at this time) as if I had clicked and dragged across these cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Cells are always below the cell I clicked on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Vertical alignment is most common, but it does occur horizontally going to the right</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I've checked:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Extended mode is NOT on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Scroll lock is NOT on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Sticky keys (shift) is NOT on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Cells are NOT merged</p>
<p>&nbsp;- View options (under view tab) have no impact (switching views does not stop the problem)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Magnification settings has no impact (hey, I really am trying here)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Closing the workbook and reopening it entirely (includes all open Excel windows) does not correct it</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is directly impacting my ability to do my job.&nbsp; In some cases I could click wildly in the cells and get it to stop, but that isn't even working right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has a real solution to this problem, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; This is something that has been an on-going issue for years.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Drew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the description of your issue, it might have caused by a corrupted system file in Excel or 3rd party add-in. We recommend that you do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Excel in Safe Mode</a></strong>.</li><li><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair your Office suite</a></strong>.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue still exists after trying these troubleshooting, please provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this issue only occur in a certain Excel document?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to your device prior to the issue?</li><li>What version and build of Windows are you using?</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?</li></ul>

<p>Hi Drew - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you figured this out or not but it sounds like a problem I was having too. In my case I had one sheet that was affected, no matter which cell I highlighted in that sheet it would also highlight the next 6 or 7 below it. If I moved between
 cells using the keyboard it would only highlight one cell at a time. I wound up clicking on cell, letting it highlight the whole group that it wanted to, and then unmerging them. Doing this ONCE fixed the entire sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what caused it. I don't know why it worked. I don't know why you don't have to go through and unmerge each group that it's seeing. I just know that it worked for me.</p>

            Lets agree on terminology, it helps reduce dissonence.
<br />
<br />2016 does not have "toolbars". It has Tabs, and Panes.  
<br />
<br />By default the Ribbon has several tabs that are visible all  the time.  There are also a number of tabs that play hide and seek. They are called "contextual tabs". They only display when the "context" is appropriate.
<br />
<br />For example
<br />.  *  insert a picture.
<br />.  *  the "Picture Tools &gt; Format Contextual tab" is displayed
<br />.  *  click anywhere outside fo the picture, the contextual tab evaporates
<br />.  *  When you click on the picture, the Pictures tool contextual tab pops back up (wheeeee....!)
<br />.  *  Go to Insert tab &gt; Illustrations group &gt; Shapes drop down button &gt; pick a shape yo want to insert
<br />.  *  click and drag to define the size of the shape (you can redefine it as needed)
<br />.  *  now the "Drawing tools &gt; Format Contextual tab" is displayed.
<br />
<br />So what "toolbar" are you talking about that is greyed out.  Please make a screen capture showing the problem. Save it to your HD as a picture. Then use the "Insert Picture" button (second from the right in the input box here) to show us the picture.

<p>
</p><p>Did you read Rohn007's response above? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that your are running Pub 2016 then the drawing tab, not toolbar, is contextual. You must click on a text box or a shape element in order to get the
<em>Drawing Tools - Format</em> tab to appear. If you have clicked on a picture...nope. If you clicked on open space on your page...nope.</p>

Out of Office automatic reply on certain days of the week</a> for the latest information on this topic.</span></p>

<p>So I am trying to work out how to post e recurring auto reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My circumstances are a little specific and I haven't been able to find any solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work a 28 day roster cycle, that is, it repeats itself every 28 days, one week I have the weekend off, the next week I have Monday Tuesday off, the following week Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to set up auto replies for my days off, set it up once and not have to do it every week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two methods I had in my mind were that Outlook (OWA) would be integrated enough with the calendar, that I could put my days off in as events in the calendar, load them as recurring and have an auto reply set to that event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively I was expecting to be able to create a rule for each week, set it to repeat every 28 days, like I can with the calendar, banking and most other things of this nature. But I cannot find a way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using OWA, but if I need to I can set up outlook 2010 that is on my machine that I haven't ever bothered using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, I tried chat support but they just pointed me to the standard auto reply tutorials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Lumia 650.  No choice but to return.</h2>
                    <p>Myself and wife updated our phones from the 640 to the 650, but since have had a wifi problem. &nbsp;We get the 'not connected to the internet message' which cannot be fixed by resetting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time we have this problem the only way to fix it is by use of the Windows device recovery. &nbsp;The phone's wifi will then start to work again, up to the point were windows 10 update's itself, and we are back with 'Not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Why can we not have a say when it comes to win 10 updating itself? &nbsp;Microsoft cannot be trusted to update devices, the updates are so often broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though we liked the phones themselves we have no choice now but to return them for a refund.</p>

<p>I'm 99% sure I have all "data usage" settings turned off (set to manual updates) for the phone and installed applications.</p>

 it will not go away. I have run RKill and malwarebytes.org products thinking it was malware, but nothing helps. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi Seniorpillbug,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A website's certificate provides identification of the web server. If the certificate has an error, it might indicate that your connection has been intercepted or that the web
 server is misrepresenting its identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Error message:</b> This website’s security certificate has been revoked.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>What it means:</b> Do not trust this website. This error message often indicates that the security certificate was obtained or used fraudulently by the website.
 The encryption key that is specified in the certificate might have been compromised or the user listed in a certificate does not have authority to use it (for example, the company was sold). The certification authority that issued the certificate keeps a list
 of revoked certificates and that list is checked by Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the below article for more information:</p>
<p><b>About certificate errors</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/About-certificate-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/About-certificate-errors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend you to check if proxy server settings are enabled. To do this, try these steps:</p>
<p>Disable proxy server on Internet Explorer (IE)</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start, type inetcpl.cpl and hit enter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Connections tab, click LAN settings button.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Uncheck "Use a proxy server for your LAN" under proxy server.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click ok to apply the changes.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Internet Explorer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the below article for more information:</p>
<p><b>Change proxy settings in Internet Explorer</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Change-proxy-server-settings-in-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Change-proxy-server-settings-in-Internet-Explorer</a>

<h2>            Not receiving emails from Craigslist for updating account Craigslist password</h2>
                    I tried to log in to my Craigslist account and was told I needed to reset my password. &nbsp;I went through it by putting my account email and Craigslist replies that it sent a verification link to my account on file (my hotmail account). &nbsp;I have repeated this
 a few times, checked my junk folder, checked the blocked sender list and I still do not receive the verification link from Craigslist.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you get the best answer to your concern, we suggest that you contact Craigslist's customer support as this matter is best handled by their level of expertise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you may also try checking if you can received emails from other email recipients. If you are able to receive other emails except from Craigslist's, it could be possible that the issue is with their website server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

            <p>Hi Jeraldine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;The email from craigslist is getting blocked by a microsoft server. &nbsp;Its a problem other hotmail users are facing as well. &nbsp;The craigslist domain is not on my blocked senders list nor is there a rule set up to delete it. &nbsp;Any other
 suggestions?</p>

 it. I&nbsp;also reinstalled the program and the problem still persist. Kindly assist me in resolving this issue.</p>

OCR- FreeOCR
<p><span>Take a look at this article about a free open source OCR tool call FreeOCR V3:
<a href="http://www.worldstart.com/tips/tips-pr.php/7225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.worldstart.com/tips/tips-pr.php/7225</a></span></p>
<p><span>I've only played with it for a few minutes, but for the most part I like what it does.</span></p>
<p><span>It is a fairly simple OCR program compared to many. It extracts text. It doesn't worry about formatting or graphics, just extracts text only. 1 page at a time. It works better if you select blocks around graphics.</span></p>
<p><span>It is slow, but accurate when you keep it away from graphical elements.</span></p>

                    <p>I can not get Outlook 2010 to add an Office 365 Exchange account.&nbsp; During the add process, it goes through the autodiscovery process, finds the account and the prompts for credentials.&nbsp; I can not get pass this point.&nbsp; The credential as good as they work
 opening the account at <a href="http://mail.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.office365.com</a>.&nbsp; This happens on XP, Vista and Windows 7 platforms.&nbsp; I was told to install the MS Sign-in Assistant.&nbsp; I did that but don't see that it has done anything.&nbsp; There are no
 errors posted just a constant request for credentials.&nbsp; The account will add fine with Outlook 2013 but that is not what this client has installed.</p>

    <title>Error preparing to share contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank cheeseman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error preparing to share contacts</h2>
                    
<p>My manager cannot share her calendar or contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a pretty lengthy 'preparing to share' wait, followed by "Error while preparing to send sharing message".&nbsp; She had previously shared her contacts with me, and I still have access to them, but she cannot share them with anyone new, nor can she share
 her calendar (with me or anyone else).</p>
<p>It seems to be specific to her OL2010/W7-32 install, since we're all on the same exchange server, and I can still share my contacts/calendar.&nbsp; (I access the server from OL2010 on two different W7-64 computers (laptop &amp; office) with no wrinkles)</p>
<p>Clever clues suggestions or references?</p>
<p>Thxmuch,</p>
<p>F/C</p>

    <title>Accepting&#47;Rejecting Tracked Changes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Accepting&#47;Rejecting Tracked Changes</h2>
                    I want to share and track changes in an excel file. Can I designate different users that are allowed to accept/reject those changes or can that only be done by the owner or person who turns on track changes? If I can designate users, how?

<div>Hi C ,</div>
<div><br />
<div>In your shared workbook, you can choose to accept or reject changes by one or more users,</div>
<div><br />
<div>For detailed information, see the MS Office support page "Track changes in a shared workbook":</div>

            Thank you for your reply, Norman.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I have read through everything I could find from Microsoft on tracking changes and I saw how you can accept and reject changes from different users. What I cannot figure out is who all is actually allowed to do the accepting and rejecting. Can I define
 certain users that are allowed to accept or reject other users changes?</div>

            Hi C,
<div><br />
<div>I have only used shared my workbooks with a single other user, and any changes were approved by me. In general, I avoid using shared workbooks because of the onerous list of unavailable features - not least the use of macros.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I do not know if, in a multi-user scenario, some users (other than the 'owner') can accept or reject changes by third parties.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Doubtless, however, an inveterate user of tracked changes will enlighten you - and me!</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>===</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Norman</div>

            I'm assuming from the lack of information out there, many people feel the same way you do about this Excel function. Thank you for your help!&nbsp;
