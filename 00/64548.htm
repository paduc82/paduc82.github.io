<h2>            Service registration is missing or corrupt</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I got some problem upon updating windows server 2003. Updates returns an error "0x8024402f". Running Microsoft "Fix it" application. It reported and error "Service registration is missing or corrupt".<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what causing this issue and what would be the solutions? <br />
<br />
Thank you so much everyone!<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,&nbsp; <br />

<p>
</p><p>For insurance purposes I need to find out if my Surface Pro 2 (<em>***deleted personally identifiable information***</em>) is less than three years old. &nbsp;If it is then I get a brand new replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find out when this device was manufactured or sold?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Turhan</p>

<h3> annaforbes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Help Rip Off&#33;</h2>
                    Totally fed up with Microsoft: &nbsp;Skype suddenly stopped working mid December 2013, after Windows 7 Updates. Also, IE 11 will not connect, so have had to reverted to IE 10, where I am informed that this is not compatible with Skype 6, which is the only version
 I can find to download - no option to reload&nbsp;previous&nbsp;versions, which worked well. &nbsp;Checked out Microsoft Help re Internet Explorer problem &amp; was recommended to a FixIt website download, for which I am expected to pay! &nbsp;This has happened a few times with Windows
 software repair program recommendations. &nbsp;THIS IS NOT ON MICROSOFT, SUPPLY YOUR USERS WITH FREE SOFTWARE TO FIX PROBLEMS WHICH YOUR UPDATES HAVE CREATED! &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried System Restore options, where everything was working well but after attempting to restore, I am told that nothing was changed. &nbsp;Even my own entered Restore Points, have disappeared. &nbsp;Enough is enough. &nbsp;Microsoft, stop relying upon your users
 to suggest ways to fix problems, get off your butts and provide professional, free, assistance. &nbsp;You do not even track the legitimacy of your Community Members, some of whom have even asked me to open my PC for them to try to help! &nbsp; That is a total NO-NO.&nbsp;</div>

            Totally agree. Same thing happened to me after Microsoft Updates kept returning every time I switched off the computer. No updates were installed and the computer switched off as normal but it is annoying to see this message at switch-off. Microsoft suggest
 using FixIt after analysing the computer and reporting it had 104 problems(not affecting performance) it offered to fix them if I paid for the software! Thought we paid excessive amounts for Microsoft software so that we could expect support. Looks like Apple
 is the only answer where even though the hardware is overpriced they do provide excellent support(so friends and family tell me!).

            <p>Thats odd? <em>(And possibly worrying, maybe mine is going to "go south" after its next Skype update?)</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have Skype 6.11.73.102 <em>( fully updated on my system as far as I'm aware )</em> and IE10
<em>( not that I use IE, tend to use Opera or maybe Firefox as my browser )</em> but it seems to run OK? No compatibility warnings. But the latest download does appear to be 6.13.0.14, so maybe Ive not got the latest? Its weird though, as when I check for updates
 it tells me I have the latest version.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What was the fixit site? I thought the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/fixit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I agree about changing to Apple Mac - maybe more expensive initially, but will be cheaper in the long run. &nbsp;There are some really good 2nd hand Apple Mac Pro's available. &nbsp;Hopefully, you will be able to uninstall that FixIt 'con.'? &nbsp;I cannot uninstall
 Uniblue SpeedUpMyPC (recommended by Microsoft,) as I get the message:&nbsp;<font>"(x86)\Uniblue\SpeedUpMyPC\inins000.msg" is missing. Uniblue informs me that I should&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;the software in the hope that the 'missing'
 uninstall &nbsp;software works! &nbsp;My Kaspersky Anti-Virus does not like that program reporting that it is full of Malware.</font>

            Skype 6.13.0.14 is the only Skype download I can find to download from the official Skype website. &nbsp;I have read that Skype now depends upon IE having an association with Microsoft. &nbsp;This is when the problem started!! &nbsp;Many other Community members are having
 the same problem, but none of the suggested fixes have worked for me. &nbsp;What version of Skype are you running on IE10 and are you working with Windows 7?
<div><br />
<div>Yes the program was recommended to download on the MS Help website. &nbsp;MS offers absolutely no free 'fixing problems' software, they just direct you to other companies, all of which demand money from us. &nbsp;Hence, I suspect that Microsoft takes a commission.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have got to the stage that I do not trust Microsoft Updates and suspect that they all have glitches causing problems in order that they can make more money than users have already paid.</div>

            <p>I'm running W7 <em>( 32bit starter on this PC, and 64bit Home Premium on my desktop )</em>. At the moment I can only access this Netbook and that is using IE10
<em>( when I run IE )</em> and has Skype at the version I mentioned above - &nbsp;6.11.73.102 - which when I check for updates within Skype it tells me is the latest version. But The other PC has IE10 and as far as I remember the same Skype.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>NOTE: As far as I can see, the system requirements for Skype don't seem to mention IE -

<p>Well, the fixit page I mentioned above ( click the link ) are MS Fixits and as far as I know all free. There are no Skype fixits, but there are some IE ones. I guess it depends on your exact problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are sites that provide old versions of Skype, such as <a href="http://www.skypehelp.com/skype-download/skype-on-your-computer/download-old-version-of-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p><u><strong><br />
</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>BUT</strong> I cannot recommend them or otherwise, as I have never had the need to try them. Sorry.
</u>And I'm not sure they would help anyway.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just out of interest, where does MS specifically recommend "Uniblue SpeedUpMyPC"? Just curious, I've never heard of it or tried it.

Current Skype version as of this morning is 6.13.0.104. Works perfectly well with IE 11, mainly because Skype for the desktop doesn't need IE at all.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is another version of&nbsp;Skype which&nbsp;does interact with IE because it is a plugin&nbsp;associated with the MS Outlook.com&nbsp;web email page. It basically adds Skype chat to your browser while you are using&nbsp;the Outlook web mail page.&nbsp;</p>

            As an individual, I could say that Microsoft provides the best software packages which no other company can integrate features of multiple apps along with performance. No other software can do this without a compromise on the hardware requirements and
 pricing.
<div><br />
<div>For example, there are many new competitive Operating Systems available in the market, which has evolved a long way, but struggling to compete with Microsoft products. By trying to copy features, RAM (memory) requirements and the pricing are on a vertical
 rise.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Being and individual and out of experience, I believe that I have the right to share my thoughts. If you go for another Operating System like Android or MAC, the operations will be limited to the design or there might be a huge price involved to purchase
 each and every software. MAC burns your budget for other than home use with no flexibility like MAC and Android is not a long lasting hardware with costly low quality hardware.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows brings all the convenience together. Free software, free troubleshooting information on Google results etc etc. Computer is slow? try Cleanup 4.5.2 and CCleaner. No need for an advanced or paid software as advanced softwares always deletes or corrupts
 System Files. Just run Cleanup 4.5.2 and Ccleaner simply and be happy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not marketting anything here, but providing helping hands and any forum admin can mail me, if you need my info. Deep Freeze is a software which can always keep your computer safe with a normal free anti-virus software installed. You should be talking
 to their tech support to understand the software before you buy it and you would appreciate my suggestion.</div>
<div><br />
Admin, please let me know if you are concerned about my genuinity.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, I have a suggestion to Microsoft. Like skype, if you are acquiring software companies or products, please do not link it to the Microsoft Services like Sky Drive and email services. It really slows down the app, creates problems and destroys customer's
 interests; especially when you link your email with Windows 8.1, it starts lagging. I know its done purposefully, where Facebook excels with lot more data than yours. Please stop limiting the performance as it proves that your products are not competitive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To see how much performance is limited purposefully, just download Everything search tool from the link below:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.voidtools.com/Everything-1.2.1.371.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.voidtools.com/Everything-1.2.1.371.zip</a></div>
<div>This tool can index the entire hard drive/hard drives in a minute and you can search with ease. I can say that these limits on performance is purposeful when freelancers build better software!!</div>

<p>I'm running W7 <em>( 32bit starter on this PC, and 64bit Home Premium on my desktop )</em>. At the moment I can only access this Netbook and that is using IE10

<p>NOTE: As far as I can see, the system requirements for Skype don't seem to mention IE -

<p>Well, the fixit page I mentioned above ( click the link ) are MS Fixits and as far as I know all free. There are no Skype fixits, but there are some IE ones. I guess it depends on your exact problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are sites that provide old versions of Skype, such as <a href="http://www.skypehelp.com/skype-download/skype-on-your-computer/download-old-version-of-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Just out of interest, where does MS specifically recommend "Uniblue SpeedUpMyPC"? Just curious, I've never heard of it or tried it.

<p>Curious about all this I tried the update link within the Skype version I had as of this morning and it did not detect any updates. IRC it was an even earlier version than yours.&nbsp;On the Skype&nbsp;download page however there was an updated version available,
 several version numbers newer. There is also an&nbsp;Outlook.com IE browser plugin for Skype available.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WRT to Uniblue, I'd never heard of it either nor seen any reference to it on an MS site but according to the link below several computer OEMs pre-install it on their PCs.</p>

                    <p>As the title says, stereo mix only works with speakers, but not with my headphones or any other device when I plug them into the 3.5 mm jack normally on the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 now, and had the same problem when I was still on Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>Hi Arlene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things we can do here. First, can you tell me what kind of computer it is (make and model)? Second, can you get me the Device ID for your audio hardware? Instructions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Go to Sound, video and game controllers</p>
<p>3. Double-click your audio device</p>
<p>4. Go to the Details tab</p>
<p>5. Select Hardware IDs</p>
<p>6. Right-click to copy them and then paste them in a reply here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> wryter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my screen &#34;fuzzy&#34; when running Quicken and OpenOffice&#63;</h2>
                    I'm stumped. Whenever I try using either OpenOffice or Quicken, my computer screen is slightly out of focus. Everything else on the computer comes in nice and clear. But typed pages and Quicken registers are just a big "fuzzy." As I type this the screen
 is sharp.<br />
<br />
Running Win7 home premium 64 bit on a Pentium dual core processor with 4 gb RAM and screen resolution set to 1366 x 768 on a 16-inch screen. Using new Asus K60 computer. Might there be a problem with using Quicken/OpenOffice 32 bit programs with the Win7 64
 bit??? They're listed as "compatible."<br />
<br />
This is driving me nuts! If anybody has an answer, PLEASE post it.

<div>It looks like you are unable to connect to internet through the Netgear router connected to the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perhaps, the computer is not connected to Internet though the Wireless router.</div>

            Hi,<br />
This is a common problem with Windows Vista, I can help you fix this problem, all I'd like to know is that what is the wireless adapter that you have installed on your computer, I mean I know that it is Atheros, but I want you to tell me, if it is
<span><em>Atheros</em> AR5007 or </span><span><em>Atheros</em> AR5007EG. And I'd also like to know if the operating system is 32 bit or 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards<br />

                    The question may seem silly but I have been zipping folders fine until today. When right clicking on a file, I go down to send to and the only options it is giving me is burning to dvd. Then I clicked on the file and then clicked share to approach it that
 way but the zip was grayed out. what do I do now?

<h2>            Verizon Fios g1100 router and 2 XBOXone consoles, OPEN NAT&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>i have 2 xbox ones with a verizon fios g1100 router, im trying to get open nat on both consoles so i can play advanced warfare on both in the same lobby</p>
<p>both xboxones in settings/ network/ say nat type: open, but on the advanced warfare screen (what ever xboxone turns on first) says open and the other one says moderate (both xboxones at one point have said open just not at the same time)</p>
<p>i call verizon and they say i need to call microsoft when i speak to microsoft they say i need to call verizon so i can open ports, but verzion then says you can only open a port on one ip, two ip address can not share the same ports at the same time, and
 there is no DMZ setting in the router settings page</p>
<p>hopefully someone has figured this out, pretty frustrating &gt;&lt; lol</p>

<p>I'm in a similar situation now i haven't tried this but on the activision website it says to port forward port 3074 on one and 3075/3076 on other consoles if you have more system.</p>
<p>I reccomend using just ports 3075 and 3076 because 3074 is also used by xbox live its not just a game port</p>
<p>I have many systems so i miss being able to put them in dmz having to either port forward or play with moderate nat sucks</p>

<p>To open your NAT you will have to call your IPS to have them open these listed ports;
</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP)</p>

<p>Have you tried playing in the same lobby? If it shows any errors what are they? Both of your Xbox One's should work fine with multiplayer lobbies due to your NAT types.

<p>Because one is moderate and the other is open, &nbsp;the majority of the time one won't connect, and if by chance it does one can't hear anyone then when you go to jump in a game one will completely disconnect.I bought to Xbox so we can both play at the same
 time like we did on our 360s and now it's almost 3 years later and the same issue</p>

            <p>xbox support should be able to walk you through the set up. i know its been a few years but i just got the same device today and trying to figure it out. but i believe it would need to be put in bridge mode and use your own router. once it bridge mode it will be just a modem no routing function, so until the new router is set up you will not have wifi.   it has been about 5 years since i did support for xbox but back then we told people to buy the dlink dir655 router. it was proven to work with multiple consoles. but since then the xbox one has came out and not sure if that is still true. if you call they should have a list of routers that will work. hope this helps.  </p>

            Hi AfthaafAhamed ,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Lucia. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />Find out your Windows activation key without programs
<br />To know the activation key of Windows without any program you must follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the start menu and type " regedit ", right click on the search result and select the option " run as administrator ".
<br />windows regedit
<br />
<br />After opening the registry editor, open the path: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt; SOFTWARE&gt; Microsoft&gt; Windows NT&gt; CurrentVersion&gt; SoftwareProtectionPlatform
<br />
<br />After clicking on SoftwareProtectionPlatform look for the entry BackupProductKeyDefault and the value that appears as a third party in the list is your Windows activation key.
<br />
<br />The key has a format of five groups of five characters each . It looks something like this: TG59Ñ-W3M1G-FGBSX-4YWX6-6F2CY.
<br />
<br />activation key windows
<br />
<br />It is important not to modify any field in the registry editor , since this would cause consequences in the operation of the system.
<br />-------------------
<br />After this, try to activate Windows with the following commands
<br />Open the CMD command console with administrator privileges
<br />Type the following commands:
<br />slmgr.vbs -ipk XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
<br />slmgr.vbs -ato
<br />
<br />Let me know if it helped
<br />Regards

<h2>            using laplink</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use laplink to transfer files from my old XP PC, but even though I have it on both P's (one is Win 10, the other is XP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had it running for a couple of hours now, but nothing seems to be happening</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have connected it through my router, as I don't have a laplink cable (this was the best option I was told)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long does it take to transfer anything ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also how do I find 'My Computer' on this Win 10 desktop ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to find my favourites or at least transfer them from my old PC to the new Win 10 one</p>

<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            debug&#58; &#34;insufficient memory&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    Any idea why the command `debug kernel32.dll` displays an "insufficient memory" error?<br />
<br />
I don't believe it is the obvious:&nbsp; truly insufficient memory.&nbsp; kernel32.dll is less than 1MB, and I have more than 234MB in available memory according to Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Oh!&nbsp; But when I use the command `debug` (no file name), then use the debug command `n kernel32.dll`, there is no error.&nbsp; The debug command `d` seems to work insofar as there is no error and it displays some data.<br />
<br />
I suspect that I should be able to use the XA debug command before the n debug command.&nbsp; But XS debug command displays the message "EMS not installed".&nbsp; What's up with that?<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
I am using WinXP SP3.<br />
<br />
I execute the debug command in a cmd window opened by clicking Start, then Run.&nbsp; Then cd to \windows\system32.&nbsp; The command `dir kernel32.dll` works, verifying that I am in the correct current directory and the file exists.<br />

            i believe that advice from some Support Engineer who is engaged by Microsoft to run the disk cleanup tool is a wild goose chase and has nothing to do with this problem.&nbsp; It is a stupid idea.<br />
<br />
I will bet you 100,000 pounds sterling (that is 2,030,254 pesos to me) that the Support Engineer has no idea what the problem is or how to resolve it.&nbsp; They post merely to get credits for posting.<br />
<br />
It is simply the Support Engineer effort to post a reply with a link to a KB article (any KB article will do).&nbsp; Might as well post safe mode, clean boot and sfc /scannow in there as well.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to make sense, it doesn't have to work, it will not help, but it is a reply with a link to a KB article - and that is what is important for them.&nbsp; Somehow it must keep them in their job.<br />
<br />
Get to a command prompt and enter:<br />
<br />
debug kernel32.dll<br />
<br />
You will see the message the OP is reporting.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Do you want a lesson on how to use the debugger and how are you going to debug a fundamental XP DLL (unless you wrote it).<br />
<br />
Follow the Support Engineer advice to run disk cleanup and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
It will not help because it has nothing to do with anything - it is just a reply with a link to a KB article to get them credits.<br />
<br />
I have already calculated and proven that Support Engineer "Answer" advice is 99.64% wrong and useless.&nbsp; They get by with sheer dumb luck the other 00.36% of the time.<br />
<br />
Those are very bad numbers.&nbsp; But, they are engaged by Microsoft (on purpose apparently).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I think I would rather engage somebody that actually has a clue.<br />
<br />
Folks like you and I must take up the slack for their incompetence.<br />

<p>Why waste your time commenting on Microsoft Support Engineer posts?</p>
<p>Why waste so much time making pointless calculations like this "I have already calculated and proven that Support Engineer "Answer" advice is 99.64% wrong". What have you achieved?</p>
<p>Why make dumb childish&nbsp;invitations like&nbsp; "I will bet you 100,000 pounds sterling (that is 2,030,254 pesos to me)" which will never get taken up and only serve to make your lengthy posts even longer.</p>
<p>Why not address the question ? The answer may be:</p>
<p>Because it may take time to download symbol files, keep in mind that the debugger may appear to stop responding (hang) the first time that you debug an application. This occurs because most of the symbol files for the system DLLs (such as Ntdll.dll, Kernel32.dll,
 and others) must be downloaded. <br />

<p>Another comment&nbsp;might be that insufficient memory reports can be generated&nbsp;by setting the computer an enormous task which it is not equiped to&nbsp;undertake. Circular tasks can be another cause.</p>

                    <p>"RESOLVED WITH UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently got the Surface 3 and I can't seem to get the onscreen keyboard to prompt within bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously got this to work on the surface pro 3 by enabling "Enable use of Bitlocker authentication requiring preboot keyboard input on slates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and on pro 3's it would have a small keyboard icon which I can click to expand a keyboard but when I have done the same thing on surface 3 the keyboard icon does not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have enabled the exact same gpedit settings as my surface pro 3 but the onscreen keyboard does not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done every Windows update available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>looking at other forums they only apply to surface pro 3 and none to surface 3. asking to enable the settings mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help&nbsp;would be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks </p>

            <p>I wonder if it is not enabled&nbsp;in the consumer version or the&nbsp;UEFI firmware. Maybe you need this to enable it.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/surface/archive/2015/05/11/new-surface-3-driver-available-to-enhance-mass-deployments.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/surface/archive/2015/05/11/new-surface-3-driver-available-to-enhance-mass-deployments.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a firmware update and driver pack&nbsp;that is intended for business systems. It mentions that the firmware part of this enables "&nbsp;new and enhanced features including those expected in a larger-scale commercial environment such as enhanced PXE booting and
 support for asset tagging", but it says nothing about&nbsp;the preboot keyboard. however&nbsp;it makes sense to me that this would be part of that pack because most consumers would not using a TPM and pin with&nbsp;bitlocker and would not need this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look through the download centre and in the description it doesn't seem to mention suface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I attempted to download it I was prompt that it will only download on surface pro 3's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in conversation with tech support on Microsoft but I believe it may be a more complex issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully there may be a windows update which will be released soon amend this.</p>

            <p>Indeed the onscreen keyboard is missing.</p>
<p>But actually Microsoft recommends disabling Bitlocker PIN for slate devices, like Surface 3:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<p>So you might consider simply disabling it.</p>

<p>I am dealing with the same issue in our network, although we had to disable the group policy you mentioned in order for the onscreen keyboard to appear on a Surface Pro 3. Our issue is when we boot up "in the dock" the onscreen keyboard does not show up
 (out of the dock it shows up). Have you made any progress on this? Perhaps my info will help you.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Disconnection Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendubillac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Disconnection Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there!<br />
<br />
I'm looking for some advice, I guess. I've been having some disconnection issues for the past 3 weeks. Went through two new modems, and two technicians with my ISP, and I'm still at square one.
<br />
<br />
I'm with CenturyLink and I have an ActionTec PK5001A modem and I've been experiencing what I've been calling "hiccups". My DSL light doesn't go out, nothing changes on the modem.. it seems like there's just a quick enough disconnection in service that it disconnects
 my Xbox One from Xbox Live. It should be noted that I have two Xbox Ones, my husband and I play side by side and we don't always disconnect at the same time, sometimes it's him, sometimes it's me and I guess I'm at a loss.<br />
<br />
My ISP sent a new modem, fixed some wires outside (have yet to check the wires inside - the third tech guy never showed up) but after a ton of poking at prodding, one of our Xbox's seemed to be working seamlessly when we opened a port directly to it using port
 3074 so I'm waiting to call before I yell at them because I'm thinking it might be the modem but I'm not sure? I'm not too tech savvy and it might have just been a coincidence. The problem being I couldn't test it with both Xbox's. I don't know if it doesn't
 support multiple devices for port forwarding or what? <br />
<br />
I guess I'm just looking for some advice on what direction to go in next, if anyone has had any experience with this problem. Can it be solved with a router, do I just need a new modem? Or do I need to keep yelling at my ISP? Or is it possibly both my Xboxs?<br />
<br />
Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>So I thought I would come back around and answer this in case anybody else runs into this since my solution was a little bit drastic....</p>
<p>It was my ISP. We went through new modems, routers, and everything. They created networks, lowered speeds, moved my speeds back up. Port forwarding failed, DMZ hosting failed. Everything I could possibly think of.. Nothing was working. In those terms, I
 still don't know what the problem was. I want to believe it was the wiring under our house. But they insisted everything looked fine on their part, wouldn't check the in-house wiring and we got to the point where there was no longer anything they could do
 for me so I switched ISPs.</p>
<p>I'm now on xfinity with a cable modem instead of DSL and much higher speeds (went from 7mbps to 50mbps and we even have an open NAT!) and I've had no problems since then. The woes of small town internet.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to everybody for your help! </p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an Gateway NE56R41u with Windows 10.At first my computer would boot up in a couple of&nbsp;seconds.&nbsp;Just over the past month and a half I have notice the really slow boot. It will take 15-20 minutes just for the computer to go from a black screen to the

            <p>Note that unless you save all important stuff, it may be lost after the reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer has been supplied with a recovery partition in place of disks..</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</font></span></p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up..
</p>
<p>For Fujitsu,<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ress the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</span></font></p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to
 contact the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks for the model.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"><font> all</font></span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus
 solution. ONLY AFTER you have done this should you replace stuff from backups or install anything else.</p>
