            "Telstra modem" is far too vague.&nbsp; Please supply the exact model.<br />
<br />
Didn't your product come with a <a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01990945.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Setup Guide</a> and <a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01991120.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Getting Started</a> manual? Are you having a specific problem?<br />
<br />
The fax component of your HP 4500 needs to connect to an ordinary telephone line (not an Internet telephone).&nbsp; Because you have a telephone with answering device, you'll probably want to purchase a fax switch so that your answering machine doesn't pick up incoming
 fax calls and vice versa.&nbsp; There are several different types of these devices, so you'll have to do a bit of research.&nbsp; If your telephone company offers "distinctive ring" service (two phone numbers on a single physical line), you can configure the fax machine
 to detect such a ring pattern.&nbsp; Otherwise, you'll have to <a href="http://faxswitch.com/auto_fax_switch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
find a device that automatically answers and switches to the fax if it detects fax negotiation tones</a>. Or order a second telephone line.<br />
<br />
The printer (and scanner) parts of your HP 4500 can be connected to your computer either using a USB cable or -- if your "router" is also a modem -- by using an Ethernet network cable.&nbsp; If you elect to start with a USB connection, be sure to install the software
 from the accompanying CD <span style="font-weight: bold">before</span> you connect the USB cable.<br />

    <title>gold to silver account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            gold to silver account</h2>
                    
<p>I had a problem with 620 points disappearing from my account. I checked my history, and they had not been deducted for anything, they just disappeared.</p>
<p>they were not from the site rewards system so they did not lapse/expire.</p>
<p>I did not receive help for this, just a snotty reply to check my account history.</p>
<p>I decided to let my gold membership lapse to silver. turns out you can't do that.</p>
<p>you people are holding my account hostage until I give you payment information.</p>
<p>I have to go thru more hassle to change it back to silver. I have to go to My Account to change.</p>
<p>so I went to My Account, except that I couldn't. you have a 'glitch'&nbsp;&nbsp; so that I can't do anything.</p>
<p>such a surprise that i'm not paying for this mess anymore.</p>
<p>kindly switch my account to Silver, which is what should have been done with out giving me more problems than you already have.</p>

<p>I agree Bobimus, since I have to call Microsoft's customer service to switch from a gold to silver subscription rather than have the option to switch over online I won't bother. I don't want some Microsoft representative trying to convince me to stick with
 the worthless gold plan; I believe that's the only reason they make you call in. I'll spend my money on my Nintendo and Sony consoles that don't nickle and dime petty things such as an internet connection.

<p>Great. I was hoping I was just terrible at messing with this mess. But it looks like Xbox is just extorting my poverty as well. And for all the people acting like they just had a revelation with, "Call customer support! =D"... And if I don't have a working
 phone? Which is the case here...? Then what... How do I switch to Silver. I had originally planned to switch to Silver temporarily, then pay for Gold again when my funds allowed it... But after being *** by the company that (Don Mattrick) has proved time and
 time again that their pockets and bottom line is ALL they care about, Microsoft has just lost a 6 year Xbox LIVE customer. Not that this actually matters to them. They don't care about 1 less customer, or the customers at all. It's apparent in their blatant
 extortion and shoddy online customer service... Oh yes. I went there to. Online to be passed around to people who "couldn't" help me. It's simple Microsoft. SWITCH MY FRIGGIN ACCOUNT TO SILVER! PERIOD! DO IT! Because you WILL NOT get a dime out of me until
 you do. And if it isn't soon, I'll just say forget it.</p>

<p>Just turn off auto renew Ghostmajic, and your account will revert to silver when the current sub runs out.</p>
<p>If you want instant cancellation, you have to call support.</p>
<p>Cancelling your sub mid term will not get you a refund on remaining time, but you will lose all gold access.</p>

<p>@THEOWENKILLER Again. I don't have phone service right now. I can't call anyone... Part of the financial crunch that has taken away my funds for XBL Gold. And I also can't access my account to turn it off myself, as they have decided to essentially hold
 my account ransom.</p>

<h2>            Question on using a Credit card to buy Microsoft points.</h2>
                    
<p>Are you charged the second you buy the points? If so, Can I remove the credit card info from my account right after I buy the points with no worries? (I don't want that info on my account)<br />
<br />
Second, I bought 800 MSP to buy Fortress Craft, can you guys recommend any other good Indie Games?</p>

<p>The problem was solved by itself. Wine was the provider.</p>
<p>1) I was not the provider of the "White IP", but only "gray"</p>
<p>2) Do ISP ports were closed, and the main port of 3042.</p>
<p>In general disconnected from your ISP and entered into a contract with another, it worked.</p>

            <p>Hi Folks -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workaround for this issue is to save your photo attachments locally (anyplace
<em>except</em> the %temp% directory should suffice). If you are using Windows Live Mail, you would open the email, right-click on one of the attached image files, and choose "Save all."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can then launch Photo Gallery and navigate to the folder to view the slideshow, or you can load the assets directly into a project in Movie Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if this resolves your issue?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>-Kristen Miller</p>

<p><br />
Did you restart your machine and see it may be uninstall on <strong>Reboot</strong> ?</p>
<p>Or try to reinstall the Application and then uninstall it!</p>
<p><br />
Instruction on how to remove it:</p>
<p>http://www.weather.com/services/desktop_install_faq.html#13<br />
</p>
<p>13. How do I remove Desktop weather from my desktop?<br />
<br />
To remove or uninstall Desktop Weather from your computer, click on "Start" - "Programs" - "The Weather Channel" - "Desktop Weather". Then click on the Uninstall program. Follow the prompts to remove Desktop Weather.<br />
<br />
You may also remove the application by clicking on "Start", followed by "Settings", then "Control Panel." Then click on "Add/Remove Programs." From the list, select "The Weather Channel," and then click on "Add/Remove." Follow the prompts to uninstall the application.<br />
<br />
To remove Weather Services from your PC, you click on "Start" - "Settings" - "Control Panel". Double click on the "Desktop Weather" weather services icon, then click on the "Uninstall Weather Services" button. This should remove any remaining elements from
 your system. <br />
<br />
14. I seem to be unable to uninstall Desktop Weather from my computer. What can I do?<br />
<br />
This is a known issue with the product, and will be resolved in a forthcoming release. Copying the UNWISE.EXE from the Framework folder to the Desktop Weather folder will resolve this issue. The steps are as followed:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Go to Start, Programs, Accessories, Windows Explorer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the left scroll window of Windows Explorer click the + next to My Computer, then click on the + next to C: drive to expand the view.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Scroll down that menu until you find the Program Files Folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Double click on the Program Files folder to expand the view.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Scroll down that menu to The Weather Channel FW folder and double click on it to expand the view.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Double click on the Framework folder to display the contents.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Right mouse click on the icon that says "<strong>UNWISE.EXE</strong> " on the pop-up menu click on COPY.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Go to the tool bar on the window and click the Back button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. In that window right mouse click on the "Desktop Weather" folder and in the pop-up menu click on PASTE.<br />
<br />
From that point you will be able to proceed as normal with the uninstall. <br />
<br />
Download CCleaner - Portable and run a clean up ( you can use the back up for the registry to be safe then you can delete safely after all okay:<br />

<h3> choisammy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade motherboard without reinstallation of windows &#40;prepare to pay a new transferable licence&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Currently using a Pentium Core 2 6320 with Gigabye 946GMXS2 motherboard. &nbsp;Would like to upgrade to a faster machine with i series processor. Currently using OEM version of Windows XP professtional. The computer is installed with an application software which
 can also run in Windows 7 but no installation disk (previously installed via internet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to upgrade without reinstallation of Windows XP to a new motherboard and processor using the same SATA harddrive. I am prepared to pay for a new licence for fully transferable Windows XP and renew the Windows XP OS before upgrade to new motherboard.
 &nbsp;I am also planned to upgrade to Windows 7 and prepare to pay a new licence. &nbsp;The application software has a new version and will cost us thousands of dollars but the old version is good enough for our current requirement.</p>

            <p>Microsoft takes the position that an OEM-licensed operating system is tied to the computer on which it is first installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft also takes the position that a new motherboard equals a new computer, unless the new mobo is essentially an exact replacement of the old one because of a defect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you basically swapped the drive into a new computer, you would have to do a repair install of XP (at the least) so that the new hardware would be recognized ... and Windows would then fail to activate because of the OEM license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, if you wanted to keep XP (which you probably know will be unsupported as of April 8, 2014), you would have to find and buy another genuine copy of it to install.&nbsp; These are getting quite difficult to find and counterfeits abound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your intent to upgrade your hardware, your best course of action is to purchase a machine with Windows 7 pre-installed.&nbsp; These, too, are getting hard to find, but they are not nearly as scarce as XP.&nbsp; Just for example, see --&gt;

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yes it can, and here how.</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has three types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Since you have a Network with Win 7 and other version of Windows you need to configure Win 7 as Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>If needed check specifically the <strong>Permission/Security </strong>settings.</p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>

<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>

            A business network most times will include what is called a Domain, which means you might need to have Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate. If your using a Workgroup setup at your work place, you should be able to join the network by finding out your Company's
 workgroup name.

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade stuck at 99&#37;, crash on welcome screen.</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've just updated my windows 7 to windows 10 yesterday using the auto updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all run smoothly until the installation stucked at 99%. I left it overnight, in the morning it's still 99%. So i left it on an went to work. After back from work, it's still 99%. A total roughly around 15 hours long left idle, yet still doesn't work. The
 loading icon is looping, but i can't do anything. So i forcefully power off my system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i boot it, the welcome screen appear in a low-resolution ratio. The moment i press Next, it freezes. Tried &nbsp;wait it for several minutes, nothing happen, i still can move around my mouse though. When i click anywhere on the screen, loading icon appear.
 Another click makes the whole screen brighter (just like clicking unresponsive program) and right after that it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have no idea what happen, and really upset with this upgrade. The only screen i can go is the bios mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system spec:</p>
<p>i5-4460 cpu@ 3.20 ghz</p>
<p>motherboard: msi b85m-e45</p>
<p>graphic: msi geforce gtx 970</p>
<p>ram: 8gb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone could help me..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ritchie</p>

What if you have a desk top? Have no option to access on-screen keyboard.

            <p>Tried doing this and still got the same result. This seems to be an ongoing problem with a growing population of people updating from windows 7 and it is kind of starting to make me mad that windows 10 is having this kind of problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 does not come for free; you have to buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer sells Windows 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was that free offer years ago; long expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(78, 176, 233, 1)">How does the Windows 7 Upgrade Option work?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Windows 7 Upgrade Option is available through participating PC manufacturers on selected PCs and through Microsoft on qualifying purchases of the Windows Vista packaged product. The Windows 7 Upgrade Option applies to Windows
 Vista Home Premium, Business, and Ultimate editions. Your Windows 7 upgrade will be to the comparable version: so you'll get either Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional (the upgrade to Windows Vista Business), or Windows 7 Ultimate, respectively.
 The Windows 7 Upgrade Option program runs from June 26, 2009 <strong>through January 31, 2010.</strong> Some Manufacturers may choose to shorten the Upgrade Option time frame.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the "Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"</p>

<p>
</p><p>Check to see if your System Specifications are compatible for Windows 7:</p>

            Hello. Typically this error indicates that the drivers for your GPU needs to be updated. This can usually be done by visiting your GPU manufacturer's website to download the latest drivers

            If you look in Device manager you can see the brand name of the GPU. For example Nvidia is a possible brand.<br /><br />Also, most PC manufacturers will have these drivers on their websites as well.

<h2>            Chinese Handwriting and speech option missing in Windows 10 pro 1709</h2>
                    In installing Chinese language input , I used to click on the language setting add language button, then the option button and it would display language, handwriting, and speech icon for me to download these packages. But in the 1709 version, the handwriitng,
 speech buttons are missing.&nbsp; I think there is a way to download these packages from MS to enable Chinese handwriting features in Win 10. Can anyone help?&nbsp; I have English, Chinese enabled in the language bar, and I also get the touch keyboard display, but no
 handwriting！

    <title>Skype cuts phone call off at one minute - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coffey09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype cuts phone call off at one minute</h2>
                    Running Skype 4.1 and windows 7.&nbsp; I'm in the army over in Afghanistan and have a very low bandwidth&nbsp; only 50 kbps.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Every time i call on skype it ends the phone call around 1 minute., the sound quality is great but it constantly hangs up.<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;video chats end around 30 seconds without the video even having a chance to load up.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or ideas,&nbsp; i read somewhere that windows disconnects the internet on one minute intervals to search for a better connection.&nbsp; maybe this is why??<br />
<br />
Any help would be great, i'm trying to get back in contact with some people in the states.<br />
<br />
Thanks

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/519ad102-45d6-4754-b677-0887369fe0c0" title="Mr0cznyKisiel">

</p><p>Thank you for the information confirming you can sign in to Xbox and Microsoft websites with this same account. With this information let's try troubleshooting the console. I recommend re-installing the current console system update.</p>
<p>To reinstall the latest Xbox 360 update, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the system cache. To do this, see the "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console/system-update-help#S3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Clear the system cache</span></a>" support article.</li><li>Roll back and then reinstall system updates. To do this:
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Guide</strong>&nbsp;button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on your controller. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>. </li><li>Enter the following button sequence:<strong>&nbsp;X</strong>,<strong> LB</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;RB</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>X</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>LB</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>RB</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;X</strong>.
</li><li>Select the option to roll back all system updates that are installed. The console will restart automatically and then download the updates again.</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try that out and let us know the results!</p>

<p>So i actually did both what you said, and PalmettoBling.</p>
<p>I cleared the cache, did the sequence in the storage menu, reinstalled the update, then tried to download my profile i used the app password (i had to turn on two step-verification) and the problem is still there.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/519ad102-45d6-4754-b677-0887369fe0c0" title="Mr0cznyKisiel">Mr0cznyKisiel</a><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for keeping us updated with your replies. Sounds as if you've done quite a bit of troubleshooting so far to attempt to get your profile signed in/downloaded to your 360 console but are still having an issue. This may sound a bit strange,
 but does your password for your profile happened to contain 16+ characters? If so, then this may be the problem. For some reason, you must have no more than 15 characters in your password for it to be recognized on an Xbox 360.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/change-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
changing/updating your password for your profile</a> once more and ensure that it has no more than 15 characters, then attempt to download the profile again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope that this helps a bit more and please let us know if this helps out.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Well guess what?</p>
<p>Nothing, literally nothing.</p>
<p>My password has exactly 10 characters, it contains of only small letters and numbers</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I may have an idea why this isnt working. Is there some kind of restriction about how many xbox live profiles can be on one console? I have two alredy. One of them is my old, that i dont have acces to (it was the first one on the console, i also remember
 that i dont have two step verification there, so i have no way of logging into it) and the second one is my friend's.</p>
<p>Can this be the case?<br />

            I have skype number that forward to my mobile phone in Australia.&nbsp; I have changed the selection from forward to voice message and nothing happens.&nbsp; I played around with all options.&nbsp; I have it presently set to 1 second on forwarding calls and that seems
 to work for calls but no way to get voice mail.
