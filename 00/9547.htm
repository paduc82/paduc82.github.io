<h2>            Contact &#34;People&#34; page is temporarily unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Just recently my account is not showing any contacts or contact information.&nbsp; When accessing the "people" page all that comes up is "This page is temporarily unavailable" and "We're sorry, there is a problem showing this page.&nbsp; We experienced some technical
 difficulties retrieving the content."</p>
<p>I am hoping that all my contacts are there, but I can't access them and they are not showing up on the left of the screen when I start a new email.</p>

</p><p>I'm having the exact same problem. It just started today and I cannot access my "People" contact list nor do I see any contacts showing in the left pane when starting a new message.

</p><p>OK, replying to my own query, hoping this may help someone else...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the solution. In my case, I had been cleaning some cookies in my browser (Firefox 33.1.1) and in this process of cleaning I also decided to put several of them in the "Block" list. Well, I know now that two of them should not have been blocked.
 They are "<em>people.live.com</em>" and also <em>"people.directory.live.com</em>".</p>
<p>As soon as I removed these two cookies from the blocked list, my contact list showed up as well as that smaller list on the left pane when you start a new message.</p>
<p>I tested it by re-blocking re-unblocking them a couple of times and the result is always the same: You block them, you can't see your contacts...</p>
<p>Now, for a comment to the engineers at Microsoft/Outlook, I would leave this suggestion: Why on earth is it not possible to create a more friendly, useful error-message than the one you provide which, actually, may be applicable to anything you can think
 of... Stating that:&nbsp; </p>
<p><span><em><strong>"This page is temporarily unavailable</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>We're sorry, there was a problem showing this page. We experienced some technical difficulties retrieving the content."</strong></em></span></p>
<p>What "technical difficulties" are you talking about when the cause is a cookie that has been blocked by the user?...
</p>
<p>Well, if my solution ends up helping just one other user, my coming back was more than worth it...</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I found out what's causing this problem.<br />
Apparently the connections that are added between Hotmail and other sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin are creates a strain on the contacts database. You have to remove those connections for thing to go back to normal.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have just bought a new computer with Microsoft Outlook.com installed, and am keen to use it as reports give it a glowing account.</p>
<p>However I am dismayed to find that after trying for 2 days, I still find error HTTP 404 when I try to get my contacts.</p>
<p>I hope this can be corrected asap.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with Outlook.com. I understand the frustration when things don’t work the way it should.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What is the Browser you are trying to work on?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The <strong>404</strong> or <strong>
Not Found</strong> error message is an HTTP standard response code indicating that the client was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The web site hosting server will typically generate a "404 Not Found" web page when a user attempts to follow a broken or dead link; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors users can find
 on the web.</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Dhenz S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a similar problem.&nbsp; It has occurred on Firefox, IE and Google Chrome.&nbsp; It has been going on for about 2 weeks now.&nbsp; When I try to access my People tab through Outlook.com on any browser I get a blank page or an Error message.&nbsp; Today I got a "Page
 not found" error and then a blank page on Firefox. If I delete all my cookies on each browser individually I can access People for awhile, then, as I build up cookies, it goes away again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

<h2>            Have Problems When Typing Lao Language in Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hello Microsoft Teams.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problems with typing the Lao language in Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac since October 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use MacBook Air, macOS High Sierra&nbsp;version 10.13.4 and Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac version 16.13 (180424).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Previous version before October 2017 is fine with the Lao Language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problems with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also try with Keyword, Pages, and Numbers but they fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attached a picture here for the example problem with Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is when I type the Lao language in the cell it is fine but in the Formula&nbsp;Bar cannot read it at all as in the photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem is Phetsarath OT Font which is the Official Font of Lao PDR, I cannot read the documents written in Phetsarath OT font at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft Teams will answer me and find the right solutions for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            A. Try to update your Office again so that if any patch is released by Microsoft that would flow in. Sometimes you have to try many times before an update is recognized by your Office.
<br />
<br />C. Another option is roll back to previous stable version which you had preferably 15.41. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Office - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install the previous stable version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some standard troubleshooting steps related to Office on Mac which you can attempt. This I am leaving to you whether you want to try these or not.
<br />
<br />1. Start your Mac in Safe Mode to determine if some other program is conflicting
<br /><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262</a>
<br />
<br />2. Create a new user account to test

<br />
<br />3. You can try to troubleshoot by completely uninstalling it and then reinstalling it.

</p><p>Hello Edgar R.G and E for Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I did everything as you both recommended but the problems still remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely remove Microsoft office and install the version&nbsp;15.24, I can type in the Lao language without problem in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. I try to update to the latest update version and the problem become occurs&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download the latest version that Edgar R.G recommended (follow the link) and install, the problems also remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I rollback to version&nbsp;15.24.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very sad that I cannot continue to update my Microsoft Office to the latest version, I have to disable update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Example of problem like this (in Excel) in the Formula Bar, the language become squares.</p>

<p><strong>Just installed Office 2010 on a new Win7 installation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm finding that Excel is very slow to perform vlookup function and also copy/paste values.</strong></p>
<p><strong>using i7 chipset and all 4 processors are at 100% during this time.</strong></p>

<p>I have very good response times with 2010, much better than 2007.&nbsp; There is nothing out there that I can find addressing 2010.&nbsp; Is this happening with all files, or a specific file.&nbsp; Does the file respond slowly on other machines?</p>
<p>There are a plethera of performance suggestions however, the apply to Excel in general (vlookup for example) but would not be specific to 2010.</p>
<p>If this is strickly a 2010 thing, then I would run repair.&nbsp; I might consider uninstalling and reinstalling.</p>
<p>Here is a solution given for 2007 unfortunately, I have no idea if it would apply to 2010, if you try this you would change 2010 not 2007:</p>
<div>
<p>Search for excel.xlb, *.qat and *.pip. Try searching and renaming this files. Check if excel works.</p>
<p>If still it doesn't work than, Click on Start &gt; Contorl panel&gt; programs &gt; programs &amp; features&gt;&nbsp;Select office 2007&gt; Change&gt; click on drop down of excel and make it NOT AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>Click on Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit &gt; hit Enter</p>
<p><br />
Take back and then delete the EXCEL FOLDERS under following registry keys:</p>
<p><br />
Browse to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office<br />
Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office<br />
Browse to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office</p>
<p>Start&gt; control panel&gt; programs&gt; programs &amp; features&gt; highlight office 2007&gt; change&gt; click on drop down of excel and make it AVAILABLE.</p>

<h2>            I am unable to access my &#64;hotmail.co.uk account.</h2>
                    When I try to log on on either an iPad or my PC I get a message saying " sorry there seems to be a problem with Outlook at the moment" . This has been going on since early this morning. I have reported it, but would like to know how long the problem might
 take to resolve as, according to the status report everything is functioning normally. My wife's account works normally.

But if it gets heat up irrelevantly, you may take it to nokia care.

<p>If you use the phone for long periods of time this is normal behaviour with any phone,so may try cut down on your usage unless its so hot you cant touch it its fine,if its so hot you cant then you need to visit a nokia care point or return to point of purchase.</p>

<p>Hi tine 13,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check if you set the size correctly, since the default unit of size in OWA is kilobytes. Please provide us the rule you set as screenshot as below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23da653a-266c-465c-96da-60aed6454c08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23da653a-266c-465c-96da-60aed6454c08" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to set another rule in OWA to check if all the rules you set don’t work or just the rule you mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please use PowerShell command to get the inbox rule and check if you can find the rule you created:</p>

                    <p>I have a Mac that runs on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5. I got this computer from a friend. &nbsp;It did not come with a product key or disk for MS Office. I can use Word, Excel &amp; Powerpoint but when I try to open Outlook I get: &nbsp;"This account isn't associated with this
 office product. &nbsp;If you purchased Office for yourself use the same account that you used when purchasing Office. &nbsp;If you received Office through an organization or school please contact your administrator. &nbsp;If you have a product key, go back and select Enter
 a product key instead." &nbsp;I am no longer on good terms with the friend I got the Mac from. &nbsp;How can I get a product key so I can get into Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't close or quit the Outlook login dialog box. It does not give me a red X to close it and when I click Quit - nothing happens. &nbsp;I need to install a MS Office update but the update won't install until I close all Office applications. &nbsp;It's holding
 me hostage! &nbsp;Someone please help!</p>

    <title>Retention Tags in Exchange Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jono_365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Retention Tags in Exchange Online</h2>
                    <p>We have Exchange Online / Exchange 2013 Hybrid Mode environment.<br />
For user mailboxes which reside in Exchange Online, an In-Place Archive is created and we wish to have the following actions take place on the Default MRM Retention Policy:<br />
<br />
1. All Items in the mailbox are archived after 3 months.</p>
<p>2. Calendar, Tasks and Notes are excluded from archiving (never archived).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have added the following tags to the Default MRM Policy:<br />
- Archive after 3 months (Type: Default, applies to entire mailbox)<br />
- Calendar never archive (Type: Calendar)<br />
- Tasks never archive (Type: Tasks)<br />
- Notes never archive (Type: Notes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our result is that the Archive after 3 months tag appears to apply but the specific "never archive" do not apply. Is this because the "Archive after 3 months" tag is taking precedence over all other types of retention tags in the policy?<br />
<br />
If so what is the recommended method to accomplish the above?</p>

<p><span>Hi Jono_365,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want the entire mailbox to be "3 months to Archive", then the retention policy tag should be a "Defaul Retention Policy Tag" (DPT) but not a "RPT". Here, please be noted that a "RPT" is used
 for the mailbox's default folder, ie, the "Inbox", "Sent Items", "Calendar", etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On another hand, to isolate it from the original MRM (default MRM) retention policy, I suggest you create a new rentention policy which only includes 1 DPT (3 months move to archive) and 3 RPTs (never
 move to Archive) and then replace the default MRM of the mailbox with the newly created retention policy (1 DPT and 3 RPTs) to see if it works.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998864%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998864%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a>&nbsp;to
 start the MRM process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Alan</span></p>

<h2>            How do I get Excel to look at a date and determine if it falls on a saturday or sunday to return the workday prior, otherwise return that date&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I do payroll through&nbsp;the 15th and the last day of the month.&nbsp; On my spreadsheet I key in the those dates.&nbsp; However, if those dates fall on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, the check date is the prior workday.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get Excel to calculate the check date?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using the Workday function but this seems flawed since I want to adjust it by 0 days.&nbsp; For example, if the pay period date is through 6/30/12, my check date should be 6/29/12 since 6/30/12 is a Saturday.&nbsp; However, I can't find a formula that
 will change the date only if the date is a workday.</p>

<h2>            Nokia HS-47 headset cable length</h2>
                    
<p>Ok. So I received my new Nokai e71 last week from Amazon OK and unpacked it to find the HS-47 headset has a left lead that is only 6 inches long and the righthand lead is 21 inches long to the muet switch. So when I wear them the mute switch is on my left
 hand at cheast height.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal and how they were designed?</p>

            Wear the right lead from behind your neck. Clamp the clasp near the first shirt button or T shirt collar centre. This will bring the mic below your chin and call activation button easily accesible with your right hand.

            <p>Can you explain more about your app and the form?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a good idea to use a multi-table query as the Recordsource for a form. If you want to enter/edit multiple tables on one form, use a mainform/subform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your Recipt table would be a subform on your Customer form. Also using text fields is not a good idea for Primary/Foreign Keys. I would have an Autonumber as the SubdivisionID. Another issue I see is can't their be more than 1 customer in a Subdivision?
 If so SubdivisionID should be a FK in the Customer table (unless customers can have multiple subdivisions).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, your Receipts table should be further broken down. The Fees should be entered in a child table like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ReceiptFees</p>
<p>ReceiptFeeID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>ReceiptID (FK)</p>
<p>FeeTypeID (FK)</p>
<p>FeeAmount</p>
<p>
</p><p>FeeTypeID would come from a lookup table.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I differ with Scott on this issue -- many times it's perfectly fine to use a multi-table query as a recordsource.&nbsp; However, you do have to do it right, because it can introduce presnickety complications.</p>

            I'm trying to replicate a form that already has a specific format, which involves data from all tables. (And one customer can have many subdivisions.) I've tried to use subforms, but then it messes up the format that I need.

<h2>            How can you call multiple people at once&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the top left corner, I click the phone icon which bring up another window. I then click on the "Call Multiple People" icon in the top right. This takes me to a search bar, which is useless given all the numbers I need to call are not in my contacts and
 are international. I can enter one phone number in the search bar and call them, if I remember to include the proper international code, but I don't see an option to dial 2 numbers. How can you do this? Also, how can you add someone else to a call that is
 already in progress? Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. When did the issue start?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried access your email account through Outlook.com and still seeing the yellow folder icon?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any changes on your Outlook prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be more helpful if you could send us a screenshot of the page where you see the yellow folder icon.</p>
<p>

            Beta testing should not brick your computer! &nbsp;I tried to roll back to the previous build because I got tired of waiting for an update that would supersede this awful release. &nbsp;None came. &nbsp;So I figured I would roll back to the previous build by setting
 the configuration to that in the Windows Insider configuration in Windows 10. &nbsp;Home computer that it is running on is literally bricked after doing that, and it is a fairly new computer and has zero issues prior to this. &nbsp;In software design, we spend countless
 hours testing and retesting as many scenarios as possible prior to releasing software to those outside of the development group. &nbsp;We go through courses and take certification exams to prove we can perform our jobs successfully. &nbsp;I would be hard pressed to
 be convinced that anyone in the development group for this release did any testing at all given what it has done to the first release population. &nbsp;We assume risk when we join in this testing thread. &

 seguia arrojando el mismo error, por lo que tuve que dejar de ocupar cuevana como sitio para ver mis series, despues usando otra pagina, de un momento a otro dejo de reproducir el sonido y con eso youtube tambien, revise la opcion de combinacion de sonidos
 en panel de control, sonido, y elegi predeterminado de windows, pero no sirvio de nada. nose que otra solucion puede ser, tambien desinstale los " complementos"&nbsp; que instala cuevana para ver sus series online, y nada sucedio.<br />

<h2>            Dropbox alternative</h2>
                    Hello all. At my company we send out pricing requests to vendors and we need to share drawings and document with them. Currently this is being done via Dropbox. Does office/Microsoft offer something similar? If so some feedback/comparison info would be
 great. Thanks&nbsp;

<p>Microsoft has OneDrive: <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/</a></p>
<p>Both offer cloud storage, sharing files, and viewing Word documents and Excel workbooks without opening them.</p>
<p>OneDrive offers more direct integration with Office, but I find DropBox generally more user-friendly.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive shared file gone</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had created a spreadsheet with excel and shared it with a couple of co-workers via onedrive.&nbsp; 2-5 days ago it was working fine.&nbsp; Today I came into work clicked on my desktop shortcut and it is gone...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my desktop recycle bin as well as the recycle bin in OneDrive.&nbsp; Then I did the same thing on each of the co-workers I shared with, there is no sign of this file in anyone's recycle bin and I've searched it as well as manually went through all of
 my office 365 file and cannot find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to restore?&nbsp; Or is this a glitch in the system and I have to spend hours recreating?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Jones,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for what happen to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find your lost file, I'd like to suggest you launch Excel then click File&gt;Open&gt;Recent to check if that file is on your list or not. You can also check the folder Recover Unsaved Workbooks under the list to search your files. If you still can't find your
 files, since you have already checked recycle bin of OS and OneDrive, this file may lose&nbsp;completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid this issue, please save your files in OneDrive. I appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Neo&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Neo,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have tried the solutions you suggested with no luck.&nbsp; The confusing part for me is that these files were saved to one drive and now have completely disappeared.&nbsp; At this point I have spent several hours re-creating the file since I assume the system
 glitched and wiped my file.&nbsp; Thanks for trying.</p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia 1020 side button stuck &#40;power button&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1020 side button stuck &#40;power button&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 1020, and this problem started happening yesterday afternoon. I keep my phone in an otterbox. The phone works fine, but the lock/power button does not work. I can double tap the screen to wake it up, but I have to wait 30 secs for it
 to lock itself back up.. I'm worried the phone will shut off one day and I won't be able to start it again, or I'll have trouble texting someone and have to restart my phone, but I won't be able to (which happens half the time). I don't know how to explain
 the "stuck" problem. I'm able to push the outter shell of the button down (I can feel it). But the *clicking* feeling does not happen and it does not lock the phone or turn it off if I hold it down like it normally does. Maybe the button is stuck inside it?I
 don't know! What do I do? I haven't seen anyone else with this problem</p>

<p>Is it the same if you remove the phone from the case ?&nbsp;If it is,</p>
<p>then.. seems to be a hardware issue which needs an inspection by Authorised technician ..</p>
