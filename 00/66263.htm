    <title>Can I prevent a driver from being installed with windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I prevent a driver from being installed with windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
I have a Mid 2011 27" Imac with Windows 8. It works mostly fine with the latest bootcamp drivers, I don't have sound in the integrated sound card since I upgraded from Windows 7, but I use bluetooth headphones anyway. But Windows show two driver updates in
 Windows Update: an update to the Intel integrated graphics and an update to the SATA AHCI. One of these drivers crashes the system upon install and each reboot thereafter (I identified which once, but forgot).</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f827121-28a1-4a6b-80be-5020316f076c" /></p>
<p>
My problem is that the Windows 8.1 update comes with these drivers and crashes during install on the "Setting up your devices" step. So I'm currently unable to update. Is there any way to block these drivers from being installed with windows 8.1? or a way to
 replace these with the bootcamp version in the window of time between their installation and their activation?</p>
<p>
Just in case anyone wonders, disabling the device in the device manager won't change the outcome.</p>

            I think there might be a misundesrstanding here. I don't have problems with windows update. I ignore those driver updates, But windows 8.1 installs them while upgrading, so I'm unable to prevent them from being installed.

<h2>            Skype call quality starts diminishing after about 10 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hiiiiii!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We ran into this annoying issue that after a few minutes, the quality of a skype call goes radically down to the point that you even don't understand the other person anymore.&nbsp;<br />
Doing a speedtest without cable, we have a ping of 20; download 30 mbps, upload 5,6.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This goes both for audio only as for video calls. </p>
<p>What can be the problem and how do we solve this?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Missing content from the E3 2018 mixpot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omarhammam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing content from the E3 2018 mixpot.</h2>
                    <p>So I recently got a notification on Mixer.com that informed me that I had received my mixpot from watching the Xbox 2018 E3 briefing which contains a&nbsp;pre-order of Outer Wilds (the release date for some reason is 29/12/2799 when I check it in the Microsoft Store). I went on my Xbox One to make sure and I see the game already installed. I check for the other stuff (mainly the Halo 5 Classic Helmets REQ Pack) and they are nowhere to be seen. I have checked all of the areas that I can think of (Ready To Install, Leftover add-ons, etc) to see if the items were there but I can't find them. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I also received the notification on Mixer about the Outer Wilds 2 hours ago, and just got a notification about a Gears of War skin 5 minutes ago. I'm sure the rewards are rolling out! Wouldn't be surprised to see the Halo REQ Pack in a few hours.</p>

The only thing that I can think of is that the item hasn't been sent to my account yet as you stated.&nbsp;I would also probably make a post that states that the pre-order is chance based and that items can be added at different times just so it helps avoid confusion. I appreciate the clear, quick and helpful response you gave.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - no display until OS booted</h2>
                    <p>I have a weird issue after installing Windows 10. There is no display at all before the log in screen appears, which prevents me from seeing bootloader (win7 and win10 dual boot). Weird, because when I turn off and on my monitor, it works fine until I fully
 boot Windows 10 again. No such behaviour with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS Z97-PRO</p>

<p>16 GB DDR3</p>
<p>MSI GTX 970 GAMING 4G</p>
<p>LG M2452D 24inch connected with HDMI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it installed as UEFI, CSM on with only UEFI boot device support and UEFI PCIE boot support, fast boot also enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: In the end, it turned out to be the display, which might have some problems with HDMI connectivity given it's a TV as well. I somehow got it to work by switching ports on its back or something else I can't recall.</p>

            Seems this is a minor fault either display adapter or display. Can you try another display to test? May be display driver update will help.

<h2>            Windows sign in problem</h2>
                    <p>When I turned my laptop on this morning the regular sign in screen was 'overlayed' with a very fuzzy white screen with the words Windows sign in and a small box with a blue rectangle with four blue lines down the left side and six lines on the right it looks
 like the blue lines might be print but it is too small to tell for sure.&nbsp; I can see the date and time on the left edge of the fuzzy white screen but if&nbsp; press any key or click on any part of the screen the entire screen goes&nbsp;&nbsp; dark blue</p>

<h2>            HP Photosmart C6280 compatible on Windows 8.1 RT</h2>
                    I was able to get my HP Photosmart C6280 All-In-One printer to work with my Nokia 2520 on Windows 8.1 RT using both the HP PCL3 A-Size Printer Class Driver as well as the HP Photosmart PCL3 Printer Class Driver.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to post up letting people know that there are several generic drivers that they can try to see if their printers will also work with Windows RT if they don't have native driver support.<br />
<br />
The list includes:<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker - Text, Audio &#38; Photos Out of Sync After Creating Movie</h2>
                    I am creating a movie in Windows Movie Maker which features still photos, audio and captions. Basically, for series of still photos in a row, the lyrics to the song playing in the background appear as captions underneath said photos. When I create the
 movie in Windows Movie Maker and play it in the program, everything syncs up perfectly. Unfortunately, when I save/export/create the actual movie and then play it in Windows Media Player, everything is out of sync - the audio is delayed so that the photos
 with the captions underneath no longer match up to the song. I have tried saving it in multiple formats - recommended for this project (mp4), YouTube specific (mp4), burning to a DVD (wmv) - and nothing works. Does anyone have any suggestions or advice? It
 pretyt much defeats the purpose to display lyrics to the song underneath the photo is that verse is already over by the time the lyrics appear. Thank you.

            <p>My guess is the music file is the problem. It apparently isn't previewing accurately in Movie Maker so you don't get the same timing in the final movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try converting the song file to another format. Some high-bitrate .mp3 files, in particular, can exhibit this behavior. Try converting to .wma or .wav for the best results.</p>

                    <p>So I've used poolmon to identify a memory leak that will cause my Windows 10 (latest updates) PC to crash if I leave it on for a few days. I found that in poolmon, "Bad0 Nonp" grows continually until it eats all my memory.</p>

            Bad0 Nonp means something like "bad(x) non-paged" which just means a non-paged pool memory leak is going on. Could be a device driver issue 
<br />
<br />Have you made any changes to the PC recently that may have caused this issue to occur? Like a network card update or graphic card update or BIOS - etc. 
<br />
<br />You may try to isolate the issue by disabling your device drivers 1 by 1 and watch if the memory leak continues. You can do this in device manager. Start with a network card driver and disable it. Watch your poolmon and see what happens. If it still leaks, try something else until you isolate the issue. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't seem to net you anything, you may just want to delete drivers for any device you can find a driver to, then reinstall them yourself with pristine updated drivers.

<h2>            REFORMAT AND REINSTALL WINDOWS 8</h2>
                    When I purchase my new laptop top ,I received a USB stick with the windows program. I want to wipe my hard drive clean and reinstall windows , but apparently I have to bring it back to&amp;nbsp;the Furture shop , they will not tell me&amp;nbsp;how to do it ( charge
 $167 ) for them to do it . Is there any way around this . thank you for your help Ran Belarc which one is the product key&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you planning to reinstall Windows? Are you facing any issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the USB disk contains Windows installation media or recovery media you can boot from the USB installation media and reinstall Windows. If you are unable to find if the ‘install 1-8’ file in the USB disk is installation files or not, you can also post
 a screenshot of it here. Refer to this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the USB disk doesn’t contain Windows installation or recovery files, then you will have to download the installation files using the product key. Refer to these articles:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only</a>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>Once you have the installation media, you can refer to this article to perform a clean install of Windows:</p>

</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/clean-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/clean-install</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are planning to perform a clean install of Windows due to any issues you are facing the computer, I would suggest you to get back to us with more information about the issue, so that we can try to resolve the issue using alternate methods rather than
 having to reinstall the whole operating system.</p>

    <title>Turning off Aero Peak - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Turning off Aero Peak</h2>
                    I do not like the Aero Peak feature of Windows 7 and would like to turn it off. Invariably I'll be in the process of typing something when suddenly everything disappears. I just learned that it is because the arrow is pointed to the lower right-had corner
 of the screen. It gets pretty frustrating to have to constantly be reaching for the mouse to make the windows reappear.

            Hi Bethele,<br />
<br />
If I understand correctly, it sounds as though you are moving involuntarily to the Show Desktop preview. This should only happen with a mouse movement. Are you by any chance working on a laptop? If so, check that you have your mousepad on the keyboard switched
 off. That's what happened to me way back when ...<br />
<br />
However, if you really do want to disable the Desktop preview, do this:<br />
<br />
- Right click on the Taskbar<br />
- Select <strong>Properties</strong> from the menu<br />
- Click on <strong>Use Aero Peek to preview the desktop</strong> to deselect this feature<br />
<br />

<h2>            how to play Forza Horizon w&#47;my son&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We are new to xbox 360. My son signed up for xbox life as he plays sometimes on line w/his friends. I didn't as I will never use on-line gaming services (or so I think) so I did create just my own profile so I can play w/my son sometimes ... yes and here
 is the trick, we have no problem to play new "halo" together but are unsuccessful to set up Forza Horizon (we have an original disc w/game) to race together ... ??? &nbsp;any help will be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Hey there, so are you trying to play Horizon split screen on the same console? If this is the case that is not possible as the game doesn't support it. You would have to play together over Xbox Live.</p>

<p>I just thought I might add if you flip over the back of any Xbox 360 game case and look toward the bottom it will have some of the features of the game and one will say 'Players' always check there to see if the game is couch coop as it will say for example
 'Players 1-4'</p>

            <p>Forza Horizon is one-player locally, meaning only one person can be playing per Xbox. In order to get multiplayer you would need to play over Live, which would mean needing two consoles and two copies of the game.</p>

<p>Thanks guys, you confirmed my suspicions about that game... in that case would you recommend any other game w/split screen, one console capabilities ? Any recent racing games w/good graphics???

            <p>You might be interested in Grid 2. It's a decent enough game that came out recently and features local splitscreen multiplayer. Forza 4 also has splitscreen. It's a bit older, but still looks good and has far more cars than Grid 2 - its playable tracks are more racetracks whereas Grid features cities (so street racing).</p>

<h2>            Error on media player while playing CD or DVDs</h2>
                    <p>My computer is showing the "graphical error" when trying to play cds or dvds.&nbsp; I have tried to configure all my settings to the default settings and going through the reboot screen.&nbsp; It is showing that windows media player can not be used on this computer
 and this is a Microsoft computer.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?&nbsp; The only option I have left is to wipe my computer completely back to manufacturer settings and hope that it works.</p>

            Exactly what computer do you have, with what version of 8.0/8.1. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Sling television is not found in the App Store.</h2>
                    
<p>I just signed up with sling and was eager to install the sling tv app, but it's nowhere to be found I have searched for it several ways.</p>
<p>I have a fully updated Xbox one. No issues locating any other apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's odd; I just looked this up to see if it was showing in mine and I found it via a search of the app store. Sling Television is actually in the marketplace. Did you use the search function or did you just browse the marketplace? Is it possible that
 you've downloaded it previously and it's in your Apps section or the Ready To Install area of the Apps section for the "My Games and Apps" app?</p>

<p>My Computer will not load the default website of IIS. I am using Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials. When I try to start the website, a popup appears:</p>

<h2>            I cannot reset my computer&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My goodness, i've tried everything! I no longer have admin permission on my machine and i am so annoyed! If you do not have administrative permissions, there are many things you aren't capable of, you cannot run as administrator of course, and you cannot
 reset this pc through settings &gt; recovery. I have even tried Advanced startup, and frankly, i was very confident this would work, but of course it just worked as it was a normal restart. I have tried a variety of things! I have tried programs and programs,
 i have tried inserting the programs into .bat files, i have tried cmd, but i cannot gain admin access without running command prompt as administrator. I have tried shift + restart. I have tried everything i could possibly think of, but as always, no luck.
 I really need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another admin account which i am a **** to forget the password. Now i am only left with a non - administrative microsoft account, the admin account is a non - microsoft account. I have no other computers in this establishment. I am left with very
 few options, maybe even none at all! I need to somehow recover, or reset the admin password, and i have tried many, many passwords. none worked as i thought. In the startup, under where you insert the admin password, it says reset. When i noticed this i was
 hyped up, but then i clicked on it, and it asked for a usb i believe. i don't quite remember but i know it needed something i do not have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no money that i could buy any essentials with. No friends who have PC's, (they only play xbox and ps4 consoles) And no way to contact them. And since it is summer break makes it worst. I am in a very stuck situation and at this point i am probably
 ****. Please help.</p>

<p>If you have forgotten the password to your only Admin account &amp; it is, as you say,&nbsp;a local account for which you have not previously made a Password reset disk** then the only remedy that we can suggest in this forum is to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**&nbsp; A Password reset disk can only work within the account for which it was made so you cannot, for example, make one on another computer or within a different user account to solve the problem.&nbsp; A Password reset disk is, in any case, only&nbsp;a glorified alternative
 to writing your password down somewhere secure.</p>

            In order to reinstall windows 10, i need admin rights to launch the setup or application. And like i said before, i have not any other machines in this property. I am not sure if i have the right installer so could you send me the link of the setup to
 reinstall windows 10, which i believe wont work due to me not having admin rights, it always asks me to insert and admin username and password. thanks

<p>Hurmia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reinstall Windows 10, you boot from the installation disk.&nbsp; This requires no Admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have an installation disk then, on the login screen, click on the power icon then hold down the Shift key as you click on Restart.&nbsp; That will take you into a Windows recovery environment [WRE] where you select Troubleshoot and then Reset this
 PC.&nbsp; A Reset is supposed to be about the same as a reinstallation but I believe that it offers you the chance to keep your existing files.&nbsp; See

<p>Like i said before, i have tried this method. Shift + &nbsp;Restart wont work, i don't understand why?...</p>
<p>And i do not posses an installation disk, Nor does anybody else in this household. I have tried shift + restart a majority amount of times, i have honestly lost count of this process and i believe i do not have access to this menu, and i am</p>
<p>not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have been aware of this strategy "[WRE]" for about two days. Three days is the amount of time i have been having these problems. I really need help, thanks a lot for taking the time to help me, if you
 cannot figure this out, i understand completely, because even i do not obsess the knowledge of providing myself with arrangement of this operation.</span></p>

<p>Hurmia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, yes I can see it now.&nbsp; You tried to get into the WRE using Shirt-Restart before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three methods of entering the WRE using Shift-Restart to do a Reset.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1&nbsp; While in Windows, click on the Start menu then the power icon then hold down Shift as you click on the Restart entry [and then let go of Shift].</p>
<p>2&nbsp; Restarting the computer to reach the login screen then, instead of logging in,&nbsp;using the power icon on the login screen in the same way.</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Start menu, Settings, Update &amp; security, Recovery, Advanced startup - Restart now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all three cases, in the WRE you click on Troubleshoot then Reset this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think, judging by your explanations, that you might have already tried all three ways but I am not absolutely sure.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I was always unable to get into the WRE on my Windows 7 computer and ended up always booting from an installation disk instead if I had some repairs to carry out.&nbsp; I never understood why.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other option, given that you have nobody else's computer to get onto, is to take your computer to a trustworthy local computer technician.&nbsp; But obviously that would cost you money and I appreciate that you cannot do that.&nbsp; Are there, perhaps, any
 community groups that provide mutual support for computer issues much as this forum does?&nbsp;

</p><p>My response to this is, I am not aware of any groups of this sort, Though i am willing to do some research on this, and hopefully get positive conclusion. I will then tell you the results of this research.</p>

<p>Ugh. I've tried so many things, if there were even a software to reset my pc, or to repair my installation of windows 10, or a software to fix whatever is preventing safe mode to boot up, it wouldn't matter because i need administrator permissions to even
 launch the software!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i had admin rights i could easily get this done. I could reset my computer in a jiff, i already have a software to do this, the problem is, i just cannot launch it. I need some method to launch a program as administrator, but i need it to somehow dodge
 the administrator password so i could launch this reseting/repair program. I have no disks, or siblings who own a machine, and i know no mechanics. I have done so much research on the internet, and i've done some research on youtube, but the youtube videos
 were mostly clickbait, and the internet worked for other people, but not for me. I do not understand, why aren't these methods working for me? please help me, i am in pure need. thanks</p>

    <title>Windows Search Index Wrong&#47;Foreign Language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 0125  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Search Index Wrong&#47;Foreign Language</h2>
                    <p>I just ran into a problem with Windows system/display language. Because many other users are having the same issue, I wanted to share the
<strong>simplest solution</strong> to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to get it working correctly is <strong>create the user account from scratch</strong>
<em>after</em> making all the necessary changes to region and language settings. Many users went so far as to completely reinstalling the OS; this is unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried other less drastic methods of no avail; changing the region and language settings for the input language
<em>after</em> installation doesn’t update the search results. Rebuilding the search index or manually deleting
<em>Windows.edb</em> file has no effect either.<br />

<h2>            Adera episode 5 keeps crashing</h2>
                    <p>I have enjoyed playing the game, but now stuck in a puzzle. Trying to solve it, the app just quits. There is also no skipping the puzzle, just hint, which is of no use. Any suggestion to relive the pain?</p>
<p>Thanks...Oscar</p>
