<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile TP Build 10549 - Collective BUGS and Feedback Thread</h2>
                    <p>So, here's my full list of bugs and feedback for improving Windows 10 Mobile starting from Build 10549 (I'm testing it on a Lumia 920)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Windows 10 Mobile Build 10549 - BUGS AND FEEDBACK LIST</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p>UPGRADE NIGHTMARE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only way to upgrade was to downgrade from 10536 to 8.1 Cyan via WDRT Desktop app, then upgrade 8.1 Cyan to Denim, then 8.1 Denim to 10549. It took literally HOURS, and it went wrong too;</li><li>Upgrading from WP8.1-&gt;WP8.1/Denim-&gt;WP10549 goes wrong: apps were missing, wrong apps texts on App List, Internet Explorer instead of Edge, Settings and many apps won't open. The only workaround was to shut down the phone, and doing a further Hard Reset
 via Power and Volume keys. Then 10549 was finally installed correctly (another hour wasted);</li><li>After reinstalling Windows Insider app, and re-enrolled to Fast Ring: another upgrade with "Fast configuration update" was triggered, so ANOTHER HOUR WASTED;</li><li>PLEASE IMPROVE UPGRADE EXPERIENCE: Both from WP8.1 -&gt; W10M, and from Old W10M build -&gt; to new W10M. Always doing Hard Reset after an upgrade is&nbsp;<span>NOT</span>&nbsp;acceptable.</li></ul>
<p>HARD RESET + NO BACKUP = PERSISTENT PROBLEMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Store apps fail to update/install on first try (they gave an "Error"). I had to retry at least 5 times, and than they were updated/installed successfully;</li><li>Settings pane crashes when trying to change Action Center triggers;</li><li>New Messages app and Skype Video have bugged label on Settings-&gt;Phone and Settings-&gt;Messages (when selecting default text and video apps);</li><li>Groove Music stops playing music when other media content is loaded in the player (like it should be)...but then can't be resumed from the same time/seconds returning to Groove app;</li><li>Camera App: swipe from left to right to smoothly load Camera Roll photos is missing. A downgrade compared to stock 8.1 Camera App;</li><li>Many animations are missing: for example opening Edge "Hubs" button, Edge "Tabs" button does not trigger any animation, and the next menu just appears like Windows 95. It happens many times with many OS menus, very ugly and a regression compared to WP8.1
 smooth transitions;</li><li>Action Center needs blur/transparency like Windows 10 Desktop;</li><li><span>Edge ABSOLUTELY needs an AdBlocker or TPLs (Tracking Protection Lists) support</span>. Both on Phone and PC. See new iOS9 Beta native ad-blocking features. It's night and day browsing after that;</li><li>Edge doesn't have "Google" search engine option instead of Bing;</li><li>Live Tiles sometime flickers and/or not update themselves;</li><li>Swiping down the Action Center still has some lag/delay before it shows itself, at least the first time after boot;</li><li>Calendar Live Tile doesn't update itself;</li><li>Messages app is a bit slow to open;</li><li>New Outlook app could be even faster to open;</li><li>LinkedIn is no more integrated in People App.</li><li>Performance is SO MUCH BETTER than 10536 on Lumia 920, I would say almost close to 8.1.2 . Very good improvements after all, but it could be even better (some "Loading/Resuming" screen still appears);</li><li>Battery drain is still much worse than 
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">PLEASE, now SHARE this list inside your W10M "Feedback App" (adding all your personal issues too).<br />
</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentStandard">That's the only way for MS to REALLY notices us.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Thanks! :)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Oh, and I would like to add:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Some Italian menu texts translations are bugged (for example: when Xbox App gives connection error, or some Settings submenus;</li><li>Edge Address bar is bugged: when tapped for start typing a web addres, it blanks white and it isn't possible to see what website we're typing. Workaround is to type something random, let bing search show results, and then start typing again inside it;</li><li>Cortana has huge battery drain.</li></ul>

            Today, after one day working Outlook mail (and calendar) stopped syncing with my live acount. The same is the case with my work exchange account! It was working for one day, and cannot make it work again. Lumia 930 - 10549. Much faster, otherwise then
 the 10536...

            <div>I have also faced:</div>
<div>- screen turning off by it self for 2 seconds and turning back on. Lock screen doesn't appear</div>
<div>- added live tiles not always appears on start screen</div>
<div>- removed live tiles goes invisible instead of being removed</div>
<div>- dragging live tile over another one to create folder can't be dropped and goes back to previous location</div>
<div>- installed apps still have pending label on the list</div>
<div>- Edge still has poor performance</div>
<div>- you should add shadow to UI elements which are covering other parts at runtime</div>
<div>- I should be able to slide hamburger menu from the edge of the screen like android does for better one-hand usage experience</div>

            <p>To obtain 10549 you must directly upgrade from Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>Direct upgrade from 10536 doesn't work right now (but it will for the next WM10 TP build).</p>

            <p>Well it took several hours to back down and then upgrade my 635 to 10549.&nbsp; it is all done and so far there is only one problem when I tap the phone icon it opens and then immediately closes not allowing me to make a call.&nbsp; Fortunately this is&nbsp; my test phone
 so it is not a disaster.&nbsp; It does receive calls.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been a update but it has not solved the problem but if I go to the name in my people list it will dial the number.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well after the phone had another 34 updates to apps including Phone all seems to be well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only app that seems to have any problem is battery which seems to take forever to tell me how fast it is charging and the current battery level.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the impression that these updates have been offered today. Many were updates to Microsoft or ATT apps.</p>

            I solved most of the issues post-upgrade with a further Hard Reset (and no Backup restore) when all was set on 10549 (it's a pain in the ****, I know, but it worked).

            Cellular service won't work on my phone after updating, and wi-fi won't turn on. Nothing internet related will work except receiving phone calls.

            The Blackjack II does not have Wi-Fi so it will not connect to your wireless router unless you can get a Wi-Fi card for the memory slot.&nbsp; I don't think it is worth trying that IMHO.

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2011 crashes when I insert citation &#40;EndNote X5 Mac&#41;</h2>
                    On OSX 10.6.8. &nbsp;I have a document that I have been working on and now whenever I try to insert a citation MS Word crashes with the following error report. &nbsp;I have tried removing CWYW with no luck. &nbsp;The strange thing is that if I open a blank document,
 I can insert citations fine with no problems. &nbsp;Is there something which could have become corrupt in the document I am working with?

            Looking at that Crash Log, it appears that crash WAS caused by Cite-while-you-Write.
<div><br />
<div>Did you re-start the computer after removing CWYW?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, it is entirely possible that that document is now corrupt and any attempt to add anything may cause it to fail the same way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to remove CWYW. &nbsp;You could also try a Maggie on that document:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>The Maggie:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Create a new blank document in .docx format</p>
<p>2. Carefully select all of the text in the bad document EXCEPT the last</p>
<p>paragraph mark</p>
<p>3. Copy it.</p>
<p>4. Paste in the new document.</p>
<p>5. Save under a new file name and close all, then re-open.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This technique for de-corrupting is known as "Doing a 'Maggie'", after</p>
<p>Margaret Secara from the TECHWR-L mailing list, who first publicised the</p>
<p>technique.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            Nevermind I have figured it out.&nbsp; If anyone else is having this problem, just click on "Sheet 2" and scroll bars pop up.&nbsp; You can then go back to "Sheet 1" and scroll bars are back there too.&nbsp; So if you keep 2 sheets on the workbook, scroll bars will remain.

            Hi WendyHirokawa,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />If you ticked Show horizontal scroll bar and Show vertical scroll bar and you're still having the problem please try this.
<br />
<br />Try opening excel in safe mode.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type excel /safe
<br />
<br />If it worked, disable any suspicious add-ins.
<br />

            Hi Wendy, how are you, thanks for posting in our microsoft community. I suggest that you repair  office to resolve the issue. To do this follow these steps:
<br />First open Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Now click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications &gt; Then click Change &gt; And click Repair (choose the Online Repair)
<br />If the issue persist I recommend that you take a look to the suggestions in these links:

    <title>Cant send a Word document to email on our new computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dedmunne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant send a Word document to email on our new computer</h2>
                    <p>On our old computer we could&nbsp;easily send a saved Word document to our yahoo email simply by clicking 'send'. Well&nbsp;we recently purchased a new computer with Windows 10 then&nbsp;purchased Office 2016 through my girlfriends workplace. She installed Office on our
 computer, so I don't know the prompts she accepted or declined,&nbsp;but now when she creates documents on Word and tries to email them to&nbsp;her yahoo&nbsp;email account&nbsp;it says "No valid email accounts are configured. Add an account to send email.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to "add an account" several times&nbsp;but it just says "We are having trouble connecting to your account, verify the settings below and make changes if necessary." I enter my yahoo email address, then the password for that yahoo account, nothing.
 I change the password to my Windows 10 Admin. account, nothing. I mean I could somewhat understand yahoo not being my default email account on the new computer as of yet, but for it to not even recognize a known email account I've had for 15 years is beyond
 frustrating. Our old XP was wonderful and I only 'upgraded' because of XP security issues and CPU speed. This issue alone makes me wish I'd never 'upgraded' as this is pathetic and beyond ridiculous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help concerning this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>It doesn't seem to matter how I try and send it. If I open "file explorer", right click on particular file I want to email, choose "email", enter email recipient then&nbsp;click send, it gives me the "No valid email accounts are configured. Add an account to
 send email." box. That's when I jump through the hoops of trying to set up an email account to which it responds "We are having trouble connecting to your account, verify the settings below and make changes if necessary.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open Word and choose a file it's the same result, I get no where! As far as same issue other than Word file I don't know other than when I responded to a Craigslist post, it gave me email options. I chose yahoo from the list, it gave me the option to
 always use that email to which I checked that box, asked a question of the seller, clicked send and it successfully sent my email.</p>

            <p>Does the version of Office that you have installed include Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, you need to set up access to your Yahoo e-mail account in Outlook</p>

</p><p>See <a href="http://www.setup-outlook.com/outlook2013yahoo.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.setup-outlook.com/outlook2013yahoo.php</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Office suite does not include Outlook, you will need to use a third party MAPI compliant mail application such as Mozilla Firefox and setup access to your Yahoo e-mail in it and set it as the default mail application.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response Doug and yes it has Outlook. I tried following the steps in the link you provided but it's confusing. It says
<strong>You will need to enable POP in Yahoo:<br />
</strong>1 - Log in to Yahoo<br />
2 - Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Configuration</strong>&nbsp;button at the top of the page<br />
3 - Select&nbsp;<strong>Mail Options</strong><br />
4 - Select<strong>&nbsp;POP &amp; Forwarding</strong><br />
5 -&nbsp;<strong>Enable POP</strong>&nbsp;and select what you wish to occur wen accessing POP emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I'm always logged into Yahoo, and there's neither a "Configuration button" on my Yahoo homepage window or my Yahoo email window. How can I proceed if I can't get past this most crucial step?</p>

When I try printing from MS Word, I get nothing. <br />
Not even an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since I can print from some applications, I'm sure my<br />

<p>Thank you for the quick reply.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm still not able to print with Microsoft applications.<br />
<br />
I was having trouble with my old Office 2010 so I upgraded to Office 365 and still no print. I have Windows 10 and all updates have been applied.<br />
<br />
I CAN print to the new printer from:<br />
&nbsp;- Nuance PDF Reader</p>
<p>&nbsp;-&nbsp;DraftSight CAD package</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Photoshop Elements</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure the problem is with Microsoft products.<br />
I've tried:<br />
&nbsp;- Outlook</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Word</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Wordpad<br />
&nbsp;- Internet Explorer</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Microsoft Edge kind of worked</p>
<p>Some of them don't give an error, and some say printer not ready. </p>

<p>Thanks Stefan, I have tried the latest updates.<br />
</p>
<p>That was a good suggestion about using a PDF as an intermediate stage.</p>
<p>Funny thing: when I print other PDFs they work fine, when I converted a Word document and tried to print it as a PDF - I got no error, but it refused to print.</p>
<p>I'm really puzzled.</p>

            Since the converted PDF didn't work, either, there must be something about the content and/or formatting which causes trouble. Is there anything particular about the documents for which printing fails?<br />

<p>The documents I'm printing are single page Word documents.<br />
They contain song lyrics with chord letters (in blue) on every other line.<br />
I use a title section and a footer.<br />
<br />
One of my song sheets looks like this:<br />

<p>Just use the phone as you normally do and see whether the battery really dies that fast. It may be just an issue with the Display Indicator. If the phone really goes dead soon after then first check for any firmware update or re-install the existing one.</p>
<p>If no change then, back up and try a Soft Reset after taking Back-up of your data as the reset will erase all data from the Phone memory..</p>
<p>If problem remains, get the device inspected by Nokia Care technician for any Hardware issues..</p>

<p>Re-installing firmware should not affect the applications that are preent in the phone or on Memory Card, but it is always advisable to take Back-up before updating / re-installing ...</p>
<p>..and for the power consumed when the phone is OFF ..a very small amount of power will get discharged even when the phone is OFF..( similar to the case if you charge a Battery fully and then remove it out and leave it for some days.. You will not find it
 fully charged when you start using it back..). More&nbsp;power is consumed when the phone Reboots..</p>

I can receive all emails OK. But i cannot send emails anymore. All of a sudden it has started to say: "Entourage cannot connect to the server. Verify that your computer is connected to the network." Isnt the server for sending and receiving emails the same?
 I am certain i didnt mess about with the setings. Curious as to why this would suddenly happen.

BASICS Send &amp; Receive<br />

2.&nbsp; If you can send but not receive you have a bad POP or IMAP configuration<br />

Check under advanced settings. Check your provider's website for exact info on authentication, SSL and ports. It's not uncommon for them to update and either not send out notices or the notice ends up in junk and you didn't see it.<br />

    <title>Suspicious Activity Report - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasde fence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suspicious Activity Report</h2>
                    <p>I opened a new outlook.com account today and immediately received a warning email that suspicious activity was occurring. The recent activity log showed activity from a Singapore IP address. 111.221.116.37.&nbsp; An IP Lookup shows that IP address is registered
 to Microsoft.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I was attempting to sync an outlook 2013 account to the newly created outlook.com account and I wonder if that IP is a legitimate part of the process (MS email server?), or is it a spoofed IP and possibly malicious.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Can anybody share any light on this? I note the IP is recorded in one blog entry previously for a different issue.</p>

<p>I believe the option you are looking for is within<em> Access Options</em>. Click the<em> Office button</em>, then<em> Access Options</em> in the lower right.</p>
<p>Select<em> Advanced</em> from the list down the left side, then locate<em> Default find/replace behaviour</em> in the top<em> Editing</em> section (four or five from the top). Change this
 option to<em> Start of field search</em> and click<em> OK</em> in the lower right to save your changes.</p>
<p>The old behaviour you described should be back.</p>

            <p>There is no legitimate, verifiable source for a solution and those listed, regardless of whether or not you or some other user said&nbsp;it seems to have&nbsp;worked, do not feel safe (especially since I viewed over 50 online (none from sources trusted by this site)
 that are close, but many include variances that could be significant - or potentially even dangerous or misunderstood or easy to interpret as being unnecessarily extreme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The generic removal tools we often recommend do not seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than risk some of these .bat (and sometimes other) file deletion techniques that go&nbsp;far beyond a single file&nbsp;(even if it's a nasty script trick), please use&nbsp;this&nbsp;safe approach (if only to rule it out - but I'm convinced it will resolve whatever this
 problem might be).</p>

    <title>14946 - Display Set to full resolution, Compressed vertically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucianalaverne  say:</h3>
<h2>            14946 - Display Set to full resolution, Compressed vertically</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to 14946. Text was large, so I turned down the display scaling from 150% -&gt; 100%, and signed out/signed in. Everything functioned as expected until I put my computer to sleep. When I next woke my computer, the display was compressed vertically.
 Even though the Resolution setting in Windows is at 1920 x 1080 and my laptop (Lenovo W520) has a 1920 x 1080 display, only maybe 75% of the height is used but still 100% of the width, even though the entire display should clearly be used. The aspect ratios
 don't match, causing text and images look blurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't found a fix apart from rolling back. Anyone else encountered this? Anyone have a suggested fix?<br />

<p>I did find the import/export but it failed.</p>

<p>Then I tried some of the links provided.&nbsp; I am beginning to realize that I have probably never had any MS directions actually work and this one failed on the first step.&nbsp; "Open the Control Panel: In Windows 10, right-click the
<strong>start </strong>button the then click on <strong>Control Panel.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not produce said control panel but there is a settings option.</p>
<p>The second step mentioned the <strong>View By </strong>list and there was none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still trying to find these pst files and when I tried to search for them, none were found.&nbsp; Why is it that the search failed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all cases, Outlook was not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally did a search for "Show all hidden files, folders, or drives" and it was already enabled.</p>

<br />AS originally mentioned, no requirement to use export/import but given the error you encountered, would strongly suggest that you run ScanPST files on any PST file you plan to copy to eliminate any errors that may exist in the file. It may require multiple runs to get rid of all errors in a file

                    Until a few days ago I could paste tables and formatted text across documents with no changes, keeping the formatting. Now when I paste there is only one icon&nbsp;A on a clipboard&nbsp;whereas before there were three wth various options. I use Word 2010. Not sure
 what has happened. I tried system restore to no avail. I've also gone into paste options and checked the keep formatting options. Any ideas? Thanks, Tansy&nbsp;

If it does, uninstall Skype, then re-install but make sure to "uncheck" any options, especially browser addons.<br />

<p>Thank you for your clarification. Since you mentioned that the issue occurs only on Windows 10 Mail app, we suggest that you reset the mail app. Once done, try adding the account again and check if the issue still persists. It is most likely a server/sync
 issue especially if the mail is being delivered to multiple platforms. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset Windows 10 Mail app, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Mail and Calendar</strong>. </li><li>Click on it and then, <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Find the <strong>Reset button</strong> and click it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Do update us with the results.</p>

<p>I already said issue is with the web when I access email via browser. I tried every browser but issue remains the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is issue on the server side not on the client side or any app. Other outlook emails works well in the app. But I don't care if it works with Win10 mail app or not, I'm concerned for the web, in the browser email remains unread unless I go back and forth
