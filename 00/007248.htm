    <title>Redirect malware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bad gravity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Redirect malware</h2>
                    <p>Lately while streaming video with apps (some anime apps and now a youtube app) an IE tab comes up telling me update my phone with a download link and timer to download automatically, or other such gibberish. The site changes over time, a couple of weeks
 ago it was s.track788.com or such. I've cleared browser history but it keeps coming back and it's always (so far anyway) during video stream in an app. I've even begun to suspect the problem may be on my mobile operator's end as it tends to happen move over
 cellular but I haven't researched this enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if it's not a virus, since WP can't get infected supposedly, what is it and how to get rid of it? It's not only annoying but also undermining my faith in the system's safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone is a Lumia 435 with Windows Phone 8.1 Update, OS version 8.10.14234.375. Also I lack PC access so external tools may be out of the question.</p>

<p>Okay, I suspected this may be the case for one app that plays from a now unreliable site, but youtube?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, assuming a streaming site is reliable-ish, will downloading videos cause the same issue? For some reason when I stream using IE nothing happens (yet) but streaming apps act up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: One more thing. One yt app is popping up malware but another isn't (or hasn't during the 4-5 videos I tried). Can it be the app itself that's the reason? I noticed this for that one anime app as well, it worked fine for months and suddenly malware
 started coming up (but the host site has been compromised so it's not entirely the apps fault). Or can it be the in-app ads are to blame?</p>

<p>A bit of an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue persists, although it seemed to subside for a brief while. Additionally, spamverts seem to only turn up over cellular now. If I'm connected to wifi (or at least two free networks I use occasionally) the apps in question play vids just fine, with
 no IE opening up to show crap. But as soon as I switch over to cellular (e.g. if my wifi connection breaks and mobile data is turned on) I get a popup almost instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I haven't run into this issue outside from a select number of streaming apps so I can't say if it's something about the apps, the ads (I tend to use apps with ads in offline mode so I haven't researched if it'd happen there as well) or my mobile operator
 letting crap through. I would assume it's not a host site issue, unless you consider youtube a dubious host site.</p>

<p>Hey hey, this is still unsolved. I don't really have anything to add except maybe that I don't get redirects over the wifi network I'm using, only via cellular. So my theory is this: it's either the app(s) triggering the redirects or it's the ads. Also it
 would seem my mobile operator offers no countermeasures as the wifi network simply refused to let me to some seemingly legit sites, claiming they're unsafe and stuff. So they may have some malware protection unlike my mobile operator, which would explain why
 I don't get redirected over wifi. It's also not the host site's fault (youtube? hello?) as I've played and downloaded from the same host sites via the browser without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to other theories though. 😁</p>

    <title>Distribution List disappears after editing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Distribution List disappears after editing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just discovered this:&nbsp; When editing a distribution list in Outlook 2007, specifically when removing a member from a distribution list, the moment that I remove a member, the distribution list closes and disappears from Contacts.&nbsp; I found it in the Deleted
 Items folder.&nbsp; I have a colleague who had the same experience, but she can't find her missing distribution list anywhere in Outlook after editing.</p>
<p>I'm assuming this is a known issue with Outlook 2007, based on a quick survey of the forums.&nbsp; However, I haven't seen any solutions offered, or any suggestions of where to look if one cannot locate the "removed" distribution list in the Deleted Items folder,
 from the Recover Deleted Items cache, or in any Outlook items search.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any insight you might offer, especially how to recover a deleted distribution list (that disappeared when editing) if it is not in the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; (We know how to search Outlook for items, using Advanced and other searches...
 thank you.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You weren't brought down any notches at all. Everybody has fallen into this trap, including me. The only red-faced people should be the developers. Think about it. Why would anyone who has opened a DL dialog box to edit the DL want to simply delete the
 entire DL from that interface?&nbsp;No one&nbsp;would, of course. The button shouldn't be there in the first place. I bugged it in Outlook 14 but was ignored. I can't bug it in Outlook &lt;next&gt; because I haven't been invited back. Wonder why.

            <p>No such "known issue." Sounds more like end user error to me, aided and abetted by Microsoft's poor interface design&nbsp;for DL's. Most users who want to&nbsp; delete a member from a DL select that member then hit the "Delete" button on the ribbon. Wrong. That deletes
 the entire DL and places it in the Deleted Items folder (if you're lucky; it often categorically deletes the DL). That is precisely what you are describing.
</p>
<p>The correct procedure, of course, is to select the member and then hit the "Remove" button, which most users never find.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/978dad91-bb44-4f64-823b-b120a331e79b" title="tinizong">
<p>
</p><p>There are things you need to meet before you can contact a Skype for Business user using the consumer Skype application. To connect with people who are using Skype for Business, you will need:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The <strong>latest version of Skype </strong>available for your device. </li><li>Your <strong>Skype account to be linked to a Microsoft account</strong>.</li><li>The email address of the Skype for Business user you wish to contact.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can add a Skype for Business user the same way you add a Skype contact but you have to use their email address. Once the connection has been established and that you are part of each other's contact, you can: make voice and/or video calls, send instant
 messages and see each other's online status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Make sure that your profile is not hidden from search and suggestions. You can double-check this by logging in to your
</em><strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account dashboard</a></strong>&nbsp;<em>and going to your
</em><strong>Profile settings</strong><em>. Make sure that the box for </em><strong>Discoverability
</strong><em>is checked. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this link for additional details. <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12315/can-i-contact-skype-for-business-users-from-skype?q=skype+for+business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can I contact Skype for Business users from

<p>thanks for trying to help, but it does not solve the problem, i had tried all that already</p>
<p>i have</p>
<p>- latest skype version - 12.1803.279.0 but mine looks black on desktop</p>
<p>- it is linked to a microsoft account in good order</p>
<p>- i used correct email address of skype for business contact</p>
<p>- my profile is discoverable&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>search wont show me the other contact in the greater skype world</p>
<p>and search from a skype for business side wont show my standard skype address either</p>
<p>but both exist!</p>
<p>something separates these worlds that I have not yet found out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried searching for the Skype for Business contact using a different Skype platform?
<em>(eg. Skype for Web, classic Skype for Windows desktop, etc.) </em>Can you also confirm if you observe this behavior specifically with a Skype for Business user and does this happen to only one or do you happen to observe this on other Skype for Business
 users as well? What exactly happens when you locate their account in the directory? Please provide any error message you see<em> (if any)
</em>so we can assist you further. </p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem - I have Skype and am unable to see a Skype for Business contact in the directory (like the user above, I have the correct version, email account, and other person's email). Similarly, I'm unable to see my own Skype for Business
 address within my normal Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype help pages confirm that the 2 accounts should be compatible, but they don't appear to be - is there anything I can do?</p>

<h2>            Yammer Information Management Policies &#47; Retention Capabilities&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I am a Yammer user in IT and have a user level understanding of Yammer and an IT background. &nbsp;I've been tasked with understanding what capabilities Yammer may have in the way of information management policies. It is not uncommon in IT systems to have configurable
 information management policies, retention policies, etc. by site, group, etc. I need to understand if&nbsp;Yammer has same in the form of configuration or even developer API's. IM Policy requirements vary by business of course and businesses that may have a requirement
 to age off data will likely have that requirement for many of their systems, even for a social tool like Yammer. I'm hoping the folks that designed Yammer agree.
</p>
<p>Any information you have on this is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Doug</p>

<p>Thanks Nova, Yes I've been getting familiar with the REST API and if we build our own will use that. I'm still at the stage however where I need to confirm conclusively that there is not built in capability through configuration. From what I am seeing there
 is none but not quite finished digging. </p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>Thank you for your response! When you say "built-in capability", are do you mean that API is a built in function for Yammer Admins or there is a default configuration like that in the Yammer network? For more information about REST API or any configuration
 about developing an app for Yammer, you may also reach out to&nbsp;Let"&gt;stackoverflow.com/.../yammer.&nbsp;Let</p> me know should you have any questions.

<p>That was my original look. After googling for the solution, I followed an instruction for a specific site for allowing cookies. I added live.com under Sites to Allow. It didn't work immediately. Later,&nbsp;I had an script error message with Microsoft Edge suggestion.
 After I Oked the message and closed the suggestion message at the bottom. Now it's working fine.</p>

            The error message of log in comes up in Howard email notifier which I use for email alert for Hotmail. When I receive this error message, I click on the Howard icon to get in Hotmail. I find out that I'm already signed in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I've added live.com and microsoft.com. I don't know the site for the Howard email notifier. It's just .exe file in a zip file. I downloaded Howard email notifier 1.56 again. After that, hotmail opens up in Howard email noitifer 1.51 instead of&nbsp;the log
 in error message.

<h2>            Does Word for Mac 2011 have an &#34;enable editing&#34; feature&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Word .docx forms server that I use constantly.&nbsp; The forms are downloadable over the internet and arrive in protected view.&nbsp; In Windows 7 Word the instant I attempt to edit one of these forms a dialog box opens asking if I want to "enable editing."&nbsp;
 Clicking yes makes the form editable. In Word for Mac 2011 I can find no way to enable editing.&nbsp; What function does Word for Mac 2011 have to enable editing of such protected documents?

            Word for Windows provides a variety of protection options or <i>levels</i> not offered in the Mac version [or earlier Windows versions, for that matter]. If any of those features are used when the file is created on a PC, Mac Word is able to recognize
 the document only as "protected". Accordingly, no part of the document can be edited.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid that any type of Form or document that is to be shared cross-platform has to have certain platform specific distinctions taken into consideration when the document is designed.<br />

            By default macros are stored in the normal template. If you have File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Save &gt; Prompt before saving normal template checked, you should get a prompt to save changes to that template when you close Word. If you are not getting that
 prompt (and not saving the template at the prompt), something is interfering with that process - usual suspects are incompatible or defective add-ins and over zealous anti-virus checking.<br />

            You should be able to record a macro to do that, but the following will do the job (in Windows 7 - and probably Vista) where '<span style="font-weight: bold">filename.docx'</span> is the name of the document on the desktop.<br />
<br />
Dim strPath As String<br />
strPath = "C:\Users\" &amp; Environ("USERNAME") &amp; "\Desktop\"<br />
Documents.Open FileName:=strPath &amp; "filename.docx"<br />

if you do want to save the macro in your document rather than the NORMAL.DOTM template, you have to explicistly SAVE AS to DOCM format instead of DOCX..<br />

            They are going into my Normal.dotm (I'm working on my PC at home) until I close Word.&nbsp; Then when I go back in to use them again, they aren't there.&nbsp; I have also checked all the other places where it could be saved from the drop-down list in the Macros
 Dialog Box to no avail.<br />
<br />
Graham (above) suggested that something might be corrupted too, but didn't say what I could do to fix it (if there IS anything I can do.)<br />
<br />
I'm currently working through the chapter and hoping that when I do my assignment at the end, it will work for my instructor.&nbsp; It's an online course, and I will have to upload my assignments to the course drop box.&nbsp; She then downloads them to check them out
 on her end.&nbsp; Thankfully, I have an extension till Sunday now.<br />
<br />
My Word program also has a glitch that does not allow me to save a different default font.&nbsp; I'm thinking I should maybe insist on getting a replacement program from Microsoft!<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying - hope you can help.<br />

            OK - so an update.&nbsp; My macro did not work at all when I saved it in a document (.docm format).&nbsp; I ended up going to the college library to do my assignment on one of their computers where, of course, it worked fine.&nbsp; Are you able to tell me how, or if,
 I can fix a corrupted Word program?&nbsp; Or is there a way to get a replacement program from Microsoft since mine is "broken"?&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            What version of Windows Mobile is running on your phone?&nbsp; (There is no such thing as Windows Mobile 3).&nbsp; If there is an OS upgrade for your device, you'll have to go look for it on the manufacturer's or carrier's website.&nbsp; Microsoft does not distribute
 windows mobile OS updates directly to end users.<br />

    <title>How to set Jalali &#40;Shamsi&#41; as default&#47;alternative calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashkan n  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set Jalali &#40;Shamsi&#41; as default&#47;alternative calendar in Office&#47;Outlook 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Though Windows 10 now supports Jalali (Persian, Hijri&nbsp;<strong>Shamsi</strong>, جلالی, هجری شمسی) Calendar, Office 2016 does not show dates in Hijri
<strong>Shamsi</strong> (Jalali), even when Windows 10 calendar is set as Persian (Hijri
<strong>Shamsi</strong>, Jalali).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel 2016, now we can set 'Number Format' for 'Date' to be shown as Jalai, by choosing Persian as 'Calendar Type'; Which adds the code [$-fa-IR, 16] before the field value. The argument 'fa-IR' sets 'Locale (location)' value and the second digit ("6")
 sets 'Calendar type' 'Persian'.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba8eccb3-7972-4324-a226-f8674ad9d796" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e6fa050-af20-49b3-b6cd-967bb7153cab" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the first digit, it is meant to set language of the calendar ('1' for English, '2' for&nbsp;Japanese, '3' for&nbsp;Chinese Simplified, '4' for&nbsp;Chinese Traditional, '5' for&nbsp;Arabic, '6' for&nbsp;Thai, '7' for&nbsp;Korean, '8' for&nbsp;Hebrew and '9' for&nbsp;Hindi, as can be found
 under alternative calendar setting for Outlook). But, in Excel 2016, the argument 'fa-IR' overrides this argument.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99edc509-5c78-4e74-9472-eaa6bb669db3" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, If I understand correctly, in order to use Jalali (Persian) calendar at least as an alternative calendar for Outlook 2016, I should set Outlook's alternative calendar
<strong>language </strong>to English ('1') and&nbsp;alternative calendar <strong>type </strong>
to Persian (or argument '6'), but there only 5 calendar types, not six!</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd710340-3bca-4f26-b3cc-c65fe258919f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Is there any way to use&nbsp;Jalali (Persian, Hijri&nbsp;<strong>Shamsi</strong>) at least as an alternative calendar in Outlook 2016?</p>

<h2>            Have inadvertently created two OneDrive accounts Mac vs Windows</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have been using OneDrive on my Windows computer for a while. &nbsp;I recently bought a Mac desktop, setup sharing for Office 365 that I had on the pc, and downloaded OneDrive for Mac from the Appstore. &nbsp;I signed in using my Microsoft account and checked all
 the files to sync. &nbsp;Instead what's happened is that the Mac OneDrive seems to be a completely different account than the one associated with my pc. &nbsp;If I go to OneDrive Live, I see the files saved via the Mac only, but not the files associated with my pc.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to have one account that's synced with both my computers so I can save files on one and access them from the other, and I have no idea why that didn't happen automatically when I signed into my account using the Mac OneDrive application. &nbsp;Any advice
 would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It works! &nbsp;First I called Apple support to make sure I had properly uninstalled the old OneDrive app, and to get some other advice. &nbsp;Then I re-downloaded the app via the Microsoft link you provided. Everything seems A-okay now, both computers are synced.
 &nbsp;I'm really happy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you Qing, your help and patience was greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thank-you to everyone else who also chimed in. &nbsp;I'll use this forum again in the future.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone, how are you doing today?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on the Insider Program since the beginning. Currently, I'm on build 1809, and everytime it tries to update to 19H1, it shows me an message that tells me my PC is not eligible for the&nbsp;<strong>upgrade</strong>, as if I was on an older version of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have any of you seen this behavior before? What could be done for me to fix this and update to latest version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and best regards</p>

            <p>the answer to my problem after so many dead ends was a suggestion I chanced upon to install the free copy of adwcleaner. Problem solved. Very relieved but fingers crossed it works in the long run...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the suggestions offered below were a real frustration as these were constantly repeated as a resolve but teh webpage was still bouncing back to ask as a default search engine/webpage.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div><b><span>To resolve this issue I may need few more information:</span></b></div>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you try to change <span>homepage </span>in Internet Explorer 10?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error messages?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to open Internet Explorer 10 in no add-ons mode and check if you can change the homepage.<br />
<br />

    <title>Disabling Smileys in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zappa_328  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling Smileys in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi-- recently, (I think in a Windows 10- Creative Update) my Word 2016 program started to autocorrect (b) to a yellow smiley icon. I looked for this entry in the Autocorrect list, and it is not there. There is no entry for (b) (and it doesn't help if I make
 one). There is also no longer an option in "Autoformat as you type" to disable smileys. There used to be 7 options, now there are six.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use (b) quite often in my writing. How can I disable this autoformatting?</p>

            <p>This is probably related to the issue, which has also been reported, of :) now giving a box instead of a smiley. The Creators Update has a lot to answer for!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of looking for (b), have you tried looking for just b)? Though this seems unlikely to be the problem.</p>

<h2>            Javascript slow load problem on Microsoft Edge and scaling</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10's latest browser "Microsoft Edge"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to open facebook&nbsp; it became very slow to fully load but this page loads faster in Mozilla and Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is There any problem on Microsoft Edge's Java applet? because facebook is using jQuery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: After an Microsoft Edge update, It's much faster now. I had some problem with DPI scaling, I created a manifest file that fixed the issue.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
I'd be glad to help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow these methods, mentioned below to resolve the issue:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Disable Antivirus software.</span></span></strong><span> <span>

Disable the Antivirus software temporarily and check, if it helps.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            PowerShell - Tables</h2>
                    <p>I've been working on a few scripts and cant figure out how to add text next to a result in a table format.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Get-WmiObject win32_physicalmemory | Format-Table Banklabel, Manufacturer, @{Label="Speed";` Expression={$_.ConfiguredClockSpeed}}, @{Label="Capacity";` Expression={[INT64]($_.Capacity/1GB)}} -autosize</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

<h2>            Mobile Device</h2>
                    Microsoft must have a mobile device like smartphone or have close relationship with smartphone vendor like HP so that it is able to leverage and provide apps for consumer industries such as retail, fastfood, supermarkets, etc. &nbsp;this is must for Microsoft
 for future growth
