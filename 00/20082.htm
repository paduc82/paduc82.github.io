<h2>            Bing Images won&#39;t scroll far.</h2>
                    When looking up images. The last couple of days it will only give me one set if images &amp; suggestions. It used to allow you to scroll very far down. Why gas this been changed or is there a way to correct this problem?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When viewing images, what Filter is set in Safe Search</p>
<p>Try changing the filter</p>
<p>You might also change your Location in Bing Settings to determine if this is a regional issue.</p>

            This I occurring on my Lumia 920 &amp; my gf's 830. For instance if we search "sexy lips" when setting is on strict we get nothing. If set on moderate we can scroll far &amp; get many pics &amp; suggestions. If turned off we get desired result but only one group of
 pics &amp; suggestions. I tried looking for location setting but cannot find it.

<p>Yes I have noticed this has been the case since yesterday, but only when using the bing app on my nokia windows phone. Also since yesterday this message has appeared at the top of image search results screen, "Safe Search is Off" and then next to it in a
 different colour font "Change SafeSearch Settings." When you change the setting to moderate you get the full set of results for that search criteria. When you switch safe search off again, then you get a restricted number of results. So my question is this,
 has this been done deliberately by Microsoft to restrict the number of results you get on an "unsafe" search or is there a bug in the software, caused by inserting the above message, as I do not have same issue when using the bing app on my android tablet,
 or when using the Bing search engine in Firefox on my pc. And this is with the "safesearch" switched off. As to changing the location settings on my bing app, I can either switch the "use my location" on or off and this does not make any difference.<br />

            Thanks for replying. Funny I was just going to leave a post to say it's all working fine now. I cleared my search history and internet explorer history, which I had done last night to no avail. However when I did it again half an hour ago. It rectified
 every thing. Anyway thanks for getting back.

            Sorry i wasn't clear. I cleared all temp files, history in Bing, &amp; history in IE. When safe search is set to moderate I get many pics &amp; suggestions. If safe search is set to off it still only gives me one set of pics &amp; one set of suggestions. Am I missing
 some files or a cache to delete?

<p>
</p><p>If that fails, try soft reset and retry image search.&nbsp; See if that makes a difference.</p>

    <title>Conflicting Objects in an Active Directory infrastgructure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex rizeanu msft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conflicting Objects in an Active Directory infrastgructure</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span><span>Two objects are in conflict when they share one or more of the same unique identifier attribute values. For example, two accounts in the same Active Directory database cannot share the same User Principal Name (UPN). If they did, the system could
 not choose an account to use to authenticate a user who is passing that specific UPN.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Conflicting accounts are rarely generated from within the same Active Directory. When it does happen, its usually due to a misbehaving provisioning system that contacts two separate domain controllers at or near the same time and generates two
 copies of the same account information. When these separate copies eventually replicate to the same domain controller, one is deemed a conflict object (CNF) and is marked as such, while the other is considered the "legitimate" copy. The presence of a CNF object
 in an Exchange directory can cause issues with account management, mailbox provisioning, and login.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Much more common, and far easier to reproduce, is the attempt to replicate, or synchronise, conflicting account information from one separate Active Directory to another. For example, attempting to export a user account from on-premises with
 UPN X to AzureAD when a cloud-only account with that same UPN already exists. You can have a mail-enabled Public Folder in Exchange Online (EXO) with smtp address X, and then you can create a user account in AzureAD with the same address. Within minutes, you'll
 receive an error in AzureAD for that account after AzureAD attempts to copy that information to EXO.
</span></span></p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>IMPORTANT:</span></strong><span> As long as an account in AzureAD has a validation error, it
<strong>will not sync</strong> to EXO <strong>until</strong> the conflict is resolved. Any changes to the account, including licensing it to create a mailbox, will not flow and will not complete.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It's also important to realize that any object, no matter what it's type, can conflict with another in this way. A user account can conflict with a group if they share the same email address. A contact can conflict with a public folder if they
 share the same address, and so on. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Unique Identifier Attributes</span></span> </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>These attribute values must be unique across all instances of an account across all directories it replicates to.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>EmailAddresses </span></li><li><span>UserPrincipalName</span></li><li><span>MicrosoftOnlineServicesID</span></li><li><span>WindowsLiveID </span></li><li><span>NetID </span></li><li><span>SamAccountName</span></li><li><span>ObjectID</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>ExternalDirectoryObjectID</span></li><li><span>ExchangeGUID </span></li><li><span>GUID </span></li><li><span>ArchiveGUID </span></li><li><span>DisabledArchiveGUID </span></li><li><span>DistinguishedName</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>All other attribute values, can and in some cases, will be the same between different objects. Display Name for example does not have to be unique. Many mailboxes may share the same servername if they are hosted on the same database, and so on.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Typical Errors</span></span> </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Conflicts can occur on accounts between AzureAD and EXO and between on-premises AD and AzureAD. There are two places where you will see errors recorded for detected conflicts:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>The account in AzureAD that attempted to sync to EXO.</span></li><li><span>The on-premises directory sync tool (ex. AzureAD Connect) installed in the on-premises organisation, typically in the form of an Export error to AzureAD.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Common errors seen on AzureAD accounts</span></span> </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>The proxy address "" is already being used by "". Please choose another proxy address.</span></li><li><span>The value "" of property "UserPrincipalName" is used by another recipient object "". Please specify a unique value.</span></li><li><span>The value " GUID " of property "ExchangeGuid" is used by another recipient object. Please specify a unique value.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>The value " GUID " of property "ArchiveGUID" is used by another recipient object. Please specify a unique value</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Common export errors seen in directory sync</span></span> </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Unable to update this object because the following attributes associated with this object have values that may already be associated with another object in your local directory services: [ProxyAddresses &lt;smtp:<em>conflict address</em>;]. Correct or
 remove the duplicate values in your local directory.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Remediation</span></span> </p>
<p><span><span>Plan</span></span> </p>
<p>Well to be able to solve an y conflicting issues between an on-premises Active Directory organisation and Office 365 (Azure AD + EXO) we need first to answer a couple of questions and depending on the answers we can implement an Action Plan:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>You must identify the account you want to fix and the account that is conflicting with it</span></li></ol>
<p><span>In the AzureAD admin centre we have a filter view that can show only the active users that have an error and this should be the starting point of the investigation. If this filter doesn't help or it doesn't display the whole error then we would need
 to use Powershell to see the whole error:</span></p>
<p>(Get-MSOLUser -UserPrincipalName user@domain).errors.errorDetail.objectErrors.errorRecord.errorDescriptionWe should know now what attribute is actually the root cause of our conflict.</p>
<ol>
<li>Second step would be to delete or modify the identity that is causing the conflict and this action would raise additional questions like:</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Do I need to modify the "old" user or the new one...?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. If the identities cannot be modified and we need to delete the "duplicate", can we backup the existing data associated with this account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well this article cannot answer these questions, but I have posted these here to raise awareness on we need to take into consideration before taking any actions in the attempt to solve the the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to know that by default in O365 there is no backup, if we need to delete an account (to solve the conflicting issue) then all the data associated to it will be lost so we need to find a way to save this data.</p>
<p>Depending on the license model, in Exchange Online we can use Litigation Hold/ In-Place Hold to retain the content of a mailbox for as long as we need without keeping the user in the service. In other words we can put the mailbox on hold and then just dispose
 the user associated with it.</p>
<p>Another approach is to user the eDiscovery process that will enable an administrator to download the mailbox content into a PST file, available to download locally or to copy the content of the mailbox to a Discovery Mailbox on the tenant. This will ensure
 that we have a copy of the data in that mailbox and we can now safely delete the user and mailbox from the service.</p>

            <p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I would like to thank you for the feedback and for taking the time to read the article. The post's purpose is to explain how and when we can find ourselves with CNF objects in the AzureAD and to underline the attributes that need to be unique so avoid
 these conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with you that the post is asking questions that I haven't answered so I have modified it a little to give more context.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

    <title>Dropdown list does not display entire column, help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philly_caterer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dropdown list does not display entire column, help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a simple 2 sheet workbook that pulls names and employee rates from sheet 2 into sheet 1 where I calculate their hours. It works fine. But I decided I wanted to take our separate "Contacts and Rates" sheet from word and add it to excel. By doing
 this I can pull our rates and names from the contact sheet right into my payroll workbook. Now, I copied and linked the columns in the Contacts Sheet so they would line up with the names and rates on Sheet 2 of the Payroll workbook. Success! So far... I was
 able to link the two workbooks and the payroll Sheet 1 was able to pull names and rates from the Contacts Workbook. Unfortunately the drop down list only listed the first 59 rows...I have probably 80+ rows. Why is it not going past row 59?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more information please contact me!</p>

<h2>            Symbian Anna Update Didn&#39;t Change OVI Store Icon&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After much waiting, I finally got to upgrade my E7 to Symbian Anna, everything is perfect but there is one flaw.</p>
<p>All of the new-look icons have appeared except for the one for the OVI Store, it still shows the shopping-bag-type-thing that was the icon pre-Anna.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can fix this? (I tried to re-install the software via. PC Suite, the problem still persists)</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated :)</p>

<h2>            Business Contact Manager 2013 with O365 ProPlus</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am having an issue installing Business Contact Manager for our Office 365 ProPlus subscription.&nbsp; We currently use BCM with Office 2007 and as part of our upgrade to 2013 I need to make sure that BCM is accessible.&nbsp; The installation of Office 365 ProPlus
 via Click to Run has worked quite well for the few users I have been testing with however I cannot seem to get BCM to install.&nbsp; I have already installed the Server tools and upgraded the 2007 SQL DB on our server but when I run the BCM setup (found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36513</a>)
 it spawns a GoToMeeting Outlook Plugin setup/update process instead of the actual Business Contact Manager installation.&nbsp; I presume this is a package ID issue, does anyone have any ideas or suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been uninstalling all Office 2007 applications beforehand, but was under the impression that the installer was capable of both update and fresh installation but have not tried in place upgrade of BCM 2007?</p>
<p>Any assistance would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Greg</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Start&gt; Run or Windows logo key + r, type in shell:Favorites and hit Enter.</p>
<p>Does that access the Favorites folder at [C:\Users\account name\Favorites] ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of what permissions appear to be, Windows 8 is not happy that you pasted in a Favorites folder from another computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From IE&gt; File&gt; Import and Export, export Favorites to a file. Open the HTM file to verify that it contains all folders and Favorites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Favorites folder at&nbsp;[C:\Users\account name\Favorites] and delete all Favorites and (sub) folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart and import the bookmark.htm file that you exported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did that resolve the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks that seems to have resolved the access denied problem.&nbsp; A side effect is that that IE is now very slow in creating favorites, like a 10 sec delay before the dialog box opens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to learn a little from all this, could you explain why even after setting full control access to the Favorites folder it still didn't work.&nbsp; IE10 seems to work under a separate account but I gave full control to that account also with no success.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first saw this issue in the forums when users copied a Favorites folder from XP or Vista to Windows 7.
</p>
<p>I don't know why correcting permissions doesn't fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may resolve the slowness issue, but it's not without some risk...</p>
<p>I had 6 or 8 Windows 7 users&nbsp;move and rename&nbsp;the Favorites folder so that Windows would create a new Favorites folder on restart. Two of those users reported that Windows didn't create a new folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a new Favorites folder was created by Windows 7, and Favorites were imported into that folder, all access/permissions problems disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don</p>

            <p>I've spent a couple of hours today&nbsp;on this particular problem of not being able to save urls into my Favorites folder (which is literally about the 45th big problem I've had in setting up my new laptop -- it has taken me&nbsp;weeks and weeks and I've had to go
 back to the factory&nbsp;image and to early system restore points way more than any careful, cautious person should have to ---&nbsp;this stuff should really be streamlined and efficient&nbsp;at this point -- what&nbsp;ARE they spending their time on&nbsp;at that gargantuan&nbsp;software
 firm?), trying many "fixes" for&nbsp;this problem&nbsp;that&nbsp;have been&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;on all manner of Microsoft help&nbsp;sites and other computer help sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the solutions&nbsp;worked for me and my new computer, except the really simple fix proposed by St. Helens Computer Center (approx. the 11th comment on the following&nbsp;thread--</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10-windows_7/access-denied-error-wont-allow-to-add-web-page-to/27763639-ca39-460e-ba9b-7796d9087a74">"Access
 denied" error won't allow to add web page to favorites using IE 10.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(At least, it's been working for the first 10 minutes after implementing&nbsp;the solution -- I hope it will hold!)</p>

<p>I tried all the "fixes" listed here, none worked.&nbsp; I figured it out though:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Close all browser windows</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Create a new folder on the users desktop and&nbsp;open the new folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Press the Windows + "R" keys simultaneously</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Type in "%userprofile%\Favorites"</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Highlight all items in the newly opened Favorites window folder (Ctrl+A)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Hold down the Shift key and drag and drop them to the new folder window (this will move them as opposed to copying them)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Give it a few seconds (depending on how many Favorites you have, should be fast)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Hold down the Ctrl key and drag and drop them back to the Favorites windows (this will copy them as opposed to moving them)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Open your browser and try to add the page to your Favorites again</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Ta Da!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see this happen pretty often after a "Clean install of Windows" and someone tried to put their own files back.</p>

            <p>My emails are still failing to send. I'll compose the email, hit "Send," and it will create a draft. Then, even if I go into Drafts and click "Send," nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, now I'm getting "Unusual Sign-In" activity notices from Atlanta, GA; IP address
<span>107.77.226.151.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this may have to do with my trying to send emails from another Hotmail account through this Hotmail account. The first account, my primary, sends and receives emails fine. The second account is set up to forward to my primary, and my primary is set
 up to send on behalf of the second, so that I can effectively use one account to send and receive from either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log directly into the second account, it is using the "older" version of Outlook online, with the white lettering on a blue background.</p>
<p>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. To your question:</p>
<ul>
<li>My primary account (new Outlook) can send emails from its account</li><li>My secondary account (old Outlook) can send emails from its account</li><li>My primary account cannot send emails on behalf of the secondary account. When it tries to send emails, they are put into "Drafts" and sit there.</li></ul>
<p>This happens when trying to send from Outlook.com.</p>

            <p>So both accounts have been migrated to the new Outlook system, but I still have the same issue. I disconnected the account and tried to add it back, and now it will not let me add back the second Hotmail account. I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We are unable to reach your email provider. Please check your server settings, or try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried setting this up with both POP and IMAP settings. The settings I'm given by Hotmail/Outlook are:</p>

<h2>            Huge ribbon and icon size in Microsoft Office programs&#59; my story of one possible fix</h2>
                    I use a 175% DPI setting on my 4K screen.&nbsp; The ribbon and related icon sizes were fine till I had to change to 100% DPI size temporarily.&nbsp; When I went back to 175%, the ribbons and icons in all the Microsoft Office programs had become much larger.&nbsp; After
 unsuccessfully searching the community posts, I prayed.&nbsp; Then the thought occurred to me, "Change the DPI to 150%, then back to 175%."&nbsp; When I went to 150%, the ribbons and icons had all returned to their normal size (relative to 150% DPI).&nbsp; Then I changed
 it back to 175%, and, voila, the ribbons and icons were back to the proper size.&nbsp; Whew, after an hour of trying.&nbsp; Prayer works.&nbsp; Our Lord is Lord of the cyber world too.&nbsp; :o)

            <p>4K screen ... oooh ... I'm jealous (but I'm hoping to soon get one too, next time they are on sale).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm this tip works for Word 2013 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I was playing around with QAT button size, mouse touch and back while working on another question.&nbsp; But after returning to mouse mode, the 2013 buttons did not return all the way back to normal size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, on Win 8.0 on a HD screen (rotated to Portrait) I started at 100% DPI, bumped it up to the max, 150%, and then back down to 100%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yahoo, it fixed my problem too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip.</p>

            <p>Rohn007,</p>
<p>You bet; glad to have helped.&nbsp; Another thing I forgot to mention in my discussion is how to get rid of text fuzziness in some programs should you have run into that.&nbsp; It is strange that in, say, Outlook, there was no text fuzziness, but in a tax software,
 there was fuzziness.&nbsp; I discovered on the box where you set the DPI, there's a check box that says, "Use Windows XP style DPI scaling."&nbsp; When I checked that box, the fuzziness all went away.&nbsp; You get to that box using this path: Control Panel&gt;Display&gt;Set custom
 text size (DPI) (on the left panel of the Windows 7 Display screen).</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t clicking on Footnotes on the View menu in Normal view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendagriffing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t clicking on Footnotes on the View menu in Normal view bring up the note pane in Word 2003&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to decouple chapter text and endnotes. Word 2003 Help says to switch to Normal view and click Footnotes in the View menu. I do this,&nbsp;and not only does changing to Normal cause the notes to disappear, but there's no set of menu options that would allow
 me to click Endnote Separator.</p>
<p>There also isn't one in the Insert menu, with the References option. How can I accomplish the decoupling?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I have checked with related team&nbsp;</span>that your Account Anniversary Day is 4th (the date you created the account) while the Subscription Anniversary Day is 22nd (the date you purchased the subscription).
 Since the AAD is smaller than the SAD, the next invoice will be generated on December 5th, 2017. Since you paid the subscription by credit card, our system will charge you on 6th December, 2017. There is no invoice in November as no billing period for one
 month. All your license change history will be reflected on your December‚Äôs invoice.</p>
<p>

<h2>            License conflict between KMS and Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, we activate our Microsoft Office 2013 using KMS. &nbsp;One of our users installed the newest version of project 365 which has created an apparent license conflict</p>
<p>She doesn't want to run anything else besides project 365, but it's broken the licensing for the existing 2013 Pro plus products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I Manually reactivated, using&nbsp;cscript ospp.vbs /act, and then /dstatus shows that the 2013 product is successfully activated (but also lists the (inactivated) office 365 product in the same status output..) Launching any 2013 product, and then opening a

<h2>            There isn&#39;t enough memory to complete the Automation object operation on the Worksheet object &#40;Access 2013&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Got this error after upgrading from Access 2007 to Access 2013 when trying to use the embedded pivot table functionalty in my Access application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking another <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-access/there-isnt-enough-memory-to-complete-the/bc5e479e-c270-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">

<p>
</p><p>it turns out that Access 2013 has deprecated embedded pivot tables:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Pity that Access 2013 doesn't give a more meaningful error message... I will likely create a stand-alone Excel spreadsheet that connects to the queries I built in Access and do my Pivot Tabling from there. It should give me the same sort of functionality
 - albeit now I have to manage a separate Excel spreadsheet rather than relying on Access to do that for me.</p>

            Good suggestion RunningManHD - cross tabs would indeed work, but they don't offer the user-friendliness, drag-and-drop features of Pivot Tables in Excel. I look at my data a whole bunch of ways, and don't really want to create a cross-tab for each. Building
 a single data-warehouse type query that had all the data in it that I needed in Access and then using pivot tables to sort/group/count/sum/etc... my data by all the different criteria in the large query using drag and drop in Excel has always been quite lot
 easier than writing custom cross tabs. Of course, building the initial query took time... but I did that years ago and now just want to keep the ease of Pivot Tables.

            <p>I got this working, but there were a couple of gotchas...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Regardless of the different connector you choose to link the Access 2013 query to the pivot table in Excel (Jet OLE DB, Access 15.0 connector, ODBC, MS Query), your Access query can no longer include the 'Nz' function (nor I suspect any other customer
 Access functions). In my case, I rewrote my queries to use the Iif(isNull(x), &lt;null value&gt;, x) pattern. See&nbsp;<a href="http://dailydoseofexcel.com/archives/2008/01/10/cant-access-table-in-ms-query/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dailydoseofexcel.com/archives/2008/01/10/cant-access-table-in-ms-query/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Excel 2013 has a new feature with Pivot Tables called Data Models - whereby you can link use more than one data source for a single pivot table. Pretty cool - except in my case (where I only wanted one source anyway), I discovered that checking the "Add
 to data model" (or however it is actually worded) in the create connector phase meant that grouping on date fields (if you want to show your data points grouped by month, quarter, year etc...) was no longer available. Took me a while to spot that one and this
 post helped:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.webr2.com/excel-2013-pivot-tables-group-greyed-out-unable-to-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.webr2.com/excel-2013-pivot-tables-group-greyed-out-unable-to-group/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Not really a gotcha, but I think I wound up using the Jet OLE DB connector (called "Office Data Connection" when you check the Connection settings in Excel 2013) to actually connect to my query in Access 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Also, not a big deal, but I added the location of my Access 2013 database to the list of trusted locations within Excel 2013 to save having to "Enable" the Excel spreadsheet every time I opened it. You may not be so trusting of data on your own computer...</p>

<p>hi pamal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we can create security groups in the office 365 admin center and the exchange admin center. to do that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.create security groups in the exchange admin center:</p>
<p>log into <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">the portal</span></a> using the global admin account&gt;admin&gt;exchange&gt;recipients&gt;groups&gt;expand the plus icon and select security group.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7596518a-7352-477d-bff4-4675a9f655b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7596518a-7352-477d-bff4-4675a9f655b8" /></a></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>note:</b> for the security groups created in the exchange admin center, we can email them or assign sharepoint permissions to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.create security groups in the office 365 admin center:</p>
<p>log into <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">the portal</span></a> using the global admin account&gt;groups&gt;click the plus icon&gt;check
<b>security group&gt;next</b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b430ffbe-4e81-4c52-ae12-2f95fe979452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db430ffbe-4e81-4c52-ae12-2f95fe979452" /></a></span></p>
<p><b>note:</b> the security groups created in the office 365 admin center are used to assign sharepoint permissions to the members of the groups. we can't email the security groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-edit-or-delete-a-security-group-55c96b32-e086-4c9e-948b-a018b44510cb?ui=en-us&amp;rs=en-us&amp;ad=us#__groups_in_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Hi Mohamad,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it seems that kanji doesn‚Äôt appear when you type hiragana in Office 2016 in Windows 10. If yes, I‚Äôd like you to first check whether you have updated the version of the Office 2016 applications to the latest version. If no, update
 the version, restart the computer and then do a test to see and let us know the result. Could you upload a full screenshot of the page showing the Account page in Word 2016? You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If no, list the detailed reproducing steps of the issue you are experiencing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, I‚Äôd like you to check if you can use Japanese IME to type hiragana to kanji in Notepad. I also suggest you re-install Japanese IME, restart the computer and then do a test to see the outcome.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you change the status to </span><span>„ÅÇ</span><span> </span><span>in Japanese IME? About ‚Äú</span><span>When look into dictionary, error message popup ‚ÄòCannot open custom dictionary‚Äô.</span>‚Äù, could you upload some related screenshots?</p>

<p>Hi Yoshinobu&amp;apos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested with the steps you shared from my side and following are my result:</p>
<p>1. Save an Excel file which is sended by other to local drive&gt; Open it to edit and save it.</p>
<p>2. Upload the file to a SharePoint document library.</p>
<p>3. Open the file in Excel Online and then open it in Excel client&gt; No alert to ask me to repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand your situation and provide help for you, please help confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. What is your Mac OS version?</p>
<p>2. Could you please help capture a screenshot of the error message to share with me?</p>
<p>3. If you copy the content in the affected file to a new workbook and upload it to SharePoint to open it, will the alert pop up again?</p>
<p>4. When did the issue start to occur? Were there any changes made prior to the issue occurring?</p>
<p>5. Does the issue only happen with Excel files which are from Excel for Windows?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I marked Phillip's reply as Answer because it is the likely cause. Those characters on sheet tab names are also a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your install of Office is right up to date. I would not expect that your copy of Excel is at fault here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see if we can rule out problems with SharePoint or OneDrive. If you use File &gt; Save As and save the file locally, do you still have problems when subsequently re-opening the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if you save locally then copy the file to SharePoint or OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if you try copying from SharePoint or OneDrive to your local drive before trying to open it?</p>

<p>Hi Shiva,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good to know your problem is solved. About your concern on this, the CNAME is a DNS record that basically points a domain name at another domain name.(In this scenario, your WebSite IP address.) And
 a name server is what resolves a human friendly domain name into an IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All you want is to combined your Domain purchased in Microsoft with your Website, so the CNAME will do the trick. When a DNS request is made for your domain, it will be automatically resolved to your
 WebSite IP address.</p>
<p>Hope this information could help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably easier to leave your nameservers as alone and let them continue to point at microsoft that way you won't have to wait for propagation again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing you have purchased a business Office 365 product like Exchange Online or Office 365 Business Essentials so I will reply based on this assumption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To get to the admin area for your Office 365 business suite login to www.admin.microsoft.com</p>
<p>2. On left menu click on show more (or something like that) to show the Setup</p>
<p>3. Under setup click on Domains</p>
<p>4. Select your domain from the list.</p>
<p>5. From the slide out menu you want to make sure there is no A records.</p>
<p>6. Add 3 new A records 1. @ 2. ftp 3. www and in the address field it should always be the IP address of your webserver that your on at Godaddy you should be able to see that in your go daddy control panel somewhere or on the welcome email from them when
 you signed up. Make TTL 1 hour or 3600 seconds.</p>
<p>7. Adding these 3 A records will direct web traffic to your website at godaddy whilst MX traffic will continue to be delivered to Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the go daddy side you will have add the domain you want to use when you signed up the account so the domain so the traffic that is being delivered from your DNS records over at Microsoft will be automatically targeted to your Godaddy account.</p>
