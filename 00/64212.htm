<h2>            Left click and double tapping with touchpad not working.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>was using my computer earlier and the left click (with the click&nbsp;button) and clicking by double tapping with the touchpad its self&nbsp;gradually&nbsp;stopped working over the course of half an hour or so. &nbsp;I have done a system reset to before the problem happened
 and checked the drivers but that is all fine. &nbsp;I have a mouse and the left click on it works. &nbsp;I am really just out of ideas on how to fix this so any help would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. If you do have any help please try to be&nbsp;specific&nbsp;as I am not terribly good at working with computers.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You could have a hardware issue and need a good computer shop (not leeks and peeks at
<br />
a Best Buy or big box store) or technical support from the System maker.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad -
<br />
Driver's Tab - Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying
<br />
drivers), now RIGHT CLICK on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it).
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. <br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific
<br />
device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers to install or re-install.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with TouchPad
<br />
entries) and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I have only had it for 4 days now and it started on the first day. i'm kind of new to windows and stuff but i haven't got any error messages except that the graphics driver got restarted a couple of times. I have made sure all the updates are up to date
 with windows update and i also tried turning on and off hyper-v as i read somewhere this could fix flicker related issues, however in my case it didnt change a thing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it has started flickering in one note when in fullscreen mode and disappeared momentarily when turning of fullscreen drawing. &nbsp;having this said it is not triggered by any specific application it can happen any time or any where. even during bootup<br />

            <p>I also have a Surface Pro 4 and while I have experienced numerous other crashes with display drivers and windows biometric service, I have never experienced the issue you are having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed all the Windows Updates (including 10/23 and 11/2 Surface updates), I suspect that you have a defective hardware and you should promptly return it within your return period and buy a new one.</p>

            <p>I have installed all the latest drivers and firmware updates but aside from the display driver crashing and recovering issue (which others have reported), the display has a tendency to flicker and jump, particularly when Chrome and/or Edge is running. &nbsp;The
 first time I saw this, the entire display was corrupted with multi-coloured lines running across the screen and I had to reset it. &nbsp;Since then, it has never been that bad but the sporadic flickering/jumping which is sometimes isolated to parts of the screen
 and disappear after I close Chrome or Edge prevents me from using this as my daily driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bch49pmvvj2b4mn/VID_20151202_171145.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to a video I took of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone noted the same and would this be a software or hardware issue?</p>
<p>

            <p>These&nbsp;seem like the exact problems I'm having with my Surface pro 4.</p>
<p>The glitches don't appear&nbsp;on the desktop and don't&nbsp;seem to affect all apps, at least not all the time (as in, let's say opening&nbsp;Edge&nbsp;causes&nbsp;these lines, while OneNote runs without a problem.)&nbsp;Occasionally the multi-coloured lines show up on the boot-up screen
 (That says "Surface") and on the lockscreen. This flickering also seems to disappear if you run apps&nbsp;windowed, somewhat apart from the edges of the screen. For me moving these windows near the bottom right corner seems to trigger the glitching. The 12/2/2015
 update didn't seem to fix these problems.</p>
<p>Does what I described sound familiar?</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I can't give any real solutions though.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The glitch does happen on my desktop/home screen although this is quite rare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has just happened with Windows Explorer maximized although it stopped as soon as I set it to windowed - You might be on to something as parts of the start going crazy with flashing/weird colored line as soon as I drag the Windows Explorer window pass
 the edges of the display (where part of the window is now off-screen). &nbsp;I am trying to see if I can duplicate this with Chrome or Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Hyper-V does not help with the above nor did installing the beta display drivers from Intel (have since reverted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SensorDiagnosticsTablet.diagcab" tool also does not run, crashing every time with the message "Scripted Diagnostics Native Host has stopped working" although this may
 not be related.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just realized there are two updates on Windows Update - KB3116908 and System Hardware Update - 02/12/205. &nbsp;Will install and revert if any changes although it appears they do not help based on your post.</p>

<br />
It is on the Taskbar at the very lower left. The Windows key on your keyboard<br />
should also bring up the menu. Note the "All Apps" choice there.<br />

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>windows update won't run on my computer anymore. I tried the windows update fix it tool and I get this error 0x80070057 after running it. I still can't download windows update, it hangs and does nothing. Also, windows update shows a Red shield and says I've
 never updated at all, why? In history it shows update history with a lot of failed updates for the past 3 or 4 days now, why?</p>

            <p>I don't need help with my Dell printer anymore.... haven't used that printer in years.&nbsp; For some reason when I posted the question about windows update problems it also added the question I asked about my Dell printer back in 2015?&nbsp; What I really need help
 with is why I'm having so many problems with my windows updates on my windows 7 home premium, 64 bit?</p>

            So I was able to run this finally but it's been searching for updates for some time now.... this is the same thing that windows update does on my computer and it never stops or shows updates to download.&nbsp; Also before I did this I restored my computer to
 an earlier date and my windows update is now showing updates but they won't download, they run, run, run and never download.&nbsp; Windows 10 is one of the updates but I don't want that so I uncheck that box.&nbsp; Could windows 10 up be the problem I'm having with
 my computer now?&nbsp; Last week, for some reason it started to run but I stopped it because I don't want it.&nbsp; Ever since then I've had nothing but problems with Windows Update on my Windows 7 64bit Home Premium.&nbsp; The windows update stand alone installer is still
 searching for updates so how long does this take anyway?&nbsp; Is it even working?

            Unfortunately I'm not able to change my update settings because I am the administrator on my computer and it's set on check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them.&nbsp; How would I change these settings?&nbsp; I've looked for a solution
 in the past but never found one.&nbsp; So, is there a way to change Windows Update to update automatically after I get this windows update problem fixed?

<p>We keep getting a message to load an update and after the console re-starts it freezes and we either get system files are missing or corrupt?. We also encountered an e71 error this morning but that seems to have gone away?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try changing the settings to something else as if you planned to leave it that way and then go back<br />
and change them to how you wish.&nbsp;Did you check and reset the Power Plan AND its advanced settings?<br />
<br />
A virus would not likely do that.<br />

Control Panel - Power Options - upper left - Choose what Closing the Lid does.<br />

Also check the Change Plan Settings for the Power Plans and the Advanced Options for each.<br />

Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to check window&#39;s &#34;Proof of license&#34; code to tell if your software is genuine or not&#63;   </h2>
                    A received a computer with windows XP already installed on it. When I went to download a security pack, it told me my windows copy may not be genuine because it could not find a Volume license key. On my computer the registry code for windows is on the
 bottom. I was wondering if you could put in your code somewhere to tell if it is genuine or pirated.

            Hi Ken
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device. 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809 , if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h3> vitamin ex  say:</h3>
<h2>            ilomilo &#43; save data</h2>
                    <p>When ilomilo&nbsp;first got released on the 360 I bought it day one and thought the game was amazing. Then after upgrading from Win 7 to Win 10 I noticed it was on the app store. I thought maybe it was backwards compatible and I wouldn't have to buy it again
 but sadly it wasn't so I was compelled to buy it once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's been years since I have had an Xbox 360 (due to my previous 6 red ringing on me) and had the chance to play the game, I was expecting to start a new game once I launched it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where things get confusing. For a game that isn't backwards compatible, it has a data sync function which takes your old 360 save data and syncs it with the Win 10 app version. If it can do that then one would think it's the same game...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have a game that I just bought on the app store thinking it was a new version of a game I finished years ago but instead I get a new app with everything already 100% completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to delete the save file and maybe a way to disable the sync? I'm looking to play through it from a new save file but there is no option in game to delete your save data or to turn off the sync funtion&nbsp;which kinda ruins the game in my
 opinion.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, I don't have an Xbox and I think that probably one of the worst&nbsp;designs I have seen. Forcing people to own an Xbox just to manage&nbsp;your save data for a virtual app from the app store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some kind of work around? Like using the firewall to block the game from connecting to the internet to sync the data, and deleting the data locally?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there a way to get a refund for the game since there is no possible way to start a new game and no reason to even play it?</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center Album Artist Tag &#40;For Various Artist - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billy_k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center Album Artist Tag &#40;For Various Artist Compilation Albums&#41; Not Recognized With Search Feature</h2>
                    My assumption is that&nbsp;when you have a compilation album with several artists, the album artist tag for all tracks is supposed to be set to "various artists" and each individual track will have a unique artist tag.
<br />
<br />
When seaching for an artist in windows media center it correctly displays the unique artist tag from the compilation album, however the issue is that&nbsp;when the i attempt to actually play the track it only displays a message "There are no songs by this artist."<br />
<br />
Am I configuring the tags or something incorrectly? If I were to have unique album artists it would treat the compilation album as several unique albums which i think is an unacceptable outcome...<br />
<br />
Has anyone else encountered this issue? Any advice, links to updated software, or whatever would be helpful... Thanks!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This issue could occur if the Media center is not updated to the new album art..</p>
<p>To find that Windows 7 Media Center is still using the old album art in various places throughout the program? Its a common problem due to the fact that Media Center utilizes an album art cache that is rarely (if ever) checked for consistency.</p>
<p>Lets take a look in rectifying the problem</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first thing youll need to do is enable the viewing of hidden files and folders through the control panel. Open up the control panel from the start menu and select Appearance and Personalization<br />
<br />
On the next screen choose the option under Folder Options marked Show Hidden Files and Folders<br />
<br />
This will bring up an options dialog with a large number of settings to customize your folder appearance inside Windows Explorer. By default Windows hides a number of folders that are commonly used by installed programs to store important data to protect them
 from less experienced users. Well need to see these folder to navigate the folder structure to clear our album art cache however.</p>
<p>To enable showing hidden files and folders mark the selection to Show hidden files, folder and drives and press OK. Thats all there is to it. Note that you dont need to uncheck the option to Hide protected operating system files, nor is it recommended.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hack7mc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/folderoptions.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hack7mc.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f09%2ffolderoptions_thumb.png" /></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Once we can see hidden folders open up Windows Explorer from the programs menu and navigate to the C:\Users folder and open the folder with the same name as your username. Inside youll now see a slightly transparent folder named AppData<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hack7mc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/appdata.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hack7mc.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f09%2fappdata_thumb.png" /></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong>Open this folder then navigate into the \local\Microsoft\ehome folder inside. You should now be in C:\Users\USERNAME\local\Microsoft\ehome and there should be a folder named Art Cache. Right click this folder and select the delete option<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hack7mc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/artcache.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hack7mc.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f09%2fartcache_thumb.png" /></a><br />
<br />
Now the next time you launch Windows 7 Media Center and enter the Music section the program will reload all the album cover art from the files. This process could take quite some time depending on the size of your collection. Thats all there is to it! You
 should now have a completely refreshed album art cache inside Media Center&nbsp;</p>

            <p>answer is probably don't use Edge :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can click the three dots and click open with Internet Explorer, then right click the blank space on the top and enable the Menu, then you will find File is back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to avoid that, do a search on Internet Explorer then pin it to Start menu so you can find it (its buried in there) or install Firefox</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a third party software. I was using this since a month now, and have been facing this issue since a couple of days.</p>
<p>Non of its sub components are working now, and not even allowing me to install it from scratch,</p>

            Hi Swarup, that error generally means one of two things
<br />
<br />You are trying to install a 64bit application into the 32bit version of Windows 10 - have you re-installed Windows lately?
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />The Installation files are corrupt - have you tried downloading the installation files again . . .

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The system OS and installables both are 64-bit, yes I have re-installed the windows after this error has came out.</span></strong></span><br />

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erhankarabekir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    My computer is set for automatic download and installation of Microsoft updates. I was assuming that I already had the anniversary update installed on my computer. I wanted to very this so I checked the version and compared it to the version&nbsp;that, some
 sources say, should be Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.10); the current version on my computer is 1511 (OS Build 10586.545). My OS is Windows 10 Pro x64-bit. Why has my computer missed the anniversary update since it is set to automatically install updates? Microsoft
 Update has been installating updates ever since I bought the computer. Do I have a problem with Windows Update on my computer? If this is the case, how do I repair Windows Update? I run Windows Update frequently and it says "no updates have been found". I
 would appreciate advice on this issue. Just one reminder: my operating system was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit.

Ive got 57 gigs free, and it doesnt start with these errors. The reserving space works fine for a while, then these happen. Plus the errors at the bottom. At least thats what I noticed at a glance.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. I can install 4.5 framework fine, and it works, and most of my programs work. But I have a few that needs 4.0, and well, this seems like a bigger and deeper issue than just 4.0.<br />
<br />
I dont have a Windows 7 CD. &nbsp;It came installed on the PC I bought from Tiger Direct.<br />
<br />
AMD Dual 2.43 ghz<br />
6Gigs DDR&nbsp;<br />
250gb hd<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Rewards is terrible on Xbox</h2>
                    Why is it so hard for it to track the achievements you get for games? The first day of this month I got 2 Achievements on Oblivion for the ESO + Oblivion one, and they still haven't counted. For the Pedal to the Metal one, I have 2 achievements on that
 MX vs ATV game, and it's still yet to count.

            You're not wrong about it being a bit wonky at times. I'm personally just glad it's there at all, because there are some reward opportunities that aren't available on PC. Over time, the experience will get more stable. The app is still pretty new. However,
 if you do the requirements for a reward and the reward doesn't just show up late, but never shows up, that's when I'd reach out and let Microsoft know.

            The previous month the achievements counted pretty much instantly. I don't know if I should try and get more achievements, and get annoyed when they don't get counted, or wait and risk it ending without finishing all the quests

            That might have worked, had the achievements for Oblivion and MX had not been drowned out by other achievements. but I'll remember that for next month, thnaks.

            Yea sometimes it can be a bit odd, but I just let the rewards go in the background and often forget about them. They will add up eventually. Just keep playing and doing your best. You wont lose out on any points even though it may take a few days for some
 to appear.

<p>Happens sometimes when the achievements are not listed or pop up after completion.</p>
<p>At certain time after login we get all notifications of achievements listed.</p>
<p>Probably an update would get this fixed.</p>

            I rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it. I'm guessing you're new the Rewards app on Xbox. It's been like this ever since they started the quests. Some are instant updated and some don't update at all. What does work 100% is contacting
 Microsoft Rewards Support and they can help you with the quests that don't update.

<h2>            can I add a brief description to each photo which will appear on the photo when I display them&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to add a brief description onto each photo so that it appears when I display the photo full screen ( in a similar way to keeping hard copies in a photograph album).&nbsp; Is this possible?<br />

            <p>The freeware Picasa has several options<br />
for adding text to the face of photos. <br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create<br />
a System Restore point before installing<br />
software or updates)<br />
<br />
Picasa<br />
<a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://picasa.google.com/</a><br />
<br />
After downloading and installing Picasa...<br />
open the program and double left click<br />
an image to open the editing features.<br />
<br />
To add text to the face of the photo...<br />
choose...Basic Fixes / Text Button...<br />
<br />
'Basic Fixes' features: Crop, Add Text, Retouch <br />
