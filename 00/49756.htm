<h2>            Chinese characters not displaying correctly</h2>
                    <p>We just got a new computer with a fresh Windows 10 installed. When trying to install games from Chinese suppliers, we get the following image:</p>

<p>At first I thought it was a unicode issue but that doesn't seem to be it. Most searches bring me to this link:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020102/windows-10-update-kb4020102 . Downloaded the specific update for this only to be told it wasn't
 compatible with current windows installed. Any help?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;CurisoDiablo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few reasons why some characters are unidentified when installing or launching a game, like missing system files specific to the program, language package required by the program, or at times, newly released patches needed for the game to name
 a few. In order for me to have a better idea on your concern, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To clarify, what is the current version and build installed on your computer?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box, then type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li><li>Do you get the same issue when installing other games on your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?</li><li>Have you tested if the issue is happening on other user profiles?</li><li>Are you able to successfully install the game but get the missing characters still?</li><li>What's the name of the game that you are trying to install?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you keep your <strong>Windows 10</strong> installed with the latest version and build. This is to ensure that previous issues would be addressed on your computer. If you don't receive any updates on your computer, running
 the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> would be a good start in addressing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the unidentified characters, I would recommend that you install the appropriate language pack that you'll be needing. You can refer to this article in case you wish to
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-language-interface-packs-to-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">add or change the language interface of your Windows 10</a></strong>. However, If you're able install
 the game, and you wish to only keep just the language of the game on your preferred language, then you might want to consider tweaking the settings inside the game, and ensure that the game is installed with the latest patch from the developer's game website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep me posted, for me to assist you further.</p>

    <title>How do I remove the parental account from my xbox live account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jomama3115  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove the parental account from my xbox live account&#63; &#40;I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m 18, turning 19 in Sep.&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I first got an xbox live account at around 2007/2008 and I was 14 that time and I would need the approval of my parents to have public chats during games or being able to receive messages and get into parties with my friends. &nbsp;Now that I'm 18, I saw that
 I still needed approval of my parents email to access some things. &nbsp;How can i remove this now? since I am now of age to do things like download rated M demos or buy games that are rated M. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox LIVE determines whether an account is a child account or an adult account based on the age of the account owner. Account owners who are younger than 18 are given child accounts in the United States. The legal adult age varies by country and region (for
 example, the adult age in Korea is 20).</p>
<p>Child accounts are tied to an adult's Windows Live ID. The adult account can control Family Settings and restrict some features of Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>After you reach the age of adulthood (which varies by country and region), you can promote a child account to an adult account. This promotion removes the Family Settings and Xbox LIVE restrictions.</p>
<p>To promote a child account to an adult account</p>
<p>Sign in to Xbox LIVE by using the account that you want to change.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, and then select Account.</p>
<p>Select Promote Child Account.</p>
<p>Note This option is available only if the date of birth for the account indicates that you have reached the age of adulthood (18 in the United States). The legal adult age varies by country and region. The age of an account owner is calculated by using the
 date of birth provided when the account was created. This date cannot be changed. If you entered an incorrect date of birth when you created the account, your only option is to create a new account using the correct date of birth.</p>
<p>Follow the on-screen instructions to promote the account.</p>
<p>Note If you want to control the console itself - for example, to limit the amount of time the console can be used on a daily basis, or limit the content types that can be viewed on the console - please see Xbox 360 console parental controls. To learn about

<p>The sugestions here do not work as of the Xbox-live November update. Sinds you need to acept the new terms of use to change youre settings. AND to do that you still need the parental account.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate &#40;VHD&#41; ... Multiple Video Cards &#40;Workstation&#47;Gaming&#41;</h2>
                    I'm building an X58 chipset system and looking for a solution for installing a workstation and gaming graphic cards on the same system.&nbsp; The issue arises from the fact you can't have multiple video drivers installed at the same time, or can you?&nbsp; From
 what I have read the Quadro drivers of the workstation card are separate from the driver the Geforce series uses.&nbsp; One solution would be to have multiple installations of windows on separate partitions.&nbsp; My question is, would VHD give me a better solution
 allowing me to switch between installations more quickly?

            Hi Montwells.com,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows 7 introduces support for enabling multimon across display adapters from different driver manufacturers. Windows Vista only supported multimon when all display adapters were from the same manufacturer, such as all ATI cards or all Nvidia cards. This
 restriction is removed for Windows 7, as long as the drivers being used are WDDM 1.1 drivers.<br />
<br />
You may go ahead and try installing the driver for both the video card and check if it works. Post back if you come across any issue with error messages (If any), so that we can help you better. I would suggest you to create a system restore point before trying
 this to be on the safer side. You may also contact the video card manufacturer for better help.<br />
<br />

Hope this information is helpful.<br />

            <p>Try reloading the Ethernet driver for your computer.&nbsp; On another machine, go to the driver support page for your computer:<br />

<br />
Select the "Windows XP" operating system and the "Network" category.&nbsp; Find your appropriate driver, download it, transfer it to your OptiPlex computer, and install it.&nbsp; There is also a Broadcomm Diagnostics Utility at the same place you can run if that doesn't
 solve your problem.</p>

            Usually that has to do with setting up default program or failure to do so.
<p>Check to see if default is set to the following applictions....</p>
<p>1. Internet Explorer ( or your main browser if you have more than one.)</p>
<p>2. Your Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>Here is how and I am using IE as example. Procedures are the same for Windows Live Mail......</p>
<p>Start button &gt; Default \programs &gt; Set Your Default Programs &gt; left column, click Internet Explorer ( or your main browser )....</p>
<p>On the right column, does it say " This program has all its default " ?</p>
<p>If no, click Choose Defaults for this program &gt; check all the boxes under the list &gt; cick Save when done.</p>
<p>Do the same for Windows Live Mail</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to make some clarifications to fully diagnose your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Do you still experience the issue?</p>
<p>&gt; When you said "Windows Live Mail for everyday", are you referring to the Windows Live Mail Client or email account with @live.com?</p>
<p>&gt; "CANNOT&nbsp; OPEN&nbsp; LINKS&nbsp; FROM&nbsp; SPECIFIC&nbsp; SENDERS" -&nbsp;What is the email providers of the "specific senders" in which you are having problems opening the links?</p>
<p>&gt; Does it mean that generally you can open links, the problem occurs on these "specific senders" only?</p>
<p>&gt; Do you encounter the issue even when accessing the email using other browser?</p>
<p>&gt; Do you encounter the issue even when accessing the email using other computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Hi there.</div>
<div>
<div>
1. the videos i'm trying to play are those from my dslr camera. (quicktime file)</div>
<div>
2. they automatically came up as Windows&nbsp;TV and Movie documents, but I've tried to open it with Media Player and Quicktime and it doesn't work on any of them, just a black screen. I do believe the version of Media Player is the most recent as it said it was
 downloaded in July.</div>
<div>
3. Only on the videos that I hadn't opened on the laptop, all the ones on that I had previously moved from the card unto the laptop and had watched, were visible.</div>
<div>
<div>
Thanks</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the first instruction and it didn't work so I moved on to the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took about 5 seconds to complete the command and it came up with "error 87" (being the videos - I assume). It then said "Online /Cleanup-Image/RestoreHealth option is unknown... refer to help by running the dism.exe" which I did. And there was a lot of
 information on things that I had done before from september 30th and then there was huge jump to today december 4th. Not sure if thats relevant information, but thats all I have for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>i have struggled through this for 4 days and no one online&nbsp; had a suggestion that worked or that I could understand.&nbsp; (i am just a 70 year old non computer science guy).&nbsp; i thought that the problem was not ejecting the stick or ejecting too soon; but no</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed USB sticks and it worked.&nbsp; I tried with 4 others and they all worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure what the problem with the first stick was but I tried doing a quick format and a full format with no luck.&nbsp; It is about 8 years old and works for transferring documents but lots of problems with pictures (.JPG) and now&nbsp; .MOV files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck; hope that this works for you<br />

    <title>How to disable auto screen dimming&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable auto screen dimming&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop have a weird problem, everytime, when I unplug the power cord while it is running a game, then plug it back in later. The screen keep dimming whenever a dark scene is on, not only it is dimming when a specified program running, but whatever rendered,
 no matter if it's an image, movie, game, desktop. It dims according to what was showed up on screen, the darker the scene, the more it dims, not to the surround light (through the light sensor).</p>
<p>I have tried some guide online like configuring power plan's option, configuring integrated graphic driver's settings, none work. But if I reinstall the dedicated graphic driver, the problem is fixed, until I have to unplug the machine again. I figured it
 out, this problem is more related to hardware driver, but still I think this have something to do with how the OS control driver's settings to adapt to the power plan/power source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop's specification (Acer Aspire VX5-591G):</p>
<p>- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7300HQ</p>
<p>- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050</p>
<p>- OS:&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 16299) (16299.rs3_release.170928-1534)</p>

    <title>Surface Book display driver STILL crashing when attaching clipboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paceadvantage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book display driver STILL crashing when attaching clipboard</h2>
                    <p>I have all the latest updates and drivers applied as of the latest driver updates on May 25</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem, which has existed since just about my first day with this Surface Book, which I bought back in February, is that when reattaching the clipboard to the base, about 30-40% of the time, the screen will go black and stay black. The surface book is
 still running, but it appears the display driver crashed and did not recover. The only way out of this is to hold the power button down for 10+ seconds, then turn the machine back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the i7 with the dGPU and 8GB ram...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing that I have found on the internet that has helped me solve this problem. Not even a workaround. It's VERY frustrating to have to hard-shutdown/reboot almost half the time I go to attach the clipboard back to the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I seem to be one of the few who still have this problem, despite all the driver updates these past few months?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I'd be happy for even some goofy workaround that at least would stop me from having to hold the power button down for 10 seconds to get out of this constant mess.</p>

<p>Quick question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your screen flash/flicker once right after attaching the clipboard? Even when my screen doesn't go black and become unresponsive, I always get a quick flash/flicker right after attaching the clipboard. Curious if people who don't experience my kind
 of crash also get the flicker these days...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you referring to the quick blink of the display that happens when you attach the clipboard? If so, this is normal behavior on the Surface Book (at least the ones with the nvidia dGPU in the base). It's recognizing the additional video adapter and usually
 makes the new hardware found sound as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have the black screen on attach or detach a lot, too. But that mostly seems to have stopped after I started routinely running the system file checker and DISM commands (using a downloaded tech bench Windows 10 image) following each Windows 10 update
 every month. Windows Update is probably still introducing file corruption (something MS is aware of, I believe), but it has yet to be fixed (maybe in the next big update to Windows 10 coming this summer).</p>

<h2>            Task Manager only showing services</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;I didn't know for sure what topic to put this under-sorry if I am in the wrong place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;am using &nbsp;Windows7 SP1 64bits. &nbsp;When I&nbsp;click on &nbsp;"Start Task Manager" from the taskbar the only thing that comes up in the window is the screen with all the &nbsp;services and if they are running or stopped. &nbsp;Nothing about memory, or the number of processes
 - it doesn't even have an X at the top right hand side to close out of that window (I have to use the taskbar)&nbsp;&nbsp;the green icon does shows up on the taskbar which tells me the percentage the CPU is using. That's it, &nbsp;and I am wondering what happened.</p>
<p>Has something made this change? I would appreciate your take on this. Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you double click the empty space around the border of the Task Manager display it will switch back to regular mode and then you should see the tabs you are used to seeing.</p>

<h2>            Error Code &#34;80073712&#34; When trying to use windows update, run programs, install software</h2>
                    <p>I've been having some problems running programs, today I wanted to use Radeon Pro and it had a grayed out "Install this feature" with a "Skip this installation" (Or something along those lines) then gave me a frustrating reoccurring error code: 80073712</p>
<p>I searched online for help and thought it was because of .NET Framework 3.5, I proceeded to do an offline install of 3.5, but all that did was skip the "Install this feature" screen.</p>
<p>I tried using windows update but got the same error code.</p>
<p>I read online that using DISM would fix the problem, so I used the command: <strong>
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth </strong>and it returned this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\system32&gt;Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth<br />
<br />
Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />
Version: 6.3.9600.16384<br />
<br />
Image Version: 6.3.9600.16384<br />
<br />
The component store is repairable.<br />
The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran the command <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </strong>
and it returned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\system32&gt;Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</p>
<p>Version: 6.3.9600.16384</p>
<p>
</p><p>[========================100.0%====================]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 14098</p>
<p>
</p><p>The component store has been corrupted</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM log file can be found at C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>I further read online and saw some suggestions to try use Powershell</p>
<p>
</p><p>CheckHealth said the store was fine, however ScanHealth and RestoreHealth said store is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? I've been trying to fix this for hours, quite ridiculous really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I thought I might add the update that is having errors: Windows 8.1 Update for x64 based Systems (KB2919355)</p>

            For example, if you want to find MS Word:<br />
<br />
press <strong>Start</strong> &gt; type in search box: <strong>Word</strong> &gt; you will find on the list
<strong>Microsoft Office Word</strong> <br />
<br />
You can also run them using run window:<br />
<ul>
<li>to run Word: press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>winword</strong> and press enter
</li><li>to run Excel: press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>excel</strong> and press enter
</li><li>to run PowerPoint: press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>powerpnt</strong> and press enter
</li><li>to run Outlook: press <strong>WinKey+R</strong> &gt; type <strong>outlook</strong> and press enter
</li></ul>
<br />
If you want to know they location on the hard drive.. I guess it will be stored on C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office

<p>Starting yesterday, the blue connection circle is constantly trying to connect and failing.&nbsp; No error message.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed.&nbsp; All of my other apps are connecting just fine.&nbsp; It is only Skype that is failing.&nbsp; The HELP page sends me round and round and round and has more than one missing or failing link.&nbsp; There is no one I can actually e-mail to ask for help from.&nbsp;
 And most important, no clue, no hint, no concept of what might have gone wrong to help me fix it.<br />
<br />
My team hates Skype.&nbsp; I've never had problems with it before but if this is what a problem with Skype is like (sorry, kid, you're screwed), then I don't blame them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a REASON you don't provide actual customer support for you customers?&nbsp; I have begun evaluating software not on how much I do or don't like the application, but based on the customer support experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;Skype customer support experience is a pure
 F right now.&nbsp; No reason to keep using it other than the conversation history at this point.<br />

<h2>            R18 Games</h2>

<p>If your parental settings are set to allow you to purchase those types of games, then you should have no problems. (See this for more info -

<p>You just can't download free demos or trailers until you can promote your account to an adult account.</p>
