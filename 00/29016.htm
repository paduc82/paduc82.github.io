<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

 I'm running xp sp3 and it has the intel intergrated grafix driver on it. Which apparently handles how im aloud to control my monitor setting... Can any one help me get my display to be widescreen?

            Read the manual for your display and determine its native resolution.&nbsp; It's probably either 1366x768 or 1920x1080.<br />
<br />
Then right-click on an empty spot on your Desktop and select Properties.&nbsp; Click the Settings tab. Adjust the slider under "Screen resolution" left or right so that the value matches the native resolution of your monitor.<br />

 this sounds like a Adobe problem, but trying to get any help from them doesn't seem to exist.&nbsp; Any help on how do to this would be appreciated.

<p>In my case, it is the CC version, downloaded for Win 10 64 bit. I also tried some older versions. They all worked fine before the last upgrade, and since then, the newest version does not work, and crashes all the time. It gives a message about the graphics
 processor. Trying an older version, CC2015, everything appears to work, until I try to save my work, when I get a message that I cannot save due to not enough RAM. I tried increasing the minimum on the paging file, to make sure, but still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disagree with the original poster, it is not an Adobe problem as both the latest versions of Photoshop, and an older 32 bit version installed (needed for a particular plug in that is 32 bit and does not exist for 64 bit) worked just fine before the latest
 update, and now do not, this is another Windows issue, which get worse with every freaking update.

            Hi futuristic,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Seen a lot of cases where RAID is the culprit preventing the updates. I do not have much experience to troubleshoot if RAID is an issue, but let us check if it is indeed a cause. 
<br />
<br />We would like to see the Installation log to check what caused the update to fail/stuck/rollback.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named files from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.
<br />
<br />If the logs are not present, run Media creation tool to upgrade and let it fail.       
        </p>

            Hi F.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />RAID is dated technology that doesn't play well with Windows 10.  In tens years in forums daily I've never seen anything but problems with RAID; data is always lost even though it claims to be "redundant," etc, ad nauseum.  It is almost certainly the cause of your problem; in fact it's the second case today of Version failure on RAID.
<br />
<br />I'd unRaid slowly and pick your fastest SSD drive alone to  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Later add the other drives back for storage, to move your User folders off onto if you need to offload anything and don't want to compromise SSD speed, save a System Image backup so that if WIndows ever becomes irreparable you can reimage C drive in 20 minutes and your files will be safe and current in their separate vault. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  If not just ask back anything else you need.  I'll be standing by here to help as needed with any of the steps, and will continue to help until the problem is resolved.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are already logged-in to the PC using administrator password, Backup and Restore will not require any password as it is a Windows feature. It could be possible that you have to enter the password if you are working on network PC to use Backup and
 Restore. </p>

            Hi  CoolBananas2005
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Are you sure you were not using the manufacturer's own proprietary biometics (fingerprint or face recognition)?

            This computer is custom built. However, I am using biometric devices that do work on my laptop that didn't come with a Windows Hello device installed. I'm using a Acer Windows Hello camera. But, once I tried that it said can't turn on camera. With the
 camera still plugged in, I tried using&nbsp; digitalPersona 4500, which also worked with my laptop. After configuring and reassuring that I had all the drivers set up, it still didn't work. At that point I reset my PC and reinstalled Windows, and it still didn't
 work.

            So, I checked their website and there is no indication this biometric device is Windows Hello compatible:

<br />
<br />I have also checked previous threads dating back to 2015 which around the time Windows Hello just started rolling out and only a small group of devices supported it. digitalPersona 4500 is not one of them.

<br />If you are signed in with a Microsoft Account, switch to a local account then try setting it up again.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your info
<br />Click sign in with a local account instead
<br />
<br />Enter your current password
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Enter a name, password, confirm it, enter a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Sign out and Finish
<br />
<br />Sign into the account
<br />
<br />Try configuring it again.
<br />
<br />Download and install the following driver again to see if it works:

            Thanks. I tried both solutions and unfortunately, both ended with the same results. However, with a laptop without any pre-installed Windows Hello device worked functionally with both the Acer Windows Hello Face Camera, and the dP 4500. Is there anything
 else I could try?&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm experiencing very weird problem. Windows 10 interface looks differently on two different installations of windows 10.<br />
<br />
Both of them are activated using serial number. Both of them are installed on same hardware. See attached images.<br />
I circled the different parts. Does anyone know why this might be ? <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/719d87b6-685a-431b-a111-59fcac40a285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Thank you posting on Microsoft community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you facing any issues on working with Windows because of this?</li></ul>
<p>This is because of the updates installed and the Themes selected might be different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to Install all the pending updates on both the machine and also set the default Theme and check if it resolves.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to Microsoft account and <strong>install all the pending updates.</strong></li><li><strong>Right click </strong>on the empty place&nbsp;in the <strong>Desktop </strong>
and select <strong>Personalization</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Default Theme </strong>and check.</li></ol>

<p>You fell for a scam. You should do two things:</p>
<p>1. Start all over from scratch and reinstall Windows cleanly. I don't<br />
recommend that you take the risk of continuing to use the installation<br />
you currently have. You can't be sure what they've done, and the only<br />
thing that's really secure is a clean installation.</p>
<p>2. <strong>After</strong> you've clean installed, change all your passwords (not just<br />
the bank passwords). Do it <strong>after</strong> the clean installation because<br />
whatever you do now might be automatically reported to them. <br />
And step 2 means that you should do step 1 ASAP. Do not hesitate.</p>

<h2>            My laptop won&#39;t reset&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Well i was doing a reset(i wanted to erase all my personal files) in my acer cloudbook 14 and when it reached around 47% it said there was an issue with resetting your computer. After that my laptop would just show the acer logo without the loading circle
 and then it would go black and repeat over and over again. Can someone please explain what is going on and how i can fix this?! I need my laptop to be fixed asap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver has slow performance after Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community and Technical Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after installing Windows 10 Creators Update, all 3D software I use became extremely slow in visual performance. To be exact, the software I'm using: FEKO 2017, Solidworks 2016 SP5, Altair HyperWorks 14. The features like rotating, pan, zooming or even making
 a sketch are useless now, because it takes enormously lot of time to redraw the view, moreover, whole UI is freezing, ever the CPU is not loaded at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latest driver version I have is&nbsp;<span>15.33.43.4425. The same version was on previous Windows build before Creators Update;</span></li><li>I rolled back to previous versions of driver, they behave the same way;</li><li>I deleted and reinstalled driver completely, it works perfectly exactly one day. After computer is shut down and turned on again, everything is the same as before. Should I reinstall the driver anytime I need to work?</li><li>I installed Windows 10 1703 15063.296 from scratch;</li><li>Using of OpenGL software rendering mode in an option, but it also has poor performance in big assemblies.</li><li>Tried Intel Driver Updater to search new drivers;</li><li>Tried to block the drive from automatic download and install certain version of each driver separately - no luck.</li></ul>
<p>I suppose the issue is definitely in Creators Update. Something was implemented, something was enabled what nobody knows, because obviously the same driver was working on previous Windows build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I switch something off in register? Change a parameter there? Enable or disable some options in gpedit? Run a hidden command in PowerShell? :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For information: ThinkPad x230, Windows 10 1703 15063.296, Intel HD 4000, Driver&nbsp;<span>15.33.43.4425.</span></p>

<p>Hello Evgeniy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the extensive procedures you've performed, it's highly likely that the affected programs aren't compatible with the
<strong>Creators Update</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There's still something we can do. We can try to re-install the <strong>Creators Update</strong> by using an installation media. This ensures you're using the latest version of the
<strong>Creators Update</strong>. Simply follow these instructions for doing so:<br />
</p>
<p><strong>1) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Rollback to the previous version of your Windows 10 computer</span>.</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <strong>Start Menu</strong> and type <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Once in the <strong>Settings </strong>panel click on <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Go back to an earlier build</strong>, click<strong> Get Started</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen steps.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Upgrade to the Creators Build using our Windows 10 installation media</span>.</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and click on
<strong>Download tool now</strong>.</li><li>Follow the instructions from the <strong>Using the tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10</strong> drop-down.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will also find other helpful information on the same page.<br />
<br />
After upgrading to the <strong>Creators Update</strong>, you should be able to use your apps. Otherwise, please let us know and we'll continue to help.

<p>We would like to ask for clarification for a better understanding. You mentioned that the driver worked prior to the Creators Updateâ€“this tells us that there was a previous build on your computer. Have you tried following the instructions? If not, kindly
 give it a try and see if you're able to roll back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then we'll need to do a factory reset so we can go back to the previous version of Windows. You may refer to the
<strong>Go back to your previous version of Windows</strong> drop-down in this <strong>

<p>I'd&nbsp; like to thank the OP for verifying that the poor video performance issue (when using Intel HD-4000 video HW)&nbsp; remains the same regardless of the&nbsp;upgrade method employed when moving from Win-10 1607 to 1703 -&nbsp;because their succinctly well stated findings&nbsp;saves
 me the time and effort of uselessly attempting a "completely clean" 1703 upgrade using the Creator's Build installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I ended up with the same exact poor video performance results after&nbsp;using the 1703 upgrade path afforded via the "Update &amp; security" panel...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3345faaa-4121-4c58-ade0-d8b1e6e8a698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3345faaa-4121-4c58-ade0-d8b1e6e8a698" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I believe that the post-upgrade poor video performance issues (on&nbsp;HD-4000&nbsp;equipped systems - which in my case is a 3rd Gen I7/HD-4000 equipped HP Envy Notebook) ties to the fact that&nbsp;Intel stopped issuing updates for this video driver in May of 2016.&nbsp;
 Also of note is the fact that&nbsp;their last few&nbsp;driver releases&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;some elements via "compatibility mode" for all Win-10 installations - to wit:</p>

</p><p>Fortunately (so far) the Creator Build update continues to remain an elective (via the Update panel linkage) on this HP notebook.&nbsp;Assumedly the&nbsp;compatibility diagnostics checker&nbsp;continues to flag this HD-4000 "hang-up" as an forced upgrade "no go" issue.&nbsp;An
 interesting stipulation, particularly for mobile devices (notebooks, etc.) that essentially are "ever married" to their HW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Microsoft will eventually arrive at a solution for this - I (for one)&nbsp;am certainly not willing to pitch aside a perfectly good, 5-year-old, high-performance notebook because a newly issued OS build fails to&nbsp;adequately&nbsp;address the inalterable core
 HW elements of what (at least recently was) considered mainline HW implementations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh - one last thing&nbsp;- as the OP very clearly noted in their succinctly excellent post - Win-10 1607 and all it's predecessor releases work just fine with&nbsp;3rd Gen HD-4000 video HW implementations.</p>

<p>The problem is not confined to Creator's Update. I received an unprovoked W10 Home 64bit OS major update which installed without much warning. At that time all my design programs that use Open GL for graphics rendering took a minute to re-render each model
 window when prior to the upgrade it took a second or two. I put the problem down to poor implementation of Open GL in the Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So having learned from previous major upgrades that MS always seem to have this graphics rendering bug after major upgrades, I downloaded the newest NVIDIA graphics driver and switched those programs to use the NVIDIA processor. It is now running much faster
 but by default, it seems the graphics settings of all software default to the MS Intel HD driver which is a lot older than what is currently available from the MS driver download site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice is to download a W10 graphics driver that suits your hardware and change the graphic settings to use the built-in processor if you have one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>is there any chance to get my laptop working properly? Since half of the year there was no improvement. Intel released&nbsp;15.33.45.4653 version of the drivers, but it is still
<strong>not working</strong>. I tried to install the older versions of the driver for Win 8 and Win 7, doesn't work as well. The same slow behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New <strong>Fall Creators Update</strong> gave also no results and no improvements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

</p><p>It could be that the graphics card driver is not compatible with that version of Windows 10. May we know if you have checked with the manufacturer's website if they have an updated version of that device or that if there are news/announcements about that
 particular device when dealing with the performance of the device in Windows 10 Creators Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Well. It looks like either Microsoft or Intel changed something in code, driver support or compatibility. There was no improvement prior to last Creators Fall Update (build 1709). Newly released Intel drivers (version&nbsp;<span>15.33.45.4653)&nbsp;</span>gave
 no results as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing I tried and it works for me now:</p>
<p>I walked through all driver versions downwards, reinstalling and testing them at least three days to validate the functionality. I found out, that the version&nbsp;<strong>10.18.10.3282</strong> for Windows 8.1 x64 (driver date&nbsp;26.08.2013) works well and without
 any problems already one week. I tested different software (SolidWorks, Altair Hyperworks, FEKO) and different scenarios, e.g. waking up from the sleep mode, hibernation, hyper-v on/off, shared second monitor over mini display port and other stuff â€” the driver
 works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automatic driver update was blocked in <strong>gpedit </strong>during all driver tests and installs to avoid its automatic change:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Group Policy Editor <strong>gpegit</strong>;</li><li>Go to \Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update;</li><li>Change "Do not include drivers with Windows Updates" option to <strong>enabled</strong>.</li><li>Delete you actual driver in <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> completely, including driver files;</li><li>Restart OS;</li><li>Install Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver version&nbsp;<strong>10.18.10.3282</strong>&nbsp;for Windows 8.1 x64 (driver date&nbsp;26.08.2013).</li></ol>
<p>There is no way to get this driver from official Intel Download Center, so try to Google it by yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, this works for my ThinkPad x230&nbsp;(2325CN9) with Windows 10&nbsp;(1709) and&nbsp;<span>Intel HD 4000 graphic card.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone else please confirm that this driver is working or have any issues?</p>

    <title>Installing Windows 7 on a Windows 8 computer with Advanced Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew030  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 7 on a Windows 8 computer with Advanced Startup Options</h2>
                    In Windows 8 there's an option to boot from a DVD or stick in the Advanced Startup Options, and also a button to remove everything and reinstall Windows. My question is: assuming that I don't have the boot options set to boot from CD/DVD, will one of the
 methods work to successfully install Windows 7?

<div>Yes, I want to perform a clean install of Windows 7 by formatting the hard drive. About the boot order in the BIOS: I tried changing it but there are only 2 options in the boot order menu: "Windows boot manager" and "None"</div>
<div>I tought the Windows 7 DVD must be booted only once from the start, then it just works on his own (meaning he boots as a windows), so why wouldn't the "Boot from a recovery CD/DVD" option from the Advanced startup options in Windows 8 work?</div>

            <p>Thanks very much.&nbsp; I had looked at the article without much joy, but the answer was (as usual) blindingly obvious once I'd found it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Word, where I was working, and language pack route showed that I had only English (UK) installed, I must have inadvertently hit Windows Key&nbsp;+ Space and changed the keyboard layout to French. Repeating that restored the English keyboard layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your help</p>

<h2>            Saved game erased&#63;</h2>
                    So I downloaded fable 3 on demand to my Xbox to play it. Keep in mind I already played the game before. I sold my fable 3 game disc to someone. So I was far into the game. So I turn the game on and I wanted to load up my saved game, when I clicked start
 it said " you do not have the required downloadable content necessary to load this save game. Would you like to download this content now? Free weapons". So I downloaded the free weapons content to my USB drive which contains my memory from fable 3. And then
 I plugged my USB drive into the Xbox and started up fable 3 again and it still won't work. I also tried copying my memory in my USB of fable 3 into the Xbox hard drive and I downloaded the downloadable content that was needed to start up my saved game to the
 hard drive also and still none of that worked. Could someone help me out plz?

<p>try going here type Fable in search - then select the Fable 3 icon under xbox 360 - check through all "addons" and re-download any you had previously - NOTE if you change a GAMERTAG or create a new x-box live account with new GT old saves may not work. However
 make sure you have all content you had - ALSO NOTE - It may be advisable to delete old x-box live updates and re-download them to make sure the updates stick. There may be some Items you forgot you got before there and still available for re-download -if-
 you haven't changed accounts. ALSO NOTE - if a file is corrupt or unfinished downloading this also could occur as well.</p>

<h2>            Sound keeps disappearing.</h2>
                    My sound keeps going off.&nbsp; I ran the "Fix It Now" from Microsoft but it did not help even though it did find a problem and said it fixed it.&nbsp; I have not added or deleted anything for several weeks and the sound was working fine the last time I had my computer
 on.&nbsp; I had this same problem several months ago, but not recently.&nbsp; I tried to update the drivers, but it said mine were current.&nbsp; Any other suggestions.&nbsp;

<p><span><strong><span>Hi tshady,</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></strong><span><strong><span>Step
 1:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<span><span><strong><span>Check in Device Manager for the status of the Audio Device.</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Check if you see any yellow exclamation mark.<br />
</span></strong><br />
<strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Uninstall and re-install drivers for your audio device from Device Manager and then check for the issue.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, click on Run and then type devmgmt.msc in the Run box.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>b.
 On the device Manager window, look for the Audio device under â€˜Sound, Video and Game controllersâ€™, right click on it and select Uninstall.</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>c.
 Reboot the computer.</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>d.
 On reboot, Windows should re-install the drivers automatically.</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Check
 for the issue.</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Also

<h2>            Remove &#34;Your upgrade to Windows 10 is ready&#34; from Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I've tried to upgrade to Windows 10. Windows Update is asking for me to restart. When I do, it does nothing and starts Windows normally. How do I remove the Windows 10 pre-install from my computer and just continue to use Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the install is not working as there may be a login script in my laptop, which I purchased from work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computerâ€¦..</p>
<p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update (<strong>WU</strong>)&nbsp;manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of â€œimportantâ€ updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January 14, 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people have tried Windows 10 and decided they want their Windows 7 back.&nbsp; If you are one of those, once you have Windows 7 back, you will need to take steps to keep it that way.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates
 should be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7 other than fixing security issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting â€” NEVER.&nbsp; Well you neednâ€™t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>

<li>Take Windows Update off automatic â€” <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed (below)&nbsp;updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.
