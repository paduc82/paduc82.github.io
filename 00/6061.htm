    <title>Android &#34;Push&#34; email option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidmarj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android &#34;Push&#34; email option</h2>
                    <p>I just want to know whether when the "Push" option is selected regarding mail sync with Exchange, the mobile connects to the server only when there is a change in the Inbox (which I've read somewhere in this forum), or when there is ANY change in the mailbox
 (ex. moving a mail from one folder to another etc...) at the mobile device level</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about the email settings you can utilize. Let us provide the information you need to resolve your concern. Before we continue, kindly answer the questions below for us to better clarify the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which email app are your using, the default one on your phone or is it the Outlook mail app?</li><li>Are you experiencing any issues in receiving emails also?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, Push email utilizes an email system that has real-time capability to push email through to the email account or client as soon as it arrives, rather than requiring the app to poll and collect emails manually. The email mailbox is
 constantly updated with arriving email without any intervention from the user and announces the new mail's arrival with an alert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>

    <title>&#34;Processing&#34; dialog box during every file opening event - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Processing&#34; dialog box during every file opening event</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks, I've been unable to find any mention of this across the internet with large number of search permutations so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I open an Office document on my computer, this Processing dialog pops up, progress bar seemingly meaningless, and a minute or so goes by before the document will actually open. I am not using Microsoft online service to open and save certain files
 (in Preferences in Word). Also I am not using Office 2016 to sync Office files that I open (in preferences in the OneDrive client).<br />
</p>
<p>What's causing this and how can I stop it? It wasn't always this way. Don't remember how many versions it goes back. I'm on Word for Mac, currently version 16.15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>

            Hi Dan,<br />
<br />
This might be an expected behavior. Since Office does need extra time to open a new file, usually created by other versions of Office.<br />
<br />
About the processing window, I just see it a few times when I open a file for the first time, and it vanishes very quickly, I think the time is related to the file size. when I open a big file download from a website, it takes longer to process. if I close
 it then open it again, the window will not show up.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you facing a different situation? If you are, it might be an issue. Could you share more details with us to troubleshoot it?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

 seems to double quote the " I place in the cells to display inches. Now I have removed them from some products yet it just would not make sense to get rid of them all. Further, as you can kind of tell from the photo excel just randomly adds " wherever it whats

            I tried the repair option and after it ran for quite awhile it came back with a message saying it couldn't complete the repair and gave an error code. 30015-13. It looks like the next step is to uninstall and reinstall. Before I do that, I am wondering
 if I have something else going on in the background because when I try to shut things down the usual way I get a message that a download is in process but I'm not downloading anything. How can I see what that is and stop it?

            So I've tried about everything. I looked in task manager and can't see what might be trying to download. I uninstalled and reinstalled Office after 3 attempts and everything is still blowing out. I opened Word, Excel, PPT, and One Note and get the same
 error on all applications, then they close. I'm also still getting the notice that something is still downloading but can't find it. Is the next step the landfill???

            also, the app that seems to be wanting to download might be mapuser?providerid...&nbsp; from usync.nexage.com.&nbsp; No clue what that is or where it came from. All of this started when I accepted the Windows software update on Thursday. After that update, Edge
 was blank so I contacted&nbsp; help and ended up reverting to the previous version prior to the update. At that point, I lost a year of notes on One Note and things have gone downhill from there.&nbsp;

<h2>            windows 10 mobile&#58; Website pinned to start doesn&#39;t pin the image to tile as on windows phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my favourite features of windows phone is that I can pin a website and it makes an images of the website as a tile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just unboxed my new Lumia 950. and when I try to pin a website it only makes the edge icon or the small icon of the website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this supposed to be like this? Its awful. I have my&nbsp;start startscreen full of websites and like this I can't see which site it goes to, because they all look the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to solve this? Is ths a bug or will it stay like this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank, Asa</p>

</p><p>I want to use the traditional footnotes citation with superscript numbers, like the below example.</p>

    <title>Linking to Oracle 11g data with TIMESTAMP Datatype - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Linking to Oracle 11g data with TIMESTAMP Datatype</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have connected to an Oracle 11g db that utilizes the&nbsp;TIMESTAMP datatype. When I view table data that uses this&nbsp;datatype, I see "OLE Object" as the data for those fields. I have read online that that in those situations, you need to click on the BIND TIMESTAMP
 AS DATE option in the Workarounds tab in the Microsoft ODBC connection&nbsp;settings. When I do that, I still see TIMESTAMP data displayed as "OLE Object." Is there anything else I need to do to make this data usable?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>I guess I would assume the behavior you are seeing would be expected.<span>&nbsp;</span>Is there a reason you would want to see the values in this field?<span>&nbsp;</span>Unless
 this is different on Oracle, normally a field with a data type of TimeStamp contains values that are a series of binary numbers used for version stamping table rows (not an actual date and time), which really doesn’t provide the end user with any useful information.</span></span></p>

</p><p>but:</p>
<p>- I had OneDrive for Business 2013</p>
<p>- I have Office 2016 and need to upgrade</p>
<p>- I have unistalled v.2013, restarted computer, no Office 2013 program is listed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you very much. I probably have done that yesterday night by some accident :-), but was not sure, if that is the right way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, from now one, I should be fine with only one OneDrive client installation, which doesnt have "for Business" suffix, I can use it for my companys Sharepoint, docs etc.,
 plus for my private account. Only one Cloud icon in the tray....</p>

                    <p>I want to turn off automatic compression all new documents in powerpoint. I don't see that option. Everytime I open a new document I have to tick the "do not compress" box. However I really appreciate a way where I can set the default as do not compress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article in office support points to a way. I do not see the option of the do not compress for all the new documents anywhere in options</p>

            <p>I'm pretty sure the writer of that MSFT article is mistaken. The option for "All new Documents" exists in WORD but not in POWERPOINT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In PowerPoint you would need to edit the registry. <strong>If you feel able to do this:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Close PowerPoint completely.</p>
<p>Open REGEDIT and navigate to:</p>
<p>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\PowerPoint\Options\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new Key (DWORD) in that folder and name it AutomaticPictureCompressionDefault</p>
<p>
</p><p>The value should be set to zero (OFF)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure this works in the RT version which I do not use.</p>

<p>If these are definitely duplicate mails then often this is caused by integrated anti -virus/anti spam utility, can also be caused by a sync utility.</p>
<p>You should ensure that the polling interval (auto send/receive) is set to the default 30 minutes, and not less than 10 if you have modified it.</p>
<p>Assuming&nbsp;you are using an IMAP mail account, your mail provider may have a mail box size limit&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    Sometimes, an&nbsp;Excel link which I instal in a workbook&nbsp;breaks-up / changes after saving and closing the file, even though it previously worked well and I confirm (by checking status of Link and validating the imported value against source spreadsheet) that
 the link is OK befoe and after I save; on re-opening I get (generally) (a) display of the last-saved value, but a changed formula / link or #N/A in the cell which previously had the link.

            ### FAQ: <br />
<br />
If I click on the red close X button of the Excel application (not the yellow file close X button),
<br />
only the active file is closed. <br />
<br />
I have created a PERSONAL.XLSB file and now I must always click the close button twice to close Excel.<br />
<br />
Excel 2003 did not show this behavior.<br />
<br />
How can I close all files if I click this button?<br />
<br />
<br />
### Reason: <br />
<br />
You have set the option "Show all windows in the Taskbar".<br />
See File\Options\Advanced\Display\Show all windows in the Taskbar<br />
<br />
<br />
### Solution:<br />
<br />
Install this AddIn. It has no user interface nor any settings.<br />
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35239054/AppCloser.zip<br />
<br />
<br />
### How to install:<br />
<br />
Save the file in a trusted location.<br />
Click File\Options\Add-Ins\Dropdown Manage: Excel-Add-Ins\Button: Go To\Button: Browse<br />
Select the AppCloser.xlam file<br />
Click OK\Ok<br />
<br />
<br />
### How it works:<br />
<br />
It tests with some Windows API codes if the mouse cursor is positioned on the title bar if a workbook is closed,<br />
that happens if you click the close button in the upper right edge of Excel.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, it tries to close all opened workbooks, one by one.<br />
<br />
If a file isn't saved, Excel asks you to save it or not. If you cancel the close, the AddIn stops closing remaining files.<br />
<br />
If all files are closed successfully, it closes Excel.

<h2>            how do we configure the Information management policy and  &#39;Expiration Policy timer job&#39;  in Sharepoint Online&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have set retention policy for some of the document Libraries in SharePoint Online Sites &nbsp;currently retention policy timer is running weekly once.</p>
<p>Is it possible to set these timer jobs to run every day.?</p>

<p>Hi Koushik,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to set these timer jobs to run every day . They are set by default.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Usually when you cant see Internet Options that means your computer could be infected. Have you ran your Anti-Virus lately? If so did it find anything?</p>

    <title>Office 2013 Home Use Program Activation Rights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Home Use Program Activation Rights</h2>
                    I am eligible to purchase Office 2013 under the Home Use Program.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At some time in the future I will purchase a new computer. If I buy Office 2013 under the HUP, will I be allowed to activate my copy of Office 2013 on the new computer? (Of course, I'll need to remove it from the old computer.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: Since posting I have learned that Office 2013 can be installed on one computer ONLY. Not one computer at a time, as in previous versions of Office, but one computer only, forever.</div>

            Wow this is lame.&nbsp; I am going to have to talk to my benefits administrator about this, because it was misrepresented on a large scale.&nbsp; My computer broker and now I have to buy another Office 2013.&nbsp; This is lousy and I work for one of the largest employers
 in the Western United States.
