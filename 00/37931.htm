<h2>            Windows 10 IS activated, telling me license will expire soon</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Sony VAIO laptop that initially had Windows 7 installed (by the manufacturer). &nbsp;When Windows 10 became available, I was notified through Windows 7 and upgraded via the free offer. &nbsp;Everything went smoothly and I had absolutely no problems for months.
 &nbsp;Yesterday, I got a message that popped up telling me my license will expire soon and I need to activate Windows. &nbsp;The thing is, according to the "Update &amp; Security" tab, it IS activated. &nbsp;If I try and click "Activate", nothing happens. &nbsp;I am at a loss on
 what I should do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
                </div>

            Hi Karen,<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to verify, what changes have you done prior to getting this issue? Does it randomly pop up or only when you use a certain program? Can you provide a screenshot?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<h2>            &#34;SecureBoot isn&#39;t configured correctly.&#34; My system does NOT support SecureBoot</h2>
                    <div>Hi all</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro today, and upon reaching the desktop, discovered the watermark saying that Secure Boot is not configured correctly (Lower right corner, message is "Window 8 Pro with Media Center, SecureBoot isn't configured correctly, Build
 9600"). I checked the event logs as the Technet article on the subject suggests, and the problem is that SecureBoot is disabled in BIOS.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>I have a custom built system (MSI Z77a-G45 mobo, Intel i5-3570k CPU, Gigabyte nVidia 670), and while while my motherboard does support SecureBoot, it says that my GPU does not (Exact message is "System BIOS detected a non-Windows 8 Logo graphic card. There
 is no GOP (Graphics Output Protocol) support detected in this card. Secure Boot setting in BIOS will be changed to disabled"). So I CANNOT enable SecureBoot (seriously, it's not possible, don't tell me to enable it, my motherboard won't POST).
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to remove the watermark through the approved channels? Or do I have to edit system files to make it go away?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I have exactly same problem. Upgraded to 8.1 yesterday, and today few minutes ago (after many turn on and turn off already), the stupid watermark appeared.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know that I made changes to my BIOS (to my liking !!!, not to Microsoft liking) when getting a new PC with Windows 8 pre-installed couple months ago, and I never had that stupid watermark in the right lower corner --&nbsp;until today (approx. 24 hours after
 an upgrade to 8.1).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I upgraded to 8.1 because I wanted a START button (not happy how it appeared in 8.1 at all!!!), but I still use a&nbsp;third-party START program anyway. Now, some stupid watermark is&nbsp;showing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What did Microsoft do to cause that problem? It seems that upgrading to 8.1 was the second mistake (the first one was buying a PC with a preinstalled Windows 8).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is a link directly to Microsoft where users can leave&nbsp;the feedback for Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/secure-boot-watermark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/secure-boot-watermark</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I already left my "NO" feedback, explaining my frustration and annoyance with the suddenly appeared embedded watermark and my unwillingness to comply with MS demand to enable Secure boot. More people should express their opinion there.</p>

            I have just disabled legacy boot in Bios and this has fixed the problem. The water mark has now gone, as it allows secure boot to function

            <p>It might work for some people. However, I categorically refuse to tinker with my previously working BIOS with a disabled SecureBoot under Windows 8.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft's upgrade 8.1 caused this problem, and Microsoft needs to fix it with a KB/update (whatever MS is going to call it) to get the annoying watermark out of our desktop screens. All I can say, Windows Millenium has its descendant. Actually, I am seriously
 considering switching to LINUX MINT even before the expiration of my warranty on a new laptop.</p>

            I tried switching my legacy boot option in BIOS, to no avail. I've got a temp fix in place (modified resource files to remove the offending text strings), but I would love to have a real solution so I can restore the original files.
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I am rather fed up with Windows as well, I am on 8/8.1 because the upgrade deal was AWESOME when I built my computer ($40 for a pro version of Windows? Native RDP and native network backup? Sold!) but now that I have a separate work/school laptop with
 Windows 7, I'm just waiting for Steam's Linux library to grow a little and then I'll jump ship on my gaming PC.</div>

            <p><strong>"A final nail in the coffin had been hammered in by Microsoft."</strong>
</p>
<p>The requirement of SecureBoot is unacceptable for many users, and the watermark on the desktop is an insult to users.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I cannot be more fed up either. Not only I did not like Windows 8, but I disliked Windows 8.1 double time. Thankfully, I still have my old PCs with XP and Vista for regular daily tasks. This ugly tiles OS that freezes, hangs, recovers webpages multiple times
 per day when using IE 11, receiving error messages that&nbsp;browser is incompatible with website I visit, ....&nbsp;will be soon replaced with LINUX. I would downgrade to Windows 7, but there is no a retail version available on the market for a reasonable price (I
 do not want OEM version under any circumstances).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It started with an optional SecureBoot (and an&nbsp;option to have it disabled under Window 8, without having an&nbsp;annoying watermark), now it is a requirement under 8.1. I the meantime, 8.1 introduced a new idea -- using PC while being constantly sign up to Hotmail
 account. Right now, it can be disabled by using LOCAL ACCOUNT, but who knows what MS will sneak in into another update. Next time, probably users will not be able to use their own PC, if they are not&nbsp;signed in to their Hotmail account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It looks that sale of Windows 8 was so bad that Microsoft tries to limit as much as possible users who are left.</p>

Microshaft loves nothing more than to punish the people that make it rich: "familiarity breeds contempt."&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Even now, I am writing from Outlook.com, but on a Chrome browser, since my regular desktop Explorer quit working properly after the installation of 8.1. I guess all of my favorites are gone now, and it's more complicated to navigate the system than before with
 the earlier Metro version. I'm not going to even try to contact a Microsoft technician, since they only want to dispense lousy advice that obviously feeble minded amateur idiots like the rest of us shouldn't even try. Luddites.</div>

            <p>You cannot be more right!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I thought that it was only me having a problem with IE. Under 8, it was not easy, but under 8.1, it&nbsp;is not fun at all -- freezing, not loading some pages, .... Not mentioning that update wiped out all my cookies setting; all bank websites were asking for
 a verification because of an unrecognized PC after MS's&nbsp;messy&nbsp;update. And MS said that everything will be carried over. Maybe, in their dreams.
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;use Mozilla Firefox, it has much more features I like to use than IE 11.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>MS will never see a dime from me!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I never tried Mac, but since&nbsp;we already have many Windows based PCs that will end up without a support soon (meaning a stable XP), I am going a&nbsp;LINUX way.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the meantime, <strong>I am still wondering how long it will take to a "genius" who came up with an idea to embed a watermark "SecureBoot ins't configured correctly" on&nbsp;the desktop to make an update to get rid of the stupid watermark.</strong>
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It looks that MS decided that instead of using pop up error messages that we can disregard by clicking on "x", every time when MS will think that our settings is not to its liking, we will have a new watermark on the desktop. Very well done, Microsoft!!!
 Microsoft, you know how to hammer the&nbsp;nail to your coffin.</p>

<h2>            Battery not recognized on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba Laptop Satellite L645 -SP4003L Latin American Version. Once I installed Windows 10, I experimented some minor issues, but the main problem that I have already is that my computer never detect the battery in any condition (Alone or Plugged
 to the AC power) so it's a problem, because when I'm working with it, I don't know when I'm going to be shut down by my PC.</p>

<p>It does not matter where you are calling from (assuming Skype services are not blocked). If you only plan on making calls to the US using Skype, you should purchase a US subscription. Subscriptions automatically renew as early as 3 days before the end of
 the subscription. If you plan on keeping the subscription for a month, it would be best to cancel the subscription before ~27 days have passed. This will ensure the subscription only lasts one cycle.</p>

    <title>Focused vs Other email app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chandrasekhar85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Focused vs Other email app</h2>
                    <p>I used the Outlook email app in Windows 8.1. It had two categories Focused and Other. There is a similar layout on the Phone Outlook app as well.&nbsp; I really loved the app. It neatly categorized the email for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I upgraded to Windows 10,&nbsp;the new email app, is bland and the nice filtering that I automatically had earlier is gone. Can someone tell me how I can get the outlook email app that I had on 8.1 back in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further assist you, we would like to ask the following questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What activity were you doing when the computer crashed?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message if there's any?</li><li>What is the result of the reinstallation?</li><li>Is the hard disk locked out of BitLocker?</li></ul>
<p>

            You can't do a re-installation or anything if the hard drive is locked because it can't be written to the drive.&nbsp; It is reported as an I/O error in some trouble shooting programs.&nbsp; We just need to know how to unlock it please.&nbsp; This is the second time
 this has happened, I bought a new computer and now it happens again but I can see everything is still there when trying unsuccessfully in my recovery usb.&nbsp; I do not think older computers should be upgraded to windows 10 even if it works.&nbsp; I think it has to
 do with EFI boot and dual booting but even the other operating system rescue disks cannot access a locked drive!!!!<br />

    <title>Win 10 Anniversary update fails without any descriptive reason - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drewsk01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Anniversary update fails without any descriptive reason</h2>
                    <p>Hi;</p>
<p>I have a clean fully licensed install of Windows 10 Pro. A few applications installed, and everything patched by Microsoft Update (everything up-to-date). Then the anniversary update starts &amp;&amp; never ends.</p>
<p>First requests were to remove MS Office 2003 Pro &amp; all components (I use it as I like it). Then to remove Icloud. Did this. No luck, the next screen requests that I uninstall "." - yes some phantom program that it calls a 'period'.</p>
<p>On to the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant. It crashed a couple of times as follows:</p>
<p>Downloading [ok]</p>
<p>Verifying [ok]</p>
<p>Updating -&gt; exits without explanation @ 77%.</p>
<p>First retry it suggested turning on BitSVC and CryptSVC</p>
<p>Second it just exited. Then I rebooted and tried one last time.</p>
<p>On to the system logs. It appears the crash was happening immediately following an interrupt from Windows Defender. I disabled this and retried. This time the update just stopped and started the Windows 10 Setup application. This program halts with the request
 that I uninstall -&gt; an unknown generic application.</p>
<p>Ok, into the windows 10 update logs via PowerShell as Administrator.</p>
<p>There are three lines constantly repeated:</p>
<p>1600/12/31 19:00:00.0000000 332&nbsp;&nbsp; 7924&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown( 149): GUID=1477caed-5800-d699-76a3-82f34fdbd329 (No Format Information found).<br />
1600/12/31 19:00:00.0000000 332&nbsp;&nbsp; 7924&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown( 65): GUID=1477caed-5800-d699-76a3-82f34fdbd329 (No Format Information found).<br />
1600/12/31 19:00:00.0000000 332&nbsp;&nbsp; 7924&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown( 148): GUID=1477caed-5800-d699-76a3-82f34fdbd329 (No Format Information found).</p>
<p>I assume the 149, 65, 148 could be PIDs. Nothing in task manager (services or details) lists them.</p>
<p>Finally Win 10 Upgrade exits with the error code:&nbsp; 0xc1900209</p>
<p>I cannot find any of the above codes in Microsoft / TechNet or via Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted both the update and install of update from the ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just done a clean install to the previous release to rectify other issues (installer fails from Win 7 Pro because old drivers are not properly cleaned - there is a separate thread on this topic).</p>
<p><br />
For the time being I am using <strong>wushowhide </strong>to hide 1607.<br />
<br />
As you can imagine the below information isn't exactly helpful...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f924770" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f924771" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions of what I might try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx.</p>

                    <p>Ребята , я попал в очень сложную ситуацию . Пару дней назад у&nbsp; меня слетела система и ее пришлось восстанавливать с последней точки сохранения( DVR в том сохранении был включен). Я пытался устранить это сейчас и у меня ничего не вышло т.к нету параметра
 "DVR для игр".</p>
<p>Я пытался через реестор и консоль, но ничего не вышло. Раньше у меня в CS:GO было 200 фпс , теперь 57-60 фпс. В Minecraft было 500 фпс и 81 фпс при использовании шейдеров, а теперь 47-60 фпс и 10-13 фпс с шейдерами. Что надо сделать , чтобы вернуть прежние
 значения фпс и выключить DVR ?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble with your Xbox App not behaving like it normally would. Have you made sure your systems software is all up to date? If you have you may want to try uninstalling
 and reinstalling all the applications involved. Powering your computer down and leaving it unplugged for 5 minutes usually helps with performance as well. Hope this helps check out these helpful support articles:

    <title>Missing navigation path in windows explorer after booting of Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing navigation path in windows explorer after booting of Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I love to use explorer's option to re-open previously closed folders. Usually I have from 1 to 3 explorer windows opened before shutdown of computer and later when is switched on it restoring closed windows and sometimes can be one or none of them that
 does not have top part of explorer where is navigation buttons and address line with search field. It is missing all this toolbar row. Opening new window has no problems. Not sure what's causing this issue. I guess it is just few users using this feature and
 I am one of them using since Windows XP and seeing this issue occasionally after windows 7 boot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Steps to reproduce</i>:</div>
<div>Open Explorer settings -&gt; tick 'Restore previous folder windows at logon' option. Open few windows and then shutdown or restart computer. &nbsp;Boot the computer and check you folders windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So is this a bug or I am missing something?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Tomas</div>
<div><br />

            Thanks, I will try this.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I just want to say that this happens not every time. Out of 10 times this happens at least one time or more. Yesterday I had 3 windows which first two of them did not had this toolbar and last one had. After leaving them and rebooting this morning did
 not had same issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div>For me this looks like windows are shown before this toolbar initialized or something like it as I do have a lot stuff on PC including 3 versions of Visual Studio (2008,2010,2012) and SQL server 2008. So it is a bit slow on loading after logon.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So could you keep watching this then?</div>

<p>If you are using the orginal console that Minecraft was purchased on, all other profiles should be able to play it as well. Otherwise you may need to perform a license transfer if the game was purchased via another console.</p>

<h2>            Moving programs from old to new computer</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a new computer. THe old one has programs that I need for my College classes, how do I move them from the</p>
<p>old to the new computer. &nbsp;The old machine runs win 7 Ultimate the new machine runs windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ineed to do this with little or no outlay of cash and between 22 Dec and 2 Jan of next year.</p>
<p>the old machine is on my Lan, and I could perhaps add the new, the new will be taking the place of the old in that LAN also</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks &nbsp;Tim</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, are you and the person you're calling using the latest version of Skype? Have you tried using a different internet connection? Is the issue with Skype-to-Skype calling or calling to mobiles/landlines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been an issue with connecting to Skype services, which affects calling to landlines. However, it is already resolved. You may check it on

<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. <br />

<h2>            turning off digital signatures</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have read various posts and cannot turn off the signing</p>
<p>I am using Win 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I wish to run a util called i-menu for my AOC monitor but cannot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the following errors.</p>
<p>1&nbsp; Do you want to allow this program from an unkown publisher</p>
<p>2&nbsp; Windows requires a digitally signed driver</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Please Run as Administrator</p>
<p>Can any one help?</p>

<p>Hello eugeneb_2010,</p>
<p>Did you try the steps above to disable digital signing?</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then I suggest you contact the manufacturer for i-menu for steps on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            skype goes offline in windows 8 power saving mode</h2>
                    problem with windows 8,&nbsp; skype - desktop version. as soon as windows 8 goes into power saving mode, skype goes offline. is there a way to keep it online so i can receive calls while pc is in power saving mode?<br />
<br />
<p>i have xp on another pc. skype stays logged in all of the time whether its being used or in power saving mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i went through skype tech support. they said it was a windows 8 issue that causes this.<br />

<h3> teodor s.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freelancer game on windows 10</h2>
                    So, yesterday I could play this good old one with absolutely no problem, just that I got a message telling me that the game couldn't recognise my gpu everytime I started it, now, I formatted my hard and reinstalled windows, everything worked fine with
 the installation, got all the drivers and updates and then installed Freelancer, I didn't have any problems with the installer but the game won't start at all, it sometimes shows up the "is the app working correctly?" I have to mention that I tried running
 it in all compatibility modes available, as an admin, reinstalled the game twice and used a crack, any suggestions? I checked some older posts about this but it didn't really help me.

    <title>Windows 8 will not launch because of recovery boot configuration data - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 will not launch because of recovery boot configuration data file missing</h2>
                    ok, firstly my hp pavilion laptop's wifi adapter was not working and i went through different ways to try to solve it, but then after one of many reboots later, it came up with the blue screen titled recovery: Boot Configuration Data file missing.&nbsp;
<div>i have followed what others had said about fixing this like rebooting with the windows 8 upgrade installation disc and using the advanced startup to solve the problem. i used the automatic repair and that didn't work, and then i tried a pc refresh to see
 whether that would differ, but that didn't work because of the hard drive in need of unlocking. i am not sure whether to do a system restore because of the original problem with my wifi adapter, the system restores did not work due to my antivirus (norton
 360) and when i uninstalled norton 360 to do a system restore, the restore was unable to do it because of data being incorrect (or it said something similar). so i think if i did another system restore, the same message will appear again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i do not know what to do, i have been researching into this matter, but no one has posted a problem like this on the net.&nbsp;</div>
<div>i will provide a link to laptops specs if needed:&nbsp;</div>

            ok, i have followed what you have suggested and it has fixed the problem with the boot configuration data, however, when i restarted it, there was nothing on the start screen. so i could only get to the classic desktop through using the ctrl alt delete
 method to the task manager to take me to the desktop.&nbsp;
<div>my wifi adapter is still not working and after a couple of minutes, google chrome appeared on the start screen.&nbsp;</div>
<div>what do i need to do to get my start screen back to normal</div>
<div><br />
<div>UPDATED NOTE: my wifi adapter has magically working again, just the problem with the start screen&nbsp;</div>

            <p>ok, </p>
<p>when I got my laptop working fine after your suggestion, I got the start screen to work properly and everything, but then two days later, another similar blue screen appeared like before. it said the same thing last time, but it had a different error code:
 0x0000001. </p>
<p>I have tried using the auto repair, but that has not worked, and I am thinking that this problem needs another manual command prompt like before. also, the refresh does not work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>your help is very generous </p>

            <p>i have entered the command prompt and I restarted it, the blue :( screen still appears and then changes to black and grey Windows Boot Manager. it says to choose an operating system to start and the grey highlighter below it is showing nothing inside it.
 also, underneath it still has the advanced option F8.</p>
<p>I have tried the other safe modes: with networking and with command prompt as well as the normal mode, but all three have not worked. however, from now on, every time my laptop restarts, it will always direct me to the Windows Boot Manager first.
