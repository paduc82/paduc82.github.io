<h2>            Folder deleted from Outlook.Live.com, How to get it back</h2>
                    I deleted a 3rd party email account folder from Outlook.live.com a while ago.&nbsp; I did not try to retrieve it right after, because I did not know that I would need it back until now.&nbsp; However, the email account still exists.&nbsp; Because I tried to add the email
 account again, it wouldn't let me for duplication.&nbsp; How would I make the folder appear on the left pane again like before?&nbsp; I tried to see if I could make it happen under Option/Email/Account/Connected Accounts, but there was no any options to retrieve the
 folder.&nbsp; Please help, Thanks.

<p>Essentially, you'll turn off all the addins/startup workbooks and then open<br />
excel.&nbsp; And then turn on each addin (closing and reopening) one at a time to<br />
find the culprit.</p>

<p>my suggestion is to clear any applications/themes/images/animations that you are not using, and backup these to the memory card. then select the option in the phone settings to Restore to Factory Settings. if this does not work, then try taking your phone
 battery out for five minutes and then replacing it and see if your phone functions correctly again. if this still does not work, looks like a trip to the local Nokia Care Centre is in order. by the way, default code for restore is 12345. let us know how it
 goes.</p>

<p>hey buddy,you can also try updating to newer firmware or reinstalling the current firmware version on your phone using Nokia Software Updater. so i would try doing this, and after the firmware update or firmware reinstallation, Restore To Factory Settings
 again and see if that works. if it does not, then you have no choice to take your phone to your local Nokia Care Centre. firmware updates or firmware reinstallation will not damage your phone, however remember to have stable power connection when performing
 the update, as power loss during updates can corrupt your phone. let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>only way you will know is if you connect your computer and use NSU to find out. or you could visit this link, and see what firmware version is available for your product code. you do know that there is a newer firmware version out for your phone that you
 are recommended to upgrade to? i am sure the latest is 6.65</p>

<p>who told you that your warranty would be invalid if you upgraded to newer firmware? that is not true, because you are in either of two scenarios. you either have a vanilla handset, that is unbranded, or you have an operator-branded handset. in each case,
 firmware updates will be either authorised by Nokia or your operator, so in either case you are not invalidating your warranty by upgrading to the latest firmware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>well to answer your other question, i would not recommend that you update your phone while your phone is charging. if there is something like a freak accident (which is highlt unlikely but you never know), then your phone can be damaged because it is connected
 to the power supply and is in the middle of updating, i.e. phone firmware corruption can occur. which could make your phone unusable. so i would say ensure that your mobile is fully charged, and then leave the charger out, and update to the laterst firmware
 with only the phone connected to your computer and not the mains. if your net connection slows down it will not corrupt your mobile, you will just have to wait a little longer before the complete file is downloaded and able to be installed.if your internet
 does manage to get disconnected during the update, it will not affect your phone as the update process only occurs when the firmware file is fully downloaded.</p>

            I know of none. You will have to search google to see if there are any. Bear in mind that Excel 2011 only accepts add-ins built with VBA. So many of the add-ins made for windows Excel wiill not work.<br />

            Usually, when Windows Defender is not working, the best way to fix it is to perform a repair upgrade.
<br />
<br />See steps how to do that:

<br />
<br />Other steps you can also try:
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations

            Thanks for your reply. However I created a new profile but when outlook tests the settings it fails to send and receive but if I go back to the original profile it passes but I still get the msg and am kept from finishing setup.

    <title>Contact phone list in Nokia 6555 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 6555user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contact phone list in Nokia 6555</h2>
                    I just upgraded my 2 LG1400 phones that I had for 3 years to 2 Nokia 6555s &amp; am suppossed to receive them tomorrow by FedEX.<br />
<br />
In the LG1400, you had an option of keeping your Contact phone list either on the Sim card or in the phone itself.<br />
I preferred keeping them only in the phone because it allowed you to list several phone numbers for each contact.<br />
However, since it was not saved on the Sim card, all of your contacts were lost if you ever had to remove your Sim card for whatever reason (which returned the phone to its inital state each time).<br />
<br />
Saving the list to the Sim card was much safer, but it made you enter a different contact for each phone number of a particular contact. i.e.- if 1 contact had 3 phone numbers, it required 3 separate entries.<br />
<br />
QUESTIONs are: Does the Nokia 6555 work the same?<br />
Which method have you found works best for you?

            Nokia's phone books have allowed several contact detail (several numbers, addresses, email addresses...) since about 2004.<br />
<br />
Do you have your contacts in Outlook or another PIM program?<br />
If so try syncing your Samsung, edit in Outlook and sync with your 6555.

            Does that mean that you can input those several contact detail either in the phone or on the memory card?<br />
<br />
I asssume if you input the contact detail only in the phone, you do run a risk of losing it all &amp; not be able to retrieve it?<br />
<br />
ANOTHER RELATED QUESTION:<br />
Even though I upgraded my phones &amp; plan online, I assume the local AT&amp;T Mobility store will tranfer my contact information directly from my old phones to my new phones for me?

            Nokia phone work likewise. Here too you have Phone memory and SIM card memory. In phone memory you can add multiple numbers to a single contact likewise as in LG.<br />
As regards question 2 I am not too sure if that is possible as<br />
LG &amp; Nokia use different file types.

            Would it not be possible even with the use of a cable?<br />
<br />
The local AT&amp;T Mobility store has various cables for various phones where they regularly do that.<br />
Now, whether they can do it from 1 manufacturer (LG) to another (Nokia) is the question.<br />
I don't think they did it for me for an older Nokia to the LG because I think I originally input the contact list from scratch because I wanted to store it in the phone instead of on the SIM card (to be able to list more than 1 number for each contact).

            UPDATE:<br />
<br />
This morning (Thursday 5-8-08), I went to the local AT&amp;T Mobility store.<br />
<br />
They said they COULD transfer my contact list from my old LG1400 to my new Nokia 6555 using a cable they had that would connect both phones together.<br />
<br />
But, before she went to the back to get the cable, she said she would try something even more simple.<br />
<br />
She took the SIM card out of my old LG1400 &amp; put it in my new Nokia 6555.<br />
LO &amp; BEHOLD, it accepted it!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Then she merely copied my contact list off of the LG1400 SIM card to the phone memory of the Nokia 6555. Then she put back the Nokia 6555 SIM card back into the Nokia 6555 and merely copied the contact list from the phone memory of the Nokia 6555 to the SIM
 card of the Nokia 6555.<br />
<br />
ALL WENT PERFECTLY!!!!<br />
<br />
I now have the contact list from my old LG1400 in two places in the Nokia 6555: In the phone memory AND on the SIM card.<br />
<br />
Of course, that now means that every entry in my contact list shows up twice. But, I can easily cure that by deleting the contact list from my phone memory &amp; leaving it only on the SIM card.<br />
<br />
Since my contact list on my old LG1400 was only on the SIM card, that is where I think I will leave it for a while.<br />
<br />
LATER, I expect to take each contact one at a time &amp; transfer each to the phone memory which would enable me to list the various telephone numbers for each contact. That would decrease the number of items in my contact list since most of my contacts have more
 than 1 telephone number.

            Just to expand this discussion a little more.<br />
<br />
Until I get both my Nokia 6555 contact list and my Outlook contact list identical, I would like to be able to save my Nokia 6555 contact list on my computer - but in a separate "file" by itself and NOT in Outlook 2003.<br />
I would have to use a USB cable to do that since my computer is NOT Bluetooth enabled.<br />
Is that possible?<br />
<br />
And of course, can I also use that file on my computer (with the cable) to restore the contact list from my computer to my Nokia 6555 if the need ever arises?

            Yes you can save not only contacts but also pictures, messages, video clips.<br />
All you need to do is download and install latest PC suite. Connect your phone to PC through USB cable. PC suite will install necessary files.<br />
You open PC suite and do a backup of all the phones contents and also of memory card into PC.

            I am sure that "YOU" know this already, but others may not know this.<br />
<br />
If you are using the free Nokia PC Suite software to backup a contact list to your PC that is only on your SIM card in the Nokia 6555, you must first copy that contact list into your Nokia 6555 phone memory. The software apparently only backs up information
 that is in your phone memory and does NOT backup anything on your SIM card.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Preview - Delete button sometimes not working</h2>
                    <p>Not sure if anyone else is noticing this, but when I'm in Outlook 2013 Preview, sometimes the delete ("X") buttons don't work.&nbsp; The message is highlighted in the left pane, and I can press the top delete, the one right beside it, or right click -- nothing
 happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I change to a different message first, then&nbsp;click back to it, it works.&nbsp; It's like it loses focus on what message is selected or something.</p>

<p>Be sure that all values are indeed numeric.&nbsp; That is, =ISNUMBER(A1) returns TRUE, changing A1 to the appropriate cell reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I copy-and-pasted your table into Excel, 32.5, 42.9 and 82.7 were text because what appears to be spaces are non-breaking spaces (HTML nbsp; ASCII 160)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that does not tell us they are text in your Excel file.&nbsp; It could be an anomaly of the table object in your posting or of copy-and-pasting from a webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, when I ensure that all values are numeric, the power trendline works.</p>

            Lines in 2010 are all connectors. They will snap to the red connect handles on shapes. Turning off snap or holding dow ALT won't stop this (annoying IMHO). If you draw the line using the Freeform tool in Lines (second to last tool) they won't snap. To
 draw a line with this tool - click at the start then double click at the end of the line.<br />

            In general, uninstalling Outlook from a "click-2-run" office subscription is not possible.under normal operation
<br />
<br />.You can try t follow the instructions as outlined in the Oct. 8th, 2015 post by &lt;AllanLu_MSFT&gt; in the following thread to modify the download XML file

<p>I don't use Outlook.&nbsp; I have had so many crashes and lost files through the years.&nbsp; Since my school has changed over to Google, only the administrative staff use Office products.&nbsp; It was too time-consuming each time I had to deal with the crash (just as
 dealing with the frequent instances of Word and Excel telling me that my versions are not licensed, but that's another story).&nbsp; I wear too many hats to lose time dealing with these types of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook can sit idle&nbsp;for now.&nbsp; Thanks for the input.</p>

            A virtual machine running windows might be the best option, but there is a powershell for mac at GitHub. The article at <a href="https://www.cgoosen.com/2017/03/connecting-to-exchange-online-with-remote-powershell-from-a-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cgoosen.com/2017/03/connecting-to-e...</a> tells how to use it.

<p>Hi Johane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your posting back, if so, given your situation, I suggest you bulk move your emails after January. 1, 2018 to another folder(or custom folder), then clean up your Inbox folder from
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Outlook Web App</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then move these emails back to your inbox as a workaround. meantime, to avoid mistake operation, I suggest you back up your emails in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the following steps to bulk chose the emails you need to move.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the first email in your inbox.</span></li><li><span>Hold on the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Shift</span><span> key, then drag the slider downstairs, select latter email to buck select the email and move to your other folder.</span></li><li><span>Right click your Inbox, the select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete All
</span><span>to clean up your inbox folder.</span></li><li><span>Move the emails your moved before to your Inbox folder with the same method.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it help with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors. If Feb 10, 2016 update (KB3114717) is installed, this should be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
13. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Flash Plugin for N73 Browser - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flash Plugin for N73 Browser</h2>
                    I have purchased N73 and am enjoying the browsing experience with N73.<br />
<br />
But I feel that it does not have the Flash plugin for the browser. I want to know what is the default browser for Nokia N73 and how to get the flash plugin for that?

            The default browser is "Services". The phone also has "Web", which is another (newer) browser.<br />
<br />
Neither one supports "full" Flash as used by web designers on many sites.<br />
<br />
The phone supports Flash-Lite 1.1, and I think with the "Services" browser it might work on web sites with embdedded Flash-Lite 1.1 compatible content, too. Never tried it myself (not that many web sites that support Flash-Lite anyway; I don't know of any).<br />
<br />
There is also no separately downloadable/installable "full" Flash plugin available, I'm afraid. You could always ask Adobe to make one, if they think it is possible.<br />
<br />
You can, of course, also ask the web site owners/developers for a more mobile friendly site that doesn't use PC-only technologies.<br />

            Thank you petrib for your quick response.<br />
I wil try exploring options of checking with Adobe on this. :)<br />
<br />
Based on your comments I have a new query:<br />
<br />
Can I install any web browser on my N73 which support Flash like mozilla, Opera, IE, Netscape etc..

            You can only install web browsers made for S60 3rd Edition/Symbian operating system. You can't install browsers made for Windows, Linux or MacOS, etc.<br />
<br />
Besides what's on the device now, it means Opera or Opera Mini. At least for now (= unless someone else also releases a web browser for S60 3rd Edition).<br />
<br />
Opera and Opera Mini you can find on their web site:<br />

            I installed Opera Mini and downloaded Flash Lite, but find that Flash content remains invisible.

            Opera Mini is a separate Java app.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with Flash Lite, and Flash Lite cannot, anyway, handle the "full" Flash content that web pages tend to use.

    <title>Disable sending from a specific outlook account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable sending from a specific outlook account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have an account that I would like to receive emails for, but do not want to use that email account to compose emails. By default, my emails seem to send somewhat randomly from the email address I don't want to send from. Is there a way to disable
 one of my accounts from sending emails, but yet still receive emails for that account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using Outlook on a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>MS-Project 2016 &#40;Format Bar shape in Gantt Chart&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philppem  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS-Project 2016 &#40;Format Bar shape in Gantt Chart&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to change the shape of the Gantt Chart bar and I tried both (Bar format, on the middle section but the shapes I can select from are all very thin, I don't have the thick bar that will fill the whole cell as usual)</p>
<p>I also tried to increase it from (Layout under Format, Bar Height) choosing 24 but still very thin line...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what happened and why I don't have the regular (thick) shape that I have on the other 2010 or 2013 on the other computer?</p>
<p>As you can see in the attached pictures, these are all the shapes that I can choose from , they all have just thin bars but no thick ones or the regular Gantt chart bar that we used to see</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Surface Pro 3 (I3) windows Pro 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I use MSP2010 and I don't have MSP2013 or MSP2016.</p>
<p>However, and this may not work for you, I would try recovering the default formats by recovering the Gantt Chart view from the global template with file, organiser.</p>

            <p>I am assuming by recovering the default here you mean just open any template and I already tried that with no luck... it opens with the same issue.</p>
<p>Is there another way to recover default bar format?</p>

            <p>No, I don't mean just open the template.</p>
<p>See file, organiser.</p>
<p>The stuff on the left contains all of the views, tables, filters, groups, calendars, reports etc that are in the global template.</p>
<p>They are all the clean originals. Copy a Gantt Chart view from the global to your file.</p>
<p>That said, I don't think it will fix your problem but it would be a good start.</p>

            It appears as though your installation is up to date and you are on the "Current Channel" versus the "Deferred Channel" for updates. &nbsp;As I noted earlier, I cannot reproduce this error. &nbsp;Are you running any other products at the same time? &nbsp;If you select
 another task, does the Format Bar command show the correct options?

            <p>I sometimes used to have excel opened at the same time , but i closed it and restarted MS-Project and still the same.. the weird thing is that it doesn't give me the option to use thicker shape...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think it might be an issue (error) during installation?</p>
<p>Do you think if i uninstall and reinstall it will solve the issue? will i lose my license if i uninstall it from my machine and reinstall it or it knows the machine and keeps the license or it?</p>

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry - I have no idea what is causing the issue. &nbsp;Before uninstalling, you could try a repair through the Control Panel. &nbsp;Go to the Control Panel, click Programs &gt; Uninstall a program. &nbsp;Select Microsoft Office in the list, single click and then choose Repair
 at the top of the list.</p>
