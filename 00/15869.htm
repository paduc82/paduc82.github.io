<p><font>IP address shouldn't matter. It is looking at the&nbsp;<strong>code</strong> on the device to see what the latest and, maybe, maybe not, greatest update is for the device. The code is what the server needs to see to know
 which flavo</font><font>r of firmware your device wants. It can then see what the newest version of that flavor is.
</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>You'll find the code on the accessory device label inside the accessory battery compartment. Formerly the label and battery compartment were part of the device but when I asked a question about them it was moved
 to accessories.&nbsp; Now I always, and correctly, refer to them as the accessory device label and the accessory battery compartment.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>As of 10 April 2009 there is no update available for 12.046 for the N78-3 Code 0565615 :robotsad:</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>If they are still working on it I'd like to see them:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font>restore FM broadcasting of Internet radio</font></li><li><font>add native Nokia VOIP client with UMA</font></li><li><font>video out if possible to do it through the firmware</font></li><li><font>add close music player from task list</font></li><li><font>restore device label to main device; no longer be an accessory</font></li><li><font>restore battery compartment to main device; no longer be an accessory</font></li></ul>

<p>I think it's a disgrace that nokia have not provided a firmware update for 12.046 yet, the phone is imo a pile of **bleep** and I would not buy another Nokia after this one, it isnt nice to use at all.</p>

            <font>Nokia have provided firmware in advance of 12.046. Discuss with Vodafone their failure to adopt it. Also, some perceived failures of 12.046 may not be of the version but of the underlying S60 and how it is employed by the
 end user. Things that didn't improve when you updated from 12.046 to 21 might well be end user issues or S60 underlying issues. A complete hard reset of the device and a&nbsp;thoughtful reinstall of the apps and address book might eliminate the bulk of the issues
 you are experiencing. This did wonders for one of my N78-3 devices that was beginning to act a wee bit squirrly.</font>

<p>For North American Market Nokia have released Firmware V. 21.002 via NSU for the N78-3.</p>
<p>It's been a long time coming. Hopefully the&nbsp;issues I've seen raised&nbsp;on the boards about the 20+ level firmware&nbsp;of the Euro releases have been addressed.</p>

<p><font>Have Version 21.002 on my N78-3 for about 20 minutes now. Here is what I observe</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<ol>
<li><font>Internet radio still does not transmit through FM transmitter.</font></li><li><font>Photo thumbnail display has more placeholder icons than formerly although the images are intact when I open them.</font></li><li><font>Messages would not restore from backup I did prior to update.

<p><font>What does it fix? Only Nokia knows. As a matter of policy Nokia will not share firmware changes with the end user. My device has run smoothly all day today with no unexpected results. It is still showing a full charge on

    <title>PDF attachments not opening in Microsoft Outlook 2016. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PDF attachments not opening in Microsoft Outlook 2016.</h2>
                    <span>There may be an easy answer to this but I can't seem to find it.<span>&nbsp;
                    <span>There may be an easy answer to this but I can't seem to find it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have looked on Google but found nothing that has helped my problem so far.<br />
<br />
I have a laptop and I have Microsoft Outlook 2016.<span>&nbsp; </span>My main email account is a 'Live' account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In the past, when I received an email in this application that had a PDF attached, I had no problems in opening the PDF attachment.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now, it is very hit and miss.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most of the time now, when I double click, right click etc. etc. on a PDF attachment, it will not open.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can open a preview of the PDF but this will not allow me to print it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only when the PDF is fully opened properly will it let me print, so at this point in time, I cannot print the PDF either.<br />
<br />
I can get around this by sending it to 1 of my Gmail accounts and then opening it on the web but this is very inconvenient for me.<br />
<br />
Very occasionally, when I start my computer, let's say the next day, it will work and then the PDF will open as normal.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As I said, most of the time they do not open so something is going on here.<br />
<br />
In contrast, when I go on my desktop computer that has also got the same account on it also within Microsoft Outlook 2016, the attachment opens as normal.<br />
<br />
Has anybody got any ideas why I am having trouble on my laptop with this problem?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping it is so simple that I will be embarrassed but I don't mind that if this problem is solved for me.<br />
<br />
Any help will be truly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<p>I would never call a random number back that came via email especially from America.<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to my actual question. Today, the PDF attachments are opening. This is what I am saying, it is very hit and miss. Yesterday, I could not open them for love nor money.<br />
<br />
I've checked my Trust settings, they are how they should be and made sure the Adobe reader add-in is enabled.<br />
<br />
So what could be going on here? Is there anybody on here that could give me viable answers on this question please?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for assisting,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made no changes to the account.</p>
<p>This a refurbished device so it may have been connected to a different Hotmail acct, but this is the first time I have tried to connect it to mine.</p>
<p>All my other devices have connected fine. In the online account under their "access state" the other devices are listed with "access grated."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It has been stated by Microsoft Support&nbsp;the email app may have&nbsp;a problem, however I have used this app successfully on many other phones with no problems when the link in the outlook email&nbsp;to "finish syncing device" worked properly.</p>

            Yes I have tried that as well as all of the recommended troubleshooting issues. Including deleting the device from OWA and deleting the app and starting from scratch. Each time I get an email from Microsoft when I connect back to the exchange server. If
 this were a corporate managed 365 account I could simply grant the device access from the control center, however since it is Hotmail I have no ability as an end user to allow, quarantine, or block access to specific devices. Because the link in the email
 from Microsoft to "finish setting up the mailbox" doesn't work (which I assume serves purpose to allow access to the exchange server) I am unable to manually change the status to access granted like the other devices which I was able to do so. If you look
 at the screenshot above you can see how the device is in "quarantine status." I fear that unless an employee can go in and manually change status to&nbsp;allow access this device will not work.

 you look at this screen shot of my other device using the same mail app it has access granted by "Global permissions" because this is Hotmail access is granted in an automated process by clicking the link in the "finish setup email" on that device the link
 in the email worked and the device was automatically granted access. In 365 on corporate exchange servers the administrator can change access to devices, but again because this is Hotmail I have no manual override authority to allow access to this device.

<h2>            Microsoft Bookings</h2>
                    I use Calendly and would like to switch over to MS Bookings.&nbsp; I've set up some "Services" for customers to book appointments but Microsoft doesn't appear to integrate with my calendar so customers could end up choosing a time that I'm already booked.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Calendly checks my Outlook calendar to see when I'm available; shouldn't Microsoft Bookings do the same?&nbsp; Is this user error or a technical issue with Microsoft Bookings?

<p>Hi NealIsaacs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Bookings calendar will not display personal information of your Office 365 work calendar, it will only show whether the time is available for appointments. For example, if you already have an appointment in your Office 365 work calendar,
 the Booking calendar will show <strong>Busy </strong>at the corresponding time. And from my test in the lab, customers can't book a time which is already booked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please make sure if you have set up syncing work calendar to Bookings. You can navigate to
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/?path=/bookings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Bookings online website</a> and select <strong>Staff </strong>to check if all the staff have enabled
<strong>Events on Office 365 calendar affect availability</strong>. For your reference, you can make a view of the link below.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-staff-s-personal-calendar-with-microsoft-bookings-23ee9b4c-0241-40ff-b663-67a309c378f8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-staff-s-personal-calendar-with-microsoft-bookings-23ee9b4c-0241-40ff-b663-67a309c378f8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a><br />
</p>
<p>And if you have already set it up, I'd like to collect more details to do the further investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How did you set up some Services in your Bookings? I'd like to collect the detailed steps to check if I can reproduce this issue.</p>
<p>2. Do you use an Office 365 account calendar? As a side note, you can't sync an external calendar, such as Outlook.com calendar.</p>
<p>3. What does the Booking calendar look like? If it's convenience, please provide some screenshots for the direct understanding of "choosing a time that I'm already booked".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is no native support for this functionality. In earlier versions you had to do all the hard work to copy the formatting. In PPT 2010 however, you can use the ExecuteMso method to workaround this.</p>
<p>Presentations(1).Slides(1).Copy<br />
Presentations(2).Windows(1).Activate<br />
'Execute the command to paste with source formatting<br />
CommandBars.ExecuteMso ("PasteSourceFormatting")</p>
<p>For older versions this is example code: <a href="http://skp.mvps.org/pptxp001.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Had same issue with HP 500 desktop. Audio worked before update. Then no audio output device found after. Ran audio troubleshooter which detected the problem but did not fix it. Also missing driver for SMBus controller and PCI simple Communication controller.
 Probably the SMBus is the audio problem. Tried to update those missing drivers through Device manager. But they would not.

            <p>Just a update, I tried searching for driver for sound and while the Driver update found a compatible driver.</p>
<p>It could not update because of the SMBus issues and PCI issue. </p>

            <p>No, but am not sure if you will get any other updates security wise? But I don't blame you, if that build was working for you. I would maybe wait a couple days to see if updates get pushed out to fix problems?</p>
<p>Myself, this is a bit to much for me, I expect some bugs and glitches but not total driver failures from one build to another. Guess I will go back to Windows 7 and wait for the finished product.

<p>
</p><p>One thing I'd like you to try is setting your playback device to 24-bit, 96000 Hz if that option is available to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Right-click the speaker in the system tray and click "Playback devices"</p>
<p>- Double-click the active device and go to the "Advanced" tab</p>
<p>- Change the setting there</p>
<p>

</p><p>What do you mean "destroys"?</p>
<p>Installing from the HDD by running "Setup.exe" from the root directory of the mounted ISO is like updating using USB or DVD, you get to keep apps and files, it doesn't destroy anything!</p>

            I'm sorry but it doesn't. I've tried it twice. That option will not check off. There is an error message at the bottom saying "can't be kept because you current version of windows might be installed in an unsupported directory or you're trying to install
 an older version of windows".

<p>Hi &nbsp;,</p>
<p>OneNote is installed on the phone already, and does voice recording too.</p>
<p>You need to find something in the store, if it has to work under locked screen and/or for&nbsp;better audio quality.</p>
<p>Also notice that call recording is not possible in Windows Phone because of OS restrictions, at least not yet.</p>

<p>Hi Qaisabrar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The native software of the Nokia N9 is currently is not supporting video calls.</p>
<p>Although you could try using thid-party applications to achieve this over WLAN.</p>
<p>To use video call applications on 3G network, please refer to your&nbsp;mobile provider&nbsp;to ensure it is possible. Not all of them support this at this moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>they have pull out the video calling function on the N9.</p>

            Front camera is working in N9 only if someone would actually make it in use. Mirror application and bambuser are so far apps that I have found that take use of the front camera.

<p>Does it mean that people who bought N9 paid for some hardware, which they can not use?</p>

    <title>30 Note limitation on 6126&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> endorice  say:</h3>
<h2>            30 Note limitation on 6126&#63;</h2>
                    I don't know if this is a limitation of the 6126, or a PC Suite limitation, so here goes:<br />
<br />
I can successfully sync up between MS Outlook and my 6126 using PC Suite. However, I get only 30 of my Outlook Notes. Is this a *documented* limitation? My selection of the 6126 was driven by the fact that I read many times that you could synchronize your Outlook
 Notes using PC Suite, so I'm really disappointed about this.<br />
<br />
<br />
TIA.

            I could not easily find 6126 from nokia usa, europe or asia, so where is this phone sold ? Try your local Nokia site (in your country) and look for the "find product" - devices and select your phone to view the technical specs.<br />
<br />
However, I doupt there is a documented exact promise how many notes can be stored. If the phone has limited phone moemry capability, some of the memory is reserved for contacts, calendar, notes, files, music, ringtones etc. etc. Phone uses the memory dynamically,
 so none of the listed areas have an exact amount of momery in use, but there are limitations to each of the area to ensure they all work to a degree. I am not aware that user could manually change such settings.<br />
<br />
If your notes are really big, that limits the amount of notes also. Since I could not find your phone, I am not sure about its capabilitites, but maybe you can also use notepad in PC to make notes and then move the notes as files to you phne gallery (but it
 depends on the phone model if the text files are redable or not)

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
The 6126 is a common USA handset for AT&amp;T.<br />
<br />
As far as the size of the Outlook Notes - it doesn't matter if they are one character each, you are still limited to transferring 30 notes to the 6126, which has 10 MB memory, and a MicroSD memory card expansion slot for up to 2-Gig. Since it has this much
 memory, I would expect that you could transfer more than 30 notes to it.

            notes and similar data is saved to phone memory and 10MB is not that much, so I guess you have made the right conclusion, only 30 notes. A smartphone might have been a better choice the PIM features are better and there is more internal memory available
 (for notes also)

<p>
</p><p>ON a Mac ,running Powerpoint for Mac V15.33</p>
<p>
</p><p>This negatively affects the DropBox SmartSync.</p>
<p>Once a file has been downloaded from dropbox using smart sync as a local copy, no matter if the file is converted back into ONLINE only, the recent history in powerpoint keeps downloading the file from dropbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have weekly presentation each of 50MB or more, and while I'm only interested in downloading the last week presentation and keeping all others online, when I download the latests presentation, it wants to download every presentation found under the history
 of recent files. This freezes any action until many many 50MB files are trying to download, preventing the computer from doing any other activity and taking up hard drive space</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first solved it by uninstalling and reinstalling Office for Mac</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently opened over 25 files within the same hour, and clearing the Apply icon recent files does not erase the history from the powerpoint, so all 25 files kept downloading again.</p>

<p>Hi Martce99,<br />
<br />
You can remove the items from the recent items and pin the last week presentation to the list.<br />
1. In PowerPoint, click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Recent</strong> &gt; <strong>
More...</strong>, right click an item and choose <strong>Remove from Recent</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=43e22f41-ecb6-4e36-bc87-0a93df8d29b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d43e22f41-ecb6-4e36-bc87-0a93df8d29b4" /></a></p>
<p>2. For the items you want to keep(the last week presentation), click the pin icon at the right side to pin them to the list.</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9574348e-4c81-4eff-a75f-73b17f95c13d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9574348e-4c81-4eff-a75f-73b17f95c13d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, to better understand the situation, could you provide the following information?<br />
<br />
1. How did you convert the file into online version only?<br />
2. Provide a screenshot of "the recent history in powerpoint keeps downloading the file from dropbox".<br />
3. Does the issue remains if you <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-Office-for-Mac-updates-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
upgrade your PowerPoint</a> to the latest version 15.34?<br />

<p>Hi Martce99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found solution for this, although it might be a bit annoying, it's better then it trying to sync every time you open up powerpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I ended up doing was going in to the dropbox preferences - account - Selective sync: Change settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went and unchecked the files that were causing me grief. The files will still be accessible on the web but will no longer be on your computer. You can re-check them as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            This is what I did, but then if you want to shrink or enlarge anything the shapes don't move with the column as they do with the orginal graph.. Powerpoint has the same problem :(

<p>Sorry I picked the wrong chart before -- but the same method works, with the addition of a step to copy/paste the column shape. When you click in the shaded area of the third column, the handles (little circles) appear on that shape as well as on the outer
 canvas to show that it's selected. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8576a666-c9da-4d47-a82c-a77fe19a75d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8576a666-c9da-4d47-a82c-a77fe19a75d6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy that shape and then paste it on the fourth column, where it automatically lines up with the small boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8681f528-76e8-4943-be97-edefe5e39b92?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8681f528-76e8-4943-be97-edefe5e39b92?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you resize the outer canvas, everything inside will be resized too.</p>

<p>Hi Ajd602,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>According to your description, the issue may be related to you didn’t have edit permission of the file.</p>
<p>I need to confirm if you stored the file on your OneDrive.</p>
<p>If so, I suggest you open the file on Excel online to check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not your situation, I want to collect the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>1. The detailed version of Office, such as Version 1902 (Build 11328.20222). (Click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of error message.</p>
<p>3. Where did you store the file, computer or OneDrive for Business?</p>
<p>4. Check if all files meet the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Automatically set default location in weather bar</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>when our users open outlook 2013 and click calendar the weather bar shows "washington, d.c" by default. i would like to change this default to a uk location.
</p>
<p>i did some research and found some articles online about using group policy to implement a weatherserviceurl registry key but this didn't work and resulted in it showing "washington, d.c - requesting..." rather than the weather in a different location. it
 looks to me that the weatherserviceurl is to point to a custom weather service rather than the standard one (which i guess i bing) rather than changing the default location.
</p>

<h2>            MS Publisher 2007 weird symbols I can&#39;t remove from docs.</h2>
                    I hit two keys at the same time while creating a document in MS Publisher 2007. Now all of my documents have backward P's all over the document and a lot of dots everywhere. How do I get these symbols off my documents?

            Hello Lane. I'm a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear that you're facing this frustration.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new Skype is still under development and as such as lacking many of the features and functions that users have come to know and expect.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates in the very near future in order to add features and functions as well as fix known bugs in order to bring the new Skype up to the level that users know and expect.<br /><br />Microsoft has dedicated a website to collecting feedback, feature request, and Bug reports for the new Skype. It can be found here.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com</a><br /><br />in the meantime, while it is not recommended, users are able if they wish to revert to using classic Skype and Microsoft has decided that classic Skype will continue to be supporte

<h2>            &#34;This page can&#39;t be displayed&#34; error and wifi issues</h2>
                    <p>i have windows 10, the error "This page can't be displayed" keeps showing up on my internet explorer browser, after refreshing a few times I am able to see the webpage. since this has been occurring my browser is very slow. I am also having problems with
 my Wi-Fi, the connection keeps saying "not connected" or "no internet" however all other devices in my house seem to work fine with the router. After a few times of disconnecting and reconnecting the issue is solved but temporarily. sometimes the connection
 will go of and back on by itself. Everything was working fine up until 2 weeks ago, only thing that has changed since then is an automatic update.</p>
