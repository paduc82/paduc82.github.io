</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I am having a terrible time with Windows 10 update. I build this system new and

installed a fresh OS. It worked well for several weeks. Then windows updated and <br />
then I was unable to use several of the USB Ports and got error codes: The exception
<br />
&nbsp;breakpoint has been reached. (0x80000003). Then after a while as it is shutting down a blue screen with: DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE when shutting down.
<br />
Once it shut down it would not boot. The little circle just keeps spinning. Eventually it
<br />
got to a repair screen where I was unable to get back to windows. I thought this <br />
might have been related to some lightning that happened the night before. </span>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then it worked for ~4 weeks until I came home to see that

windows had tried to update and was stuck at 93%. I left it on overnight with no <br />

needed a new OS install (Win 10 Pro 10.0.10586.318 I think - cannot get into <br />
Windows to see what it actually installed so I pulled this from my Microsoft account
<br />
page). I tried to install this and it failed. Booted to safe mode and cleared the update

cache. Then installed it without difficulty only to realize that this is was the problem
<br />
that killed my USB ports and made the system unstable in the first place!!?</span></p>

Is the motherboard not compatible with this version of Windows? I find it hard to

    <title>Repeated rejection of passwords - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> optimost  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated rejection of passwords</h2>
                    For the last couple of months, I have been being asked repeatedly for my password, like have of the time I try to use Skype. Then, after many attempts to use what I know to be my password, I am repeatedly told it is invalid. When I set up a new password,
 it may work for a few days or a week, but then it is rejected no matter how carefully I check its accuracy.&nbsp; Today, I set up a new password, and it was rejected within minutes when I tried to use it.&nbsp; That was a hour or two ago. I was asked for password to
 enter this site and ask a question, and the same password that was rejected a couple of hours ago, was accepted.&nbsp; I do not want to hear that this must be because I am making mistakes entering my passwords. I check too many time and too carefully, as you might
 imagine, for that to be the problem. Anyone else run into this craziness??

    <title>Cannot read&#47; copy Jpegs from external drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louismarais  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot read&#47; copy Jpegs from external drive</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 7 Premium 64bit. Then I started to copy Jpegs from my external harddrive to my new PC internal harddrive. This external harddrive was managed by XP previously.
<br />
<br />
Suddenly Windows7 complained. It tells me that the file or path does not exist. With some investigation I found that all Jpegs larger than 1MB cannot be read or copied. Smaller files are fine.
<br />
<br />
Then I tried to copy my latest photos from my camera's SD card. Same problem. However, Windows7 then asked if I wanted to acan fix a problem on the card. I decided not to and "imported" the images by choosing it as one of the options in the pop-up box. It then
 worked.<br />
<br />
So manually trying to read, open, thumbnail preview or copy any Jpeg larger than 1MB does not work at all only since I have moved from Xp to Windows7 64bit.<br />
<br />
Why is this?<br />
How can I solve the problem? <br />
<br />
Thanks

<p>Hey LouisMarais,</p>
<p>What is the file system of your external drive and the SD card?</p>
<p>As per your post, Windows prompted you to scan and fix the problem on your camera's SD card. The reason for the error is most likely due to the fact that your external drive as well as the SD card was formatted with FAT32 file system on Windows XP.</p>
<p>The gist of this message is to run check disk on your SD card. Iâ€™d suggest the same on your external drive.<br />
Insert your external drive and follow these steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Go to start and type <strong>cmd</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;At the command prompt type the following command.<br />
<strong><br />
chkdsk <em>(device drive letter):</em> /f<br />
</strong><br />
For example: chkdsk e: /f, where e is the drive letter for the external drive.<br />
<br />
Depending on the size of your drive, this might take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it is checking for errors.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Repeat the same procedure for your SD card.</p>
<p>Once check disk completes, you should be able to copy successfully. Verify the same.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the drive data available on that might be lost when chkdsk tries to repair that sector.</p>
<p>For other method of checking drive for errors, see:</p>
<p><strong>Check a drive for errors<br />

<p>You may also convert the file system of the external drive as well as the SD card to NTFS for better performance and security.</p>
<p>Refer this article for help.</p>

<p>When I call support, there is a message stating that there is an issue with computers that have upgraded to Windows 10 and Microsoft is aware of the issue.</p>
<p>Is there any resolution on this or any workarounds? We are getting download speeds of 1.3 MBPS and upload speeds of 0.74 MBPS.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we can't do anything at all...</p>

            I am also an Xfinity customer and had internet connectivity issues, I found I needed to update my drivers for my network card. Microsoft update driver told me I had the latest but going to the internet and searching for the drivers found a new version
 on the manufacturer website. Updated the driver (Microsoft said it could not verify the driver compatible with hardware but I upgraded anyway) and now working fine. Good luck!

            Thank you. We did update the drivers yesterday but it didn't do anything to help. I think we will have to go back to a previous windows. Our computers are less than a year old so it's not a computer issue.

<p><strong><span>Hi Novum,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The information provided by Chris is the best you can get.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But I would suggest you to try Installing and using the device in Windows Vista or Windows XP SP3 compatibility with in Windows 7 and then check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If a program written for an earlier version of</span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span>
 doesn't run correctly; you can use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.<br />
<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link for assistance on compatibility mode-<br />

    <title>How to create a report showing folder structure and files in a folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to create a report showing folder structure and files in a folder</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I have a requirement to produce a report (could be a PDF, Word doc or XLS) that shows all the folders/sub-folders below a given folder in Windows Explorer, so we can see the folder structure and analyze it. We also need a second report with the same criteria
 but also listing out all the files inside each folder. There are thousands of files under each folder so it will be large report. I have done something similar using the File System object model in VB before, but am wondering if there is a simple off-the-shelf
 tool or command we can use instead.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            Hi Paul
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer and navigate to that folder
<br />
<br />In the address bar, just type cmd and hit Enter
<br />
<br />That will open a Commend Prompt in that folder
<br />
<br />Paste this into Command Prompt and hit Enter
<br />
<br />dir /s/b &gt; AAA.txt
<br />
<br />Wait for that command to complete
<br />
<br />That will have created a new text file in that folder - AAA.txt that will contain a listing of all files in that folder, including all sub-folders, which you can copy/paste into Word, Excel . . . etc.
<br />
<br />If you just want to list files in a specific folder and not sub-folders, open a Command Prompt in that folder and run this command:
<br />
<br />dir /b &gt; AAA.txt

<h2>            Group Messages</h2>
                    <p>Are there any plans to change the conversation group messages? We are in a community and find the mass messaging ( group conversation) really annoying when people leave it or post in it, it alerts you to every action. It would be great if we could go back
 to the 360 system where you could mass message members and it only alerted them individually. There was no linking them into the conversation on mass so they didn't get notifications every time someone left the group/conversation or commented. Please think
 about &nbsp;changing this system, as it really isn't helpful to communities or clans.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Crimlawfed, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. I need a little more infromation in order to give you an appropriate answer What OS are you upgrading from? When the installation fails is there an error code associated with it? Does the install roll you back to the previous OS or are you
 stuck where you have to install 7? I see you received your copy from Digital River, did you burn your copy or did they mail it to you? Finally, what make and model PC are you using if any?
<br />
<br />
Let us know and again thanks for posting.

            <p>IÂ´m sad to say that you probably will never get this to work. The two main issues: Asus not providing updates for this PC since 2010 and Microsoft insisting on upgrading with drivers that will not work on this PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically the graphics drivers are the problem. </p>
<p>The UL80VT comes with "hybrid graphics" which means that there are two graphics cards in the PC, one on board (intel) and one discrete (nvidia).
</p>
<p>Special drivers are needed to switch between the two cards and these drivers have only been updated once (2010). Thanks Asus, this is the reason why IÂ´ll not buy an asus pc again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when you upgrade from win 7 to win 10 it wil "see" an Nvidia graphics card with very old drivers and attempt to update to the latest Nvidia drivers. This update will fail when you reboot as the drivers are not compatible with the switchable graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as Microsoft insists on forcing driver updates on us win 10 will never work for us, unfortunately.</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the useful post! Hope you won't mind my interjecting. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too, faced two problems after upgrading my old ASUS UL80-Vt from Windows 7 to Win 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The default graphics (as decided by Microsoft) is the Intel Mobile Express 4 graphics upon the first installation. Win 10 doesn't recognize the UL80-Vt's second graphics adapter - the GeForce G210M until later in the same week, when it downloaded a separate
 G210M driver but my laptop failed to install it (the driver) for some reason.</li><li>The Intel Centrino Wireless-N 1000 adapter gets updated with Intel's version 14.1 driver, which doesn't coexist nicely with Windows 10. I had to roll back to an early (year 2009) Intel BGN 1000 driver in order to get my WiFi to connect properly. Even then
 I was able to use my laptop for a couple of days, until Win 10 updated something in the background which caused a permanent WiFi dropout which I was unable to resolve.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that depending on the hardware configuration, Windows 10 may or may not be suitable for PCs that have been running on Win 7 for years without problems. In the case of the UL80-VT (including its siblings, the UL50-VT and UL30-VT based on the same
 hardware), the G210M/Intel Mobile Graphics 4 doesn't have the Optimus auto graphics switching technology that later GeForce hybrid graphics do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result my laptop is permanently stuck on the Intel Mobile Graphics adapter and the upper-left hardware button no longer switches between the Intel and the Nvidia GeForce G210M. It was a mild annoyance but I could not accept the fact that the laptop's
 WiFi connectivity was also affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back to Windows 7 and all become fine after that. I got back both my Intel/Nvidia graphic adapter switching and more importantly, a stable WiFi connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I would put the blame on Windows 10 instead of Asus. At the time the UL80-Vt was released, Asus chose the best low power consumption, hybrid graphics subsystem available. Moreover, Win 7 was the current Microsoft Windows OS available and the UL-series
 notebooks were certified to run properly on Windows 7. There was no way that any manufacturer could predict Microsoft's future operating systems, let alone guarantee that their laptops will continue to work seamlessly with post Win 7 OSes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Asus cannot guarantee a 100% compatibility with Windows 10 on the UL80-VT. If you want to retain your laptop's Intel/Nvidia graphics switching and consistent WiFi connectivity,
<strong>do not upgrade to Windows 10.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you also have any computer that runs certain old games on Win 7 nicely, there's a chance that Win 10's compatibility mode will not run your favorite old games properly (Ubisoft's Raven Shield and Ghost Recon game will NOT run properly under Windows 10)
 as I found out the hard way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I would not be so hasty as to boycott Asus as I'm sure other notebook brands with the same hybrid graphics technology are not fully Win 10 compatible either. I have two other (newer) Asus laptop - I'm typing this on my Asus G551-JM gaming
 rig, which runs Windows 10 beautifully. My other notebook is the UX-303LN Zenbook, but I haven't decided when to upgrade it from Windows 8.1 to Win 10 yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a 2010-era, Acer Aspire 1825PTZ convertible that originally came with Windows 7 and had succeeded upgrading it to Windows 10. It too, uses the Centrino Wireless-N 1000 network adapter but I managed to get the WiFi to work after trying out several
 (older) Intel Wireless-N 1000 drivers. Since the Aspire 1825PTZ uses a single graphics adapter (Intel Mobile Graphics 4 series), there were no issues with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a general rule of thumb, any Asus laptop that was originally shipped with Windows 8/8.1 should run Windows 10 without major issues. If it originally came with Win 7, it depends on the hardware configuration and you have to give Win 10 a try. It's sad
 that Microsoft gave consumers a blanket impression that all PC hardware that came with OEM Win 7 will upgrade and run Win 10 seamlessly. :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this post helps anyone owning the old Asus UL-series notebooks and are contemplating to upgrade to the free Windows 10. :-)</p>

</p><blockquote>Is there any way to prevent the graphics drivers from being updated?
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10? Yes, there is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can prevent Win 10 from updating any hardware driver using the following method:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open up Control Panel and select <em>Devices and Printers.</em></li><li>Right click the icon representing your laptop and choose <em>Device Installation Settings.</em></li><li>When the window pops out, select the radio button next to "No, let me choose what to do" and tick the radio button next to "Never install driver software from Windows Update".</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e2e5a5d-bda5-4423-8eb4-827483318700" height="375" width="450" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This should ideally be performed as soon as you have successfully upgraded your laptop to Win 10 or at least, temporarily disconnect your machine from the Internet. If don't do this ASAP, Microsoft will attempt to update your Asus UL80-VT (or a similar model)
 with new drivers that won't work and render certain functions useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, Windows 10 in my opinion, is less suitable for the old Asus UL series compared to Windows 7 - unless you're prepared to use only the Intel Mobile Graphics 4 series graphics mode.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it stop at second boot or forever black screen try follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use Microsoft MediaCreationTool to download latest version ISO (my 1703).</p>
<p>2. Expand IOS to a bootable USB.</p>
<p>3. For update version/build, run a Windows administrative shell at USB device.</p>
<p>4. run setup.exe /Auto Clean</p>
<p>5. Station must be online.</p>
<p>6. It will auto download the update&nbsp;and selectively the only supported drivers.</p>
<p>7. A fresh new Windows 10 with latest build will be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning! All apps and application will be removed. You need to reinstall all others except a new fresh activated Windows 10 with latest build.

<p>The root problem may be in Win10 in loading the long list of device driver components for Mobile Intel 4 Series Chipset Family when upgrading from Win7 to Win10. Intel supports the dual-drivers for the lower graphic performance in the on-board chip and the
 higher performance (thus power consumption) Nvidia card, so that laptops can switch between the two mode depending on AC or battery only. V1511 and 1607 will crash the driver update - apparently when the OS determines "Insufficient System Resources exists
 to Complete the API" when loading components for the Nvidia G210M card. The error code # is (Code 31).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 v1703 can survive from the problem and "isolate" the the card and only use the Intel on-board graphic driver. This problem seems to be unrelated to a specific dual-mode graphic card. I suspect that when OS detects this Windows resource problem, it
 forces a download of a new Nvidia driver of the same card. In my Asus UL80Vt laptop, the card is G210M, and it will slip through all the blocking scheme for downloading drivers, such as "ExcludeWUDriversInQuality" key for the Home version. The group policy
 may not work either, but my laptop is Home version. The new Nvidia driver will fail and give a blank screen, but will NOT crash the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to finish the updates (to v1703), and the system displays generic low-resolution. I opened up the graphic display in&nbsp; Device Manager and "rolled back" the Nvidia driver., and restart. The high resolution display return. But the original Nvidia
 driver is NOT in the list (only the Intel driver). And 3 Intel graphic components (igfxtrap.exe, hkcmd.exe, igfxpres.exe) show up for security confirmation to install. These are part of that long list of components (20+) which OS does not have sufficient resource.
 The Windows 10 Home v1709 (yes all the way to the latest version) will work except for the dual display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to share this with someone who is knowledgeable and can get Microsoft's attention. I saw other complaints on different dual-display cards. I think the root problem is right within the Windows 10 after all.</p>

<h2>            Help with Windows XP. Your security settings do not allow websites to use ActiveX controls installed on your computer.</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original Title: Help with Windows XP.</u></strong></p>
<p>I have a laptop with Windows XP. When I try to go from home page to email it says I have no internet connection even though I do. I also cannot run windows update. A pop up says that my security settings will not allow active x but does not give me option
 to change as I have seen before. I have tried everything I can think of.</p>

    <title>Blu Ray&#47;DVD leads to static and flickering - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blu Ray&#47;DVD leads to static and flickering</h2>
                    I'm having issues with playing DVDs or Blu Rays on my Xbox X. My games work just fine, but once I insert a DVD with the Blu Ray app on, the display starts flickering, switching between static, black screens, and the images from the DVD. The audio is also
 choppy, mostly turning on when the images from DVD are on display. Here's a video:&nbsp;https://www.dropbox.com/s/33d2tzywgdcrjx2/IMG_9109.MOV?dl=0<br />
<br />
I've tried different HDMI cables. I've tried resetting the whole Xbox. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the blu ray app. Anyone have any tips or other ideas? I just want to watch a DVD once in a while!

<p>Ok!! That solved it. It was the HDMI cable. I was using the original one from Xbox, but I switched to a newer one and now no more issues. It's strange to me that the old cable worked with games, but not with DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it works now. Thank you so much for your help!</p>

            Hi Alvaro, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend two troubleshooting steps which may resolve the problem you're having accessing Google sites:
<br />
<br />Firstly, flush your DNS:
<br />- Click Start, and type "cmd".
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Copy and paste the below one line at a time, pressing enter each time:
<br />netsh winsock reset - and press Enter.
<br />netsh int ip reset - and press Enter.
<br />ipconfig /release - and press Enter.
<br />ipconfig /renew - and press Enter.
<br />ipconfig /flushdns - and press Enter
<br />
<br />Secondly, try resetting your hosts file. Here are instructions:
<br />

<br />
<br />After doing these steps, you should be able to access the sites again. Let me know how you go! Thanks!

            Please also check the date, time and time zone, I am not sure if you are the case, 
<br />
<br />When the system time is earlier than the current date, say 1999, or a future date say 2020 which make the SSL certificate invalid or expired when it make compare to system time.

<h2>            Incompatibility between Hyper-V and AMD FirePro M6100 FireGL V</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a laptop (DELL Precision M6800) with an AMD FirePro M6100 FireGL V with Windows 10 Enterprise installed (clean install)</p>
<p>Before installing Hyper-V, my HDMI video output works normally and allow me using another monitor as third display (I've also a VGA one).</p>
<p>Once I've installed Hyper-V all goes wrong. Screen are full of "snow" and only the mouse pointer is correctly displayed. (see picture: the VGA is #2, the HDMI is the&nbsp; #3)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5f4e978-edf0-4f93-b72b-a49be5d016ef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5f4e978-edf0-4f93-b72b-a49be5d016ef" /></a></p>
<p>I uninstall Hyper-V and all goes to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an known issue ? Does a workaround/fix exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need Hyper-V to work. So I cannot be satisfied with an answer like 'try VMWare'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pierre-Alain Galtier</p>

<h2>            Driver and software for Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    A client I support has pre-ordered a number of Surface Pro 4 tablets. &nbsp;Due to security requirements at this firm I will need to wipe and reinstall windows 10 before these devices can be connected and joined to the corporate network. I already have the
 Windows 10 Pro installation software but nothing specific to the Surface 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;Is there somewhere I can download the drivers and software now in preparation for the reinstall? &nbsp;Any assistance will be appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks
