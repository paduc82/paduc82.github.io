            Hey I found out how to fix this. &nbsp;Find word (or whatever program/s that isn't working) in its file location then right click on it and go to properties. then go to the compatibility tab and check the box. I had to set the compatibility to windows 7, but
 it might be different for you. Hope this helps.
<div>P.S. if you need the thread to find word in its folder just say and I'll try to help &nbsp;</div>

    <title>N70 does not ring for messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inespgancho  say:</h3>
<h2>            N70 does not ring for messages</h2>
                    Good evening,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I would like to apologize if this question has already been raised in any other topic.<br />
<br />
I have a problem with my N70. It receives messages, but it does not ring. When I receive a message, only a small envelope appears on the top right-hand corner of the screen. Additionally, it does not show any delivery reports.<br />
<br />
When there is an incoming call, it rings. However, if I do not answer, it does not show any missed calls warning. It only appears as a small sign on the top right hand side of the screen, when I go to the menu.<br />
<br />
Firstly I thought that this happened because I had no memory left. So, I bought a new memory card, with larger capacity. Now, all my messages are stored in the memory card, which has only 176 MB used and 802MB free. The problem seemed solved for a while, but
 now it returned. I do have a lot of messages in my phone (about 2000...), bot as they are stored in the memory card, there should be no interference, right?<br />
<br />
How do you think I could solve this problem (preferably without deleting all the income box)??<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help,<br />
Inês

<p>I also do have same problem exactly as reported. But in between I saw some interesting thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took back up of phone on memory card, reinstalled/upgraded firmware version from nokia updater. After reinstallation/uprgade, in its default mode, it gave all missed calls alerts and message tones as a normal mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after restoring backup back to phone, the messaging phenomenon got disappeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Nokia Support Team (if they are monitoring forums) also should put in some thoughts for these user problems and suggest something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, it is their product and they only may understand than we users crushing our heads.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />unfortunately for Microsoft product there is no deactivation process. You had to delete your licensed products before computer handover.
<br />Nevertheless you may reactivate these products by calling Microsoft support during work hours and asking a live person for help.

            Could I just add to Igor's post.&nbsp; If Windows 10 and or Office 2013 came preinstalled you cannot transfer the licence.&nbsp; If not you need proof of purchase for both Windows 10 and Office 2013, that is the Product Keys and any other proof of purchase.

<div>
<p>Dear Nokia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi Suite proposed to me the firmware upgrade from 031.??? to 051.018 release. After upgrade, my new E52 is freezing completely 1-3 times per day now !!!&nbsp; There is not possible to turn-off the phone. I have to pick out the battery, put the battery in and
 start the phone again! Firmware re-installing has no effect. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pretty frustrated from this situation.</p>
<p>Does new announced firmware 052.003 solve this greate bug? OR How can I downgrade the firmware back to 031.??? release?</p>
<p>I need to solve it FAST!</p>
<p>In other case, I will have to ask for money back and switch to another brand mark (after many years using of Nokia phones).</p>

<h2>            New to WM how to Delete emails on device without deleting them on the server</h2>
                    
<p>I recently switched over to WM 6.5 device from a BlackBerry and when I would delete emails on my BlackBerry it would ask if I want to delete them on just the phone, or on the server and the phone, Windows Mobile 6.5 doesn't appear to have that functionality.</p>
<p>If I delete a message on my phone on either my Exchange account or hotmail account it gets&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;deleted. &nbsp;Is there anyway just to delete from the phone?</p>

<p>No there's no way to stop this from happening. The only thing you may be able to try is to limit how much mail your device keeps stored locally.&nbsp; Since you're using Exchange you could keep this setting low and use server search to find other e-mails.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I'm understanding your question.</p>
<ol>
<li>Defintion of 'page break': this is a break indicating that any text which follows after the break should be displayed on the next page in your document.</li><li>Unable to type a letter with header and footer on first page only: use the "Different First Page" option. In Word 2007, create a new document, and add some text until you end up with at least two pages. Go to the top of your document and double click in
 the header section to activate the header. Type in something in your header. Now, while your header is active, there should be a new contextual tab on the ribbon, called "Header &amp; Footer Tools" "Design". On that tab, there is an "Options" group, with a checkbox
 labeled "Different First Page". Make sure it is checked. Now, close the header using the "Close Header&nbsp;and Footer" button on the ribbon. If you check the result, you will see that your header is only on the first page, and not on the second page.<br />
By using section breaks, you can have different headers/footers for different parts of your document. In such a case, you will have to use the "Link to Previous" button on the same ribbon tab.</li><li>What does Body-Add Details' mean: no idea. Where are you seeing this? Are you using some kind of template?</li></ol>

<h2>            How can I get Powerpoint to launch on mid-2010 15&#34; MacBook Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Under 10.9.5, I can't get either Word 2011 or PowerPoint 2011 to launch.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Under 10.12.6 and 10.13.4, I can't get PowerPoint 2011 or 2016 to launch.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They all seem to hang at CGLChoosePixelFormat.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I applied the MBPMid2010-GPU-Fix, so it's not clear the known GPU problem with this machine is causing this or it's something else.</p>

 either Safari or Firefox. It just hangs. Also, Chrome won't fully startup. It gets stuck at a blank, white window, but doesn't hang like PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I got admit your suggestion of running with the shift key made absolutely no sense as to how that could possibly make a difference, but it did. Powerpoint loads just fine. I can also surf to the page above and Chrome starts up just fine. Interestingly,
 at bootup in safe mode, there are all sorts of graphics artifacts and I'm not sure what causes them.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Anyway, I discovered the Apple kext&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(64, 11, 217, 1)">AppleIntelHDGraphics, which is being loaded under normal startup, but not in safe mode, is the cause for the issues I described above.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled this kext under normal startup and amazingly the computer boots up in full startup mode, and works perfectly normally. I'm not sure I fully understand how this is possible, but it seems to be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            external monitor not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    I noticed several other posts with this this problem, but none seem to be resolved, does MS monitor this forum? I have an external monitor connected by VGA, worked fine before the upgrade, now the Dell laptop doesn't recognize that there is an external
 monitor. Happened on 2 different laptops. Nothing special about the machine, just vanilla Dell with current Win 10 release. checked for new drivers, rebooted, not a VM

<h3> jv m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional formatting&#58; custom icon set makes Edit Formatting Rule pane very slow</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using icon sets in conditional formatting, I have the following issue. I wonder if this is a general issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select an icon set, everything is fine. However, when I set one of the icons to "No cell icon", the Edit Formatting Rule pane gets extremely slow. This seems to be a problem with any "Custom" icon style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anybody recognizing this issue or does anyone have a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> jefflang007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync settings not saving</h2>
                    I have two computers that i sync with, both being different items, and never the same ones on both computers.&nbsp;
<br />
My work PC has active sync on XP and this always works remembering what the sync settings are (this one is for my calendar and contacts.<br />
My home PC is simply for syncing files, however even though on the previous sync i save these settings and have all the others unchecked (ie contacts, email) the home PC (vista) syncs all items that are available to be checked (ie mail calendar one note etc
 etc.) this wipes all the settings from my work PC such as my important calendar and contacts.<br />
Oh these settings are also saved in my phone how I want them, it is just my home vista (32 bit) that screws it all up.<br />
<br />
Any ideas....PLEASE

            Direct answer: Yes, Office 2008 [12.3.5] runs fine on OS X 10.6.8 [Snow Leopard]. I'd recommend that you have Office fully updated before upgrading the OS, though.<br />
<br />
Also, once you've completed the upgrade, run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions &amp; restart the Mac before launching any of the Office apps.<br />
<br />
One possible issue is related to fonts. If you have any problems reply here for steps to take.<br />

<p>You are sort of off course in that this site is for testing beta releases of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am an user of&nbsp;Word 2016&nbsp;so Word 2007 was a long time ago.&nbsp; This shot of my Word 2016 which shows a location to store a file that may not have been saved.&nbsp; Look for something like this in 2007.&nbsp; There is a lot of internal saving going behind the
 scene.</p>

<h2>            Outlook allows you to set a default font, but on every message, there is an empty line below the signature where this reverts to Calibri</h2>
                    Outlook allows you set a default font and choose your own font for your signature, but no matter what you do, there will always be at least 1 blank line below your signature (in new messages and replies) where the font reverts back to Calibri. This means
 if you type below your signature or remove your signature, then start typing, you are not in your default font and must manually change it.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sorry for the delay, as I was out of office several day ago. General speaking, we edit the email above the signature
 and Outlook doesn’t consider the text below the signature as a part of the contents of your email body. The text below the signature is convinced as the “quote” (just like the original message text when replying or forwarding a message). The original message
 is formatted as Calibri 11 by Outlook acquiescently. That’s why it is Calibri instead of the other fonts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As far as I know, we can’t change the font via the Settings in Outlook desktop client. I agree that it would be better
 if we can custom it. Given this situation, I suggest that post the idea in the user voice and leave a comment to submit feedback via the following link:

<h2>            Phone beeps when I talk</h2>
                    I have had&nbsp;a Moto Q 9h global phone for over 9 months now, it is great. Something new and very irritating has started. When I am talking on the phone about every minute or so it will BEEP in the earpiece. It beeps so loud that the conversation is interupted
 and it hurts my ear. I do not have a bluetooth hooked up, virus scan is enabled, and it does't beep if Idon't talk on it. Everything else is working like it always has, hooking up to the computer, texting, internet, schedule, ETC.... just that darn BEEP. I
 have tried everything I know. Even saying a little prayer to the cell phone god, of course he answered with this website and a little message. ""&nbsp;Any help will be rewarded with a days worth of happiness, and a life time of satisfaction". Thanks B&nbsp;&nbsp;

            On your device, go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Sounds. Scroll down until you see "Minute beep". Disable that feature. You probably accidentally enabled that feature that makes the device beep every minute during a phone call.

 Column G should = Column C ONLY when Column A reads the word "Other".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found this page:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-your-billing-address-for-Office-365-for-business-a25c10d6-c1e9-4299-9185-25178df9eba6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-your-billing-address-for-Office-365-for-business-a25c10d6-c1e9-4299-9185-25178df9eba6</a></p>
<p>but it is not helpful as it describes how to change your credit card details not the billing address.</p>
<p>Can someone explain how to do this without changing credit card details?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi Jaspervan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>Generally, we can change the address in the credit card details as the billing address. The payment will go through to the newly created address.</p>
<p>If you encounter any issue after changing the billing address, please feel free to post back, I will be glad to give further assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Poppy</p>

<p>Hello George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a very interesting past, if I must say. Would love to have met Bill and the boys back in the day. Anyhow, you state you are running Build 17713, a very old build. (or is that a typo). That is even prior to October Release. That could be part of the
 reason you cannot upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you just download the ISO for 18272, just mount the image and run setup.exe within windows. Hopefully at this point, you should be able to upgrade to Build 18290.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also just upgrade with the Release build and make sure Insider is set to Fast Ring and upgrade to Build 18290. Your choice. You can get the ISO's here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>George, double check your Insider Ring in Settings, something just not right here. Been a MS user since Dos 3.0. The good times with autoexec.bat and config.sys days, having to manually load drivers. :-)</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010&#47;Windows 10 No Search Results - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010&#47;Windows 10 No Search Results</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple users that are experiencing massive issues with searches in Outlook 2010 after a recent security update. I know it was a known issue with the recent update for issues with indexing, but it has been marked as fixed. I am up to date on software
 updates, and issue is persisting. Yesterday searching was working flawlessly, but today it is back to its "No search results found" shenanigans. This is happening to multiple users, all running 2010 Outlook and Windows 10. I've also read a few places that
 the specific update that fixed indexing was pulled, but haven't been able to gather any concrete evidence of this. I could be missing it completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked out a couple resources around the issue, but still am having issues getting their search function up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2769651/outlook-search-returns-no-matches-found</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Outlook-known-issues-in-the-June-2017-security-updates-3f6dbffd-8505-492d-b19f-b3b89369ed9b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 search is working as expected, which narrows it back to Outlook 2010. Upgrading to a newer version is in the upgrade plan, but is not feasible yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This troubleshooting has been completed some by me, and some by another tech in the department so I am open to any and all help because we may have missed something. I am looking for a fix, rather than a workaround. I believe if I turn off indexing the search
 function through outlook would work, but it will not be as quick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to confirm if you have completed all the needed steps in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-network-upload-to-import-PST-files-to-Office-365-103f940c-0468-4e1a-b527-cc8ad13a5ea6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do have completed the steps, we need to collect some information below to troubleshoot it:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check if the same issue occurs to another global admin account. If there isn’t another one, you can create a new user account and then assign the global admin role to it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: A global admin account doesn’t need a license.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Which web browser are you using? Try to use different ones to see the results.</span></p>
<p><span>3. What’s the size of the PST file?</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>I can confirm I have done all that need to be done. it was that article I used many months back to import other PSTs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I&nbsp;uploaded two&nbsp;PSTs using the azure storage tools command line.</p>
<p>I went through the process of uploading the mapping file. Again no errors but he import job does not appear in the browser window.</p>
<p>I know the import is happening as I can see the email appearing in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I run the command Get-MailboxImportRequest -Status InProgress I can&nbsp;see the job, just nothing in the web browser window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different admin accounts, different browsers, different PC's / laptops and a iMac with chrome and safari.</p>
<p>
