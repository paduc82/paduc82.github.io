<h3> terrileesmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Teams - using Class Notebook for student digital portfolios</h2>
                    <p>I have created several Teams which include students from the Class of 2018 and Class of 2019.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Class of 2018 in Teams:</strong></p>
<p>This one is working!&nbsp; I added the students (about 200) and teachers (about 60), and then created the
<strong>Class Notebook</strong> for the student portfolios.&nbsp; I used 7 sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>High School Plan</li><li>Self-Assessment</li><li>Interest Inventory</li><li>Career Research</li><li>Employment</li><li>Transition Plan</li><li>Resources</li></ol>
<p>I can view all notebooks, and can see all the student notebooks, plus their 7 sections.&nbsp; I created this one as a test in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For the past 2 days, I have been working on adding three other Classes in Teams:</p>
<p><strong>Class of 2019 in Teams:</strong></p>
<p>This one is not working, nor <strong>Class of 2020, </strong>or <strong>Class or 2021:</strong></p>
<p>I did these all the same way. &nbsp; I can see the Teams, all student and teacher members; however, I can not see any of the student notebooks. :( &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea why this worked back in the fall and is not working now??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Thank you Carlos. I actually had a phone / Skype conversation with an engineer last Friday. &nbsp;He put me in touch wirh another engineer Sunday. &nbsp;We were able to get the students populated in one another Team. &nbsp;Now, just two teams are left. It does take some
 time for the student notebooks to populate. &nbsp;This shoulld not be a problem when the students start using their Digital Notebook for eportfolios.&nbsp;

                    <p>New PC with Windows 10 and Office 2016 recently purchased and downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can successfully open Word and Excel documents from within File Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But</span> if I am in Word or Excel and try to open anything from those programs I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Excel has stopped working</strong></p>
<p><strong>A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available. CLOSE PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>then&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft Word (or Excel) is restarting</strong></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
2. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
6. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
7. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
8. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
10. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
11. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
12. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
13. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

    <title>Print position adjustments for documents and labels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> honest abe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print position adjustments for documents and labels</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to make small adjustments in print alignment, for different printers, without affecting the formatting of a document?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THE DILEMMA </strong>- The paper registration for many printers&nbsp;can be&nbsp;slightly off&nbsp;and there is often no way to mechanically correct this problem.&nbsp; Furthermore, many printer configuration utilities do not provide options for adjusting the print
 alignment to compensate for registration problems.&nbsp; These small registration&nbsp;differences&nbsp;can be extremely noticeable, especially when working with small tolerances&nbsp;related to labels or other&nbsp;publications that require accurate layout.&nbsp; While there are a myriad
 reasons for a paper registration&nbsp;problem,&nbsp;even small differences&nbsp;in registration for plain paper, labels, photo paper, cards, brochures, and other stock can create problems on a single printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WORD DOES NOT PROVIDE A CLEAN SOLUTION </strong>- Adjusting the document settings in Word, in order to print properly on a specific printer, often means the document will now print wrong on&nbsp;other printers.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is especially a problem when the document
 is widely distributed.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp;it is extremely unintuitive, not to mention confusing,&nbsp;for users when required to set margins to 1 1/8 inches, for example, just to get a standard 1 inch margin on a specific printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BEST SOLUTION</strong> - Many accounting programs provide a feature that allows the user to make fine adjustments&nbsp;to the print position of the final printout.&nbsp; This is especially useful in printing checks properly on a preprinted form without having
 to change the check design format.&nbsp; Some graphics and publishing&nbsp;programs also provide such a feature for properly registering output on different printers.&nbsp; In most cases, the feature is in the form of a small dialog that allows the user to specify small
 TOP and LEFT adjustments for changing the default starting print position.&nbsp; These settings can be changed at any time for printing on different printers.&nbsp; If not present already, we hope Microsoft will consider such a feature for all OFFICE applications.</p>

            <p>Why not have the label producers such as Avery provide a backing paper for their products that is less prone to cause the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with many cheap inkjet printers is that the mis-alignment gets progressively worse from the top to the bottom of the sheet and no print-position "Band-Aid" is going to be able to fix that.</p>

<h2>            Odd spacing in my email &#40;to some recipients only&#41;</h2>
                    Some recipients of my emails (eg those using SBCglobal, yahoo) see unintended spaces between characters (particularly before and after the letter "a"); others (the majority of recipients) do not see this. I cannot find the source of the problem. It could
 be related to my signature and use of logo in my signature. Please advise. It is driving me&nbsp; crazy! (Note: the spacing problem doesn't occur if I format the email using&nbsp; Plain Text;&nbsp; only when formatted in HTML .&nbsp;

            I seem to have fixed the problem by changing the settings so that my Mail Format (Tools, Options) is set to NOT use Microsoft Office Outlook as the email editor. This sacrifices some degree of user-friendliness in the command menu and editing features
 (no auto-correct tho it is marked on, doesn't seem to like using colored fonts - grr) but until I find another solution, I guess this is as good as it gets.

<h2>            Connected accounts in Outlook 2013 desktop are not available when creating New Mail.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have already discussed this over at Office365, but they think the problem is related to the desktop client and they directed me over here.</p>
<p>I'm using office 365 with Outlook 2013 desktop app. In addition to the basic account I have set up two connected accounts. On, receive everything works alright and mail from each accounts is downloaded properly to Outlook 2013 desktop app. However, on send,
 I have only the basic account available. There should be a "from"- drop down where to chose sending account. But this button is not available in my Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d70f222-c609-401b-bd6e-b77f1a3c1861" />In this example the button is available. But it is missing in my installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In OWA everything is alright:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fe60d6a-6323-453a-b456-ac91379b3938" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it should look in Outlook desktop app too. How do I activate it?</p>
<p>

            Hello Ulf, <br />
<br />
As per the following article, Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 supports multiple Exchange Server accounts (two exchange accounts to the same profile).
<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff522797%28v=office.15%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff522797%28v=office.15%29.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Hence, you may either configure your email accounts as Exchange server account or other type as you prefer.
<br />
<br />
You may refer to the following article to get more information about POP and IMAP access for Office 365 for business or Microsoft Exchange accounts.<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/outlook-help/settings-for-pop-and-imap-access-for-office-365-for-business-or-microsoft-exchange-accounts-HA102908389.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-ca/outlook-help/settings-for-pop-and-imap-access-for-office-365-for-business-or-microsoft-exchange-accounts-HA102908389.aspx

<br />
Hope it helps. I look forward to your reply to assist you further.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<p>Supposedly the 950 and 950XL have a Natural Flash, which Microsoft claims will stop red eye from occurring. It is like two flashed one after another which often helps because the eye constricts and does not have time to re-dilate, thereby reducing the red-eye
 effect in photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I notice it happening I generally ask people not to look at the camera but look to the side. In many cases lighting is sufficient to snap a pic without the flash on.</p>

<h3> vittles123  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA Create Bullet Style for Find&#47;Replace Command</h2>
                    <p>We have documents that are downloaded with concatenated sentences using * to separate different commentators.&nbsp; I need to find a way to have a macro that can be stored as part of the normal.dot and converts&nbsp;these * sentences to bullet points among other page/formatting
 changes.&nbsp; I have found the find and replace function can do this if the bullet format is set as a style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to be able to create the 'Bullet' style via vba through the macro record function, but the style doesn't keep the bullets or 'list' formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to keep the list formatting when creating a style using vba?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, have other ideas for how to make this same function happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to use it on existing documents on a regular basis, so having it part of the normal.dot as a macro seemed like the way to go...</p>

            <p>Thanks Jay!!&nbsp; That put me on the right path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to change the optional execute find/replace lines to a&nbsp;single one&nbsp;and then I added coding that changes the list paragraph style to actual bullets with a .5 indent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other modifications&nbsp;include removing the *s and&nbsp;changing the document font to&nbsp;our standard&nbsp;and paragraph spacing to single.&nbsp; Not sure why Word defaults to the 1.08 spacing...but that is a wish list item for a future build.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>See below for the revised coding - may be helpful for someone else too.&nbsp; :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for the delay response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have motioned that when you tried to access your private NAS shares, you have ticked the option which says remember the user name and password. That's why it's not&nbsp;prompting for user name and password again. You also want to share the folders, you
 can provide the access to the shared folders by selecting the user account. You can also check this link below which will give you more information:</p>

<p>we are trying to setup a way to email selected contacts in the contact list on sharepoint online.

 which seems to be relevant to sharepoint 2013 on-premise but i need a solution on sharepoint online. we were able to setup the custom Ribbon button but the action to send email were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Any help from this group is much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Making and Recieving skype calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello new user here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a monthly subscription package. I bought it because I have an incredible important skype interview coming on Tuesday and I'd like to make sure that I don't have any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My subscription was the $13.99 monthly worldwide package. Will I be able to make and/or receive a call? I have my skype phone number I think and I was going to send it to the interviewer. But I want to make sure that there won't be any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            Wirless connection to Nokia 9500</h2>
                    Wireless is connected and the phone can connect but as soon as it starts to download it says cannot find server. Any clues?<br />
<br />
Also the Wifi light keeps flashing on and off on the unit is that correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            That's ok, blinking lights on your WIFi access points. Did you configure your router/modem to limit the IP address? Can't find server means the DNS is not accessible! Check default access points settings.<br />
<br />
Microwave oven &amp; remote tel handsets interfer with WIFI signal be sure its out of the way.<br />

<h2>            Joining a Group Chat - Issue with a Call Starting at the Same Time</h2>
                    My team at work starts a group chat every morning so we can ask questions, make announcements, etc.&nbsp; My issue is when I join, it automatically starts a conference call at the same time.&nbsp; I then have to hit the red phone icon to hang up because we aren't
 using it for a call, we only use it for a chat function.&nbsp; How can I change the settings in Skype so that it only starts as a chat and not both a chat and a call?&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Problem reference atpvbaen in Add-In - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem reference atpvbaen in Add-In</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I am developing an Add-in in which I use the yearfrac function.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;This add-in will be automatically loaded when Excel is launched. My problem is that I need to reference this add-in to atpvbaen.xla in order to make it work, but each time I open a new workbook I have the following error message: "This workbook is currently
 referenced by another workbook and cannot be closed".<br />
<br />
Do you know how could I avoid this error message? Knowing that afterward the add-in works properly but this is quite annoying..<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />
<br />
Michel <br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I found the solution. I need to refer to the yearfrac function directly in the atpvbaen add-in. So I used in my code the following sentence: Application.Run("ATPVBAEN.XLA!Yearfrac", Start_Date, End_Date, Basis)<br />
<br />
And now it works!<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help<br />

<h2>            My Outlook account got hacked. E-mails leaked by IMAP automatic sync. How this happened&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook account got hacked. Have been using this e-mail&nbsp; account from the early days of Hotmail. E-mails leaked by IMAP automatic sync despite using different password than on other sites and having two factor authentication activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got warning SMS from Microsoft and when checking recent activity, i saw multiple "Successful Syncs" listed from countries like China, Thailand, Russia, Poland, Brazil, Ukraine, Philippines, Kazakhstan and Iran. These syncs took place in two different times
 in four hour intervals. How could this be possible? Why Microsoft detected that something fishy is going on but allowed sync to be completed anyway? Doesn't IMAP sync have some kind of location based checks in place like when logging in into other MS sites
 and services?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have changed the password of my account, unlinked Skype from my Microsoft account, deleted any active app passwords.</p>
<p>I see again some IMAP syncs in my activity tab and they are now marked as "Unsuccessful". Small consolation knowing that your whole e-mail history is already leaked into some Chinese servers :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>How this all could have happened? Is there a security hole in Microsoft's IMAP sync implementation?</p>
<p />

<p>Dear Tech community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far as we know now, there was an UX issue on the MSA recent activity page, where a subset of unsuccessful IMAP syncs are erroneously shown as successful. This bug should be fixed in a couple of days and we hope that no one was ever compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Volker<br />
</p>
<p>P.S.: IP addresses are translating to countries like Bangladesh, Brasil, China etc. A hacker can&nbsp; simply fake their source IP, therefore it is difficult to say, where the hack attacks are coming from. Please just keep using security best practices for your
 hotmail/outlook accounts with difficult passwords to be changed as often as possible and leverage multi factor authentication.</p>

</p><p>After clicking the link of the document in the mail, I'm not getting Open this task... button in the document to sign the document like you are getting in the above image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead I'm getting View Signatures button like below</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31b9d789-b6a7-4acf-87c1-955171108d14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31b9d789-b6a7-4acf-87c1-955171108d14" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the Open this Task button from outlook the below window is coming</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After clicking Sign button, I'm not getting any option to sign the document instead the task gets completed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as per the working of this workflow after clicking the sign button I should get a window to sign the document like below</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f20f199a-4911-4a42-8387-46912de40830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f20f199a-4911-4a42-8387-46912de40830" /></a></p>

Hi Anand,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your update.<br />
<br />
Since I can't reproduce this on my side currently, I need to confirm the following information, so we can be on the same page.<br />
<br />
1.Your Office version. Please open Word -&gt; File -&gt; Account -&gt; capture a screenshot of this page including Product information and Office version.<br />
2.Do your colleagues have the same issue? Do you have the same environment (Office Standard+ SharePoint Online)?<br />
3.Do you use the built-in "collect signatures - SharePoint 2010" workflow or customize the workflow in SharePoint designer? If you use the built-in workflow, please capture screenshots of how you create the workflow. If you have done some customizations in
 SharePoint designer, please share a screenshot of the steps how you did in SharePoint designer too.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sky

            <p>Hi Anand,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using the same built-in signature workflow as yours and I can confirm the following window is not related to SharePoint Online settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4857b18-8fa5-4b05-a8c5-c425c8ce75dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4857b18-8fa5-4b05-a8c5-c425c8ce75dc" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>So, could you let us know if you or your IT department have done some settings in the Office client? For example, open Word -&gt; File -&gt; info -&gt; Protect Document -&gt; add a digital signature. If so, please
 share the detailed reproduce steps with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the message "This document needs to be signed. View Signatures" on your screenshot and your Office Product information indicate there is something wrong with your Office client. Please
 make sure you have activated your Office first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sky </p>

            <p>Hi Anand,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The signature window you needed is actually produced by the setting (open a Word document-&gt; Insert -&gt; Microsoft Office signature line) in Word. So the issue you experienced should be related to the Office client other than SharePoint Workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you can get the View Signature Option in the Word document. Please click View signatures<span>&nbsp;
</span>-&gt; right click the Signature control as below -&gt; on the pop-up window -&gt; click sign to see if you can get the signature window you required. If it is not the case, let us know what you will get after clicking view Signatures. (Remember to try it in Office
 which is activated). </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/080b09bc-8083-4738-b581-67fbecce55af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/080b09bc-8083-4738-b581-67fbecce55af" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.The detailed repro steps of how you set signature in Word.</p>
<p><span>2.Share with us an reproduce file. To protect the privacy, I will move this conversation to Private message to obtain such details. You can access it via this link:

            <p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I followed so far are as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Created a new document Library in sharepoint site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Created a test word document(using deactivated office version Office 2016 std) and inserted a "Signature Line"&nbsp;in &nbsp;this&nbsp;document.</p>
<p>a. Inserted Sign Line using the Insert option on the ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Configured Collect Signature Workflow on this library. Screen shots of which shared earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Uploaded this word doc in the lib and started workflow manually. After, clicking on Advanced --&gt; Workflow, it leads me to task assigning window. I'm assigning this task to myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. As soon as I'm starting&nbsp;the workflow I'm getting an e-mail to complete the task, containing&nbsp;a link to review the doc.</p>
<p>When I click on the document link, it&nbsp;opens document in the desktop application of Word and in Read-Only mode having options like "Edit the Dcoument" and "View Signatures" but I should get "Open this task..." option to complete my task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. When I'm clicking on "View Signatures" what happening is I'm able to sign as you mentioned above and the signature is saved automatically in the document with an error that "This certificate could not be verified" but, the problem is that the workflow
 task is not getting completed automatically.&nbsp;I have to complete it manually&nbsp;from "Task List" or "Workflow status page" which I do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, today I will repeat complete process again but with activated Office and will share results&nbsp;with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou so much for your efforts!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Anand&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to configured same workflow over a new library and used active Office 2016 standard but, the issue still exist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could not find the "Open this task" button in the document when clicked on the document link in the mail triggered from workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please tell me how this "Collect Signature 2010"&nbsp;workflow works. Mainly, how to complete a task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May be I'm expecting in the wrong way.</p>

<h2>            OneNote App</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An email has been send to me with an OneNote attachment which has a .onepkg extension file at 7mb.</p>
<p>i trying to open this onenote file using my ipad&nbsp;- i have an onenote app installed and have signed in using my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>it does not open, it adds the file to the section and when i click on it it gives me the option to open then i get the "preview not available"</p>
<p>"try open the file in another app".</p>
<p>
</p><p>initially i thought may be it does not support .onepkg files then for testing purposes before i give up. i open this files in my computer which gives me the sections
</p>
<p>with in the package the i sent one of them to myself by email as .one extension file. it does not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i am doing wrong?</p>

</p><p>doing this way has work but the idea is that having the app on my ipad is to quick view the&nbsp;onenote file without having to login to my desktop, unzip the package and share it on onedrive.
