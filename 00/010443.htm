<h2>            Can&#39;t delete corrupted site in SharePoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Although I've looked up all over the Internet, and called Microsoft Support I still haven't managed to find a solution for this problem.</p>
<p>Let me list the events:</p>
<p>1) from inside Project 2013 I created a new project site which I stored in my account under
<a href="https://apolonia-my.sharepoint.com/projeto_novo_erp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a*****ia-my.sharepoint.com/projeto_novo_erp/</a></p>
<p>2) I'm new to SharePoint Online, so I then found out that I could create the project site inside a simpler path, so I did it in
<a href="https://apolonia.sharepoint.com/projeto_novo_erp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a*****ia.sharepoint.com/projeto_novo_erp/</a></p>
<p>3) then I tried to delete the side in point 1 above. However despite the fact that I'm an administrador in the SharePoint account, I had no link to "delete site" for that site.</p>
<p>4) I changed permissions and tried many ways to delete that site to no avail. The only way I found to "delete" it was inside Project 2013, in the "Open" dialog box it shows an explorer window with the site contents so I tried to just delete the folder "projeto_novo_erp".
 Problem is it only did a partial deletion so I ended up with a corrupted site (doesn't work properly, and still can't be deleted completely).</p>
<p>5) I tried copying over it with files from a site that was working correctly but it doesn't seem to fix the problem.</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;I even pulled out the SharePoint Powershell but when I try to do a Get-SPOSite or Remove-SPOSite is just returns an error "&lt;the site&gt; is not well formed".</p>
<p>7) I noticed that inside the site there is a recycle bin with a lot of stuff, but if I try to restore those files, the page returns the following error:</p>
<p>Cannot restore item "".</p>
<div>
<div>ID : 22584a9d-00ab-2000-4650-5222d54711c0</div>

</div>
<p>So basically I'm stuck with this and have two questions:</p>
<p>A) how do I force delete a corrupted SharePoint Online site, i.e. <a href="https://apolonia-my.sharepoint.com/projeto_novo_erp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://******nia-my.sharepoint.com/projeto_novo_erp/</a></p>
<p>B) wasn't SharePoint online supposed to only allow one place for storing sites? I didn't completely understand the difference between the "****nia-my" context and the "*****nia". Theoretically the "*****nia-my" should be a place where I place personal sites
 and I should have all the permissions, however as proved with my problem above I can't even delete a site in there.</p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Ruben Gomes</p>

<p>hi, i've answered to your questions directly in the pm.</p>
<p>below is the error i'm getting when i try to remove the site. (&lt;the site&gt; is not properly formed).</p>
<p>i assume it's because its corrupted so the commands won't work.</p>

<p>Hi Ruben,</p>
<p>I have received your information in private message and notice that the Microsoft Support you called is waiting for your feedback, you can follow their suggestions first.
<br />
And if you need additional assistance from us after that, given the situation, could you try the following methods to see if there are any improvements?<br />
Can you access the corrupted site page now?<br />
If so, click the gear icon on the upper right corner of the page&gt;click <strong>Site settings</strong> in the drop-down options&gt;click the option
<strong>Delete this site</strong> under <strong>Site Actions</strong> part. <br />
If there is no option like that or it does not work, click <strong>Content and Structures</strong> under
<strong>Site Administration</strong>. On the open page you‚Äôll find the whole structure of the site collection. You can find the site you want to delete&gt;hover over the option&gt;click
<strong>Delete</strong> in the drop-down option to delete the chosen site.</p>
<p>And since it seems that the site is corrupted, could you try to repair it then run
<strong>Remove-SPOSite</strong> to see the outcome? You can use Repair-SPOSite as in

<p>hi,</p>
<p>microsoft us support didn't ask me for feedback. the closest i got to getting an answer from them was that i had to get in contact with the european microsoft support since they didn't have the tools/permissions to change european accounts. i asked for a
 phone number but they didn't seem to know. they passed me through to the european support but no one answered the phone&nbsp;so i decided to try the microsoft community instead.</p>
<p>as for the "delete this site", unfortunately i don't have that option.</p>
<p>also i don't have a "content and structures" option under site administration in sharepoint online. i have a "sites and workspaces" but it's empty.</p>
<p>as for the repair-sposite command i had tried it but i get the "not properly formed" error (please see imagem below).</p>

    <title>Windows Mobile closes calendar when deleting an appointment - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mobile closes calendar when deleting an appointment</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes on&nbsp;my Windows phone Lumia 640, when I delete an appointment, the calendar app just closes down. When I open it back up, there has been no change to the appointment, and this process repeats every time I try to delete that appointment. I can delete
 the appointment from my desktop however. Other appointments work just fine. Anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify if the issue is software related, we suggest that you perform a <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove anything
 at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We're just here if you have further questions.</p>
<p>

            Thanks for the input, but I have tried that and a hard reset also. Several times. I also am a member of the "Insider" program, so I get OS updates before just before they are made public. None of this has helped. Any other thoughts? I guess no one else
 has this problem.

To check it, go to <strong>Settings&gt; About&gt; More information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's an update available, we suggest to please update the phone software to the latest released. Then, try to update apps on the Store again.

<p>Update: I found a work around solution. The calendar will accept changes to the repeating appointment, so I make the end date only the next day. After closing the appointment and reopening it, I delete each day's appointment individually. The calendar does
 not shut down, and the appointment disappears.</p>

<h2>            GMail to O365 migration</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read:</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IMAP-migration-in-the-Office-365-admin-center-4682f2e4-f720-4868-91ab-207f5b0c325d</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a migration where the users were using Gsync with Outlook. The Mail was exported to PST, DNS was changed to O365 and Outlook profiles were setup for O365. New mail okay and import of the PST files from Gsync done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that it is only a subset of the mail, for example 2GB PST but looking closer at GMail for that user (using the GSuite login and web browser) you can see 23GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: If I use the above method in O365 Admin will the mail be duplicated in the users O365 mailbox as it comes across?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>Actually, there a specific method to migrate G Suite mailboxes to Office 365.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Migrate-your-IMAP-mailboxes-to-Office-365-3fe19996-29bc-4879-aab9-5a622b2f1481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Migrate your
 IMAP mailboxes to Office 365</a><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">&nbsp;gives you an overview of the migration process. Read it first and when you're familiar with the contents of that article, return to this topic to learn how to migrate mailboxes
 from G Suite (formerly known as Google Apps) Gmail to Office 365.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please pay attention to the size of the PST file you exported from Gmail. Does it also show as 23GB?</p>

<h2>            Importing Main Identity from Office 2011 for Mac to Office 365 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>After losing my MacBook Air&nbsp;to water damage, I bought a new replacement MB Air today. I transferred all my data from a Time Machine based backup disc. I have MS Office 2011 on the new computer and it's working fine. I also have a subscription to Office 365
 ‚Äì 2016 on my desktop iMac and wanted to add a license on this new MB Air computer. After installing the desktop version of 365 on the MB Air an alert appeared saying that my database was damaged and needed rebuilding. I did that, opened the 365 Outlook program
 to discover that none my contacts or preferences, and only a very few archived emails were imported. From Outlook 365, I've tried importing the 2011&nbsp;Identity a half-dozen times. Now I'm in an unending loop that asks me to quit sync services (I did), then it
 says one or&nbsp;more applications are open and to quit them before importing. I've quit every program I know is open and when I go back to the alert window and click ok, I'm taken back to the first import window.</p>
<p>Frustrating. If I try exporting from Outlook 2011, the program crashes.</p>
<p>Help??</p>

<p>Hi Carlos,</p>
<p>I have not resolved it. On Friday, I uninstalled (as per MS detailed instructions) Office 2016. Then installed it again, opened Outlook making sure not to add an email address. I'm hoping that means I have a virgin program with no identity or profile yet.
 Then I opened Outlook 2011 and cleaned out my stored email messages and permanently deleted as much as I could. Went back through the steps to import the database. I've attached the succession of windows that have me in the loop and unable to import. No success.
 Then I exported contacts and my email from Outlook 2011 ‚Äì in separate exports. When I imported the contacts into Outlook 2016, I got just a fraction of the contacts, but it did import all of my custom categories. Every time I tried importing my email, the
 program crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing. I successfully installed Office 365 on my new 2017 iMac a couple of weeks ago. All of my identity from Outlook 2011 showed up seamlessly ‚Äì no need to import anything. Could that have something to do with my repeated failures on my MacBook
 Air? Is there a way to "share" the database between computers? I care a lot more about my contacts than my emails.</p>
<p>

<p>That worked perfectly! Thank you.</p>
<p>BTW, I thought Microsoft solved the problem with updates and sync services. This is the first issue I've had with it in a long time.</p>

<h2>            Error Syncing with IPAQ PDA</h2>
                    A couple of weeks ago I was able to sync the Calendar, tasks, and files on my IPAQ 2215 to Outlook 2003 and my PC running Windows 7.&nbsp; Today I just get an error when trying to sync that just says "Calendar, Tasks: attention required", but doesn't give me
 any clue what the problem is or how to fix it.&nbsp; I don't understand what has changed in the past couple of weeks.&nbsp; How do I find out what this issue is so I can do something to correct the problem?

<br />
Also, the other solutions assume I'm running Active Sync.&nbsp; I can't run Active sync running Windows 7 so these don't apply<br />

<p>Doug and Charles have both given you good advice, but the reason you're experiencing the problem is that you are inserting Header and Page Number building blocks, and either will replace the other. There are Header building blocks that include page numbers
 or positions for page numbers or other text, but you don't need to use a building block at all; you can type directly in the header after accessing the header pane by double-clicking in the header area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you access the header area directly, the style applied is the Header style, which by default includes a center-aligned tab stop centered between the margins and a right-aligned tab stop at the right margin. These are
<strong><a href="https://davescomputertips.com/word-2010s-alignment-tabs-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">alignment tabs</a></strong>, so they will adjust automatically&nbsp;if you change the margins.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem - see post a few back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was bored so followed the instructions I found for creating an iso from the ESD file in the recovery folder on my c drive.&nbsp; (there is a post/topic about converting ESD to ISO but I cant seem to search for anything on this forum at the moment to point anyone
 to it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did a full/clean install from that iso (which I had put onto a usb stick)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I installed via the update process the install took around 5 or 6 hours to complete (not counting download time), but from the iso it took around 15 minutes to get into windows.&nbsp; I then installed minesweeper - which uses the xbox sign in and it worked
 - so I reinstalled AOE:Castle siege and it now works with out any sign in problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't changed any hardware since the previous release of Win 10, but the apparent bug with the install process seems to be causing other problems (such as this xbox sign in issue)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the next release will not have a similar install 'hiccup'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from that, I am enjoying Win 10 and am looking forward to its final release.</p>

<p>Then they said coverage expires two days before the 27.08.2015. </p>
<p>Then they said 24 hours before expiry date.</p>

    <title>Side-by-side columns in pivot table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Side-by-side columns in pivot table</h2>
                    <p>I want to show pivot table columns in tabular form. I've found several postings which offer instructions roughly like this: &nbsp;</p>
<div>right click each Field in the pivot table and choose Field Settings, go to Layout &amp; Print and select Show item labels in tabular form</div>

<p>
</p><p>But I don't have that option. I click Field Settings, but the the pane that pops up does not have a Layout &amp; Print option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, once I figure out the side-by-side columns, one thing that I'd sometimes like to do is to have have some columns side-by-side and others hierarchical. For example, if I have three fields, I'd like to have Field1 and Field 2 side-by-side, and Field3
 indented underneath them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Unfortunately, there is no documentation that describes the differences between Office for mac and Windows versions. Upgrading to Office for Mac 2016 is still Mac, and I believe you will find the same shortcomings. Most people here (on this forum) think
 that Office for Mac 2011 is MUCH better than Office for Mac 2016.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Internet Explorer 11 crashes when trying to to use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timjulian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Internet Explorer 11 crashes when trying to to use SharePoints &#34;Open with Explorer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone can give me a suggestion here. Recently, as off this week actually, our SharePoint 2013 environment is crashing Internet Explorer 11 on windows 10 when we use the "Open with Explorer" option. I've tested it on 3 machines with the latest
 version of IE and they all crash, but one server with an older version and one laptop with an older version both work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already reset IE, removed it and re-installed it through the "Turn windows features on or off", and it is not possible for me to remove the latest updates(As far as I can find anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I found that if I have the URL in the trusted sites with "automatic logon with current username and password" it will crash when trying to open in explorer view, but if it's not in "trusted sites", or if it has any other logon type, it'll crash
 immediately when accessing any part of the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SharePoint environment is locally hosted, and we've already reset IIS and rebooted the server to no affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be lovely.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We want to learn more about your concern. Help us verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does it happen using a different browser?</li><li>Is it only limited to Sharepoint site? Can you open different websites?</li></ul>

            The crashing only happens in IE as that's the only browser that can take advantage of the "Open with Explorer" option, and every other website works perfectly fine. It's literally just SharePoint that does this.

            I can't move it! It started in the IE section, which is the software I needed help with! I'm not that dumb. If you'd read what I posted, I started with opening a ticket with Microsoft, as we pay them for support. Then they told me the issue wasn't on SharePoint,
 but an issue with IE. And since I can't open a ticket for IE in my enterprise account, I went to the IE forums, and the first thing that ever happened was some mod seeing the work "SharePoint" in my post and moving it without actually reading what the issue
 was. If someone wants to move it *back* to IE, I would prefer to keep the conversation going there, as that's the product with the issue. Don't sass me for it being in the wrong section, when I didn't put it here!

    <title>My Excel 2004 spreadsheets don&#39;t have the default thin black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane young  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Excel 2004 spreadsheets don&#39;t have the default thin black border surrounding the all the cells when printed in Excel 2011 for the Mac.</h2>
                    I discovered my Excel 2004 spreadsheets are not quite the same when printed out with my new Excel 2011 for Mac.&nbsp; I lost the nice thin black border that normally surrounds the outermost edges of all the cells on each printed page, even though the outside
 border was never set in Excel 2004 as a preference or setting of any kind.&nbsp; It's just the way Excel 2004 used to print out all the spreadsheets.&nbsp; Now I have a faint gray line at the edges of my outermost cells on every printed page.&nbsp; It is more faint than
 the gridlines, which makes it look like cells may be cut off or missing.&nbsp; I tried 2 different things:<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; I&nbsp; did a Copy/Paste of all the data from my Excel 2004 spreadsheet into a new Excel 2011 spreadsheet, and was able to obtain the nice black border around the outer edges by manually selecting the Outside Borders option.&nbsp; However the column widths did not
 transfer over exactly the same, in spite of doing a Paste Special for column widths.&nbsp; To clarify, the column widths imported as the same 10.00 width, but the actual measurement of the column width was narrower in Excel 2011 than the .94 inches the 10.00 width
 was in Excel 2004.&nbsp; As a result, I had to enlarge the Excel 2011 column widths to 11.67 to arrive at the same column width of .94 inches so the text in my headings would be completely visible.&nbsp; I then had to adjust all the remaining columns, which is just
 too much work to do when you have a ton of spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; So I tried resaving my original Excel 2004 spreadsheet in Excel 2011.xlsx format, but that did not help with the border.&nbsp; No border appears around the outside edges of the cells; I have the same faint gray line.&nbsp; I tried selecting all the cells and using
 the Border Button to manually place a border around the outside edges, but in spite of selecting that option no border appears.<br />
<br />
<u>Note</u>:&nbsp; I am able to get a border around the cells if I select all the cells that are
<u>one cell down from the top</u> of the alphabetized column headings, and <u>one cell in from the left</u> of the numbered column rows, but that does not give me a border where I want it:&nbsp; Around the outside edges of all the cells that butt up against the
 column headings and column rows.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to get a nice black border to print by default around all my cells when using my spreadsheets created in Excel 2004.&nbsp; Is that impossible now since installing Office 2011 or is there an easy way to do this?&nbsp; The outside border was there
 by default in Excel 2004.&nbsp; It can be done manually when creating a new spreadsheet in Excel 2011.&nbsp; It just does not work when printing a 2004 spreadsheet, or when trying to resave a 2004 spreadsheet in the 2011.xlsx format.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

</p><p>Hello RexEast,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that your Mac OneNote is continuously crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied your crash logs down and am investigating them. When you do crash, make sure that you always report them, either to Apple or Microsoft, as we do investigate the crash logs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few suggestions to try:</p>
<p>1. Make sure that all the cache files have been deleted. Here is a summary to get rid of all files related to Mac OneNote.</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete this folder: ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.onenote.mac</li><li>Delete this folder: ~/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office&nbsp;</li><li>Open up ‚ÄúKeychain Access‚Äù app on your Mac, and search for ‚ÄúMicrosoftOffice‚Äù. If OneNote recognized that you signed in, you will have an entry with a long name. Delete it.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Try launching OneNote and signing in again.</li></ul>
<p>2. Create a new user account, like has already been suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add to this thread after I investigate the crash logs.</p>

            I had the same problem on both my Macbook Pro and iPad. &nbsp;I tried all the solutions I had found on the internet to no avail. I had been loading documents that were created in OneNote for PC 2010, sharing them as per the Microsoft Instructions then trying
 to view them in MBP or iPad. &nbsp;My Solution was to create a new notebook on the MBP and copy and paste my notes manually from Outline+. &nbsp;It now works fine but what a pain to do this with a lot of notes.

<p>Hi I am having the same issue. &nbsp;You note to delete the folder&nbsp;<span>UBF8T346G9.Office &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can you be more specific as I am using Outlook 15 and it is storing all the data in the folder as well. &nbsp;And obviously I do not
 want to delete all my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can you tell me what exactly to delete.</p>

            <p>I work paperless and use Onenote at work (Windows + iPhone5s) and private (MacBook +iPad) - they all work beautifully together until my MacBook Onenote crashed and gave a continuos black screen on my Onenote for MAC. Tried to go back with Time Machine, safe
 mode, tried to delete Onenote and reinstall - all in vain. Was desparate. Found this. It didn't match my reality completely; but with a bit of creativity - and following thes steps - I finally made it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Guilherme Pinto Lima de Almeida,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just read all your conversations with Iry&nbsp; in your last post and consulted her about your issue, now I understand your email domain is blocked by Outlook.com and MSN.com. As Iry said, the delist
 address you said before ( sender.office.com) is to delist addresses blocked by Office 365, which is not applicable to your scenario.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, I'd like to suggest you submitting your delist request to following website of Outlook.com:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=edfsmsbl3&amp;locale=en-us&amp;ccsid=635714983457075069&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;forceorigin=esmc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=capsub&amp;productkey=edfsmsbl3&amp;locale=en-us&amp;ccsid=635714983457075069&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;forceorigin=esmc</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And since we have different support teams to handle different kind of issues and our team is dedicated for Office 365 issues, I will help move your thread to Outlook.com category and you can get targeted
 help from our Outlook.com experts there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully above information helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<h3> muhammedshafeeq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Integrate Lync with PBX &#40;Zycoo&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everybody,&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are using office365 for our office email accounts, and &nbsp;using Lync 2013 (Skype for Business ) for IM. Also we are using ZYCOO IP PBX system for our call centre. Now we are planning to integrate our IPPBX system with LYNC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the document from ZYCOO, we have to prepare Lync server and AD server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is it possible to integrate PBX with Lync on our current office365 subscription? or do we have to configure a separate Lync Sever on our premises?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Shafeeq</p>

<p>Hi Shafeeq,</p>
<p>Yes, if your Office 365 subscription is Enterprise plan, this feature is available. You don‚Äôt need to set up a separate On-premises Lync server. However, this integration is still in preview and not fully supported by Microsoft. At present, it is available
 for customers in US. It will be fully available for other regions in the end of the year.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran<br />

<h2>            I Lost All My Conversation History</h2>
                    I have lost all my old conversation history in Skype,which is quite strange to me. I have checked my "C://Users/User/AppData/Roaming/Skype/user" folder and it looks like it's created on 27 September 2015 although I have been using Skype since 2011. Looks
 like Skype might have re-created the folder when it got upgraded to a newer version??? Anyone else facing this problem? Is it still possible to retrieve my old chat history? Can I view it online? I suspect they must be still stored online in their database.
 Or can I request Skype send them to me by e-mail? I currently only have conversation history from 27/9/2015 onward but I barely chat with anyone in Skype since February 2012,all of my daily/active chatting was in 2011 &amp; 2012,that's why I need them. Can someone
 help me???

            Yes,I used Skype on the same computer in the past. By the way,never mind,I solved my problem,I found out that my old main.db file was in "Administrator" user folder,instead of my current user folder. I just had to do is copy that file and replace it with
 my current user's "main.db" file. This is a little strange though.

<p>I'm sort of having a similar problem in reverse. There are some conversation histories that I would like to remove, and if you right-click on a post, you have the option to remove it. However, as I'm going along removing some posts, it all of a sudden doesn't
 allow me to remove anymore. Any ideas why I can start out removing posts and then not have the option anymore? Thanks in advance, Bill</p>

<h2>            build 14915 update problems</h2>
                    <p>Just thought to share a particular problem. When trying to update to build 14915, the install failed 3 times right at 41% getting ready stage. Only Defender, no other antivirus installed. Should have noted the error message, but thought I would remember,
 which I haven't. Nevertheless, it said about something on the LAN being duplicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from my LAN, also have a second LAN cable, connecting this, plus another PC on a private address. After disabling this network, the installation went without any more problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On checking this LAN on completion, noticed that Windows had already enabled it again</p>

<h2>            Start Menu or Start Screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using the Windows 10 preview with a Samsung Slate tablet computer. When I use this computer as a tablet, I like to use the start screen as it's easy to use with the touch screen. When I use it as a desktop with keyboard and mouse, I would
 like to use the start menu. Currently the windows 10 preview only allows the use of one or the other which I believe is the wrong approach. For me the solution is simple, the windows icon from the desktop should launch the start menu and the windows icon from
 the charms bar should launch the start screen. </p>

            Windows key sends the same signal regardless of where it's located. Does continuum as MSFT calls it (hybrid Start screen) work for you when you connect keyboard &amp; mouse?

            'Continuum' which is the automatic detection of what type of &nbsp;device you are using and adjusting the 'Start" to the device, has not been released yet, it is due to be released later during the preview cycle.

            <p>I like the idea of a start menu instead of a start button or start screen. I would create a menu bar either on the left, right, bottom or top of the screen. The menu bar should contain different categories like apps/programs, files, folder, tools etc. The
 menu bar should be the base of how to navigate. I kind of like the reinvention of the start button in that sense but I would not put it in the left lower corner. Having a menu bar that lets you control and navigate through everything could avoid having a two
 personality OS. The categories in the menu bar could have the tiles in order to touch or click by mouse. Touching an 'apps tile' would open another sub-menu containing all apps that the user determines. Both menu bar, tiles and sub-menus should be easily customizable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is too conservative. Most users chose a computer based on how they can interact with it. Just going back to an old system with some modifications will not be very successful. Users want to have a new way of interacting with a computer. Windows
 8/8.1 with the start screen was a good move towards that direction but the switch between start screen and desktop is annoying and confusing at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The charms are not necessary if the menu bar becomes created in a way that merges start screen with desktop and start button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Windows 10&nbsp; will still become drastically modified until its release. At the moment I also think it is not making the big leap.</p>

Instead of linking the textbox to multiple cells, have the single cell contain the value of the multiple cells...&nbsp;

Every month, I update the YTD numbers in the text box &amp; would like to eliminate some of the manual work there.&nbsp;&nbsp; How would I create that?

            Re:&nbsp; YTD numbers in textbox<br />
<br />
Same method would apply; just add a line feed (alt + enter) after each space.<br />
Or you might consider adding the actuals to the chart legend.<br />

<h2>            Download Failed, Failed to aquire license for download</h2>
                    <p>Xbox video app on windows phone 8 . </p>
<p>Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Movies can be streamed no problem, and downloaded once...</p>
<p>However once the temp files of the phone are cleared, or the video collection updates</p>
<p>downloaded movie show as Streaming again.. And when I </p>
<p>try to redownload it gives the above error..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>uninstalling &amp; reinstalling the app does not fix the problem</p>
<p>reseting the phone to factory settings does not fix the problem</p>
<p>clearing the cache CAUSES the problem....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it affects all movies in my collection bought on PC, Windows phone,</p>
<p>and Xbox one.... I can download the movies to my PC without issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so the problem seems app specific having to do with how</p>
<p>the downloaded movies are stored on the windows8 phone</p>
<p>or how the license is attached to the download?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>help please how can I download and KEEP the movies on my phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also posted this question under the windowsphone8 area and consistantly get</p>
<p>refered to this section of the database .... </p>

            <p>Hi Bill19711,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for your post to the Microsoft Answers forums!&nbsp; It is unusual to see that error only occur on your phone, when you can download the same titles using your account on other devices.&nbsp; It might sound oblique, but one thing I'd like to suggest is to
 sign in at account.live.com and review the security proofs on your account (e.g. secondary email/phone number).&nbsp; These details are available at account.live.com, please follow this link for detailed instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/security/security-proofs-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/security/security-proofs-overview</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Hopefully this gets things back on track, we look forward to hearing back with updates or further questions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi Greg, <br />
OK so I went into my Microsoft account.<br />
Verified my email, phone number and secondary email address, got the security code entered that marked my phone as a trusted device. Then installed the Microsoft authenticator app and used it.</p>
<p>So all my security information seems to be working and current .. I even added details like time zone.</p>
<p>Then I restarted my phone and attempted to re download one of the movies, and the same error is still occurring.</p>
<p>Download failed, failed to acquire license for download.</p>
<p>So any further ideas?</p>
<p>Oh and thank you for getting back to me so soon.</p>

            <p>&nbsp; It is unusual to see that clearing the phone's cache would effect a video license, can confirm this was through
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Applications </strong>&gt; <strong>Internet Explorer
</strong>&gt; <strong>Delete history</strong>?&nbsp; Also, please provide us with the full OS version on your device, listed under
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>More Info</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; In some situations, this error can identify a connectivity issue and is improved with better signal quality.&nbsp; When you have a chance, can you also attempt to download the movie with a different Wi-Fi connection?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Additionally, I'd also like to see if restoring the purchase history on your phone resolves the error should the signal not have an effect.&nbsp; With the movie removed from your phone's collection, open the app and tap
<strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Restore Purchase History</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

            <p>Hi Greg.</p>
<p>Yes I can confirm settings applications Internet Explorer delete history. Also I removed every movie from my</p>
<p>collection ---- I restarted the app , it updated my collection ... I attempted a download... And got the
</p>
<p>same error...</p>
<p>However you might be interested to know that I did purchase 2 new movies recently.<br />
One the legend of Hercules, I downloaded no problem to my phone. It showed it downloaded available offline. Then I went to bed took my phone to work the next day and during the course of the day attempted to watch the movie, when I open the Xbox video app...
 I received the message sign in, then the message updating collection... And the legend of Hercules showed&nbsp; the streaming option only. It no longer show just downloaded available offline even though I DID NOT delete the temporary Internet files.</p>
<p>And Unfortunately I cannot keep buying me things just to test theories lol.</p>
<p>As far as the connectivity issue goes I only have one WiFi at home so I can't really download it on a different wifi&nbsp; connection, however let me state again that I can download every movie in my collection ONE time. For whatever reason they then disappear..
 And go back to the streaming option. </p>
<p>And when I try to re download the same movies on the same WiFi connection.<br />
I get the air download failed. failed to acquire license for download.</p>
<p>So I really don't see how connectivity could be the problem.</p>
<p>And last but not least.<br />
Nokia Windows Phone 9:20.<br />
OS version 8.0.10517.150<br />
firmware revision 3051.40000.1347.1001</p>
<p>anyway I hope all this helps.<br />
I'm thinking its gotta have something to do with how the Windows Phone holds the license information. And if there is any limiting factor on the number of times a movie can be downloaded?</p>

            <p>&nbsp; Purchases can be deleted and downloaded once more from the marketplace using the available licenses on the content, the single download you are able to complete is not the expected behavior.&nbsp; We'd like to continue investigating this on our side, can you
 please also provide us with your Mobile Operator, Country/Region, and the language used on the device?&nbsp;

 it was intended for. I give up with you Microsoft!!!</p>
