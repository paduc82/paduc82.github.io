<h2>            How to transfer Office 2000 without a product key&#63; </h2>
                    I want to transfer Office 2000 but I no longer have the 25-digit product key of it. I found out that it is already obsolete. Can I still get a product key?

<p>To "get" a product key, you have to buy the product. No other way. They are not free.</p>
<p>Because Office 2000 is obsolete, you will have to "get" 2010.</p>

    <title>Downloading 10159, this is going to sound strange. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downloading 10159, this is going to sound strange.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have two desktop systems running Windows 10-10158.&nbsp; Both are ASUS motherboards with built-in Ethernet and Wi-Fi.&nbsp; The Ethernet was primary and the Wi-Fi was enabled but not connected.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The upgrades were done a day apart so the first system already had the fbl downloaded and installed, which would mean the second machine could use that system to acquire the fbl.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>This happened on both machines the same way.&nbsp; I waited different time intervals so you would not assume it was coincidence.</div>

<div>------------------------</div>

<div>
<p>Upon opening the Update dialog and checking for updates, a defender update and the fbl showed up.&nbsp; After a few seconds, the defender update was downloaded and installed, leaving only the fbl.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The second download started at 50 Mbps (my internet speed) and stayed there for several minutes.&nbsp; Probably long enough to download the entire file, but I did not time it. Then the download stopped.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I had Task Manager open so I could watch the download and other performance data.&nbsp; After the download stopped, there was no appreciable disk or CPU activity, so the install had not started.&nbsp; Also noteworthy is the fact the download progress for the fbl never
 moved off 0%.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I waited for a period of at least 10 minutes with no activity, so I had the idea to disable my Wireless adapter.&nbsp; After I disabled the wireless, the download started up again, the download progress indicator moved and the install finished normally.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>It is also noteworthy the first machine did all downloading at the 50 Mbps rate, but the second machine did the initial download at 270 Mbps but the second session at 50 Mbps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I know this sounds strange, but maybe someone at Microsoft will know what was happening and if there could be some sort of bug in the update system.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Thanks for reading...</div>

            <p>No, you must install a Windows Emulator, like bootcamp to be able to run a Windows Office license on Mac.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows and Mac Office licenses are totally separate products. MS does not allow you to switch between them using the same product key.

<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 on My Lenovo IdeaPad U410, that I believe was running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;After installation, it started up, never completed the full start up and showed the blues screen, telling me it was collecting information and would restart. &nbsp;It now
 does this every time it starts and the laptop is unusable. &nbsp;I'm am pretty much a newbie, and probably shouldn't have tried to install it, but I'm stuck now and need some assistance. &nbsp;</p>

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />

The issue could be due to some hardware or Software causing the issue. I would suggest you to press the
<strong>Shift key and hold the power button</strong> so that it will go to the <strong>
recovery options</strong>, Select safe mode and boot to the desktop. If you are able to boot to the desktop, If you are able to boot to the desktop in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 -- Add a person to a group</h2>
                    <p>In the older versions, by hitting "enter" after adding the name and email address, I got the next entry screen. There also was a keyboard command, I believe Alt+D that pulled it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I type mostly off an attendance list, so the new people are about 99% new entries. This requires me&nbsp;to click and answer&nbsp;the same&nbsp;question&nbsp;for every person and it really slows me down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know a quick way to keep typing, instead of having to click on the ribbon?</p>

            Your post might make sense to you, but for anyone not watching what you are doing, it makes no sense. Clarify what you want to do and why you think Outlook 2010 can't do what you were doing before.

            <p>in 2003, you could type a name into the enty screen, hit enter, and a new one popped up. There was also a keyboard command, I believe Alt+D that gave you the entry screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not been able to locate this is 2010. The only way I know to type a group with all new names (not select from existing emails) is to click on the plus sign, answer the question where it is to be located, then type it...and go through this 60 times,
 which is the length of my usual groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping for a shortcut, so I could keep on typing rapidly, instead of stopping for each name to answer the same question over and over.</p>

            Ent(r)y screen for what? You haven't clarified what you are doing. Be very accurate and specific please and use the same terms Outlook uses not your own so we can understand you better. You also need to define what you mean by "group" since Outlook used
 no such term in Outlook 2003. Are you trying to create a Distribution List? If so what can't you do?

            <p>Outlook 2010 indeed uses "group" as the description for what was called "distribution list" in the previous versions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add someone to the list, you answer three questions: from Outlook, from address book or new email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the old version, the entry screen appeared, you added the information, and then with enter, the next one could be added.</p>

            In very precise terms define the screen to which you are referring and how you invoked it. Methods for adding members to a DL did not change in Outlook 2010.

            <p>If you are typing a long distribution list, this version of Outlook requires you to press the + sign for each additional entry, plus you have to specify with each if you want that person in your address book.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old version, you entered one person, selected the parameters, and then just hit ENTER&nbsp;to move to the next input. This was a very quick way to get a long distribution list typed. The alternate was Ctrl + D, which again got you to the next field to
 enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is so incredibly time consuming, I have tried all sorts of work arounds to speed things up.</p>

<h2>            N91 battery</h2>
                    The N91's battery is a BL-5C (970mAh)<br />
What, if anything, would happen if I put a BL-6C (1150mAh) into my N91?<br />
<br />
Would it give longer operational times? or just blow up the HDD?

            Well that wouldn't be so bad, just peel the label off the battery to slim it down a bit, but will the BL-6C give me more "working" time than a BL-5C? will i be able to listen to my music for longer etc?

            I don't think removing the black label is a good thing. For one it could invalidate your warranty.<br />
<br />
Also the batteries could get damaged by rubbing against the metal cover.<br />
<br />
But yes. If you put a BL-6C you can expect slightly longer usage times. I used to do that to the N-Gage (original one) once the BL-6C became available.

    <title>Android mail EAS security settings update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derek-777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android mail EAS security settings update</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung galaxy s6 running Android 7.0 with the default mail app. Just recently, the app required an update to my security settings in order to continue syncing both my corporate email (outlook 365) and my hotmail. The requirements happened about
 a week apart and did not coincide with either an OS update or change to our company email. The security settings are extremely intrusive (see first page of the list below) and have never been required in the past. No other phones in the company (there are
 about 50 Android devices both newer and older running OS versions both newer and older) have been hit with the same requirements. Is there a work around?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Derek-777,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, these notifications are simply default Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) messages. We suggest you check the question Palcouk mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also can’t use some features, we suggest you try using &nbsp;IMAP to access your email on your mobile device. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the IMAP setup steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1.</em><strong><em>Outlook.com</em></strong>: Account Type: <strong>IMAP</strong> &gt; Incoming mail server:
<strong>imap-mail.outlook.com</strong>; port: <strong>993</strong>; <strong>SSL</strong> &nbsp;&gt; Outgoing mail server(SMTP):
<strong>smtp-mail.outlook.com</strong>; port: <strong>587</strong>; <strong>SSL/TLS
</strong>&gt;<strong> </strong>SMTP authentication:<strong> <strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">yes, same settings as my incoming mail server</span></strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;<strong><em>Hotmail.com</em></strong>: Account Type: <strong>IMAP</strong> &gt; Incoming mail server:
<strong>imap-mail.outlook.com</strong>; port: <strong>993</strong>; <strong>SSL</strong> &nbsp;&gt; Outgoing mail server(SMTP):
<strong>smtp-mail.outlook.com</strong>; port: <strong>587</strong>; <strong>TLS </strong>
&gt;<strong> </strong>SMTP authentication:<strong> <strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">yes, same settings as my incoming mail server</span></strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letting us know how it goes at your convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

If the OneDrive you mentioned refers to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-OneDrive-for-Business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive for Business</a>, we can upload .arf/.zip/.HTML files to it. There's a 10-gigabyte (GB) file size limit for each file that's uploaded to the OneDrive for Business library.
<br />
<br />
For details about the restrictions and limits, please refer to the article:<br />

<p>Greetings vidinm.&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!</p>
<p>There would be quite literally hundreds of thousands of changes between 6.5 and 6.0/6.1/etc.&nbsp; It would not be&nbsp;reasonable to publish a list of changes.&nbsp; Rather, the best direction is to provide the new hive-structure&nbsp;used in&nbsp;6.5 for Developers to use when
 building a new program.</p>

            this is done to save power although a lot of users feel it should allow for user preference,<br />
unfortunately thats the way the mobile world is going, maximising power through such tweaks.<br />
as far as i think this is done deliberately and persoanlly, i feel its a great feature particularly realised when u absolutely need that little bit power for one call before ur fone goes bust !!!<br />
<br />
i dont think the new firmware fixes this issue but thats only a spectulation since its not available yet atleast for my fone.

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
i know power saver is for saving power and a good issue but the theme problem annoy me.<br />
because in all phones (i think) that have power saver mode, this part works nice. and you can choose for example a text or date or slide show for displaying on screen for a few mitues.<br />
but it does not work for N79 whiles the power saver mode itself works okey that it saves power for longest time ( a week) for me.

<p>t should In fact it should remain visible!!. On all my previous phones it worked just fine. What's the use of a screensaver when the screen goes completely BLACK???? I have always installed Largetime symbian app so I can always see a large clock on my display
 (in very low power mode but still visible).</p>
<p>The fact that the N79 goes completely BLACK is annoying at least! But I guess it's one of the zillion bugs in firmware 10.046 .....&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really doubt this is a deliberate design. Most other Nokia phones have the same "power saver" which pops up when the phone is idle, and all of them - even current ones - are set up so that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) The power saver appears after its timeout</p>
<p>2) The backlight switches off after its own, independent timeout</p>
<p>3) The power saver remains shown regardless of the phone's current state</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would the Power Saver have its own timeout and selection of Power Saver screens designed to show you the date and time, if it can only be shown for 2 seconds? I'm disappointed that Nokia support is disregarding this issue, but I assume it's more out
 of ignorance and a stock response than any insight into their plans for future firmware updates. Is there a "bug report" page or something we can use to ensure it's properly logged and not just dismissed?</p>

            Hopefully it'll be addressed in the software update, it's obviously not how it's meant to be behaving (it contradicts the manual and built-in help). I think they just lifted the software from the N85 and didn't correctly redo it.

<p>There's no way of knowing if the message even goes anywhere, never mind if it's actually read, but I keep it bookmarked and provide a bug report every time something goes wrong. Anyway, on the Power Saver I'm fairly confident that Nokia has simply decided
 not to provide low-power standby indicators on its phones beyond the "breathing" LED. None of the new NSeries devices have any support for this sort of feature. Expect to see it dropped from the ESeries and the mainstream phone range in due course.</p>

    <title>Ending Flighting on a PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ending Flighting on a PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello Insiders,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A question that has come up from time to time for some users who want to stop flighting on a particular PC (or sadly may want to exit flighting altogether) is how to go about doing this.&nbsp; As it stands, there are two ways to go back to your prior OS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Option 1</span></strong>:&nbsp; If you've enrolled a particular machine into flighting within the past 31 days (approx), you have the option to directly roll back to your prior OS through the Settings menu.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click the Start button</li><li>Type Settings</li><li>Click Update &amp; Security</li><li>Click Recovery</li><li>You will see the appropriate context to restore back to your prior OS (7, 8, etc.).</li></ul>
<p>Special notes:</p>
<p>- If you used an external USB as added memory during your Win10 upgrade, you'll need access to that USB (and hopefully you didn't erase it!).</p>
<p>- If you've changed your password after you updated to Win10, you'll need to have your old password handy to do the OS restore.</p>
<p>- Programs installed or settings changed since upgrade to Win10 will be lost</p>
<p>- After roll-back, if you encounter issues with a Modern app, simply uninstall and reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Option 2</span></strong>: If your machine has been flighting longer than 31 days (approx), you'll need to create recovery media and install the old OS directly to the machine.&nbsp; Don't forget to back up your
 data and content!&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>Go to control panel, Administrative Tools, Disk CleanUp, Run as Administrator, you will be asked to delete old versions of windows, clean system files. After this your latest version of windows 10 will become more stable. Currently we are on Build 10158
 as of 01 July 2015. JAXXSTry this...</p>

            <p>You know many of us are leaving because of the asinine requirement to use a Microsoft account.&nbsp; I like Windows 10, but I'll stick with 10159 until RTM and then drop out of the program altogether.&nbsp; This is simply a stupid thing for Microsoft to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is almost like you guys do not know anything about how your own OS works.&nbsp; Do you not understand what an impact switching to a Microsoft account has on a system that is connected to an internal network?&nbsp; It won't hurt the folks that are running a single
 PC, but it seems like the people you really want testing your OS are those that are running more complex ecosystems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever...I was getting tired filing bug after bug on stupid **** (like being unable to set a static IP Address, duh) that should have been fixed before you dropped builds on the fast ring.</p>

            What I did to fix this is go to Settings, Accounts, and then click "Verify".&nbsp; This verified my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Then, when I went back, it was good to go and download the next update.&nbsp;

            <p>I don't want to leave the insider program and am looking forward to 10,&nbsp;but fyi, the links given assume your using a retail version of windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The majority of people will actually be using OEM - ie preinstalled.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem as I see it is that most OEM machines don't come with a windows disc, and assume the user will create a recovery disc (which they wont), or use the recovery partition, which
 probably got binned during the 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely if my pc has an&nbsp;OEM licence Microsoft can supply a valid iso to download?</p>
<p>either that, use a key exchange program - enter a valid licence (oem or retail) and get a valid windows 10 licence, eligible to install on one machine only).</p>

<p>If you do not have a retail version of either Office 2007 or Excel 2007 you will not be able to install this on your new PC.</p>

<h2>            I cannot sort my data correctly because the sort warning will not display</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Professional with Excel 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a rather large spreadsheet.&nbsp; I am wanting to sort by three columns.&nbsp; When I sorted earlier, I got the sort warning "The following sort key may not sort as expected because it contains some numbers formatted as text."&nbsp; I got this warning for all three
 of the sort columns.&nbsp; That is not a problem.&nbsp; However, on one of the fields I clicked "Sort numbers and numbers stored as test separately."&nbsp; It didn't sort the way I wanted it to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I go back and try to sort again so I can select the correct option which would be "Sort anything that looks like a number, as a number."&nbsp; But it does not display the sort warning for the field that I need it to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to make the sort warning be displayed for this column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <div>Hi Scott, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I will assist you trying to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Which option are you selecting to sort? Is it <b><span>Smallest to Largest (A-Z)</span></b><span>,
<b>Largest to Smallest</b></span><span> </span>(<b>Z-A)</b> or <b>Sort
</b>from the <b>Data</b> tab?</div>
<div>If you <span>select
<b>Smallest to Largest (A-Z)</b> or <b>Largest to Smallest</b></span><span>
</span>(<b>Z-A), </b>then the sort warning would not be displayed.</div>
<div>It will display the warning only if you click on the
<b>Sort</b> button under <b>Data</b> tab.<br />
<br />
Check the following link for detailed information regarding sorting and see if it helps:<br />

<h3> jimbeaming  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Entering Bugcheck state upon Hibernation, wakes PC up and drains battery</h2>
                    <p>So I've been noticing that on the last few builds of Windows 10, when I open my Surface Pro up to wake it up after several hours of it being asleep, the battery drain is far greater than it normally is (i.e. 50% battery drain vs 10%).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a sleep study and found that today, the device went into Modern Standby at 7:15 am (when I left for work) and stayed that way for about 2 hours and 15 minutes before going into Hibernation mode. However, it immediately exited Hibernation state and
 went into "SystemState: bugcheck", and 15 seconds later back into an Active state, where it stayed for 5 hours, and then went back into Modern Standby because of a "Video Idle Timeout", even though no video should have been playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are the following most relevant (I believe) screenshots. It would take a dozen or so to capture the entire sleep study so if that's needed I'll probably just add a onedrive link.</p>

<p>So I've noticed this issue starting with the latest couple of Insider Builds, but it wasn't listed as a known issue in any of the change logs, and I haven't found many other people having this issue in the feedback app, so I figured I'd try on here to see
 if it was actually a problem with my personal system rather than the OS release. I'm currently running build 17107 on a 2017 Surface Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked, there is no cumulative update waiting.</p>

    <title>Excel for Android phone issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sanfranman59  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel for Android phone issues</h2>
                    <p>First, I want to say that Excel on my Android phone generally serves my needs very well. I find it to be a very useful product. But I have a couple of issues to report. I often have difficulty opening an .xlsx workbook that's stored on my device (Motorola
 G4). It's about the only one that I access regularly on my phone. The file is pretty small by today's standards (&lt;1MB). The behavior is that when I attempt to open the workbook, it goes to "Opening: file... Working on it...". Sometimes, the file opens almost
 immediately (within a couple of seconds). But often, the "Opening: file" screen just stays there with the little circle going round and round and it stays that way for many minutes. If I attempt to cancel it, it goes to "Attempting to cancel" and the little
 circle just continues to spin and spin with nothing else happening. Eventually, I give up and close Excel. If I try to open it again, the same thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can also happen if I navigate to another application from Excel and then attempt to go back to Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a file size limit, either in terms of bytes or the number of rows/columns in the workbook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue I've had is that the numeric keypad tab key doesn't always work to navigate to the next cell. If I switch to the qwerty keyboard, the tab keys there work fine. It's just the numeric keypad tab key that sometimes goes dead. Since I'm usually
 entering numeric data in the spreadsheet, I prefer to use the numeric keypad, but if the tab key doesn't work, it's kind of useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for a great product.</p>

<p>Hi sanfranman59,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing up this concern to our attention. If you're trying to open an Excel workbook that is less than 1 MB, it should open normally on your Excel application for Android. To know more about file size limitation in Excel, you can refer to
 this <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest that you sign out your account in your Excel application then sign back in and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>I didn't see that I had a response until today, so I haven't yet done as you suggest. But for some reason, the spreadsheet in question has been opening without much difficulty the last couple of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What effect does signing out of the application have? Does it clear memory or something? Do you suggest that users log out every so often as a general rule?</p>

            I'm getting the same intermittent problem with opening this file. I did sign out of my account and then signed right back in. When I then attempted to open the spreadsheet, it wouldn't open. When I tried it again later, it did open. I'm also still getting
 the intermittent problem with the qwerty keyboard tab key going dead.

<p>I've not been able to open this spreadsheet all day on my phone. No problem on a laptop. In case it's helpful, I've attached a screenshot of what I see on my Android screen. It's been like this all day today. The little circle just keeps spinning and spinning
 and spinning forever. If I hit Cancel, it says that it's attempting to cancel and the little circle just spins. Nothing else happens. It neither opens the spreadsheet nor returns to the main screen. If I keep trying, I'm guessing that it will eventually open
 the spreadsheet one of these times.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. To further isolate this case, kindly create a new .xlsx workbook and try opening it on your Excel application. This way, we can identify if the issue is with the app or the document itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists on the newly created document, you may proceed with uninstalling the application and reinstall it afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>I've worked with several spreadsheets on my phone and I'm confident that the issue is not specific to the file I work with most often. I uninstalled and reinstalled Excel on my Android a day or two before i started this thread, but will do so again if you
 think it might help.</p>
<p>

<p>Greetings to all:</p>
<p>You know I feel very bad to see the new mobiles 1Ghz + processor with 512 Mb RAM approx. compared to my nokia n8, this situation has made me very uncomfortable, I will not change the cell phone that I just love the architecture of this, and it makes you
 feel bad that a phone as expensive and "good" these attributes have only one RAM of 256 MB and 32 MB of graphics processor.</p>

<p>The N8 is over a year old now, and the hardware it is based on is over 2 years old, so, of course, it isn't any longer exactly "state of the art" when comparing to the newest models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N8 also can't be upgraded that way (it isn't a PC). If you want a phone with a faster processor, more physical memory, you need to buy a new model that has what you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, if you buy a phone today, 6 months from now there'll be even a better one on the market, and then you'll be wanting that, instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the N8 still does what you want, keep using it, and don't worry about other phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you're ready to get a new one, get a new one.</p>

    <title>No Printer On Network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techie bear  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Printer On Network</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I have 3 computers on a wired Ethernet connection. After much trial and error I finally have the 3 computers talking to each other, i.e., able to share files between the 3. The first two run Windows 7 (1 Pro, 1 Home Premium) and each can print to the printer
 installed on my desktop computer. The Win 10 computer (a 7 year old Dell D630) can share files fine, but every time I try to print from it, it brings up a Save As dialog box. A check of Device &amp; Printers in Control Panel shows the printer is not installed
 on the Win 10 computer, while a similar check on the Win 7 computers shows each has the printer installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 10 computer only wants to save the output to a file, even downloading the print driver did no good. So I'm left with the question: Can a Win 10 computer fully talk with a Win 7 computer, or is there some Win 10 issue with printing on a Win 7 printer?
 Any ideas or suggestions welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>Since you didn't specify that it is a network printer, I presume it's a USB printer, connected to your desktop computer, which must be running for one of the other computers to print through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my assumption is correct, I believe you will need to temporarily plug the USB printer into your TP computer to allow it to install there before moving it back to your desktop for sharing, since USB printers don't install until connected to the computer
 and turned on, even though a driver for it has been installed in the computer.</p>

            <p>Hello Mel,</p>
<p>Yes, your assumption is correct - my apologies for the lack of an accurate description, networks are something I'm just learning about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I have a problem with your solution:&nbsp; the second Win 7 computer has never been hooked up to the printer. It is only hooked up 'indirectly' to the desktop computer, e.g., it shares the Ethernet router and switch box with the other two computers on
 the network. And that 2nd Win 7 computer can print using the right-click, select print method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did finally get the printer driver onto the Win 10 computer so that it did show up in Devices and Printers, but no luck printing the Windows successful print job output, or even directly any file by right-clicking on a file and selecting print from an
 appropriate file, i.e., *.txt, *.log, etc. . When I do try it that way, I get an error message "Couldn't initialize printer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>Hello Again Mel,</p>
<p>Another 'clue'. So I tried copying the brother prn files from the desktop to the Win 10 Computer, just in case my install of the driver was somehow the issue. So I copied the 10 or so "prnbr*.inf" files from my desktop computer to my network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though they transferred to and from the network OK, and to a temp folder on the C:\ drive OK, every attempt I made to copy them to the C:\Windows\Winsxs on the Win 10 computer resulted in the same error message: I needed "permission" to copy them from the
 network location to the desired location. And I'm wondering if this need for permission (whatever it may be about) is another phrasing for 'printer can't be initialized'. Just thinking out loud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            I am a member of the Insider Program, and have been since it was announced. This post is about a non-functional printer under Windows 10, and whether there is something about the current Build of Win 10 (9926) that is preventing connection with a printer
 - the same way that Bluetooth 3.0 is not currently supported under Win 10.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. Since my last post, I've made some progress. Though I still can't print from the printer, the Win 10 computer is finally aware that the printer exists, that its allowed to share printing on it, but it still runs into a "printer error"
 transferring the file to be printed (regardless of the program that owns the file -&nbsp; .pdf, .txt, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was due to a password or login problem, but I can't seem to find any blockage, no missed passwords or user names, just the every time message, "\\Computer Name\is not authorized to access this port. Contact your Network Administrator for assistance.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've reached the end of my patience with the task - it was after all a test to see "how difficult" it was to do a specific task, and any problems (you) encounter trying to complete this task.". So I have plenty now to tell them (nicely, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            Hi  EightMallard657
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of iOS is currinstallstalled? Because I am able to launch all the Office apps just fine on my iPad running iOS 12.3.
<br />
<br />If you have iOS 12.3.1 which I'm about to installed, it might be culprit and you will just have to wait until Microsoft updates the apps to fix this problem.

            Thanks Andre. Yes i upgraded to 12.3.1 recently. The issue actually appeared on 12.3 so i thought upgrading might fix the issue but unfortunately not.&nbsp;

            Looks like you are gonna have to wait this out for an update from Microsoft engineers to update. Unfortunately, you can't rollback iOS updates easily. 
<br />
<br />I am using the second generation iPad Pro and the apps are working. So, it might be an issue specific to the newer iPad Pros.

            Update, I moved all my local files over to iCloud using the files app then deleted the app and reinstalled. &nbsp;Now works fine on 12.3.1. &nbsp;Not sure why offloading and reinstalling didn’t have the same effect, but nevertheless I’m back to fully functional.
 &nbsp;Thanks for your help.

            Logging in with a Local Account is a different animal than creating an "Other Account". Try opening another new account (I used my wife's name) and see what happens. It is in that account for me that Cortana works perfectly.&nbsp; She does not work correctly
