<h2>            Outlook 2013 sorting and deleting problem</h2>
                    Everyday, I sort my outlook 2013&nbsp;inbox by sender or date so that I can move those emails to the proper folders or delete them&nbsp;.&nbsp;However, during this process of deleting an email or moving it, the sorting reverts back to the top of my inbox,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;EVERYTIME
 I have to go back and resort my inbox to move or delete the next message from the particular sender. It can&nbsp;be very frustrating and time consuming.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to repeat this process several times in order to get all of my e-mails sorted and moved to the&nbsp;correct
 folder. &nbsp;Can anyone offer help out with this? &nbsp;Thanks I tried a repair of my outlook but that didn't help.

            Any updates to this? I have a user with a similar problem - Outlook 2013: sort by sender (or anything else), select an email, hit delete, and the mailbox view resets. The interesting thing is, I can't replicate it - if I do the same on my machine the email
 disappears and everything's fine. There doesn't appear to be any obvious setting in outlook that modifies this behavior, but I'm wary of wiping all her settings if it isn't going to fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Is it possible this behavior is controlled by (or related to) another setting?

            Microsoft phone support was never able to resolve this issue. We worked on this for over a month with the highest level of phone support through Microsoft. Our issue was not every time we deleted an item in sorted view but it did happen often enough to
 cause frustration with the user. Microsoft even tried creating a new profile and not transferring any user data over thinking it must be corrupt data however the issue occurred in the new&nbsp;profile too. They concluded that it must be a software issue and that
 Microsoft would try to get it resolved. This was a while ago and still nothing. Very frustrating. We have only seen this happen in the Office 2013 software.&nbsp;

<p>Mine does this too, but only intermittently.&nbsp; Using paid Hotmail account.&nbsp; It happens especially often if I am deleting e-mails when sorted by name rather than date.&nbsp; Would love to hear an explanation or solution.&nbsp; I have over 2000 messages in both my inbox
 and sent folders and sorting by name is a good way to identify things that need to be cleaned out, but it's slow going when I keep getting bumped back to the "A's."&nbsp; This
<em><strong>never</strong></em> happened with earlier versions of Outlook.</p>

            <p>My Outlook 2010 InBox is sorted by "Sent" and not "Received". WHY?: When I sort by "Subject," then delete several&nbsp; Emails,&nbsp;it defaults back to sorting by "Received". The oddity is that only some Emails sent after 4/30/15 are now organized in a breakout called
 "Beyond Next Month" and the year date in the list changes to 2020 (while the year date within the Email remains 2015).&nbsp;Other Emails are listed below under the heading "Today" and maintain their integrity. This is HUGELY frustrating for me.&nbsp;I have to reset
 the sort to "Sent" EVERY time I delete a group of Emails. The only common denominator is that my ISP changed something on their POP server most likely on 4/29/15; however, after contacting both MS and my ISP a few times, they both point the finger at one another.
 I truly don't care whom is to blame - I just want to find a way to "fix" it. It's not the profile. An upgrade won't "fix" it. It HAS to be code or a config in MS Outlook, as Outlook is ultimately controlling how sorts works. PLEASE MS, find a "fix"?!</p>

            <p>I am having this same problem when I have emails grouped by "From" or "Subject".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I group the emails by either sender or subject</p>
<p>2. When I hit the delete button, the screen does not change.</p>
<p>3. When I run by cursor over the screen, it resets to the top of the email list (still grouped by the original field -- Sender or Subject)</p>
<p>4. The emails are, in fact, deleted but I have to re-scroll down everytime I delete an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only delete one message from the group it doesn't seem to do it. It only does it when you delete multiple messages that would occur at differently places in the list of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the clean view command -- but that did not change anything. </p>
<p>

<p>Hi BP Service,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should make sure the meeting is deleted on both of you and invitee side. You can search the meeting in calendar and delete it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, you can back up data and re-add your account to see if the issue can be fixed. If the issue persists, may I know if the&nbsp;<span>acceptance emails comes from a particular user?</span></p>
<p>

            Did you cancel the meeting? Did everyone delete it from their calendar? When a user's phone is generating the messages, they will need to delete it.

            Yeah, if it was deleted from all calendars, it should stop. I dont know if it would help for the person who is generating the acceptances to restart outlook using the /cleansniff switch. This switch resets the sniffer lock, which processes incoming meeting requests and voting messages.

<p>Hi BP Service,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the issue should be related to the invitee. It is suggested to ask the invitee to back up data, then re-add account in Outlook desktop client and Outlook mobile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please also delete the invitation from the invitee's mailbox to see if it helps.&nbsp;</p>

            What is the host machine configuration. It might not be up to the mark. You mentioned your VM is running 8.1. Try a fresh installation instead.

<h2>            unable to open sharepoint files from file explorer</h2>
                    
<p>we are an office 365 shop. this had been working fine until a recent update but i don't know which one. i have sharepoint in my favorites list on the file explorer so that i can quickly and easily get to the files. when i click on the sharepoint link i get
 the error message &nbsp;"you might not have permission to ...." "...you must first add it to your trusted .....</p>
<p>we are running windows 10 and Edge is the default browser. what i have noticed is that if i open sharepoint with edge, i also cannot use the "open with file explorer" option. if i open sharepoint with IE11 i the "open with file explorer" feature is enabled
 and works. i read somewhere that the "open with file explorer" feature only works on 32 browsers. i don't know if that has anything to do with my problem that i cannot open sharepoint from the favorites section of the file explorer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi black94cobra,</p>
<p>the open with explorer command doesn’t work with the microsoft edge browser. more details can be found in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3083635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the article</a>.</p>
<p>based on your description, i understand you open sharepoint files with open with explorer. then pin it to
<strong>quick access</strong> as below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4c51682f-277c-464d-81d3-8c81357bc96b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4c51682f-277c-464d-81d3-8c81357bc96b" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you open the files in the quick access, you&nbsp;get an error. if this is your situation, can you try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue?</p>
<p>1. sign in to the sharepoint online site by using your office 365 work or school account credentials, and make sure that you click to select the
<strong>keep me signed in</strong> check box as seen in the following screen shot:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. add your sharepoint online sites to trusted sites via starting ie 11 &gt; click the gear icon<strong> &gt; internet options &gt; security &gt; thrusted sites &gt; sites &gt; add this website to the zone &gt; add.</strong></p>
<p>about open with explorer, i would like to share with you an article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2629108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to use the “open with explorer” command and how to troubleshoot issues with this option in sharepoint online</a>.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, can you share with us a screenshot about the error so that we can try to reproduce the issue? to upload images, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> when replying to the post, then click the<strong> insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>

<p>i found a work around. i already had the site in trusted sites on IE 11. i opened sharepoint with IE 11, the from the library tab clicked on open with file explorer, deleted the old link in the file explorer favorites and add the current location to the
 favorites and it is again working. i have no idea why the old link broke all of a sudden but deleting it and recreating it using ie 11/ file explorer worked</p>

                    <p>Hello...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am recording a Power Point with various insertions and animations that included personally recorded audio. I am getting a very heavy "hum" on playback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the microphones...still exists. &nbsp;Is this in the speakers? &nbsp; Microphone? USB Connection?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using two separate Windows DELL Computers: one is a 64 bit "7-Professional" and the other is a 64-bit DELL Windows 10. &nbsp;Both have 2016 versions of PowerPoint. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the "hum"!!??</p>
<p>

            Hi Edward,<br />
<br />
<br />
To get rid of very heavy "hum" on playing back audio insertion, we suggest you follow the troubleshooting below:<br />
<br />
• Check if all your audio plugs are inserted completely. <br />
• If you're using a USB sound 'card' try ejecting it, removing it, then plugging it in again.
<br />
• Remove the audio plugs and plug them back in again.<br />
<br />
If the hum is still there, then a whole lot will depend on your computer, house wiring, and software. You'll have to tell us what microphone, sound card, computer, and operating system you're using.
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.
        </p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 email images show as the URL, not the image</h2>
                    Hi, my wife recently fumbled the keyboard whilst in Outlook and her emails now no longer show any images or hotspots. Instead, now the underlying URL of the image shows. I spent hours trying to diagnose what setting has been interrupted but no good so
 far. I have run a full reinstallation of Office 365 and that did nothing, so it must be a Windows setting rather than Office? Any ideas would be appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook Express is the obsolete product. If you are unable to see the emails then i suggest you to access the outlook.com through Internet Explorer and check whether you see all your emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to open the Internet Explorer and type <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            &#39;Availability Only&#39; permission Option is missing when I try to share a calendar</h2>
                    
<p>office 365 calendar online. windows 10, &nbsp;browser - chrome.<br />
<br />
i want to share my availability only for one of my calendars with another member of the team. there is no such item in the drop down menu list although the documentation suggests there should be.</p>

<p>to be clear i only want this user to see if i am available on this calendar - i do not want them to see what the appointments are (full details), or for them to be able to edit them (edit),&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1036532b-2bc2-44a0-bfe2-a2904f6865fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1036532b-2bc2-44a0-bfe2-a2904f6865fe" /></a></p>
<p>this appears to be a bug to me. i have also tried to do this in the desktop application, and again among the permissions list there is no 'availability only' option.</p>

<p>Hi Communications - The Diocese of West Missouri,</p>
<p>I understand that you want the recipient to have Availability Only permission for your calendar only. The feature is not available.</p>
<p>No matter whether the Availability Only option is chosen or not, it is always applied to the calendar by default.</p>
<p>If you share the default calendar in OWA, you can choose from five permissions including Availability Only. If you create a new one and share it, you can only choose either Full details or Editor. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Monique</p>

<h3> redcmassacre  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need my Zune repaired, but when I try to set up a repair request, it is as though I am being asked to purchase another Zune&#63;</h2>
                    I've had my Zune 120 gig for two years now, and I absolutely adore it. Needless to say, when my screen got cracked, I wanted to cry rivers...but I knew that I could get that repaired once I had some cash laying around. Now I've got a battery life issue
 at hand, and I'm starting to think that now is probably the time to get this thing repaired. My warranty IS expired, but I really don't care about that. My Zune is well worth the money I paid for, so I'm willing to get it repaired, even if I have to pay for
 those repairs.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My only question is how to repair it by sending it in, without having to buy another Zune? If I send it in, I'd really like for them to send my original Zune back to me intact...I don't want to buy another one! D:!</div>

            <p>Hello redcmassacre,</p>
<p>If your device was out of warranty and you chose to replace your device, you do not have to send the device to the repair center. You only send the device to the repair center when the device is on warranty and needs to be serviced.
</p>
<p>Thanks for posting!</p>

                    <p>I find the I am unable to get either Audible Manager, or Zune software to see my Zune HD. It works just fine on a computer running Windows 8.1, but not with 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if I will be able to use my Zune HD with Windows 10 when it is released, as it seem it is not too important to anyone at this time?</p>

                    <p>Hi - </p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer updated in December with the Windows 10 update version 1709.&nbsp; Since then I can't print labels in Word.&nbsp; It worked before that since I printed labels for Christmas cards.&nbsp; I have Office 2010.&nbsp; The documents print in Word, Excel prints and I can
 print labels from sites like Etsy, eBay and Paypal that use PDF but not out of Word.&nbsp; Not sure if it's my printer or if it's Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I still have to try uninstalling and reinstalling my printer but am a little reluctant.&nbsp; I just want to make sure it will still print everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer is HP LaserJet P1102W</p>
<p>

</p><p>Not using mail merge to create labels.&nbsp; Just using the existing templates in Word under Mailings tab.&nbsp; No matter if I use a new template or one that I've already saved with the addresses on it just doesn't print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Suzanne -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not much happens when I try to print.&nbsp; The printer icon shows up in the lower right corner and the orange light on the printer telling me that there's a problem.&nbsp; Otherwise nothing shows up in Word saying that there's an error.&nbsp; That's why I don't know if
 it's the printer or the program.</p>

<p>What happens if you use ordinary paper in the printer?&nbsp; Do the labels then print? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warning light that you are seeing on the printer may be an indication that it has failed to properly feed the label media, which can sometimes be an issue because it differs somewhat from ordinary paper.</p>

<p>I always use the Mailings tab in Word.&nbsp; If it's things I need to reprint later I save them and they've always reprinted.&nbsp; I've also opened a new document for labels and tried that.&nbsp; It didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can print ordinary Word documents, Excel spreadsheets and shipping labels from sites like Etsy, eBay and Paypal that use a PDF.&nbsp; For some reason labels won't print from Word.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if it's on regular paper or a sheet of labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't always have time to sit and make a new table for labels from the beginning.&nbsp; Isn't that the reason for the label templates in Word?&nbsp;

            When you click on New Document on the Labels tab of the Envelope and Labels dialog, what you then have is an ordinary document containing a table.&nbsp; If that will not print, there maybe an issue with the font that is being used for the labels.&nbsp; Select the
 table and click on the Borders and Shading dropdown in the Paragraph section of the home tab of the ribbon and then click on All borders to add borders to the table.&nbsp; Then try and print that document and see if the borders print.&nbsp; If the borders print, but
 the text does not, then it is definitely something to do with the font.&nbsp; Maybe it is set to be hidden.

            <p>Open your Documents folder and then the Microsoft User Data folder.</p>
<p>Look inside the Office 2011 Identities folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each folder inside the Office 2011 Identities Folder contains the contents from the Identities you made. If you want to completely remove all traces of the Identity and all information associated with accounts within the Identity move the identity to a different
 folder, or send it to the trash if you are certain you will never need anything from ANY account within the identity.</p>

            I'm surprised that you can'take the call with a password enabled.&nbsp; In any event, open the screen for the password and enter a new blank password.
