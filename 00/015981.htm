<h2>            MS Word- Chromebook -TNR font</h2>
                    Every time I attempt to select Times New Roman font within my Chromebook MS Word app it will not select it and on its own selects "Shruti" font or something like that, I am not exactly sure of the name of the font that is selected instead.

<p><span>Hi Zachery,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Errors when trying to select a font in the Microsoft Word mobile application could be due to data files getting corrupted. To assist in resolving your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>When did the issue start to occur?</span></li><li><span>Were there any changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you completed?</span></li><li><span>Are there any pending updates that need to be installed on your device?</span></li></ul>
<p><span><br />
As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you clear the app data of the Microsoft Word mobile application and then attempt to verify if the same issue still occurs. If the issue still persists, you may have to reinstall the Microsoft Word mobile application
 completely.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to your response to our queries.</span></p>
        </p>

<p>This issue has occurred&nbsp;with all documents that I have created or opened within the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No updates or changes occurred, This issue existed from the time that I downloaded the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleared app data, deleted and re-installed the app, shut down the Chromebook, attempted to use word online(which would not allow me to
<em>scroll</em>, so because of those two issues I have since deleted the app and have shifted all documents to Google Docs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no updates at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already completed your initial&nbsp;recommendation to no avail.<br />

<p>Thanks for the update and sharing the results of the steps you've completed. We'd like to verify if you're installing the Office mobile apps through the Google Play Store. If your Chromebook uses the Chrome Web Store instead, what you can install is
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/office-online/ndjpnladcallmjemlbaebfadecfhkepb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office Online</a> that will allow you to create, edit, and collaborate on your Office files in your browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I have been using the google play store, although I also used "word online" from the chrome web store and I had separate issues with it, namely the inability to scroll within a&nbsp;document using my touchpad and touchscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to use the word app....or word online, once I was forced to it, however, they both have issues, and i'm&nbsp;sure you're not going to tell me how to solve them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be quite nice to have a specific problem fixed or be told how to resolve an issue, not be shifted to something else. Respectfully, your response was sub-par, did not resolve my issue, and leads me to believe that your products are junk, you have
 no concern for your consumer, and do not value feedback provided, thank you anyway.</p>

<p>We understand where you're coming from and why you would have that impression. The reason why we wanted to verify from where did you install the Office mobile application is so that we can forward the details to our support team and verify what is the main
 cause of the issue. We know for a fact that this issue already took your time and effort for it to be resolved. Thank you for providing the detail we requested and the feedback you provided will not be ignored.</p>

            <span>I tried counting down from where the font I wanted was and where the font was jumping to. I wanted to type with Georgia font so I tried each one below it until the font was what I wanted. It ended up that Gills Sans
 MT gives you Georgia font. I think the same concept could work with Times New Roman or any other font, because it seems like the coding is just off by five or six fonts. Idk, but that's how I'll manage until MS fixes the issue. Hope this helps :)</span>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work as an IT support guy at a coffee company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the users I support has recently got new shared inbox and tried to access to it on her Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She's got some problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) As shown in the screenshot below, # of unread message can be seen on the shared inbox. However, she can't see the detail of each message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17c70e6d-250f-453a-9714-3168b867bdc0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17c70e6d-250f-453a-9714-3168b867bdc0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Those unread messages can be read on Outlook Web Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have gone wrong and how should I deal with this? How should I support her?<br />

            Was the mailbox automapped or added to the account in account settings?   Look in File, Account Settings, open the account settings dialog and double click on the account - click More Settings - was the account added to the advanced tab? (It shouldn't matter for permissions either way but the account should only be added one way.) 
<br />
<br />it looks like the mailbox was added as the full mailbox. is the user caching shared folders? look in More Settings - is the box checked to cache shared?

<p>

            <p>Hey folks -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming many or all of you are or were once Windows Insiders? See this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/window-10-mobile-update-1001058629-error-code/c7650561-ff60-4e97-8d99-077e7b5a942f?page=1">
thread</a> for details. I've also pasted the info below for your convenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a theory on why this is happening. We think phones that took Insiders build 10586.11 and then hard reset or left the Insiders program are getting offered 10586.29 from production and&nbsp;<span>not</span>&nbsp;an Insiders ring. So, why the
 error? We published 10586.29 differently to production (differentials) than we did to Insiders (canonical) and could lead to the error you're hitting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to fix?</strong></p>
<p>Try this: go back to Windows Insider app and select a ring. Re-check for OS updates as you should now get the update from Insiders (instead of production) and we hope this then resolves the issue for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results!&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks Mike, that is helpful, and coincidentally what I did this weekend.&nbsp; I was in the Insider program and dropped out when W10M released.&nbsp; I was on build 10586.11.&nbsp; After days of getting the error, last Friday the update quit showing up all together,
 telling me I was up-to-date.&nbsp; I assumed this meant it was pulled to fix whatever errors needed fixing.&nbsp; But on a whim yesterday I signed back up for the Insiders program and successfully installed .29.

<p>
</p><p>Make sure you have enough disk space available, at least 25 to 30 GBs.</p>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open a Command Prompt (Run as Administrator)<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type: cd %windir% and press the Enter key.<br />

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type: net start wuauserv and press the Enter key.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type: Exit and press Enter, then go back and check for Windows Updates again.<br />
<br />
When the download reaches 100%, disconnect from the Internet immediately if you are connected by Ethernet or Wireless.<br />
<br />
Proceed with the installation and hopefully it will update.<br />
<br />
This work around discovered by Community Member Hula_Baloo has been a success for many.<br />

<p>Keep in mind that there is significant demand on the servers delivering build 10061, so you might want to hold off and try again later

<h2>            Microsoft Office keeps stopping &#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have just purchased &amp; installed microsoft office 2013.&nbsp; I am having the same problem, it seem,s as everyone else, all the programmes stop working when I try to open them or work on a document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I think there may have been a conflict when I installed my printer.&nbsp; I have now un-installed the printer and have 'repaired' office word. I am still experiencing the same problem with the programme shutting down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried following Guruprasad's advice of opening in safe mode and running the programme, but when I press the Windows key and letter R, and type winword/safe in the open box as he describes, I am told it cannot find&nbsp;the programme&nbsp;so cannot continue
 with starting word in safe mode.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do now?&nbsp; I cannot access any documents.</p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that uninstalling ABBY Fineread, or whatever it's called, did the trick and my Word package now seems to be working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I come to printing, I will do as you suggest - if I can make actual sense of what you are telling me in the physical world - do you get the feeling that I am a technophobe!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought a new computer (Windows 8) along with&nbsp;the Microsoft Word 2013 package and it has been an all day marathon trying to get it all to work successfully.&nbsp; So any help is gratefully received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            outlook has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>( I have read previous posts and reinstalled / full repair from internet) Office 365 / Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crashes also in safe mode except when I create empty profile. Disable add-ins - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I moved all ***.pst files except Outlook.pst (my main pst file) - no change.</p>
<p>Replaced the Outlook.pst with a backup from 3 weeks ago (outlook worked with few problems in between) - problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Avira antivirus (I tried disabling it - no change).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only log files I can get Outlook to generate seem to be an "Outlook-XXXXXXXXXXX.etl" file, which runs the performance analyser&nbsp;when I click on it, which then quickly terminates. Can't seem to edit the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Probably something in my Outlook.pst file is not liking some automatic update either of windows or office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be gratefully appreciated as it now almost 2 days without Email.</p>

</p><p>I searched the registry with "Find" but no reference to RequireShutdownNotification was found, but there was actually one under:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\dgnoutlook.Connect</p>

</p><p>so I set it to 0, but sadly no external difference in Outlook's behaviour.</p>

            <p>Start off by uninstalling Avira, then use any completely remove utility on their site. (The default win 10 protection will then kick in)</p>
<p>Then repair Office via the Control Panel, after which run the system file checker sfc</p>

<p>Then run scanpst.exe against your primary pst data file, if it finds/fixes an error run it again/again until it finds more to fix

https://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/usingscanpst.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If after all that the problem persists then in the Control Panel&gt;Mail Applet&gt;New Profile, with prompt for profile selected, add the single mail account, if using pop you will need to use the 'other types page' and the settings provided by your mail provider.
 You can add your primary pst data file, and set it as the default msg store, finish the process and start OL under the new profile.</p>
<p>See if that then helps</p>

            It seems that the security check system Is causing this when it goes into suspend mode or changes desktop to desktop.&nbsp; Some programmers are afraid to put a " auto function delete" but after 12 copies like the old Sun OS and some Unix should be enough.&nbsp;
 The old Sun OS limits the desktop to only 4 because of that problem.&nbsp;

    <title>Pasting an excel sheet into a table in outlook converts to table on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawsonf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pasting an excel sheet into a table in outlook converts to table on send...  How to have it send as an excel file not an attachment.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have the same issue as the below pasted question (see Link) </p>
<p>I want to imbed an excel table into a spreadsheet including the formula etc that my recipient can edit update and send back in the same email without saving the file, updating the spreadsheet and repasting it in a return email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have functionality to insert a table as an excel spreadsheet into an email. Why on the earth would you then convert that table into an image when I click send. That makes absolutely no sense. If you are going to do that then only offer an option to paste
 the cells as an image. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do this functionality in other messaging systems but in outlook it seems I only have the option of attaching the spreadsheet or pasting sending an image of a portion of the sheet in outlook. I cannot find a way to imbed a portion of a sheet or a table
 from a spreadsheet using office 365 or office 2016 and have the recipient using the same version of outlook receive the file and interact with the spreadsheet imbedded in the email.
</p>
<p>They can see the pretty picture. But the pretty picture is pretty useless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Say I have a table with a formula and I insert it into a new email as a table as an excel worksheet.
</p>
<p>I then send it to myself not even to someone else. </p>
<p>I receive the email and want to experiment changing data in column A to see the difference the formulas in other columns generate in the table.
</p>
<p>I can't change anything I've received an email with an imbedded picture of a table from an excel spreadsheet not an imbedded table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I even want to do that? If I wanted to send an image of the table I could just grab it with the snipping tool and paste it in or copy the table and choose to paste it in the email as an image. There is no reason for the insert as table function
 to exist at all. It's a confusing waste of space in my outlook client. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is it I and other users are missing here...&nbsp;&nbsp; Note the link below... at least 8 people in addition to the original poster have the same question.
</p>
<p>And I expect he number of people who would want to do this is orders of magnitude higher than 8 or 9... or with me 10.

            1. Are you using Exchange or IMAP or POP3? I am assuming recipient is also using Outlook.
<br />
<br />2. When composing mail, go to Format Text tab &gt; Choose Rich Text as Format &gt; Now Embed your Excel table
<br />
<br />Let me know the result.

            You need to send it as an embedded object using RTF formatting. This works best if you are sending it others within your same Exchange org. 
<br />
<br />If you send it to internet addresses, RTF may be converted to HTML and the embedded object could be blocked by security software. It also won't be usable by any client except outlook.

            It is back everywhere. &nbsp;The funny thing is, I had checked for Chrome to be my default browser but still had IE pinned on my taskbar for MONTHS and then WHILE I was using it today, it disappeared. &nbsp;It was after Windows did an update. &nbsp;All is well now. &nbsp;Thanks!

            <p>&nbsp;Uh, sorry to spill the beans, but all is not well. The last set of about 12 Windows Updates have caused</p>
<p>many odd problems for many Users. And they can occur days later. So be ready...</p>
<p>&nbsp;FYI, Google Chrome is an Operating System pretending to be a web-browser, and it should<em> never</em> be</p>
<p>allowed on any Windows machine. Google and MS are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
"competitors"</span>, and want your eyeballs looking</p>
<p>at <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">their</span> products and webpages 24/7... and will do ANYthing to silently 'kill-off' the competition. Same</p>
<p>old story has been going on for many years. MFG "A" releases a new version. MFG "B" releases an Update</p>
<p>which 'accidentally' hoses some functions(s) within MFG B's product; and vice versa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is worse in the case of Google and MS.&nbsp; We can have ONLY ONE operating system in charge-of</p>
<p>our computer hardware. When you allow Chrome (OS code down-sized into 'just' a web-browser) to</p>
<p>install atop existing MS Windows, you are just asking for serious trouble...&nbsp; Restraint-of-Trade laws</p>
<p>prevent direct shutdown of a competitor's software, and each 'pretends' to co-exist (yes, everyone</p>
<p>says "look, Chrome is working, and Windows is still running")... but sooner or later comes the BAM!</p>

            This was pretty interesting. We used VPN client to add these Windows 10 machines to domain. This causes the problem for Outlook client if you try to configure email profile. When vpn client is on during the Outlook configuration everything works. &nbsp;We don't
 have any Exchange servers in AD domain and there has never been any. Only Office 365 with cloud only identities.&nbsp;

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            This user&#39;s on-premise mailbox hasn&#39;t been migrated to Exchange online. The exchange online mailbox will be available after the migration is completed</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>We have a user who left the office and we disabled his account and now he came back to office.</p>
<p>We have a hybrid environment, we have his data backed in pst ,so no need to worry about data, we renabled the account from AD , however after syncing to office 365 under the mail settings , it shows ,"This user's on-premise mailbox hasn't been migrated to
 Exchange online. The exchange online mailbox will be available after the migration is completed"</p>
<p>Things we have done is 1)&nbsp;Moved the user from the syncing OU and moved it to a non syncing OU</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;And then deleted the user from the Azure Ad powershell with the following command ,"&nbsp; remove-msoluser -userprincipalname emailaddress -removefromrecyclebin -force</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;And then moved the user to the syncing OU and then the user got synced with AD on the cloud and turned to a mailuser&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Assigned it a license and it states the same error ,"This user's on-premise mailbox hasn't been migrated to Exchange online. The exchange online mailbox will be available after the migration is completed"</p>
<p>5) Tried to do remote move migration for the user to see if any changes happen and it gives an error stating "migrationpermanentexception " "the recipient isn't a mailbox "</p>
<p>At this point, we want to change the account to be in sync with Active directory, however I believe , in both cloud and on prem , it seems to be remote mailbox and mailuser on the cloud .</p>
<p>Please help !!!</p>

<p><span>Hi Pat,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, about “turned to a mailuser”, may I know what operation you do? When you disabled the problematic user’s account, did you delete the cloud mailbox?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, according to the error message, the issue should be related to the msExchangeMailboxGuid attribute. Meantime, did you have the on-premise mailboxes for the problematic user? If
 you don’t have any on-premise mailboxes, please remove the following attributes:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. MsExchMailboxGuid</span></p>
<p><span>2. MsExchRecipientDisplayType</span></p>
<p><span>3. MsExchRecipientTypeDetails</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After that, you can sync the user again to check whether the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:&nbsp; Before you do steps above, please also remove this user in cloud like you did the step 1 and 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Erick</span></p>

    <title>Equalizer Turned Off when Playing Music via Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vinoth d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Equalizer Turned Off when Playing Music via Bluetooth</h2>
                    I purchased Lumia 1020 few days back and the audio settings works fine when the headset is connected.<br />
Out of curiosity I purchased Sony Bluetooth Headset MW1 and tried playing music, OMG the sound effect is utter waste and discovered the Equalizer is turned off while playing Music via Bluetooth.<br />
What a stupid design is this?<br />
@WP8 Devs - Please Look at iOS and learn how a basic app has to be implemented.<br />
<br />
Now I have no other option other than going back to my iPod touch + Sony MW1 for hearing Music.<br />
Thanks a lot Guys.<br />

            Ok if it is a app developed by Nokia and built into settings panel, why do they have to disable the app functionality when an accessory is connected. Few manufacturers disable the equalizer when the audio is played through internal speaker to prevent the
 damage and enable it for headphones and bluetooths. But MSFT(Nokia) is the first company to provide this feature the other way!

            <p>I'm not speaking just to you, but to everyone who might be reading forums searching for solutions to their issues.&nbsp; In the internet age, if we're going to be picky, we should take some responsibility for making our world the way you want it through research
 and learning. Too many gripe with no solutions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, sorry. I just jumped into Apple-Bash mode because you mention the iPod (who's main function&nbsp;is as a music player) in comparison to the WP (who's main function is a phone). For all the constant lauding&nbsp;of the iPhone (which can't run&nbsp;EQ functions over
 Bluetooth either) no one mentions that it can't do&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for simplicity, someone in another post described the issue pretty well:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"It's not a problem of Windows Phone, it's a common problem with bt headsets and soundcards that are not linked to your bt card.&nbsp; They could make a pre-process that would process the sound before it's send thru bt. But that requires them to change the way
 the whole sound system works."&nbsp;&nbsp;This would require the phone to be built with the intention to route sound through the phone differently, planning to pipe needed parameter through bt, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easy for us to bash technology when we're frustrated, especially when we don't know how things work (like criticizing a wide receiver for dropping a pass while running 20mph when you've never run 12mph before) but if you step back and breathe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the guy who's going to say, BT has been around long enough for&nbsp;a newer phone like the ICON to have the capability, I'd challenge you to put the EQ advantages up against many of the delivered&nbsp;WP8.1 enhancements and see if you'd trade them in for BT-EQ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, much of the complaints of "tinny" sound&nbsp;by those using quality buds like the Backbeat Go, or Jabra Rox, are due to improper fitting in the ear,&nbsp; not the need for an EQ. Fit the buds properly, use your handheld volume first, then your earbud volume so
 you don't over-modulate or otherwise&nbsp;distort the sound, and you might find tolerable sound. Otherwise, get an app like MeeDJ and make your tracks sound the way you want them to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I hate the lack of BT-EQ, I LOVE having a $49 phone that does everything (of tangible value) that the $600 hypePhones do. These complaints are like complaining that you cant roll the window down on your car, so you're going back to your horse.</p>
<p>Best of luck!!</p>

 I agree partially to all the point you made, I just wanted to let you know I hate Apple products and I'm not lauding it in anyway. iPod and iPhone doesn't turn off EQ settings in BT mode and almost all the android devices too. And I know this issue can't be
 resolved since there are no API to control the EQ settings. I waited, waited from WP8.0 SDK, WP8.1 SDK and even W10 Mobile SDK doesn't support this. So nobody can build an music app with EQ settings AFAIK. Correct me if I'm wrong please.</span></span></p>

<h3> spirit33  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 Mini Firmware Update 30.0.004</h2>
                    
<p>I want to start a new topic on all the things that have changed with the new firmware update 30.0.004 for the N97 Mini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post all comments and findings here. What is good, what not so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But first of all, does anyone in the Netherlands found the new update? Because I'm still checking every hour and I have found nothing. If anyone can help me with that I would be grateful.</p>
<p>Like to hear from you all.</p>

<p>Apart from the changes comunicated by Nokia, I noticed so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When you close the keyboard, the screen now stays in landscape mode (previously the screen switched immediately to portrait). To me, this is an improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- E-mail: the basic Email-client (under Messages, just as the SMS-folders) has disappeared... Now only a Nokia-messaging type client is available.</p>
<p>Pro: better display of HTML-emails, nicer look and feel.</p>
<p>Con: I cannot use my home-internet mail provider anymore (Telfort), as the NokiaMessaging&nbsp;server keep a constant connection to the Telfort-mailbox, and it won'tallow more than one connection, locking it for my PC...</p>
<p>- Browser is a LOT better now!</p>

<p>Since I installed the update, the GPS signal takes a lot longer to fix than before...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always have A-GPS on, and before the update, it only took a couple of seconds to get a location fix. Now it takes up to a couple of minutes. Looks like it is not taking advantage of the A-GPS function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already re-entered the correct location server (supl.nokia.com), so that shouldn't be it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can it be that because of&nbsp;the hard reset it has to build up a new "experience database" in location fixing again??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, being used to instant location fix, it is pretty irritating. Anybody else recognize this?</p>

<p>Hello Serge_H,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I experience the exact opposite. With fw.12.0.110 it took ages to get a decent sat fix.</p>
<p>Now with the new 30.0.004 it only takes around 10 seconds to get a location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a full firmware update (not the 16mb via FOTA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            the phone auto lock(SETTINGS_PHONE_PHONE MANAGEMENT_SECURITY SETTINGS_PHONE AND SIM _PHONE AUTO LOCK PERIOD) is not working after upgrading to latest firmware 30. nokia look into this bug and fix it as early as possible.

<p>My findings about the update:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice look with nokia evolve.</li><li>Email can finally show the whole page and pictures, but I already had a good one.</li><li>The browser is a bit faster, but still not as good as the Opera Mini browser.</li><li>I absolutely see no difference with the Ovi Maps? What has changed?</li><li>The phone says a lot more that there isn't enough memory, very annoying (thank god for Netqin).</li><li>The one thing I didn't thought to be liking, I like. That is the little smilies in a text message :).</li><li>Haven't tested if the phone is more stable.</li></ul>
<p>Was it worth the wait? Well, I for my self have to say I am a bit disappointed. I wasn't expecting it to become as good as an IPhone or a phone with Android, but I was expecting a little bit more I guess.</p>
<p>All the big changes are still not as good as things I already had, such as email and a good browser.</p>
<p>Lets hope the phone is more stable now, but it's a shame that the phone now uses a lot more memory, anybody else noticed that?</p>

<p>I have the same problem regarding the autolock period.. i am not sure if everyone is facing this issue with the new fw, at least the people who've tried to reset their autolock period. nokia should look into this soon. :&lt; disappointment</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 in Win 10 extreme laggy</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,<br />
<br />
I've got a serious problem with my Office 2016 (32 bit) at Windows 10. When I try to open a paper with references, pictures etc, it nearly stops working, I can't scroll correctly, editing is nearly impossible and it starts looking like this:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87e6decb-fc7f-4fe4-b319-888301d0336c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87e6decb-fc7f-4fe4-b319-888301d0336c" /></a></p>
<p>(it is not freezing, i can type, save etc, but very laggy)</p>
<p><br />
When I open the same file at another PC with Win 8.1 and Word 2016, it works fine. I've deactivated all AddIns, no change. All updates are made. I've deinstalled it (completly with the office deinstaller) and installed it again, no change.<br />
When I open a Word document without graphics or tables etc it works fine.<br />
It's a quadcore with 8 GB RAM, so it's possibly not the hardware. (Taskmanager shows 0.1% CPU for Word) &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Any suggestions what I can do, where the problem is?</p>

<h2>            Visio 2010 - disabling automatic shape data &#34;function&#34; in cross-functional-flowchart</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Visio 2010 to put together a cross-functional flowchart. I have created a stencil with the standard shapes I am using and the respective shape datasets. However, when I add a shape to one of the function swimlanes, visio automatically adds aproperty
 line named "function" to the shape data that displays which swimlane the shape is in. I am either looking to disable this and have no automatic data added or change the display name of the added property because "function" will be misleading to the users of
 the flowchart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>
</p><p>thanks for the reply. Simply ignoring it is my last resort as I will have many non-visio proficient people using an html export of the flowchart and this data will be quite confusing to them.</p>
<p>

            I am using the built in Visio save as HTML feature. There it gives you active content that displays a shape's data when you CTRL+Click on it... I am using the shape data to provide additional detail to users so this is relevant for me.<br />

            <p>You can already add a shape data row named "Function" in your custom shapes and set it's Invisible cell to "True".
</p>
<p>By doing this CFF solution will add its formula to this Function row only and it's visibility will always be False, so it won't be visible to your users in HTML.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Ovi Suite software updates can not work&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I had a problem with OVI SUITE. When I open it, click tools-&gt;software updates. It would pop up something's gone wrong... Error code:14001. Please look at the attached picture.&nbsp; Then I uninstalled OVI SUITE, and re-installed it again. It still didn't work.
 Can anybody tell me what should I do?</p>

<p>By the way, I had an another question. I read a post message how to enable OVI SUITE logs. I followed the instruction,but it seemed that logs were not enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log_gathering_help.txt is written:</p>
<p>Note: Please make sure the user who is currently logged in is in the Administrator group, or that they have the access right to "C:\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia Ovi Suite\" folder. If not, there is a possibility certain logs cannot be collected,&nbsp; like the WindowsEvents
 log. (<font color="#FF0000">By the way, My OS is windows 7 64bit Ultimate SP1</font>)<br />
<br />
1. To enable the logs, do the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Double-click the enable_logs.js file.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click the button to finish enabling the logs when prompted by the dialogue.(<font color="#FF0000">when I double-clicked the enable_logs.js﻿, nothing happened...</font>)<br />
<br />
Note: After you have enabled the logs, it is better to restart NOS prior to collecting the logs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
2. To collect and zip the logs, do the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Double-click the collect_logs.js<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click the button to finish collecting. Zip the logs when prompted by the dialogue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After clicking the button, the folder where the zip logs have been saved opens.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
3. To disable the logs, do the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Double-click the disable_logs.js file.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click the button to finish disabling the logs when prompted by the dialogue.﻿</p>

<p>Hi Arthur722﻿,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do one thing here, uninstall the software along with all the Nokia related components install in your machine like connectivity driver, etc reboot the machine and then try to install the OVI suite, connect your mobile phone (it will automatically
 start connectivity process) and then try to do the software update. Hope this works....!!!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick response. I tried and found the service set manual.&nbsp; The service is not running. So my problem is still there. I also searched the related keyword by google, and it seemed there were nothing useful. It's a little complecated, and I
 am thinking of enabling NOS logs, which could tell me what exact problem is.﻿</p>

<p>Is there anything relevant in Windows's&nbsp;application event log?&nbsp;Often easier to clean&nbsp;the log first and then open Ovi Suite and check what errors you get there.</p>

            <p>Jesrael:</p>
<p>I am getting frustrated with MS support.&nbsp; If you had read the question completely you would understand that I had been using Excel to access my spreadsheets on OneDrive and now I can not access my files on OneDrive.&nbsp; I already know how to access files on
 OneDrive&nbsp;with Excel. &nbsp;Sending me links to show me something that I already know is unnecessary.</p>
<p>I have OneDrive loaded on my tablet and&nbsp;during the process of&nbsp;signing to my account&nbsp;the program/app hangs.&nbsp; I am left with a blue screen that does not go away.&nbsp; I have tried working with OneDrive Team and they told me it was Excel.&nbsp; So now I am trying to
 resolve the problem with MS support and I get the same run around.&nbsp; I am unable to access my OneDrive files either through OneDrive or Excel.</p>
<p>Why can't I access the files on OneDrive??????</p>

<p>Not hearing back from anyone I went ahead and reset the tablet after doing a backup.&nbsp; Now I can access the OneDrive files through Excell as before.&nbsp; The home screen has a different look.&nbsp; Possibly the Android operating system has changed or Microsoft made
 changes to OneDrive and left the public to figure it out.&nbsp; Anyway that's life in the IT world.</p>

    <title>Customize Quick Access Toolbar when replying to an email within Inbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Customize Quick Access Toolbar when replying to an email within Inbox</h2>
                    <p>When composing a reply email within Outlook 2016 Inbox (not a separate, opened, popped out, new email compose window), I am no longer able to customize the Quick Access Toolbar to include a shortcut for "delay delivery."
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can do this for a new email window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I previously had this shortcut saved in the Quick Access Toolbar, but no longer do and can’t find out how to put it back.

<p>I can see the difficulty with this - I was not able to add the "Delay Delivery" button itself, but the best I was able to do was add the "Message Options" button to the Quick Access Toolbar.&nbsp; That dialog has a checkbox for "Do not deliver before..." which
 allows you to schedule the delayed delivery.&nbsp; Will that work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do it, I went to "Customize the Quick Access Toolbar", changed "Popular Commands" to "All Commands" and scrolled to "Message Options", highlighted it, and added it to the list on the right.</p>

<h2>            File Size triplicates after saving as pdf</h2>
                    I'm using the new Power Point 2013 and when I try to save my ppt as pdf, the size triplicates or even grows 4 times.&nbsp;
<div>I've checked the "embebed typography..." that is one of the things that is recommended in many threads, but this doesn't solve the problem.</div>
<div>I've also chosen the option smallets and it doesn't seem to work.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any advice?&nbsp;</div>

            Powerpoint files are essentially ZIP files in which the XML code is stored. This means they are compressed. PDF files do not have that compression so inevitably will be larger than the original file. The level of compression in a zip file is determined
 by the content.<br />

            Hello Luciana,<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
I was unable to reproduce this issue.<br />
<br />
Does this issue occur on all the PowerPoint presentation? <br />
<br />
1) Let's create a new presentation and saved it in *.PPTX format.<br />
2) Re-open the presentation and save it in *.PDF format and compare the file size.<br />
<br />
<span><font color="#000000">Reply with the result and I'll be glad to further assist you.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</font></span><span><br />

            I'm having a similar issue at work, where I was just upgraded to Win 8 and Powerpoint 2013.
<div><br />
<div>I have a .pptx file that's ~4MB in size. &nbsp;If I save it to PDF, the file size grew to 17 MB with default settings. &nbsp;After playing with the options, the smallest I could get the file was about 9 MB.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I asked a co-worker who has not been upgraded yet to try to convert the file. &nbsp;With Powerpoint 2010, the PDF file size was only 2.5MB when starting from the same .pptx file</div>

<div><br />
<div>Ýou can write it both ways, for Windows it's irrelevant; the capital letters are for us humans ;-)</div>
