<p>Hi TesterBDD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 WSDL is https://outlook.office365.com/ews/services.wsdl</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting the login prompt from SoapUI or Ruby, I do suggest you contact the SoapUI / Ruby support to move on the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please provide the detailed steps and a screenshot of the error if you get any error from Office 365 app or website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

    <title>How to get account back&#63; Account wrongly banned whilst microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackbear25  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get account back&#63; Account wrongly banned whilst microsoft had problems with outlook.com</h2>
                    Around the 20th December, a message came up when I tried to log into saying 'It looks like someone else is using your account', and because the only account it asked me to send a recovery code to was an old e-mail I forgot, i used to validation via questions
 about my e-mail instead using a different account. I tried a few times but nothing was going through, this is when i first phoned microsoft. I was told on the phone that they were having some issues with account and to try back later, so I did. When I tried
 back, I got automated messages saying there wasn't information, when there was, after re-applying my answers, finally it went through. After waiting a few hours I was told that because I had submitted my validation answers too many times they had banned my
 account, even though in reality only about 2 attempts were successfully sent.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then phoned the same contact number again, to which they said they could not help me and redirected me to the website, where I eventually found how to live chat. The guy on chat was very helpful and tried to help me but I couldn't do anything from my
 account, so I sent in my issue to microsoft using a different account. I was told that it would be classed as a high up problem and that they would look into what went wrong with my acount, which has not happened.</div>
<div>They replied to me about my issue, giving me alternatives, but none were helpful as I cannot access my account at all. Instead of helping they just kept telling me the safety of the customers was important, which doesn't help because my account was never
 hacked.</div>
<div>The last time I heard off someone through my conversation for issue support was 12 days ago. It has been weeks since I could access my account and communication has stopped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I still want and need my account to be activated and saved as everything is linked to this account which I cannot change without accessing my account, and there never was any problems with my account.</div>
<div>I have now re-sent a message of my problem, I am now waiting for someone to investigate what happened and get my account back up and running, as I have no control over it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get someone to work with me and solve my problem?</div>

            No chance, the live chat was off the microsoft website which they have now removed, no scam.
<div>And I have already gone through everything on the website, I was in a conversation with microsoft workers but they have stopped replying. I have done this question on here because Microsoft help on twitter advised me to. Now I'm waiting for help.<br />
And even though it is a free service, I am a paying customer with many of their other programmes and services, I was told they would look into my account to see what went wrong, but since then no one is willing to help me.</div>

            Recommendation- None of the other music players or websites offer themes or even different color options. Itunes, google play, and pandora don't have it. I personally liked the black and green of the old app, and would be more open to using this instead
 of the other apps and such if we had those options available. Even if it just had the green and black available as classic or something that would be good

            <p>I have several recommendations for this app; I've put them all up on the user voice site, but I don't know if anyone internally has really read that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Feature match Zune and Windows Media Player (http://wp.me/p1fLW2-at).&nbsp; It's been years since the apps were introduced, so where's the development on them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Add the Zune wallpapers as 'themes' (http://wp.me/p1fLW2-aR)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. add in-app music store</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. add built-in audiobook support via the genre tag</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. add full ID3 tag advanced tag editor and the video tag editor that Zune had.&nbsp; I loved being able to organize my videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. In Snapped mode, use a Zune HD-style Now Playing screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Import playlists from Zune, WMP, and iTunes</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Actually add at least 3-5 features from User Voice every three months.</p>

<p>What about for Windows 10 for the phone? The only thing I see is Groove Music and it won't let me download music without paying for it. I already pay $10 per month for XBOX Music.</p>

<h2>            Creating multiple&#47;duplicate guitar chord templates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my question/ issue. I want to create my own blank guitar chord template pages. In Word I managed to create
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>one</em></span></strong> lone diagram. I simply want to copy and paste it across the page giving me six across and six down. &nbsp;I figured out how to do everything else. I simply don't why I can't copy and paste
 the chart. Thanks.</p>

<p>I hope Yoga Yao's post has helped you to make progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were happy with the layout I originally provided, it is possible that what you were seeing was a single grid and a load of things that look like { REF o }. In that case, you should be able to click alt-F9 (or fn-alt-F9/option-F9/fn-option-F9) to show
 a complete page of chord grids, which you should be able to print or whatever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use the grid you originally created with, the question is whether the problem you were having was making even *one* copy of that grid, or whether the problem was with laying them out in the 6x6 pattern you wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the 6x6 grid you could start with the layout I provided, but click on each chord grid in turn and delete it (and/or select each { REF o } and delete that. Or you could make a completely new document with your own 6x6 table and use the Table Properties
 to make the rows and columns the size that you need and make the table lines invisible. Then you would need to copy your own grid and paste it into each of the 36 cells.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you inserted your original grid by inserting a table, you should be able to mouse over the table until you see the little 2x2 selection box appear at the top left, and click that. Then you should be able to click command-C to make a copy of the table.
 Then click in cell one of your 6x6 table and click command-V to insert it. Then repeat for each of the other 35 cells.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't select the table by clicking on it, it's possible that you created it in the header (or footer). In that case you would need to use View-&gt;Header and Footer first, click in the header, then try clicking the table. (And/or click in the footer,
 then try selecting the table). Or it may be simpler to create a completely new diagram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you created your original diagram some other way (e.g. by using Word Shapes), you may need</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. to turn it into a single shape before copying it and</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. to make it an inline shape before copying it into the 6x6 table</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to do (a), click on one part of the diagram to select it, then hold down the Command key while clicking on each other part in turn. Then right-click and choose Grouping-&gt;Group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do (b), right-click on the shape (or the grouped shape), click Wrap Text, then click "In Line with Text" if it is not already selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select the shape and use command-C, command-V to copy it into each cell of the 6x6 table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the 6x6 table is the easiest way to create and adjust the layout, but there are other ways you could go (e.g. use Format-&gt;Columns to set up the document so that it has 6 columns, and take it from there).<br />

<h2>            After using Windows 10 on a PC how many of you will get a Windows phone&#63;</h2>
                    It is obvious that Microsoft's efforts to push Win 10 on to every PC is an effort to&nbsp;control the smart phone and tablet markets and weaken or replace android and&nbsp;IOS as much as possible. My question is how many&nbsp;Insiders will make their next phone or tablet
 a Windows10 device? (asked of android users because Apple users won't give up their&nbsp;iPhones if they were proven&nbsp;to cause cancer.)&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I bought a Windows Lumia 635 3 months ago and I really like it...decided to try it due to price was so low it was hard not to give one a try.....I will update it to windows 10 when available and as soon as the Lumia 645 xl comes out I plan of buying one
 of those ......Windows phone does everything I need and for the price you cant beat the Lumia's.......noticed the iPhones have also come down in price but I like the windows phones&nbsp;

            <p>I'm not switching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have android, and I used to think that having android on the desktop would be a great thing, so that I could do everything I use my phone for, from the PC as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately although in theory it sounds cool, in practice, after having Android apps on my PC, I discovered that it's not useful at all, because android apps are all touch optimized instead of keyboard/mouse optimized. &nbsp;They were awkward to use, and the
 limited information displayed was in stark contrast to what I was used to on a large desktop monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, I don't see any need to run Win32 on my phone, nor Metro on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if Microsoft ever develops a way that will in reality allow the phone to morph into a PC and vice versa, like their demo SIMULATIONS it might be worth taking a second look, but at this point it's vaporware like hololens. &nbsp;Sounds good in
 theory, doesn't work well in practice. &nbsp;Maybe in 5 years there will be phones with enough ram, storage, processing, and graphics power to replace a desktop PC (by connecting to keyboard video mouse), but it's just not here yet. &nbsp;I'm sure the first versions
 will be somewhat like the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It's highly unlikely that I'd buy a windows phone, but who knows in the future? I've currently more than enough versions of windows on various machines to want it on my phone as well. And truthfully, I like the iOS interface (although not 8.3 which has
 broken everything!) perhaps if Apple doesn't pull their collective fingers out and improve things in iOS 9, I may consider windows. However with MS and Apple trying to out do each other in features it probably means that they will get into a race condition
 where each one pushes features so fast that the quality goes through the floor. This happened with the pre-smart phones already, and the signs are here for the smart ones. I don't count Andriod in this analysis, as the current models have such a wide variance
 in OS release and the manufacturers seem unable or unwilling to push upgrades. If this continues I can only see Andriod going the same way as its Linux parent, so fractured and with so many forks that it has become a mammoth task for the a

            I'm partial to the Galaxy Note System and have both the original GNote 1 and a GNote 10.1.&nbsp; I&nbsp;could see myself grabbing a Surface Pro&nbsp;"n" or somebodies hybrid.&nbsp; Apple stuff bores and annoys me for a lot of reasons, but mainly because when outgrew&nbsp;AOL and
 the original MSN I was through with walled gardens.&nbsp; Besides, I'm a tinkerer and like the fact that Android&nbsp;is open source&nbsp;and I don't have to be tied to whatever the carriers&nbsp;decree. &nbsp;&nbsp;I admit I haven't paid that much attention but Windows Phone seems to
 be&nbsp;just as much of a walled garden as Apple.&nbsp; However, I freely admit I could be wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            As an Engineer I can see where you are coming from with regard to being able to tinker with Android, however with systems constantly needing care and attention around me it's good to have something largely rock-steady like an iPhone or iPad in a crisis.
 Both devices have got me out of a jam on numerous occasions when the more 'open' systems are dropping like flies. As a lot of my work involves the analysis of malware it's also good to have a heavily sandboxed environment to do day-to-day tasks like email
 and banking. However I realise my set up is not really the norm, but it works for me! 😺

<h2>            Folder settings Indexing option being unchecked</h2>
                    <p>I am having difficulty searching in outlook.</p>
<p>I made it work by selecting my OST files, properties, advanced, and selecting 'allow this file to have contents indexed in addition to file properties'</p>
<p>However, five minutes later the search stops working again, I go back to the properties, and the box has been unchecked for some of them.</p>
<p>How do I make it stick?<br />
Thanks!<br />
OS: Windows 8</p>
<p>Outlook 2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have also rebuilt the index twice, and followed all steps in this article to no avail:&nbsp;</p>

<br />
I went through the forums searching for a solutions and apparently alot of people experienced the same thing.....except in my case, I do not have any duplicate names or numbers!!!!<br />
<br />
Any ideas what could solve this???</div>

<p>1. check if phone numbers that are dublicated - entering twice same number will cause the phone software unable to determinate which contact tryed to reach you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;dublicated&nbsp;that&nbsp;connect&nbsp;to&nbsp;phone&nbsp;top&nbsp;PC&nbsp;and&nbsp;sync&nbsp;with&nbsp;MS outlook&nbsp;. Use MS outlook to edit contact fields and place the information in to the fields with default ( not custom names) &nbsp;- the reason is that VCF places custom fields at the
 bottom of the list , if default field is empty and gustom one is filed that you will not be able to see the info in it&nbsp;(&nbsp;in&nbsp;custom&nbsp;one)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are two more conceivable reasons:</p>
<p>- The provider´s server has for some reason stopped transmitting names (rather improbable if there are different providers)</p>
<p>- The persons have changed their settings to suppress their numbers.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            hmm, yes i am with you, and it does not seem like there will be a resolution to it anytime soon, this has been the case for s60 phones for a very long time. as far as i know beyond of what you have already tried there really is no fix for this.

<p>There is a fix for it but you won't like it. I have tried it a few times and it always works but it involves a lot of work. This is what you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make a backup of nothing else but your contacts only.</p>
<p>2. Delete all your contacts from both phone and sim card.</p>
<p>3. Start by entering the troublesome contacts from scratch making sure not to duplicate any numbers.</p>
<p>4. Now get those people to ring you to make sure that your CLI is working fine.</p>
<p>5. If it works then start entering the rest of the numbers, once again making sure there is no duplication whatsoever.</p>
<p>6. If it doesn't work, just restore the backup you made of your contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am fairly sure it will work, but just in case it doesn't you can always restore your backup and you are back to square one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>the algorithm is same for all contacts and for all phones like yours and many other models;-))</p>

                    <p>OneNote has been working fine for me until all of a sudden, it says that I can only open the program as an Administrator or that it can't open because there is insufficient memory(which I checked, and my laptop is fine with memory). When I try to "Print
 to OneNote" from an opened pdf, it gives me this error message : "OneNote cannot open the file because OneNote is running with administrator privileges. You can open the file from OneNote by clicking File and the clicking Open"</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to just go back an open the program normally without opening it as an administrator?</p>

<p>An error occurred while troubleshooting</p>

</p><p>I ran disk cleanup utility and trashed all of the temp files and reran the troubleshooter. &nbsp;It seems to have forced onenote to only open in administrator mode. &nbsp;I can't use win/L-shift/n to open. &nbsp;I have to click on onenote in my start menu, then approve
 the UAC message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty much the same thing I went through before the troubleshooter except that I can use my LMB instead or RMB and Run as administrator...</p>

            <p>I had this problem too and the solution to run the 'Troubleshoot compatibility' option did not help unfortunately. However I was able to resolve the issue eventually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a short-cut on my desktop, and also had a shortcut linked to the taskbar in Windows7. I right clicked the shortcut on the desktop and selected the 'Compatibility' tab. I noticed that there is a box there under 'Privilege Level' with the option to 'Run
 this program as an administrator'. Strangely this box was already unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I clicked on the button "Change settings for all users', and had to sign in as 'Administrator'. The 'Run this program as an administrator' box was still unchecked, so I left it that way and clicked on 'ok'. Then I clicked on 'ok' again. Now I was
 able to open the program without having to sign on as administrator when I clicked on the shortcut on the desktop.<br />
</p>
<p>When I clicked on the shortcut on the taskbar however it still required me to sign in as an administrator.<br />
</p>
<p>I removed the shortcut from the taskbar, and then re-established it on the taskbar and, voila, it all worked ok.<br />
</p>
<p>Sorry this is long winded, but I went through a number of steps and I'm not sure which one(s) solved the problem so I thought I'd put them all in.<br />

<p>Thanks Neha -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still not sure what my error was but I finally completed the installation and you may be interested in my end solution.&nbsp; I decided to clean everything up and then reboot and try again.&nbsp; I logged back into my Microsoft Account, followed the instructions
 and downloaded the installer.&nbsp; I got the Mac message asking if I wanted to save the download and replied yes. After I did so, The installer would not run and I got the same error message in the installer log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that point I decided to stop.&nbsp; I logged out of my Microsoft Account and closed the browser.&nbsp; As I started to delete the installer from my downloads I simply decided to try to run it directly.&nbsp; It worked perfectly and now all apps are running correctly!!!</p>
<p>

<p>Since when this problem started?</p>
<p>Try run Windows Update and install all updates and restart your PC.</p>
<p>If you open task manager, under View details and in startup, are you seeing MSRT there?</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying so quickly!! I didn't notice the insert image button. That I can do. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Started about a week ago (never seen this before, so found it unusual)</p>
<p>- Windows is up to date (this is done regularly)</p>
<p>- You're right, Task Manager shows mrt.exe trying to run at startup. Pic below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've actually highlighted 2 other things I'm not familiar with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Should I stop "Program" from running, that seems suspicious</p>
<p>2. I'm guessing "Windows host process" is usual? I just don't recall.</p>
<p>3. I'll probably disable MSRT, but how do I know if it's legit or fake? I just don't know if this is how mrt.exe should be running or not.</p>

            <p>From the list "Program" seems to be very suspicious try right click and open location and investigate a bit more about it.</p>
<p>May be you could zip the root file of it and submit it to VirusTotal:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virustotal.com/</a> </p>
<p>MSRT and Windows Host process are signed by Microsoft and seems to be legit, but they should be run only once. Try disable program first and then restart your PC and see whether problem persist.</p>
<p>You may also use AutoRuns:</p>

</p>
<p>To investigate startup more and manually disable them.</p>

            <p>Excellent - disabling stopped the persistent ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-clicked the Task Bar columns and selected 'Command Line', and found that unknown Program entry to be a divx file. I assume this is fine, but it's not required on startup so that's disabled too:</p>

    <title>MS Security Essentials won&#39;t stay on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Security Essentials won&#39;t stay on</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 and Microsoft Security Essentials. Only in the last few months did this problem start to occur and I have been unable to correct it.&nbsp; When I stop for the day, MS Security Essentials (MSSE) is programmed to start up and run a full scan
 at 2am and it used to do that. Now, every morning I am greeted with the message that I am not protected because MSSE is turned off and the full scan did not run. If I start the scan manually, it's the same in the morning. I've scoured the net for fixes and
 tried many but nothing works. If anyone has any experience and an answer with this, I would really appreciate it. Thanks very much.

<h2>            How can I get rid of the &#34;Product Activation Failed&#34; message on Microsoft Word 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Word 2010 on my laptop has been popping up with an error message about "Product Activation Failed", saying that "this product has not been activated". The program has been on there for a very long time and it never used to do this until after we
 cleared the computer when it got a bad virus, and we had to change the hard drive. So maybe that's why. Anyways, I need to know how I can get rid of this message. My mom had the same thing happen but she doesn't remember how she got it to quit. &nbsp;It still lets
 me use the program and all its features, but how can I get it to go away? Thanks. Sorry for the long explanation :)</p>

<p>Both are email applications and will get your email from just about any provider.&nbsp; Outlook has more features and was designed primarily as a business application.&nbsp; Windows 10 Mail, is free with the operating system, Outlook is not.&nbsp; If you need or simply
 like the extra features that Outlook brings, go for it.&nbsp; If you don't need or don't like the extra features and/or the price tag, Windows 10 Mail should get the job done for you.</p>

<h2>            Email Calendar Invites Received on Behalf of Someone do not show Attendees&#63;</h2>
                    My company recently switched to Outlook Professional 2016.&nbsp; I am an Executive Assistant, and I manage calendars for 6 Executives.&nbsp; The calendar invitations I received on behalf of&nbsp; another person in previous versions of Outlook showed all of the meeting
 attendees in the email tab.&nbsp; This version of Outlook seems to only show who it was received on behalf of in the email pane.&nbsp; If I want to view the other meeting invitees, I have to physically go into the calendar, open up the meeting, and view attendees.&nbsp;
 This adds several steps to my normal process, and it also doesn't make any sense why Microsoft would remove that feature?&nbsp; Is this just a view setting that I can change?&nbsp;

            What is the version number of your current outlook installation? 
<br />
<br />It sounds like you switched from a subscription to a retail or volume license. The subscription version has newer features, many of which aren't in the retail and volume license versions yet.

<p>Download <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Mail</a> and sign in with your Microsoft account. Then import CSV file there and the contacts will be synced to the phone. If you want you can remove Windows Mail once done. IF this did not work through outlook &nbsp;you probably did not install the connector.</p>

<h2>            Purpose of w&#58;rsidP tag in the XML Files of Word Document</h2>
                    <p>I was just trying to understand the xml structure of the Word document. And I have come across 'w:rsidP' attribute many times but I am not able to understand the purpose of it. I know that RSIDs are used as identifiers each time the document was edited and
 a RSID is produced at each session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for the sake of identification, there are already "w:rsidR" and "w:rsidRDefault". Can someone please explain me the purpose of&nbsp;</p>
<p>'w:rsidP'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
