<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; HP hs2340 HSPA&#43; Mobile Broadband Module for Windows10 1809</h2>
                    <p>To all my friends out there - here is how to get the&nbsp;HP hs2340 HSPA+ Mobile Broadband Module to work properly in an HP 8460p in WIndows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall the following drivers:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a) All existing 3G-modem drivers that you may have attempted to install and that are still left behind<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; First use the Windows App uninstaller or a third party uninstaller app (i.e. ccleaner) to search for and uninstall HP Mobil Broadband Drivers</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp; &nbsp; Then reboot your PC and go into Device Manager and uninstall any drivers that still may be left in there for the hs2340<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Keep in mind that if you have made attempts to install random drivers, you may end up with entries in Device Manager with incorrect names, but if so these entries should be easily seen as they are marked with the yellow triangle)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; When uninstalling drivers from Device Manager, make sure you also tick off the box: Remove driver as well.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">b) Reboot your PC after every attempt to clean out old rubbish.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then uninstall the HP Hotkey Support App. This is incompatible with the hs2340. You need to use the old Quick Launch button instead (or none at all if you don't care to activate quick launch buttons)<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">c) Then uninstall the HP Framework. It is incompatible with the hs2340 and it is not needed. (remember to reboot)<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">d) Uninstall the HP Connection Manager Software&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>2. Download (but do not install) the correct driver from the HP Softpaq library:&nbsp;sp52715</p>
<p>3. Disable the compatibility assistant for Windows 10. (This is necessary in order to install these old drivers)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a) Follow the description found <a href="https://www.winhelp.co/knowledge-base/windows-10-disable-program-compatibility-assistant-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;on how to disable the compatibility assistant completely. (remember to reverse this procedure after you are finished.</p>
<p>4. unpack the content of the driver to its default location. This can be done by simply running the sp52715.exe file. But in addition to unpacking the files content, it will also attempt to install the drivers. However, this will fail.&nbsp; If it manages to
 partly install your drivers. You have to redo step #1 again to clean up after it. But you should now have the driver files correctly unpacked to c:/swsetup/sp52715/</p>
<p>5. Open a command window in administrative mode (press Win-key and type CMD. When you see the command, right click on it and choose "Run as Administrator).</p>
<p>6. Navigate to c:/swsetup/sp52715/ericsson/</p>
<p>7. Now go back to windows file explorer and in the same folder (c:/swsetup/sp52715/ericsson/) right click on the file setup.exe and choose "Troubleshoot compatibility" then follow the on screeninstructions in order to mark the setup.exe file to run in compatibility
 mode, but do NOT run it yet. If you accidentally run it anyway, it will again attempt to install the drivers, and again you'll have to redo step #1 to clean up after it. But that's Ok.</p>
<p>8. Now go back into the command window and type "setup". Now your drivers should install correctly.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; After successful installation and reboot, you should now see the Mobile Modem on top of the list of wireless networks available if you click the wireless symbol on your taskbar, and also if you check the wireless setting in WIn10. If you do not see this,
 it may be because your modem is turned off and needs to be turned on. The only way I know how to do that, is to install the HP Connection Manager (sp53394.exe).
 But installing Connection Manager also requires disabling compatibility mode and running the installer from an elevated command mode as explained in step 4,5,6,7,8 but of course with different file and folder names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to install Quick Launch Buttons for HP, then use the&nbsp;sp49104&nbsp;or earlier version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have fun :-)</p>

<h2>            Excel printing help</h2>
                    <p>I created a spreadsheet in Excel 2016. The sheet contains text and numerical data. Certain cells are highlighted in different colors and certain data is in different colors. The necessary cells have borders on them. When I go to print preview everything
 looks great. Colored cells are there, data in black and color is there, borders are there. But when I print the worksheet I get the cell borders, the colors in different cells but no data at all. None of the words or numerical data will print. I have verified
 my print area is fine, my print setup is correctly set, the setting under my printer are set for photo and text, the only change I made was to check print preview in my printer settings so I stop wasting ink printing blank workbooks over and over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in Excel print preview everything looks great. When the printer print preview comes up all the words and numbers are gone. I have attempted coping the cells and pasting them into Word and printing it that way (thinking it was an Excel print issue) and
 again cells print, colors in cells print, no words or numbers print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went so far as to unprotect all protections in the workbook and cells, verify no Header/Footer data, verify no print blocking enabled. I cannot figure out what the problem is. The following 3 pictures are attached: 1) Sample snip of workbook data,
 2) Excel Print Preview, 3) Printer Print Preview (note the borders do not show on this print preview but they do print).</p>

</p><p>I print Word, Excel, and Outlook items all day on this printer and have never had this issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Tracy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about your concern regarding the Excel file. Kindly answer the questions below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>When did the issue start? </li><li>Have you made any changes or installed any updates prior to the issue? </li><li>Have you tried printing another Excel spreadsheet? </li><li>Are you experiencing the issue with Excel only? </li><li>Have you tried updating the printer and Office as well? </li></ul>

<p>Good afternoon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The issue started yesterday afternoon. I printed a newly created spreadsheet with no problems in the morning. I created the imaged sheet in the afternoon (following same procedure from the AM with regards to creating the new workbook).</p>
<p>2) There were no changes made to any settings. There were no updates to Windows 10, Microsoft Office, Epson Printer, nor were there any other installations or changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) I have tried printing several spreadsheets that were created under Office 2016 all the way down to a regular XLS spreadsheet. It is the same issue each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) The issue is happening in Excel and Word. In Word when I insert a table any data contained in the table does not print. Any colors in the cells and borders around the cells print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) I updated the printer drivers last night after contacting Epson. I also cleaned the print head. I verified the nozzle check pattern prior to cleaning the print head and after cleaning it. The nozzle check pattern was correctly printed before and after
 cleaning. I have attempted to update Office but there are no updates available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional) With all the updates and cleaning the issue remains. I was emailed a spreadsheet created by my RE. I did a quick print on the spreadsheet from Outlook. Same issue happened. The cell borders and cell colors printed but no data contained in the
 cells printed. I had additional conversations with Epson today. They are stating the issue is an Office problem not a printer problem. I fully expected a pass the buck response when I contacted them. Unless I can prove it is not an Office issue I cannot get
 Epson to do any further diagnostics or research into the issue I am having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for spending time attempting to assist me with this rather frustrating issue. I appreciate it immensely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you send a copy of a spreadsheet to a co-worker and they print it, is it fine?</p>
<p>Can you connect the Epson to another computer and verify that it is the Epson and not the computer?</p>
<p>If you print to another printer do you have the same problem?</p>
<p>Basically, right now you don't know if the issue is your excel, your computer, or your printer.&nbsp; You would help yourself find the problem if you can split the print task into several steps and see which step if failing (excel to computer, computer to printer,
 printer to paper).</p>
<p>Also, if you copy the data to a different sheet (with no formats and colors) and print that, do you get your numbers?</p>
<p>Also, in your list of printers you should have something like "microsoft document writer" that allows you to "print" to an image file.&nbsp; If you do that print, does the image have your numbers or does that also only have the formatting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets narrow down the problem so we know where to look.</p>

<h2>            How to Embed Onenote Files into a Website</h2>
                    <p>Hi, community.</p>
<p>I am trying to embed OneDrive OneNote files to my website.</p>
<p>As far as I used, word and excel embed&nbsp;into a web is successful.</p>
<p>However, I could not find a embed option for a OneNote file.</p>
<p>So I tried the other way,</p>
<p>Share-&gt;Get a link-&gt;add&nbsp;&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdbipreview=true to the end of the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reference is here</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Embed-your-Excel-workbook-on-your-web-page-or-blog-from-SharePoint-or-OneDrive-for-Business-7af74ce6-e8a0-48ac-ba3b-a1dd627b7773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Embed-your-Excel-workbook-on-your-web-page-or-blog-from-SharePoint-or-OneDrive-for-Business-7af74ce6-e8a0-48ac-ba3b-a1dd627b7773</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And my code looks like</p>
<p>&lt;iframe width="500" height="200" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src=" https://something.sharepoint.com/personal/something/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=something&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdbipreview=true”&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still is a no go.</p>
<p>My web is based on wordpress and based on my search, wordpress does support embed from onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wonder it is because OneNote does not support to be embed for now or did I do the steps wrong.</p>
<p>And if so how do I make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Dayu,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Personal OneDrive</a> has embed button as I show in the initial reply.</p>
<p>OneDrive for Business doesn't have the embed button. </p>
<p>Based on my test, I can cembed OneNote files frome OneDrive for Business with the steps below:</p>
<p><span>1. Go to OneDrive for Business, select a OneNote file. </span></p>
<p><span>2. Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Get link</span><span>&gt;set the link type to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Anyone with this link </span><span>(this is a guest link)&gt; click OK
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Copy the link.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Then open the guest link in IE/Firefox/Chrome first, a</span><span>fter the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">guestaccess.aspx</span><span> is changed to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">WopiFrame.aspx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span>copy the new link.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Create the embed code like below:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in">&lt;iframe height="500" width="700" src="https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/personal/yourtenant_onmicrosoft_com/_layouts/15/<span style="font-weight: bold">WopiFrame.aspx?</span>folderid=12705a52a8b974053a0e3affec0eb34d6&amp;authkey=AVlDo1i1uNrEtYD8uq4Inzs<span style="font-weight: bold">&amp;action=embedview&amp;wdbipreview=true</span>"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
</p><p><span>6. Please modify the URL with your information and check the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot embed OneNote files, please provide a screenshot to describe the error message you get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 Wierd Error message, Mobileme related&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmbennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Wierd Error message, Mobileme related&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I used to use Outlook 2003 until today when i bought Office 2010 (professional edition). I use Apples Mobileme as my email/contacts/calender provider which worked just fine in 2003.</p>
<p>When i first ran Outlook earlier after 2010 installation it popped up an error which made no sense so i clicked it away. Now all the time in Outlook the same error message keeps coming up, whether i be in contacts / calender etc? I have a hunch its related
 to Mobileme syncing as my calendars dont seem to be working in Outlook?</p>
<p>The error box popup is very small&nbsp; and the title-bar says "SetupMesageService" and the error is just:</p>
<p>$8004010F</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i have no idea from that message what its about or means? Even an hour goggling hasn't bought up any answers which is unusual with windows errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>ActiveX combo boxes don&#39;t work in Excel 13 After Windows 7 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ripmc16  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveX combo boxes don&#39;t work in Excel 13 After Windows 7 Update</h2>
                    <p>I have a large workbook with several ActiveX drop down combo boxes and active X command buttons. This sheet is a calculator that generates serveral forms. After the most recent Windows 7 update none of them work anymore. If you select them in developer mode
 and select properties it brings up properties for the sheet its self and acts like they aren't there. If you open a new worksheet and try and draw in another ActiveX function it gives an error message "Can't insert Function." I restored my computer to before
 update and everything went back to normal. However I forgot to go back in and disable automatic updates, so Windows has updated again and now they don't work again. In the update it shows as a "Critical Security Update for Excel," their are additional ones
 for each office product. Anyway to fix this without restoring?</p>

    <title>How to Download an Ads Account Report with the Ads API - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Download an Ads Account Report with the Ads API</h2>
                    I'm trying to download a report for my ads account as a xml file in my Java application, I've been looking around at all the Microsoft Guides and I've seen so many different ways of getting reports I don't even know where to start. Pretty much what I'm
 looking for is a file where I can type in my credentials and the report parameters I want, then this will run and download an xml report to my computer. Their github is really complex and I'm not sure if this can all be accomplished in one class or if I need
 a whole bunch. Thanks.

<h2>            535 touch issues when connected with USB cable</h2>
                    I have Lumia 535 dual SIM. After installing the last update (02060.00000.15053.24000) it's working great, I mean there are no touch issues, but when I connect it to my PC by USB cable, it starts to work awful, I just can't control it.

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That sounds like a grounding issue. &nbsp;The touch of your finger changes the capacitance of the location of the screen. &nbsp;If the phone is not properly grounded, that will interfere with how the screen can sense your finger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing to check would be the USB cable. &nbsp;If it has a kink or has an internal fault, that code cause the problem. &nbsp;If the USB port or the computer itself is not properly grounded, that may cause an issue. &nbsp;If you have the computer plugged into a
 faulty power strip, that could cause the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can verify this by plugging the cable into into the phone and into the charger that comes with the phone. &nbsp;if the problem still exists, then you know it's not the PC and it's either the cable or the outlet. &nbsp;Try replacing the USB cable and see it goes
 away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of that works, you may have a fault in the USB port on the phone. &nbsp;Either it's damaged or you may have some material stuck in the port causing a short. &nbsp;In the case , get a can of compressed air and trying blowing out the port. &nbsp;Otherwise take the
 phone to be serviced.</p>

                    I have a document (created in 2008, by someone else) that I am revising in Word 2010. There is one instance where there are duplicate pages. I am able to edit the text on one set of duplicates and the edits appear in the other set of duplicates. However,
 what I really want to do is just delete the duplicate pages...when I do, it deletes BOTH sets. HELP!?!?!?!

<h2>            Outlook 2010 error OLMAP132.dll</h2>
                    I keep getting error messages, i.e., OLMAP132.dll with Outlook and then it crashes. This happens every time Windows automatically updates my computer. I am sick to death of dealing with this and have quit using Outlook and gone to Google. But I would really
 like to use my Outlook, it's just that the solutions are so complicated that I am frustrated by it all. I have noted this over and over with Microsoft, I have contact Support for help, and the answers I get are all completely unsatisfactory. I'm told that
 I have to re-install Outlook and I'm not going to do that as I recall that installing Outlook originally was a mammoth headache process and I spent hours on the phone with someone in India. It seems to me that Microsoft ought to be able to solve this problem.
 In the meantime, I've just gone to Google and am using my Google email account because it will accept the other email messages. But I cannot read many of them in Outlook nor can I send certain messages with attachments. Very, v

<h2>            OneNote &#58; Resizing &#40;larger&#41; multiple images at the same time</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to increase the size of multiple selected images on a OneNote page at the same time. &nbsp;I have many images on many pages so I would like to automate this if possible. &nbsp; I am essentially trying to increase the size so that they fill up the page
 when printed but I don't want to manually increase the size of each photo. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the OneTastic plug in however it only allows you to shrink multiple images at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using OneNote 2010 on Windows 7 / 8.1 and OneNote 15.3 on Mac Yosemite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Will</p>

<p>The "Registry File" hash address "326bcf6e" is the first group that has the "ransomware protection" reference. When using the Registry file - search for "ransomware,"&nbsp; the first appearance of ransomware appears in the file "326bcf6e."</p>

    <title>Has managing &#34;Family Safety&#34; for Windows &#91;Phone&#93; 8.x - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sba923  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has managing &#34;Family Safety&#34; for Windows &#91;Phone&#93; 8.x really become impossible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had set up a "child account" on all my Windows 8.1 PCs at home that my 8-year old daughter uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I joined the Windows Insider Program and installed test builds of Windows 10 on a couple of these devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point this resulted in the impossibility to have my daughter's account (MSA) being a "child account" on the Windows 10 devices...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this seems to be "repaired" (albeit with a different way to configure an account as a "child" one, which is not that obvious to discover), except that the website doesn't seem to make it possible to secure the use of Windows [Phone] 8.1 machines by children
 in your family...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is just a very temporary glitch, 'cos I'm not sure everyone will want either to have Windows 8.1 / Windows Phone 8.1 "insecure for children" or to be forced to upgrade everything to Windows 10 (which is not yet available for phones, BTW)!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>My phone is NOT enrolled in the Insider Program. A couple of PCs are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I'm reporting is about the fact Family Safety for Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 seem to now be nonfunctional or at least impossible to manage via the web interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We won't all upgrade our PCs and phones overnight to Windows 10, still keeping our families safe on Windows [Phone] 8.1 is a must.</p>

            <p>Hi sba923,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, thanks for being an Insider!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, make sure that on your Windows 8.1 devices, your child accounts show up as child accounts in Settings.&nbsp; Then, make sure to click on the link to manage safety settings online.&nbsp; That will take you to account.Microsoft.com/family, but just in case
 the PC isn't connecting to the service, this will reestablish that.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, on the website: </p>
<ul>
<li>For Windows Phone, your child's settings are tied to the profile on account.Microsoft.com/family that shows the&nbsp;Microsoft Account.&nbsp; If you make settings changes there, they will also apply to&nbsp;any Windows 10 devices you&nbsp;give them access to, as well.&nbsp;
</li><li>For Windows 8.1 devices (PC), look for the profile on the account.Microsoft.com/family that has your child's name and the device name.&nbsp; Use *that* one to make changes.&nbsp; Due to some changes we made this spring to enable roaming profiles, each non-Windows
 10 or Windows Phone device have to be managed separately.&nbsp; </li></ul>

<p>When was this Windows Phone 8.1 device added within your family (the first and the last time)? I am asking, because the family features of Windows Phone 8.1 are not comparable to those of Windows for computers, regardless of Windows 10 or the Insider Program.
 Or asked differently: What do you want to secure on your Windows Phone 8.1 device, and what is not possible?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi, I am using Lumia 950xl DS and I&nbsp;got very deep knowledge of VoLTE because I also have JIO sim,&nbsp;actually VoLTE is a mobile feature, without that feature no mobile will use VoLTE, the phones which are coming with VoLTE features are able to use the service,
 some phones are getting updates and after that update they are getting VoLTE feature example: I have old Samsung j2 mobile phone but before it doesn't have VoLTE feature, recently it received ota update and now it got VoLTE update and now I can make HD calls
 and video calls and also&nbsp;I can able to see the VoLTE sign near the network bar, it means that the Microsoft should give the VoLTE update for their phones so that we can able to use that feature. I called on supportb2x.com and complained to them they said to
 me that we r working on VoLTE and soon we will release the update, but I am not satisfied with that conversation, I think everybody using lumia devices should complain on supportb2x.com, if they receive the complains in big no.s than they will give the update.
 this is the solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanx</p>

<h2>            finally fired it up&#33; but what is.....</h2>
                    
<p>what does fixed dialling mean in the security settings menu?</p>
<p>Im also wondering about setting a pin to lock the phone, when I though I had set one &amp; then went to - pin code request, it asked me for a code but didnt accept mine! I then tried 12345 &amp; it then said I had one attempt left! ( I assume the phone locks up
 after that?) what am I doing wrong? There seems to be several "pin codes" for different things! I just want to make the phone slightly more secure but without having to enter lots of numbers each time I want to dial someone!</p>

            you cant create a pin -it is given by your operator which generally 0000 and you can change it after that.

<p>The SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card usually has two PIN (Personal Identification Number) codes; a primary PIN code and a secondary PIN2 code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PIN is used to unlock/use the SIM card. The PIN2 can be used for additional restrictions (e.g., fixed dialing limits your calling to a specific set of numbers, but with the PIN2 you can bypass that, if you know it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM card has also, so called, PUK codes (Personal Unblocking Key), which can be used to reset a forgotten PIN code. For PIN2 there's a PUK2, too. You get the PIN/PIN2 from the network operator (carrier, service provider) from whom you get the SIM card
 from. If you need the PUK/PUK2 codes, you get also those from your operator. By default, the operator usually set the SIM card's PIN/PIN2 codes always to the same default values (usually 0000 or 1234, but it could really be anything they decide to use). The
 PUK/PUK2 codes are always unique and SIM dependent (i.e., one SIM card's PUK will not work with another SIM card from the same or any other operator).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone also has a security/lock code, which is irrespective of the PIN and PUK codes, as it is phone-specific, and not related to the SIM card at all. So far, to my experience, all Nokia phones have had 12345 as the default security/lock code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security/lock code you can use to lock the screen, or prevent changing of SIM cards (e.g., if someone steals or finds your lost phone, when they try to replace the SIM card, they need to know and enter the security/lock code, if you have made the phone
 to require it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installabe memory cards have also a password that you can set. If you do, then the memory card cannot be used in another device, unless the password is known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you use Bluetooth radio to connect ("pair") two Bluetooth devices, then a Bluetooth security/PIN code is also required to set up the connection (it is used to generate encryption/decryption keys that the devices use to "scramble" the data between
 themselves).</p>

            Just to add to what petrib nicely explained:<br />
1. Once u get ur pin &amp; pin2 u can change it under the option in settings-security settings- change access codes.<br />
2. To prompt phone to ask for security code when a new sim is inserted set the security level to phone.<br />
3. The memory card password is strongest &amp; the most dangerous of all. Strongest in the sense once u set it &amp; someone happens to take the card out of ur phone without ur permission to copy it, they can't do so.(even on pc). The password locked card opens only
 in the phone in which password was set to it. For opening the card on pc u'll have to delete the code first. In other phones however, u can unlock it but u'll need to enter password once. Now the dangerous part- if u happen to forget the code &amp; u update the
 software of ur phone then the card wont open even in ur phone. U will not b able to retrieve the data by any method until u input the code. U will not b able to format the card too. So my advice is u put a memory card password(before any prankster decides
 to do so as many ppl on this forum say), keep it in atleast 2-3 secure places so that when needed u can retrieve it well.

    <title>Can I delete office 2010 starter pack. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I delete office 2010 starter pack.</h2>
                    I have read all the posts regarding this and now i am really concerned!! I was using 2007 for ages and it is all i need. Then my computer crashed and had to be reset to factory settings, I reloaded 2007 but now it seems linked to this starter pack of 2010
 and i cant get rid of it. Help desk suggested i get office 365, i was considering it, but it looks like if one tries to upgrade to a new version, all hell breaks loose and you end up with nothing working. Can anybody tell me if there is a solution to this.,
 before i purchase a new software???

            Hi. When I write a word doc in 2007 it saves and everything is normal. I save and close it. When I reopen it it opens in 2010! Also I tried to put 2010 into the recycle bin, when I tried to find my work in 2007 I couldn't find it. It was saved to my desktop
 and it just came up with the message "program not found" then I restored 2010 from recycling and then my doc opens but in 2010. There is nothing wrong with 2010 but it is a starter pack and does not have enough features for my course work, that's why I need
 my 2007 to work properly.&nbsp;

            If you can start Word 2007 and the only problem is that double-clicking Word files opens them in Word Starter, then you can simply uninstall Starter from Control Panel. When you are done, repair Office 2007.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I found that Office 2010 Starter has somewhat "virus-like" behavior.&nbsp; If it is installed, it tended to constantly grab Windows default file associations even without being run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows default file associations are registry entries that tell windows which program to run to open/edit a given file extension. It can only point to one application at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you uninstall an application, the file association is sometimes left behind or cleared out.&nbsp; Running Office Repair does several things, including resetting the Windows File Associations.

<h2>            Access 2013 Web App - basic calculated field help</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I'm customising a basic web app in Access 2013.&nbsp; I want to create a field which concats data from two other fields.&nbsp; Both of those fields are lookup fields,&nbsp;one with manually typed lookup entries and the other is looking up data in another table.&nbsp;
 The result of the concat function is giving me the numerical "ID" (which is the primary key field) of the lookup table data, even though the field itself is showing the text value I want in the concat field.&nbsp; E.g the form looks like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>CUSTOMER&nbsp;<em>(Lookup table Company, field Customer Name): </em>"ABC LTD"</p>
<p>CATEGORY <em>(Lookup from manual list</em>): "GOLD"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then have a calculated field: Concat([Category]," ",[Customer]) which is returning "GOLD 1"&nbsp; instead of "GOLD ABC LTD".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get that calculated field to return the actual text value in the CUSTOMER field rather than the ID the lookup function must refer to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure it's super simple, but this is all new to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Firstly, the use of the lookup field wizard is generally deprecated by experienced developers.&nbsp; For reasons why see:
<a href="http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm</a><br />
<br />
Secondly, a value list should only be used as the RowSource for a combo box (which is what a lookup field uses as its display control) for a set of values which is immutably fixed in the external world, e.g. days of the week or weeks of the year.&nbsp; Otherwise
 the values are data and should be stored in a referenced table.&nbsp; A fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codd%27s_12_rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Codd's Rule #1</a>).&nbsp; This requires
 that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other way.<br />
<br />
You can do what you wish, however by concatenating the value of the text column from the referenced table.&nbsp; Whether this can be done in a calculated field in the table, I can't say as I'm using Access 2007.&nbsp; The usual way to do this would be in a computed column
 in a query which joins the two tables, e.g.<br />
<br />
SELECT &lt;field list from referencing table&gt;,<br />
Category &amp; " " &amp; [Customer Name] AS Category_Customer<br />
FROM [Your Referencing Table] INNER JOIN Company<br />
ON [Your Referencing Table].Customer = Company.CompanyID;<br />
<br />
where CompanyID is the primary key of Company referenced by the foreign key Customer column in your referencing table.<br />

            <p>Actually Ken, Katie is in an A2013 web app, which is very different from client database. In web app one MUST use the Lookup field to express a FK relationship. So she did it correctly.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes this lookup field is turned into a foreign key constraint in the SQL Server table.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but you cannot do that using a calculated value. It only allows you to pick from fields in the main table, not in any others. DLookup or equivalent are not available either.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We would like to create a list in SharePoint based on an xlsx or csv file that regularly gets updated (exported from another program). Is there any way to get SharePoint to automatically import such a file from a specified location to a list? It would either
 have to overwrite the current list or update it with new rows from the file. </p>

                    <p>I have one computer with Microsoft Office 2019 for Home (containing Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps). This 2019 version of Office has the option to insert icons (Insert -&gt; Icons).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 3</span>: I modify this presentation with the already inserted 2019 icons and I save the presentation as a 2016 pptx file, or I use some of the 2019 icons in another presentation made with PowerPoint 2016.</p>

            There is no issue with copying or reusing Microsoft content to your documents. You would only get in legal trouble if you attempted to resell or redistribute the icon collection to other users.

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello Oleg_MD
<br />
<br />First and foremost, no one (including me) here can or does speak on behalf of Microsoft but with that said, the sheer fact that you have a current license negates any issues (even if any existed) regardless of what version those are eventually opened/modified with.
<br />
<br />FWIW - the same file formats are used by both '2016 and '2019 so there really isn't such a thing as a '2016 version vs a '2019 version other then you may have used explicit functions/features used in '2019 not present in '2016.

<p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>I was just wondering if there could be a copyright restriction or other kind of legal limitation, considering that in Office 2016 you do not have installed by default the set of icons available in Office 2019 (in Office 2016 there is even no such option
 as "Insert - &gt; Icons"), so normally you need to import them from somewhere.</p>

<h2>            Replying to e-mails received in Alias account defaults to primary account.</h2>
                    So I have a few aliases. Lets say Primary is X, and alias is Y. <br />
<br />
I send an e-mail with Y, get a response back to Y. I go to reply to the e-mail received in Y, and the "From" address on my side reverts to my primary (X) account and I cannot change it to Y. This has been happening since the beginning of Outlook online and
 doesn't seem to be getting changed. In fact a lot of things seem to not be getting changed.
<br />
<br />
For example, why is it that when I go into settings on the right top side of Outlook.com that once I'm in there, I can't go back to my Outlook inbox? I have to sign out and then sign back in to view my e-mails. Why weren't these things thought of before this
 was released? And now it's been a long time since Outlook has been released and these problems are still here.

I appreciate the response, but your suggestion is not a solution. What is the point of alias accounts when we can't reply to the e-mails received by our alias with our alias e-mail? That makes no sense. No worries, I'll switch Mail accounts soon and not have
 to be bothered by Microsoft's idiotic programs/ OS/ devices. <br />

Apple FTW. <br />

            <p>Hi AlexCrisan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you're unable to go back to your Outlook.com inbox coming from Account Settings as well as not being able to reply back to emails using your alias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that when going to Account Settings, your browser should open a new tab with the Account Settings page so you can easily navigate through your previous tab with the Outlook.com inbox open. If not, you can&nbsp;also click on your name and choose
<strong>Edit Profile</strong>. Once you're in the profile page, you should see an arrow down on the upper left hand side to navigate back to your inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding being unable to reply back to your alias' emails using your alias account, kindly verify if you're unable to see a dropdown on the upper left hand&nbsp;corner to change accounts,&nbsp;when composing a response to an email.
<span><font color="#000000">For us to better understand your concern, kindly provide us a screenshot of the reply page as well as your Account settings page. In order to get a screen

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, I do not want to change my default 'from' on the Outlook.com site within my Outlook for Mac everytime I reply to an email that was sent to one of my Aliases.&nbsp; I do see the dropdown box to select which email address to reply from,
 however when I check the appropriate email alias and reply on my email it defaults right back to the primary email address after it is sent. It shows up to the recipient from the primary email address and not the alias that I selected. I do not want to confuse
 people when they are sending to one email address and my reply shows up from a different (primary) email address. There is no point in having the aliases as stated above if this cannot be fixed.
