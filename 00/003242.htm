</p><p>Your best work around is to change the BIOS date as suggested in the article and boot into Windows 8.1 after, then delete the boot manager.

Dual boot configurations is the best way in my estimation to evaluate Windows 10, an article was written showing you how to do that. Reason being, your existing version of Windows (whether that be Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7/8/8.1) is kept safe while you install Windows 10 preview on a hard disk or partition.

This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM.

    <title>Word Mail Merge&#58; Addresses vs. PO Boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Mail Merge&#58; Addresses vs. PO Boxes</h2>
                    <p><strong>Need</strong>: Merge EITHER Street Address Number, Street, etc. OR merge P.O. Box + P.O. Box Number.&nbsp; Need to show one merge code series OR alternate merge code series.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Explanation</strong>: We have safety issues for which we get lists of property owners who have either a street address, which is expressed in 7 columns (includes number, direction, street name, street type, quadrant, suite, suite number); OR they
 have a P.O. Box which is expressed in two columns ("P.O. Box," and P.O. Box number).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem</strong>: When I string the 7 street address codes in proper series with a space between each, and I tack on the PO Box series, PO Boxes print just fine, but they have&nbsp;6&nbsp;leading spaces, so it's like the PO Box portion is indented.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Years back in Word Perfect, all I had to do was insert an &lt;Alt-Space&gt; for a "soft space" within the Street Address series.&nbsp; If there was no value within the street address series, nothing would print, not even the spaces between number, street address, direction,
 etc.&nbsp; I find no equivalent for the soft space in Word mail merge.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?&nbsp; It was so easy in WordPerfect, can't believe Word does not have something as easy, since P.O. Boxes are quite common.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WORK AROUND</strong>:&nbsp; Yes, I've separated my PO Boxes from the addresses and created two lists, but I feel I should not have to.&nbsp; This is very basic mail merge stuff that Word should make obvious to us.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom</p>

<h2>            Error when updating from 9826 to 10041</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>When trying to update to 10041 from 9926, it installs and boots up to a black screen with evaluation copy down on the lower right. Nothing else shows, a command line box appears for a very brief moment before it just stays on the black screen. Mouse is visible
 however. After a few minutes the system then shows 'Attempting to repair system' then restarts. A blue screen then shows stating dpc_watchdog_violation and the system restarts again followed by a restore back to 9926.</p>
<p>Have attempted this three times now with same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to resolve this particular error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would wait for the .iso when it becomes available but I'm inpatient XD</p>

    <title>Access Accounting Setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> legal eagle but no programmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Accounting Setup</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I have alot of questions that I can't find answers to but here goes.&nbsp; I will start by explaining what I do have and then ask how to do some tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a table for each of the following;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Client Financial data (stores the billing rates that apply.&nbsp; This includes the price per hour, the % contingency, the cost per fax, copy etc...)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Costs and Non Hourly Fees Table:&nbsp; This stores the actual events I'm charging for (except the hourly).&nbsp; For example, I write to this whenever I make copies, have to charge the client for court fees, or bill them for a flat fee service.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; My Trust Accounts:&nbsp; This tracks when a client adds money to their trust account, or when I take money from it to pay a bill they owe me.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; My time sheet system tracks the start and end time of any attorney billable hours or any paralegal billable hours.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; My client debt table:&nbsp; This is supposed to hold the amount billed in each periodic billing statement, as well as the amount paid.&nbsp; When I bill the next cycle I apply the interest rate to the amount overdue and then add that to the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a preexisting accounting Access program I can look at for guidance?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Is there a way to get all of the billing information (Sum of each services * Service rate+ overdue balance and interest) into one form or report and then have that write to the Client Debt account as a new bill?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When I try to do a query that uses all of the tables the math gets really messed up (Example:&nbsp; Billable hours worked alright but when the query got to # of copies one client had 2 copies but the program said he had 4, while another had 3 copies while
 the program said he had 9)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally I want to write a program that will write my end of the month billing statements, add a record to the client debt file, and work like all the other accounting software out there.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 and leave some juicy bits for you to implement.</p>
<p>It may be better to integrate with an off-the-shelf accounting program for your line of business.</p>

            While I don't disagree with Tom you made an Ok start on your tables depending on structure.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Table 5 is not needed though at least in the way described.<br />
<br />
Can you list the structure of Table 2? That can help us understand how far you have gotten.<br />
<br />
Also the SQL for the query that produced the wrong results.

There are a number of templates available from Microsoft which deal with various business accounting tasks, but they tend to be fairly simple in structure.&nbsp; You may find examples in them of routines which will provide you with a basis for developing your own
 routines. On the whole though, if your want a customized solution you need to build it yourself.&nbsp; The reason I first learnt to develop databases some 15 years ago was that I found the available solutions did not satisfy the requirements of my own, admittedly
 quite specialized, line of work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Provided you have the base data as values in properly structured and related tables, almost certainly yes.&nbsp; The set of tables and the relationships between them must accurately model the real world situation, however, and be in accord with the principles of
 the database relational model.&nbsp; It is especially important that the tables be normalized to whatever normal form is required to avoid redundancy and the consequent risk of update anomalies which might otherwise arise.&nbsp; You'll sometimes see it said that that
 normalizing to Third Normal Form is usually sufficient.&nbsp; What that really means, however, is that normalization to 3NF will in most cases mean that a table is normalized to the higher normal forms without further decomposition.&nbsp; It does not mean that normalization
 beyond 3NF is unnecessary.&nbsp; If it's needed it's needed and should be undertaken.&nbsp; You should be comfortable with the concepts of normalization and functional dependency (on which the normal forms are based)&nbsp; if you are going to develop an application of this
 nature which is fit for purpose in a real world working environment.<br />
<br />
However, your question raises other issues.&nbsp; Firstly, do you need to create a separate table at all to store the invoices, or can these be computed at any time from the base data?&nbsp; Normally the latter would be possible if the base tables include the necessary
 columns for this to be done.&nbsp; Moreover it is preferable as to store data which can be derived from other data is generally not a good idea, there being nothing to stop updates to one set of the data or both being made so that they become inconsistent with
 each other.<br />
<br />
 another had 3 copies while the program said he had 9)</span><br />
<br />
When you join tables in a query you get the product of the join, so if there are 2 rows in Table2 which match each row in Table1, there will be two rows returned for each row in for Table1.&nbsp; If you group the query by a column or columns in Table1 and COUNT
 the rows returned per group then the count would be 2, so if each row in Table1 represents some event which you want to count only once you'll get the wrong result.&nbsp; If there are 3 matches in Table2 the count will be 3 of course.&nbsp; If you then join another
 table in the query to the join of the first two, and this has multiple matches with rows in Table2 the count will increase again.&nbsp; So it's a matter of knowing how to write the queries to return the correct results.&nbsp; This might involve including subqueries
 in the query, or it might involve creating several queries and joining them<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want the restricted functionality of a billing system then it can be done if you are confident that you have the necessary competence to develop a robust application in the light of my comments above.&nbsp; On the other hand it will be time consuming and
 likely to take you more time than it would a seasoned professional developer, so would it be cost effective to do it yourself?&nbsp; If you want a fully functional business accounting system, then it makes far more sense to purchase a commercial accounting package.&nbsp;
 Such systems are complex, and you will not be able to reproduce one with MS Access which approaches the functionality of a purpose designed product. &nbsp;<br />

            <p>Thank you to everyone who answered.&nbsp; With your answers I have gotten alot farther.&nbsp; Now I have a full accounting system, up to a point.&nbsp; I have switched all my financial data (constants such as billing rates) into one table &amp; my billable activity (multiple
 occuring events such as hours billed and costs billed) into another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also managed to design a query (or a couple of them) to get me a bill that includes the subtotals for every type of cost and then feed that into another query that gives me the total costs and the subtotals and gives it an invoice number (all of this
 is by date that you enter so I can use it for periodic billing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then that query is an append query that writes the bill and corresponding invoice number for each client to a table that I call "Client Bill Buffer".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Now I need to figure a way to get my Trust Fund (by client) total and send the client bill buffer through it using logic.&nbsp; (so that if the trust fund balance for that client is &gt;0 it will subtract the amount necessary to pay the bill, then write that
 amount to the "Client Bill Buffer 2" and subtract that amount from the Trust fund table as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; I will then have the "Client Bill Buffer 2" send the new Information to a "Client Debt Balance" Table (that tracks how much they owe) and also use the data on this file to write the actual Bill for mailing to the client.&nbsp; Then I need to zero out (delete)
 the amounts listed in the two buffers.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp; I also need to save a copy of all my client bills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to do A?&nbsp; I was thinking about trying to write a macro or VBA.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Any Ideas on B or&nbsp;C?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Any ideas overall on how I might streamline?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for all the help.&nbsp; I wouldnt' have made it this far without people who appreciate sharing knowledge for the sake of knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>re:A) a quick question that may make things easier or not depending on your table structure.&nbsp; Is your Client's Trust fund balance on an individual form for each client?&nbsp; ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client 1 </p>
<p>Client Address</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust DetailID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust (Debit)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust (Credit)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Payments&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Balance....This is a column, but won't fit here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can add a payment to yourself.&nbsp; You may have to create a form called frmClientPayments.</p>
<p>Base it on a table called tblPayments.</p>
<p>an example of the forms Record Source ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;SELECT DISTINCTROW tblCustPayments.* FROM tblCustPayments WHERE ((tblCustPayments.OrderID=forms!frmCustomerOrders!fsubCustomerOrders1.form!OrderID));
</p>
<p>This is an example where your customer Orders may be your invoice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I know I didn't automate the amount for the buffer, but I will show you some code that pertains to receiving the payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the code on the Customer payments form:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_BeforeInsert(Cancel As Integer)</p>
<p>On Error GoTo Err_Form_BeforeInsert<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![CustomerID] = [Forms]![frmCustomerOrders].Form![CustomerID]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![LastNameFirst] = [Forms]![frmCustomerOrders].Form![LastNameFirst]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![PaymentDate] = Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![PaymentAmount] = [Forms]![frmCustomerOrders]![fsubCustomerOrders1].Form![AmountDue]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me![InvoiceNum] = [Forms]![frmCustomerOrders]![fsubCustomerOrders1]![InvoiceNum]<br />
Exit_Form_BeforeInsert:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub</p>
<p>Err_Form_BeforeInsert:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_Form_BeforeInsert<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>This just may give an idea to you.&nbsp; I don't mean for you tochange much.</p>

<p>I want to change/simplify the <strong><em>default email template in</em></strong>
<strong>Outlook 2007</strong> <em><strong>for EVERY message I send</strong></em>, without having to resort to using Plain Text!&nbsp; I have tried creating new templates in Word as someone has suggested&nbsp;(since it "owns" Outlook), changed formatting in an email message
 and tried to make it the default, changed Quick Styles, created new Quick Styles and tried to make&nbsp;one of them to&nbsp;the default, etc., to no avail.&nbsp; THERE'S TOO MANY CHOICES TO CHANGE THAT STUFF!,
<em>so it gets VERY confusing</em>.....<u>more is not always better!</u></p>
<p>Here's what I want:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arial or Calibri 11 or 12 pt. </li><li><strong>NO LINE SPACING or DOUBLE PARAGRAPH SPACING ,EVER! &lt;----VERY IMPORTANT!</strong>
</li><li>Blue TEXT (and&nbsp;for it to&nbsp;stay that way!). </li><li>NO indents, NO Headers= no change anywhere between beginning and end of emails as far as formatting!</li></ul>
<p>If someone could give me EASY steps to get what I want, I would be forever greatful!&nbsp; It's been a real pain in the ***!&nbsp; I've been working on it for months!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            dell km714 wireless keyboard number pad acting funny on Windows 10 Technical Preview for Enterprise. how to fix</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell xps 18 computer that came with an wireless mouse and keyboard dell km714 which is actually built by Logitech. Its a full keyboard with a number pad to the right of the keyboard. The numbers above the alphabet keys work fine, but when i hit
 any number on the numberpad part to the right the alphabet, the numbers do not always register in the field i am typing and the computer computer turns on and off the number lock with every number key i press.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the keyboard does not have any separate on off number lock button anywhere, and keys on the number pad itself does not show any dual functions but are just numbers (you can see in the picture of the keyboard).
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58a96c1a-b477-4070-95d8-1c77b2cd79ee" />t
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems windows registers all the number keys as controlling the number lock and not just as numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example it I hit the number 5, when i hit it the first time i will see a 5 in the field where i am typing that makes me think the number pad works, but also with that first strike of any number i will get a bubble flash on the screen that says "num lock
 on" So if I hit two fives in a row (or any two consecutive numbers in that number pad), the second one will not type into the field i am trying to enter the numbers. but I will just see &nbsp;"number lock off" &nbsp;bubble flash on the screen. so basically it the number
 pad part of the keyboard is useless the way it is working right now. It does not work in any programs or documents, such as the calculator or in any place you could type numbers. every other number you press does not register anything but changing the number
 lock setting</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything re-installing drivers for the keyboard and so on. nothing seems to work. i wonder if there are settings in windows to fix this. I wonder if it is just a problem with windows 10 or if it ismy keyboard.

            I am having the exact same problem! All of the letters work fine, but the 10 key only recognizes every other number. It is so annoying! I've tried everything, but to no avail!

            <p>I tried that, it did not work, it was a good try. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;it was a bit tricky to install in compatibility mode. I do not know if i did it right. I first had to uninstall dell wireless keyboard mouse program and then the drivers were uninstalled from the device manager list. I also uninstalled this unifying keyboard
 and mouse thing too. then unfortunately there was no driver &nbsp;on the dell website and using the screen touch keyboard i was able to search the web and find a driver from dell Australia. So then i tried to install the software in compatibility mode. I think
 it did not work but the Logitech wireless dongle software also was playing some role in the set up and also installed other software and drivers. So I have a total of three different software in the computer now. 1.the Logitech unifying software, 2 the dell
 unifying software (by Logitech) -- which i think is the same thing, and 3. the Logitech set point manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so its really strange and complicated. i think the dongle inside the computer is plugged into an inner usb and is plug and play. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One interesting thing i found is that in the set point manager there is a way to control the settings of the mouse and keyboard. in the keyboards tab of that software there are boxes that can be selected that say "disable caps lock"</p>
<p>"disable windows start key (recommended for gamers only)"</p>
<p>"disable insert key"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and those are all in regular black font</p>
<p>
</p><p>but in a grey background style font there are a few more listing with a check box that is undetectable as if to say these features are not on the keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>they say. "dsable scroll lock key" and </p>
<p>"disable num lock key"</p>
<p>
</p><p>but since it is unclickable and in a light font it looks like this is a feature the software has but it does not detect that feature in the keyboard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>therefore I think this is not a problem with the keyboard and driver but something to do with the way the windows OS thinks this computer number pad has a feature that it does not have. maybe there are not many keyboards that do not have a num lock on and
 off button that do have number keys like this logitech one.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I also have this problem and found by installing Dell OSD software it shows me on screen that every time I try to use the numeric keypad it is toggling Number lock on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the appearance as every second number stroke will actually show a number. In other words, all the numbers are both toggling the the numeric keypad and registering as a number simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be a driver issue.</p>

            <p>thanks, yeah the osd seems to indicate that the # keys are simultaneously acting as a num lock on and off and number,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me know if your able to somehow find and install the correct driver. I do not see older drivers anywhere. The dell website has only one set of drivers for this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately when i got my new XPS 18 computer i immediately did a clean fresh install the windows 10 enterprise technical review (not just an upgrade but a fresh install). So before doing that I did not really test out the windows 8.1 so i did not take
 time to notice any problems with this keyboard when using with the 8.1 os, nor did i look to see what version of driver it had in the device manager with the 8.1 . I assume people with 8.1 are not having any problems with this keyboard or we would know about
 it since there would be a lot of people complaining in web discussion forums. But i do not see any one having issues anywhere. So I assume most people have not done the upgrade or the fresh install from the windows insider program and therefore you and I are
 the only people talking about this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i was on the phone with Dell they say they were going to send me another keyboard just in case to make sure it was not just that my keyboard had a hardware issue. of course i think like you that this is likely a driver or os issue. So I will test that
 keyboard when it comes but if it is the exact same model it probably will have the exact same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since these types of logitech keyboards work with a usb dongle (there is one inside the xps 18) and i also have a extra external dongle because i have a Logitech T650 touchpad that came with the same usb dongle, i should be able to test the keyboard in my
 older windows 7 laptop. I already tried to do this once but the keyboard failed to connect even though the dongle software showed it was recognized. But before i did not manually download the driver into that computer but just let it try to install automatically.
 So when the other keyboard comes i will try again to instill it on my windows 7 laptop. I do not know if the drivers and this keyboard can work at all on windows 7 machine or if it was just made for windows 8.1, but if i can get it to work on my windows 7
 machine that can be a comparison test and then i can see If the number pad does not have the same issue on windows 7 computer as it does in the windows 10 enterprise. &nbsp;If the same driver does not have an issue on windows 7 then the real problem is in the windows
 10 and not just the driver itself, or logitech or microsoft need to create a new driver for windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I also have the KM714 keyboard and wireless mouse on a Dell XPS 2710 computer.</p>
<p>In Windows 10 the both die after about 10-15 minutes into&nbsp;a session.</p>
<p>If I use Safe Mode they both works for any length of time!</p>
<p>There was a tips on the timeout for suspension or hibernate could cause the malfunction and I have changed to the Performance setting&nbsp;in the Power options&nbsp;at no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the doubledigit scheme on the KM714 numerical keypad.... When I log in with a number sequence I have to hit every key twice....</p>
        </p>

            <p>thanks I think the more people report this problem the more Dell or windows will figure out how to solve it. I actually really love the keyboard (even with the nub pad problem) it types great. i wonder for those who have keyboards dying if you have a clean
 install of windows 10 or just installed windows 10 by upgrading the 8.1. I did a clean install of the windows 10 with the enterprise version. my keyboard does not die and stays connected fine. Just the nub keys have issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell tech and I have been exchanging emails on this. They think it is a driver issue. But there is only one driver i can find for this keyboard anywhere anyhow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem with the numerical pad (every other key has to be stuck twice cause of number lock going on and off) does not change when i boot into safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone for your replies. Keep on chiming in if you have the same or similar issues or suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

            For the person chiming in on that it works with 8.1. much appreciation for sharing that !!!!! since it helps us narrow down the issue to our windows 10 install!!!&nbsp;

<h3> xenithpocknell  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Family needs to be set up before you can get this app issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just got the Nokia Lumia 635 today, and have enjoyed setting it up. However there is one issue, whenever I attempt to download or update any apps from the microsoft store, a message appears:</p>
<p>'My Family needs to be set up before you can get this app. Ask a parent to go to windowsphone.com/family on their computer, sign in with their Microsoft account, and set up My Family.'</p>
<p>The problem is, the microsoft account I use for all my devices, I am the parent and the administrator of the family settings, and I have no one else who uses any other devices. I read in a few places (I have researched this issue almost all day) that I need
 to update my billing information and all my other information. I have updated all my billing information, and have put in all the other details, including age, location, etc.</p>
<p>I have struggled with this issue all day and it is starting to get very frustrating, if anyone has a way to resolve it please reply.</p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>

                    <p>I am running Windows 2010 with Microsoft Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I recently learned of the conditional formatting ability for color coding appointments as they appear on my calendar.&nbsp; I've gone through the instructions several times and established conditions.&nbsp; When
 I jump into my email and then come back to my calendar they're gone.&nbsp; It works on everyone else's machines. I can't figure out if I need to reset myself somehow.

                    <p>My father is using Nokia 620 in India. &nbsp;Because of some software update he lost all the data, &nbsp;especially few his retirement party pics. Is there any way we can get the pics from the software?&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one is able to help him there. If there is anyone who could fix this and being the pics back I am ready to get the phone mailed here and also pay for who ever who could fix this</p>

<p>I can't figure out how to delete either email account.&nbsp; When I open up messaging and go to either the comcast or comcast POP account I then go to menu&gt;tools&gt;options&nbsp;I get a list&nbsp;as follows 1 messages, 2 outlook email, 3 comcast, 4 email sample, 5 new account.&nbsp;
 When I click on comcast account, the first screen asks for my email address &gt;next&nbsp;&nbsp; your name and account display name (which says comcast and is greyed out) &gt;next&nbsp;&nbsp; incoming mail server and account type (POP and is also greyed out )&gt;next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; username and password
 &gt;next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outgoing mail server &gt;next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; automatic send/receive and down load messages &gt;next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; messages format and download limit &gt;finish.&nbsp; If I change any of the non-greyed fields (such as email address, incoming mail server, username or password) it won't

<p>OK, to delete an account, try this:</p>

<p>When this screen appears, use the toggle button and scroll to the account you want to delete so it is highlighted</p>
<p>Now click on the Menu key and you should see the a popup menu with Options and Delete.&nbsp; Choose Delete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked your domain name and I got the same result as Johan_d. Please verify if you registered before the domain name to other Microsoft services like Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

            Hi Judith_C.
<div><br />
<div>Yes it's currently used on Microsoft Office 365 but I would like to migrate from that to Microsoft Outlook hence attempting to register here.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I cancel that to allow me to register here then that will mean that there will be a space of time when no e-mail can be delivered hence I need to get an account setup here before cancelling Microsoft Office 365.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please can you provide a solution on how I can do this?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />

<p>We regret to inform you that since you currently use the domain name&nbsp;in office 365, we recommend that you may end your subscription first and re register your domain name&nbsp;to our support admin domain&nbsp;before you can migrate to Microsoft Outlook.</p>

    <title>Sync External Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexis_kinter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync External Drive</h2>
                    <p>I have OneDrive for business and on setting up, I pointed to an external drive. Some time later (after logging out) I (or Microsoft) somehow setup my personal Onedrive on the machine. This personal shows up in the taskbar. Also, a Onedrive folder was created
 in the Users path. Also the business shows in the taskbar, but shows "Sync a new library" and when I choose the external drive, I get "Sorry, we can't save your documents to the chosen location. Plese try picking a different place on your computer".</p>
<p>So, I want to</p>
<p>1. delete the personal<br />
2. delete the local (non-external) Users path folder<br />
3. get the external drive sync to work.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p><span>2.Run the following command to set the sync client restriction:</span></p>

            I think it is to conserve battery life. The camera probably uses a fair bit of power so when it isn't used for X ammount of seconds it goes into standby. This is to save the power bars.

<p>Sorry but your first sentence is flawed, invalidating your argument. The start screen was not praised by a majority i believe, I believe you are the minority. This is an opinion and that only, nothing more.</p>

            <p>Regardless of who was in the majority or minority, the issue is moot.&nbsp; In Win 10 you can boot to&nbsp;a revised&nbsp;start menu or to the WIn 8 style start screen.&nbsp; I am currently trying both.&nbsp; I too preferred the Start Screw in Win 8 but do understand why some would

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody is being forced to do anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 gives you the ability to use either the Start Menu <strong>OR</strong> the Start Screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click the Taskbar and select Properties / Start Menu tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first option is to <strong><span><span style="font-weight: bold">Use the Start Menu instead of the Start Screen.</span></span></strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 and windows 8.1 has brought about a revolution in computing that it gave persons a unique user interface that was met with praises and with concerns. For two years Microsoft had worked hard to let persons adapt to&nbsp; this new interface called the
 start screen which if you took time to learn it you realize that it was better than the start menu. It was not perfect but it was better and for those who bought a touch screen laptop it made many buy new PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 microsoft is not moving forward but taking a step back, bring back the start menu because a minority does not want to to leave the era of the start menu and move forward. This is a bad move consumer wise as consumers are finally getting to
 understand windows 8 and 8.1 interface just for microsoft to change it back, this does not spell good and can lead to a vista like scenario, and with microsoft having to compete with Apple and Google. Windows need to stick to its path and move forward with
 the start screen not a start menu. </p>
<p>

<p>Totally agree with you. I'm working with the new Start Menu, but it is a step backward for those us who have learned how to use the Start Screen. Happily, Microsoft has given us a choice back to the Start Menu which is wise. However, the other elements of
 Window are missing like charms. The charms functionality is now integrated into the app menu option identified with 3 dots. I liked the charms because it was always available regardless of whether you were giving you quick access to PC Settings, devices, etc.
 Now you have to go back to using the old control panel. Hopefully, I would like to see the return of the Charms.</p>

    <title>Installing a game on Nokia Lumia 520 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eugensfirlos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing a game on Nokia Lumia 520</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm having trouble installing an app I just bought from the Store.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've bought Asphalt 8 from the Store and tried to install it several times already.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The game has a ~900 MB requirement, my phone has 2.1 GB of free space -&gt; trying to install from the phone will result in a 'not enough storage' error message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also tried to push the game from the PC to the phone -&gt; it downloaded then it gave the same error while installing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My last solution was to install it manually from my SD card so I downloaded the .xap file and put it on my SD Card - now the app doesn't appear in the SD card option from the store (have 2 apps there, one is PVZ and it is there and the other is A8 and
 it's missing).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea what could be the cause of this?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Unable to add members in shared mailboxes  on Microsoft 365 admin center.</h2>
                    <p>Under Groups/Shared mailboxes then select a mailbox under members it keeps trying to lead members, but&nbsp;unable to do&nbsp;so.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1e12b2f-60bd-4b29-bba2-b57a7f9560ac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1e12b2f-60bd-4b29-bba2-b57a7f9560ac?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above&nbsp;figure shows no members as the Edit on the right is greyed out, and the list of members&nbsp;says "please wait"&nbsp;</p>
<p>This glitch does not let me add or remove the members of the shared mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>Somehow the other mailboxes with fewer members&nbsp;from 5-20 work fine, but this specific one that has 35 members&nbsp;does not load the members&nbsp;it keeps saying "please wait".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of a working shared&nbsp;mailbox, where I can click on edit and add members.</p>

<p>Hi F.Tocilla,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand when you click a shared mailbox in Office 365 Admin center, the members of the mailbox keep loading and you cannot click Edit button since it grey out, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, it does need some time to load your members if there are many members in your shared mailbox, it also depends on your network environment. Please keep waiting for loading members. If you have to wait up for several minutes and still cannot get
 the members, please try to change another network environment and browser to check the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since I guess you want to edit members in the shared mailbox, you can go to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange admin center</a>&nbsp;with your admin credential and go to
<strong>recipients</strong> &gt; <strong>shared</strong> &gt; double click the shared mailbox you want to modify &gt;
<strong>mailbox delegation</strong>, you can add or remove members there. If you want to remove someone, you need to remove the account both from
<strong>Full Access</strong> and <strong>Send As</strong> lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right, grey out cannot add/remove members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been dealing with office365 help desk&nbsp;and it seems that is not a known bug. Microsoft&nbsp;does not have a fix yet, so I decided to write here and see if anyone had the same issue.</p>
<p>I let the admin center under the member for hours but it does not work, also I tried a different&nbsp;browser but still no luck.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I will try a different&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I have been working for know is the way you suggested, by going to Exchange admin center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Tanks not a fix yet. I will keep you posted. Thanks..</p>

            Yes, but with third part software. Install one of the free ones: autolock.sis or mlock.sis.

            Why is this amazing? I've never, ever used the auto keylock on any of my previous phones. Occasionally when I'm going to put the phone in my pocket I'll hit the manual lock. I couldn't stand picking my phone up and finding it locked all the time, that
 would irritate the hell out of me!

            Horses for courses, I've seen plenty of threads asking about this so it is obviously a fature that most people find useful. It was included on many previous Nokias I've owned so why drop it ?

            It hasn't exactly been dropped, as it has never been part of S60 (Series 60) based phones (from the first 7650 until any that have been made available until today).

            I have looked at autolock.sis and the other one but it does not seem to be for the N73. Please can you advise me.<br />

            There is always the option of setting the autolock:<br />
<br />
menu .. tools .. settings .. security .. Phone and Sim ..<br />
<br />
Then set Autolock period to whatever number of minutes you require and provide a lock code (one you're not going to forget!)

            Thanks petrib,<br />
<br />
I am always nervous changing or adding software. Could you tell me how one unlocks the keypad please? is it the normal top and bottom left hand keys or do you have to put in a password? If he latter it could be a nuisance.<br />

    <title>How to play videos over a Skype call&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to play videos over a Skype call&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am taking Spanish lessons over Skype (I am a desktop user), and my Spanish teacher usually likes to give me videos to watch. However, I am forced to use subtitles because I can barely hear the audio from the video, since it seems that the call is overriding
 it. It's really frustrating and sometimes the videos do not provide any subtitles, and the robot ones are awful. Is there any way that I can make the audio from the YouTube video louder so then I can hear it? Thx</p>
