<h2>            How do I access my outlook &#47; Office 365 in Skype</h2>
                    <p>I have had this new Windows 10 Skype and it seems to be a big step backwards. Aside from the UI being totally opaque - you can't find any of the functions you need it seems it does not connect with my Outlook contacts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is really incredible since the whole stated aim is that this version "is fully integrated with your Windows 10 experience". Oh no its not. Its a weird application which seems to live in a no mans land of being low on features and at the same time manages
 to be difficult to use. Now thats a feat!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So back to the question - how do I access my outlook contacts in Skype?</p>

<p>Hello Phil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know the "Windows 10 Skype" means the regular Skype app in the Windows or the Skype for Business client installed in Windows 10?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your reference: </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Do I have Skype or Skype for Business?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/do-i-have-skype-or-skype-for-business-997e00a7-4a6c-4733-87c1-7d8addd11ab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/do-i-have-skype-or-skype-for-business-997e00a7-4a6c-4733-87c1-7d8addd11ab0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, in Skype for Business client, we need find the users in the Search bar, and then add these valid users to Skype for Business contact list manually. Or, you can search the name of the distribution
 groups (DGs), and add all members in those DGs to Skype for Business contact list at one time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstanding, please feel free to let us know at your convenience.</p>

    <title>Lost My Preview Version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrischefney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost My Preview Version</h2>
                    <p>Background Info First:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up for the Insider's Program...&nbsp; and installed the preview build on my computer and played around with it.&nbsp; When the regular Windows 10 Upgrade was released..&nbsp; instead of continuing with my Preview Version, I upgraded my Windows 7 to Windows 10
 and didn't think I would need the Preview Version anymore so I discarded my original "Preview ISO" and the serial key I was given.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old laptop I was using that currently has Windows XP on it.&nbsp; I wanted to install the Preview Version on that laptop but I can't seem to be able to do that.&nbsp; I can NOT use the regular Windows 10 ISO because it does not accept the generic "Preview
 Serial Key" posted around the internet.&nbsp; I read that people who did sign up for the Insider's Program were allowed to install that version on any of their computers, regardless of O/S it currently has.&nbsp; So I'm wondering exactly what would be the procedure
 for me to install the Insiders Beta Version onto my laptop without the ISO I originally downloaded?&nbsp; The email I was sent to download it is no longer valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case anyone was wondering... I'm STILL A MEMBER of the Insider's Program...&nbsp;

            <p>This was all changed in mid July last year when a bunch tried to join the insiders just to get the free upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Even Insiders had to have a qualifying OS to get the free upgrade. </p>
<p>It was also later changed that the software was no longer activated but if you upgraded properly your computer became activated and you could change the RAM and the Hard drive and still be activated but if you changed the motherboard it became a new computer
 and you had to upgrade from an activated Windows 7 or 8.1 installation or had an activated key to use when installing the second release to the public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as reinstalling on a wiped hard drive,&nbsp; You can do that with the Media Creation Tool or a boot-able USB or DVD
</p>
<p>created by the tool or another ISO.&nbsp; This is called a clean install.&nbsp; The hard drive can be put into a fully activated computer and become activated but will not be activated if put into a none activated computer.</p>

<h2>            Cant Enter Desktop &#47; Stuck at login Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, I recently updated the windows 10 technical preview to the most recent build. I have a huge problem with it right now. My laptop is stuck at the login page. When I click on my account on the bottom left, it just expands to the middle of the screen
 and does not login. I did not set any password for my account. The computer just stays that way with my account and picture in the middle of the screen, and doesnt login. I cant enter my desktop, so I cant even try to restore factory settings. Can anyone help
 me? Either help me with a way to fix the bugged login or perhaps help me figure out a way to restore factory settings. (Spamming F8 while starting up the laptop didnt work)

<h2>            Sharing calendars with security groups</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook 2011 with Exchange 2010 and would like to share my calendar with an Exchange global security group. In Entourage 2008, one could right-click a calendar, select "Sharing", click "Add User", then the "Advanced" button to enter a security
 group. In Outlook 2011, the "Advanced" button is no longer there. Can anyone tell me how to share with a global security group?<br />
<br />

Thanks, Cody. I can get to that point without a problem; the issue is that once I get there, the "Advanced" button that used to appear in Entourage, which would enable you to specify a security group, is gone. I've tried entering the group name in the User
 field using the syntax "domain\group", but it doesn't work. I've searched quite a bit and haven't found any info online.<br />

<h2>            Unable to delete Section Break in Word for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am going slowly insane trying to get rid of a Section Break in Word for Mac. The instruction to double click on it only brings up the Document dialogue box. In it the Page Setup box brings up a box with Page Attributes and Microsoft Word as the only two
 options. &nbsp;Neither offer any solution. &nbsp;I've tried to delete everything between the two chapters, then Insert a Page Break. &nbsp;All that happens is that it inserts both a Page Break AND a Section Break.</p>
<p>I've googled all over the place with no result.<br />
Any help here... please...</p>

<p>Hi, Phillip,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. &nbsp;Unfortunately I can't see the whole page on YouTube, so I don't know what you're referring to. &nbsp;I have finally managed to select Section Break, not by double clicking on it, but by left clicking over on the extreme left, and pressing
 Delete. &nbsp;Don't know why I didn't think of this earlier. Getting old... &nbsp;However, in my defence, the Section Break was usually on the same line as the end of the text. &nbsp;It was only when I added another return that it became available for selection.</p>
<p>Hugely relieved that the problem is solved.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to change screenlock background on c7&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I have a nokia c7 phone, and I would like to change the background for the screen that requires you to enter the lock code. The background for the screen is currently all grey where it says "lockcode: and then a numpad for entering the lock code. It's
 not as simple as changing the wallpaper, because that only changes the background for when the phone is unlocked. Well, hopefully some of you will know how to do it. Thank you in advance.

            That screen is linked to the theme you are using. So using different themes will change the colour of it.<br />
<br />
It's not possible to customise it with wallpapers.

            Thank you psychomania, but what I really wanted to do was to customize it. I found a phone the other day, but because it was screenlocked, I had to wait for the owners to call that phone. That got me thinking that customizing the screenlock background
 and adding contact information is a good idea, but seems like it isn't possible.

            You would have to open ports in your network and know your IP. Look at the documentation for whatever app you're using and the manual of your router to achieve this.<br />

<h2>            Auto Text in Word</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Word 2016 (Office 365) on Windows 10. I haven't used Auto Text for a while, but it seems to me it used to be easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a composite symbol with Unicode characters, and I'd like to be able to insert it easily in documents. In the past, when you typed the first few letters of an auto text entry, you would automatically be prompted to insert it by pressing Enter. That
 does not seem to work now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can find to insert an auto text is to: Go to Insert &gt; Click Building Blocks &gt; Click Building Block Organizer &gt; Find the entry in the list &gt; Select it &gt; Click Insert. (And that leaves out the part where each time I open the Organizer I have
 to resize the Name column in order to read it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone can tell me there's a better way.</p>

<p>AutoText in Word 2016 is at least as robust as it was in Word 2003. The AutoComplete feature that let you press Enter to insert was deprecated with Word 2007 and partially restored with Word 2010. Word 2013 brought it back so that AutoText stored in any
 loaded template could use AutoComplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always type the first (four or more) unique characters of the name and press F3 to insert.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Are you sure you are not thinking of AutoCorrect which simply inserts without any prompt?
</em></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, also, attach a keyboard shortcut to any AutoText entry. I would recommend storing that shortcut in the same template that holds the AutoText. You'll need to know the name of the AutoText entry.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>SweetIM is not exactly a virus but more correct this is a potentially unwanted program (PUP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, open Control Panel -&gt; Programs and features</p>
<p>Find SweetIM and attempt to uninstall it.</p>
<p>After the process is finished, reboot.</p>
<p>At the end, try with AdwCleaner. Download it from Softpedia <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/Removal-Tools/AdwCleaner.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/Removal-Tools/AdwCleaner.shtml</a>&nbsp;, start the program and use the "delete" option. It will scan for and delete adware or PUP files, folders and leftovers .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative removal procedure:<br />

<blockquote>i want to know what is the formula used in PMT function and PMT function use 360 days convention or 365 days convention</blockquote>
<br />
The formula for PMT is basically the formula that appears in the PV help page.&nbsp; Solving for PMT with signed cash flows and rate &lt;&gt; 0:<br />
<br />
PMT = -(pv*(1+rate)^nper + fv) * rate / ((1+rate)^nper - 1) / (1+rate*type)<br />
<br />
PMT makes no distinction between 360-day and 365-day convention.&nbsp; Instead, it assumes "nper"
<br />
If you are trying to find equal payments to amortize a loan over unequal periods, for example the actual days of each month, you cannot use the PMT function.<br />
<br />
First, you must look at the applicable regulations for your region to see how to compute and use the daily interest rate.&nbsp; In the US, the annual interest rate would be divided by 365 (not 366 for leap years), then multiplied (not compounded) by the number of
 days between scheduled payments.<br />
<br />
Then you could set up an amortization schedule for the complete term of the loan and use Solver to discover the payment.<br />
<br />
However, that payment will depend on the precise payment due dates.<br />
<br />
For example, consider a 15-year 100,000 loan at 4% annual interest rate with payments due on the 1st of the month.<br />
<br />
Assuming 12 equal payments per year, PMT returns about 739.69.<br />
<br />
But assuming a daily simple interest rate of 4%/365, Solver finds a payment of about 739.91 if the loan starts on July 1 2011, but about 739.87 if it starts on Aug 1 2011.<br />
<br />
Note that if we used the result from PMT, the ending balance would be about 55.02 or 43.89 respectively, not zero.<br />
<br />
(Computed payments were not rounded, as they must be in real life.&nbsp; Solver sometimes gets confused when amounts are rounded.&nbsp; Rounding payments to the cent changes the ending balance by -0.93 to 0.36.)<br />

<p>Project 2010 Pro.&nbsp; I have a relatively large Master Project with several Sub-projects.&nbsp; I am getting circular reference errors when I try to indent tasks.&nbsp; Some of these are brand new tasks following brand new tasks, which are at the highest level and have
 no links.&nbsp; When I copied the tasks out into a new project, everything worked fine.&nbsp; Has my project gotten corrupted??&nbsp; I do have linked Summary Tasks, as this allows me to collapse further &amp; see the links.&nbsp; Is this going to cause me long term grief??</p>

<p>Potima,</p>
<p>Let me answer you last question first. Yes, it is already causing you grief. Links on summary lines are the number one cause of circular references. The best advice is, do not do it.</p>
<p>Project does allow links on summary lines and they can work in limited scenarios, but, using them requires a very hight level of discipline and a whole lot of experience with Project.</p>
<p>The problem with links on summary lines is that there are often links to summary line subtasks and those links may go to subtasks under other summary lines. Then when the user indents or outdents, the subtask links start conflicting with the summary links
 and boom! Circular references. And this effect is multiplied in a master/subproject file structure. So you have a "double whammy".</p>
<p>Your files probably are not corrupt, they are simply in need of some restructuring.&nbsp;My suggestion is this, carefully restructure your files to eliminate all links on summary lines. Then let us know if you still have a problem.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; My understanding is that Silverlight is not required to get the features you seek in the Xbox Music application.&nbsp; With that said I would like to focus on the regional setting of both your account and your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;verify the location of your computer.&nbsp; You can do this by opening your charm bar and typing "Control Panel" in the search box.&nbsp; Click the control panel icon that appears.&nbsp; From here go to "clock, language and region &gt; select the change location option.&nbsp;
 The current regional setting of your PC will be displayed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I would like to verify the regional setting of your account.&nbsp; Please sign into your account at
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a>.&nbsp; Once signed in click on MY ACCOUNT &gt; payment and billing &gt; billing info. &gt; you should see the country associated with your account below the address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be interested to know if you have a different experience when you create a new local account on your PC,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</a>.&nbsp; Once you have created the new account sign out of the current account and into the new profile.&nbsp; Review the look of the Xbox Music application.&nbsp; After you have

<h2>            I keep forgetting to set my Out of Office&#33;&#33;&#33; Heeelllpp</h2>
                    <p>Hi all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i know this this seems silly but when I am scheduled to go out of the off the next day I forget to set it. Now I need something more than a pop up reminder, I need an add on or plugin for my calendar that will pop up a message triggered by me logging off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically I need an if else or something saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF Out of Office on [date]</p>
<p>ON log out or shut down</p>
<p>Pop up or prevent shutdown before setting out if office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there here a way to accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you in advance for all your help</p>

            <p>I can't think of any addins that do that, but Outlook 2010 and 2013 let you set the OOF up ahead fo time - if you normally set it every evening, when you come in to work and turn it off, you can set it up for the evening at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

The macro will set it in Outlook 2007
 and 2003, but I don't think it will set it in Outlook 2010. It will ask if you remembered to set it though.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Power Point Notes Prints Blank Page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stf1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Point Notes Prints Blank Page</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with a power point slide deck. The deck contains 28 slides of which some contain notes. When I try to print the notes, the preview panel only shows a single blank page (instead of the usual notes pages). Printing then obviously results
 in the same. I've tried various things to fix, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm attaching a screenshot of how this looks like. I've also redacted all the private information, though. I hope it's still visible what's the problem here for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi stf1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your query in this community.</p>
<p>I have performed the test on my side with MacOS Mojave 10.14.4 &amp; PowerPoint 16.24 190414. Unfortunately, I could not reproduce this issue on my side. Please check my image below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42546767-69df-4413-87e1-49e4cb0c5899?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42546767-69df-4413-87e1-49e4cb0c5899?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that in your screenshot, you have 28 slides in this presentation, and you selected print All slides, but the under the preview panel, it's still 1 of 1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In this kind of scenario, to help us narrow down the issue, please check my following suggestions:</p>
<p>1.Click on the Print, will the Notes be exported to PDF<span>&nbsp;
</span>without issue?</p>
<p>2.In the print Layout, could you switch to the other options, and will the preview appear?</p>
<p>3.Create a new presentation, and check if the preview panel is still blank out.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Chen</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue only happens on this very same slide deck. All other decks are fine and notes print as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your notes:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The print and export to PDF results in the same empty page visible in the preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Other options work fine (I tested Handouts, Outline, and Slides)</p>
<p>3. New presentations don't have this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get the Notes to print with a lot of shuffling slides around between presentations. I'm not sure what exactly did the trick in the end, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I did keep a copy of the broken deck. I'll send it to you as a PM.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates in the private message, we have successfully received your sample presentation. Please don't worry, the sample will be only used for test and will be not shared to others under any circumstance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that I could reproduce this issue with both PowerPoint for Mac version 16.24 &amp; insider version.</p>
<p>Also, I assume this issue should be raised by the page 8,9,10,26 in your slide show. Because, when I was changing the print slide range. If these 4 slides are in the print rage, the print preview will be blank out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't identify the root cause of this issue. Will do more test and let you know the result.</p>

<p>I appreciate the update. As of the moment, what you mentioned could be possible. Let's isolate it further. Just for added clarification, have you already tried running
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17472/windows-internet-explorer-11-fix-site-display-problems-compatibility-v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Internet Explorer on Compatibility mode</a></strong>? By doing so, this will eliminate the
 possibility of the website being compatible to certain versions of browsers as some websites are dependent on browser versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that this still doesn't let you access the website your trying to visit, I suggest that you perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset on your Internet Explorer</a></strong>. This is to ensure that no cache and cookies are a factor and same
 with any possible plugins or addons are a factor of the hindrance in accessing the website. Prior to performing this, it would be best to

 even after a reset.</p>

<h2>            History  tab shows blank for  Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Dehradun</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Security Essentials appears to be installed and updating fine - and I'm not aware of any threats which have slipped through. But when I tab to History for any allowed, quarantined or detected items, it always comes up blank. Should I be concerned?
 And I would like to see what it's doing ...</p>

 Consolidated FAQ</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My tabs are blank as well. &nbsp;I installed MSE on this computer when I bought it in December 2013, tested MSE with Eicar to be sure it was working, cleared the history and it has yet to identify an issue anywhere. &nbsp;Occasional scans with MalwareBytes Free have
 also not identified malware so I'm satisfied MSE is doing its job.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MSE is concerned with prevention and detection of malware.&nbsp; Remember that tracking cookies are not malware and MSE does not identify cookies like some antimalware programs do.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since MSE is not identifying any "threats" and your history is clear it sounds like you are practicing good surfing habits and are limiting your exposure to malware. Keep up the good work.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you want to test MSE, go to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.rexswain.com/eicar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.rexswain.com/eicar.html</span></a>&nbsp;and test it on an Eicar file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">FWIW I recommend your default actions for MSE be set to quarantine suspected malware.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/whats-the-difference-between-remove-and-quarantine/0b8ba9f6-5682-4880-b6c9-62940c2a150e"><span style="color: rgba(104, 33, 122, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/whats-the-difference-between-remove-and-quarantine/0b8ba9f6-5682-4880-b6c9-62940c2a150e</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On this computer that I'm using MSE is not set to do any scheduled scans...I prefer an "occasional" manual scan.&nbsp; I think routine scanning is a bit overrated but others don't share my view.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And here is an excerpt from a previous&nbsp;post by MSE Forum Moderator&nbsp;<strong><span>Stephen Boots</span></strong>&nbsp;reference scans that sums it up quite well:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. A periodic quick scan will check the common locations for the presence of malware.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. A full scan will scan all local drives for any traces of malware</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Typically, you do not need to perform a full scan.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Real time protection is monitoring activity and file access on your PC, so if you attempt to open an infected file, it should detect the infection and stop you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A full scan is very time consuming and disk intensive. If you wish to perform a clean scan periodically, go for it. I rarely run one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your best defense is not scanning, but preventing infection in the first place:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In addition to MSE or other up to date antivirus software:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In Internet Explorer, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that&nbsp;User Account Control (UAC) ON&nbsp;&nbsp;and not running with elevated privileges.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available
 updates.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Never open unsolicited email attachments.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Practice safe web browsing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And I’ve never had any desire or need to review any technical logs of what MSE is doing (what files it is scanning, etc) so I can’t give any advice on that topic if that’s what you’re interested in.&nbsp; If so, add a second post to
 this thread specifically requesting that information and hopefully one of the more technically oriented users of the forum can tell you how and where to find the logs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Regards….</span></p>
