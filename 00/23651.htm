<h2>            Shared mailbox  - Exchange hybrid</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are currently testing the Exchange online service in a pilot project before we start the actual migration project. We have an Exchange 2016 server onPrem with hybrid connectivity configured. The latest version of ad connect is installed.</p>
<p>We have read alot of problem that can occour when you move a mailbox to EXO and then convert it to a shared mailbox, it reverts back to a normal regual mailbox etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2710029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2710029</a></p>
<p>We cannot reproduce this in our lab. Is this still a issuse with shared mailboxes? We have alot of shared mailboxes configured in various ways and if possible we don't want to modfy them before the migration.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>UC</p>

<p>Hi UC,</p>
<p>I have also done some tests in my Hybrid environment. I cannot reproduce this either. But it could be a potential issue since the mailboxes are migrated from on-premises and then converted to shared mailboxes in Exchange online, after that, directory synchronization
 replicates the attributes to the cloud and overwrites them. So, it is recommended that you have shared mailboxes on on-premises and then move them to Exchange online.

<p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent changes made on the computer are one of the usual reasons why a specific options suddenly disappears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the root cause of the issue, we need the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you perform any changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the last location where you saw the options?</li><li>Are you accessing the features on Windows settings? (As shown on the picture below.)

<p>
</p><p>OR... since everyone seems to think that Microsoft will not be producing mobile phone hardware anymore, if that is true, it would be nice if they would say so. And if they are not going to make their own phones with Windows 10 Mobile then PLEASE make the
 OS work on phones like Samsung 8 and 8+.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still people like myself that do NOT want to have to use Android or iOS even if we really would like a dozen or so of the apps that are available in those ecosystems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As ciaran1 said, being able to run a few Android apps would be great. I couldn't care less about Pokémon and even SnapChat, but the Smart Home industry is growing hugely and the few manufacturers that wrote Windows apps for their devices (Samsung, DLink,
 etc.) are all dropping those apps - and not all of them have web interfaces and, if they do have a web interface, it doesn't give you access to all of the fancy features in the apps like geofencing on Arlo as one example (or even the ability to view your Arlo
 camera live due to no Flash support in W10 Mobile)..&nbsp; Eventually people *will* jump ship to have the convenience of an app for their Netgear Arlo cameras, Samsung SmartThings hubs, WeMo and Phillips stuff, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't make us go to Android or iOS. &nbsp; Let us know W10 Mobile has an active future... or not.&nbsp; If yes, let us know which manufacturers you are actively working with to have their hardware apps available... or not.&nbsp; And if you aren't going
 to product that elusive Surface Phone, let us know and tell us that you will be selling other top spec phones like Samsung Galaxy 8 that will actually be running W10 Mobile, not just preloaded MS apps. &nbsp; Or tell us we need to make our own way in future without
 MS in our pocket.&nbsp; Just tell us, please.&nbsp;</p>

            I received a letter from OnStar that GM is not supporting Windows Phones. I had the service manager ask GM why and the reply from GM was that Microsoft had informed GM that Microsoft would not be making Windows Phones any longer. I too would like to know

<p>I received the letter concerning the OnStar Mylink app as I use it for my Volt.&nbsp; This app in fact is supposed to go away everywhere, replaced with the MyChevrolet, MyBuick, MyGMC and MyCadillac apps that now exist on Android (at least; I don't know about
 iOS).&nbsp; Fortunately the MyVolt web site works fine in Edge on Windows 10 Mobile and provides everything I need to see (e.g. charging status) and do (remotely unlock the doors, etc.) except for the location of the Volt.&nbsp; When I need that, I fire up my Android
 emulator on my Windows 10 PC and launch the app there.&nbsp; The MyChevrolet app works the same as the MyLink app with a different look and feel.</p>

<p>I was a long time supporter of Windows efforts to innovate a seamless desktop-mobile-console experience.That being said...the hoops Microsoft made firms jump though to have their apps available in the Windows Phone Store was nothing but a massive headache
 for me 90% of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gradually lost faith in Microsoft's ability to produce a phone worth buying. The latest versions were lack luster in the end. I would take a beat up 1520 over the 950 any day. I'm really sad to say that I was expecting an 'upgraded' version of my
 previous phone when I bought it, and felt it was a worse cell phone, with the same crumby app store available (even worse when it initially released)...the file system may be Microsoft's only competitive advantage at this point..and even that is nearly useless
 without apps to utilize it productively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I understand that Microsoft cannot force companies to put time and money into producing apps for the WP, but they must have noticed the awful PR caused by such low developer support, and who would blame them for not spending time to make
 apps for WP when they represent an insignificant portion of the market??? </p>
<p>
</p><p>FFS, If I had a dime for every time I had to explain to somebody why I can't get a &nbsp;particular app....I would have just enough dimes to go buy a Samsung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Windows is the only one to blame here, and I'm tired of defending them for being consistently behind the mark. I still think they have a lot of
<span>user-friendly</span>&nbsp;perks over the Apple, and I think WP is much more intuitive which is great... but Samsung has been a breath of fresh air in a whoole lot of ways. Sad to see the WP go, but I really hope to never see them go
 after this type of market again unless they put a lot more thought into it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For anybody looking for an alternative:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So far the experience with the S7 Edge has blown me away with a lot of thoughtful, productive, 'time saving' features which Windows was never even close to. In fact, I think the Samsung has an even better chance to get that seamless
 connection of desktop/phone/console than windows had, since they have Samung Internet + the VR. ((The Samsung Internet isn't amazing...BUT, this is all worth the $$$ with the strong 3rd party developer base actively working on expanding the VR Store, which
 is pretty empty rn.) The development of VR Sideload + Streamtheater which streams your PC Desktop over WiFi to the Phone screen in VR..basically making a giant monitor in the headset that can be adjusted to play 3D etc.... theres a lot of promise that is being
 shown with these apps i think, and other 3rd party developers are going to drive the Samsung success in the future..&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the Rant</span></p>

            I agree. Either unblock the phone and let us install android and use the device as an android phone or open to apps.<br />
I have a Lumia 950, I love it, but I can't use it.

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>Here can be two answers, first is total "Days" where month and year deducted, and second is all days without deducted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First Solution:</p>
<p>In H4 cell "Total Days": =DATEDIF($A$2,INDEX($A:$A,COUNTA($A:$A)),"MD")</p>
<p>In H5 cell "Total Months": =DATEDIF($A$2,INDEX($A:$A,COUNTA($A:$A)),"YM")</p>
<p>In H6 cell "Total Years": =DATEDIF($A$2,INDEX($A:$A,COUNTA($A:$A)),"Y")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second Solution:</p>
<p>In H4 cell "Total Days": =DATEDIF($A$2,INDEX($A:$A,COUNTA($A:$A)),"D")</p>
<p>In H5 cell "Total Months": =DATEDIF($A$2,INDEX($A:$A,COUNTA($A:$A)),"M")</p>
<p>In H6 cell "Total Years": =DATEDIF($A$2,INDEX($A:$A,COUNTA($A:$A)),"Y")</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you add more dates it will automatically calculate the day month year which you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help you.</p>

            The page displays fine on my phone. Now, I do not read or write Chinese, but the site does display correctly when comparing to what I see in IE9 or Chrome.

<p>I may have been in the boat as you .&nbsp; I was failing to install after about 17728.&nbsp; I kept trying to install each release but failure.&nbsp; 2 builds back, without doing anything I got an install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just this week I got a normal install on the latest release so I seem to be back to normal without doing an internal change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get a new check for updates, I likely do a Shutdown and a Re-start to get ahead of the old updates and work on the latest.</p>
<p>

    <title>Save .docx as .doc Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stage coach  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save .docx as .doc Problem</h2>
                    I developed a document in Word 2010 and saved it as a .docx file - 257Kb in size.&nbsp; I then saved it as a .doc file - the size increased to 3,237 Kb.&nbsp; The file contains a few pages of text, with the vast majority being a table for data collection.&nbsp; Is there
 a way to save the .docx version as a .doc file, while maintaining the same size file?&nbsp;

            <p>The reason that .docx files are so much smaller than .doc files is that a .docx file is actually a .zip file whose extension has been changed to .docx. In other words, it has been compressed.</p>
<p>A .doc file is not compressed, so it takes up more space than the equivalent .docx file.</p>
<p>But 3,237 Kb is very large for a document containing only a few pages. Does it contain pictures, such as photos, or a company logo?</p>

<br />
I am not clear on what you are asking.<br />
<br />
The default file format for Word 2010 (and 2007) is DOCX. So when you do a Save As of a DOC file, that is why it comes up as a DOCX.
<br />
<br />
Unless you specifically need 2010 features, there is no real need to convert all of the files.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sobnrood:<br />
<br />
PDF is mostly an image file so that can explain why a doc may be reduced in size when converted to PDF.
<br />
<br />
What program uses WPD format files.<br />
<br />
Which Word format are you talking about, DOC or DOCX.&nbsp; Either way, Word files are complex constructs. Not only do they have the simple text, they contain a lot of code to handle the formatting.&nbsp; If you change the extension of a DOCX to ZIP (just add the .ZIP
 to the end of the file name, after the existing DOCX), you can look into the file structure to get an idea of all of the hidden baggage.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.wpd is a Word Perfect file extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like .docx and .doc it is a complex construct and has a lot of code to handle the formatting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet the resultant file is&nbsp;significantly smaller than its .doc counterpart.</p>

            It's been a while since I've worked with WordPerfect. Back then Word and WP took fundamentally different approaches to file structure.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
A WP document was very LOOSELY the equivalent of a HTML file.&nbsp; A string of text with formatting codes embedded only as the formatting was applied. If you looked at it with a text editor, you could easily read the text and the formatting codes.<br />
<br />
A DOC file, on the other hand was a complex structure, with a great deal of framework code in place even before you enter any content. Default Styles and other "Stuff" like that. A DOC file is a "Binary" construct, again, very LOOSELY like a compiled program.&nbsp;
 If you open a DOC file in a text editor it is a mass of unreadable characters.&nbsp; The body text is buried in the mess, but almost impossible to find by simply scrolling through the document.<br />
<br />
A DOCX file is compromise that is half way between the two. When you convert a DOCX to ZIP, it is now in readable text format. But it is still a complex of folders and default files with at least some initial default formatting content.<br />
<br />
Taking the example to an extreme, if I remember correctly, a WPD file with only one character was very close to 1 byte in size. There was some initial formatting information, like the printer assigned to the document but no where near as much as found in a
 DOC or DOCX.&nbsp; The oldest example I have is from WinWord 6.0, released in 1993.&nbsp; A DOC file with only 1 character entered in it was saved to around 9,216 bytes in size.&nbsp; In Word 15.0 / 2013, released in 2013 the same 1 character DOC format file was bloated
 to 30,208 bytes, and a 1 character DOCX file is compressed down to 14,156 bytes.
<br />
<br />
Actually, since you have WP could you try the experiment, create a new blank file, the type a single character with no formatting and save as WPD.&nbsp; Tell us what version of WP and the resulting file size.&nbsp; I'll have to look, I think I have a slightly older version
 of WP installed on another partition I'll boot into some time.<br />

            Thanks for the WP info. It is in the ballpark I was expecting. I suspect that 2KB is the minimum "block" size on your HD, and the actual file content is somewhat smaller. But that is close enough for me.

    <title>Microsoft Word jumps to &#34;Save As&#34; every few characters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samstevens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word jumps to &#34;Save As&#34; every few characters</h2>
                    I have no idea how this happened, whether I hit some strange control character or if this is a program corruption. I opened and was working on a document in Word 2000 (9.0.2720)on Windows XP, like I do every day for years. All of the sudden, to make a
 long story short, every 1-4 characters I type opens a "Save As" window. I can find no pattern. It happens with most if not all letters. It happens with "enter". Sometimes "saving as" opens another "Save As" window. Sometimes I have to ctl-alt-del to get out
 of it. Troubleshooting: I went to C&gt;Documents and Settings&gt;Owner&gt;Application Data&gt;Microsoft&gt;Templates and deleted "Normal". (I tried this three times, but each new template had the same bug.) What next? Thank you.

<p>Could it be that your ALT key is stuck? Pressing the S key then would trigger a Save command.</p>
<p>ALso note that you are working with a non-updated version of Word 2000. Apply Service Pack 3 and additional updates to make sure you are not trying to fix an already solved bug.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but it does not apply.</p>
<p>Please note that PROBABLY EVERY key triggers the window.&nbsp; I just did not try them all.<br />
<br />
No keys are stuck - all other programs function normally.<br />

I applied SP3 as soon as it was available way back when, 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3 Build 2600.</p>

<h2>            Internet Sharing, No Mobile Network - but there is&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 820 was not allowing Internet Sharing when I got it, and I sorted that out by searching on the net, but now it has stopped working again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My network provider upgraded me to 4G, don't know if that has anything to do with it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message I get says that there is no mobile network to use, but the signal is strong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            It's not an app the you can install. It is part of the operating system. If it is not working out of the box, something must be wrong. Try going to settings, switch to the applications page and open the office section. There is a reset office button there.
 I'd try that and if it fails i would reset the phone, to see if whatever went wrong got fixed with a reinstall. If that failed too, i would return the phone as faulty.

<h3> dan2me76  say:</h3>
<h2>            Server security certificate error on Outlook 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I get this error everytime I start Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>The server you are connected to is using a security certificate that could not be verified.</p>
<p>A required certificate is not&nbsp;within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or time stamp in the signed file</p>
<p>Do you want to continue using this server?</p>
<p>The email server I am accessing when I get this error is gmail.&nbsp; I also access AOL and Hotmail servers without any problems.&nbsp; I am running a Toshiba Satalite laptop with an AMD Antholon 64 dual core processer with 2gb of ram and Windows 7 32 bit opperating
 system.&nbsp; Microsoft Security Assentials offers me my security and I run a cysco lynksys router with the firwall at high security.</p>
<p>Currently I am concerned more about why this security warning is coming up when the information contained in the certificate all appears to be valled.&nbsp; Windows 7 is up to date as is MSE and Microsoft office.&nbsp; All those update daily and automaticaly.&nbsp; The
 only update I heven't taken is Microsoft Silverlite.&nbsp; I find it interfears with the spead of my computer when gaming.&nbsp; I have also checked the time and date for both Windows, and my system bios.&nbsp; I am at a loss.&nbsp; Please advise.</p>

            I did some further troubleshooting with gmail and dicovered the problem.&nbsp; But now I have a new problem.&nbsp; All my setting had been changed.&nbsp; I am sure they were correct when I set it up, and it worked for about the first 2 or 3 weeks.&nbsp; I have also kept up
 with my virus scans, and I use the online scanner from Microsoft at least once a month.&nbsp; Nothing has ever been detected.&nbsp; Nobody used this computer but me and both windows and the computer is passworded at the bios level.&nbsp; It would have been very hard for
 someone to break either of those passwords with out using a viral trace of some sort.

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
Thank you for your response. &nbsp;But as I had mentioned previously, I had done all of the trouble shooting and am somewhat computer literate. &nbsp;I would keep re adding my signature (please note this is the SAME signature that I have had for years) and it will allow
 me to add it and it will work for a couple of hours and then disappear.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I have not made any changes to my account at all. &nbsp;I have also cleared out history, cache etc etc</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
what is very weird is that I have 2 other Hotmail email accounts and have had no issue with a signature.. it is only this account...</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I am also working out of google chrome, please help!!</p>

<h2>            Skype Meeting</h2>
                    <p>I've just started using Outlook via Office365.&nbsp; Until now, I've been using the desktop app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company uses Skype for instant messaging and online collaboration.&nbsp; It is also linked to each individual's conference code for setting up conference calls.&nbsp; How do I attach the call-in information to an appointment I'm scheduling in Office365?&nbsp; It was
 so easy in the desktop app.</p>

<p><span>Hi Brian Stalder,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you mean that you want to schedule a Skype for business meeting with joining detail in OWA, if so, you can refer to
<strong>Set up an online meeting using Outlook web app </strong>of this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-a-Skype-for-Business-meeting-in-Outlook-b8305620-d16e-4667-989d-4a977aad6556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As far as my test, after adding Skype meeting, you’ll see a prompt message ”Your Skype meeting has been created. We’ll add joining details after the invitation is sent”.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0e0988d-0c98-4db9-9be5-58d5bed663a5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0e0988d-0c98-4db9-9be5-58d5bed663a5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>After sending the meeting invitation, you can see the joining details in the sent items.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4921eb5a-ae91-43a7-ba21-c231c74d37e0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4921eb5a-ae91-43a7-ba21-c231c74d37e0?upload=true" /></a></p>

    <title>Email to me&#64;OneNote not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eastnine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email to me&#64;OneNote not working</h2>
                    <p>I'm moving from Evernote to OneNote and trying to set up *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but I can't get it to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it may be to do with the fact that my "From" address is different to the work address at which my Office365 account is registered: my company is a subsidiary of a larger group, and email addresses are for the subsidiary while Office365 uses the group
 email address and username.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on the Onenote email settings page, all I see is the checkbox next to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
</p>
<p>This email address works for incoming email, but the way we're set up I can't send from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no "Add another email address" link, so I can't try that. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If I try to send from my actual email address, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I get the "Almost there!" email and a link to confirm the email address: but if I select the button, I just go back to the settings page showing only the group address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emailed notes don't show up in any notebook, on the Windows desktop client or in Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><strong>Hello Everyone,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a full boxed retail version of Microsoft Office for MAC 2011, its the Home and Business version, which means I can install onto two machines. I've had it for awhile now and currently using it on only one MacPro.... I originally activated this
 with no problems, but last week, everytime I opened up one of the office apps, it asks me to activate it, so I enter the key off the box and its re-activates without issue. The question is, why does it keep doing this, because its a pain.....</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            sharing vs. installing</h2>
                    <p>I have a family of 4. My Office 365 subscription lets me both install Office on up to 5 computers AND share with up to 4 other people in my household. My son just got his first laptop and I created a Microsoft account for him. How do I choose between having
 his laptop be one of the 5 machines vs. sharing the subscription with him.</p>
<p>

            <p>Your Office 365 Home subscription allows you to install on a total of up to 5 PC/Mac class machines. That is total between "your" installs and those shared with family.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is probably best if you share with them. That way they have their own allocation of 1TB of OneDrive space and 60 minutes Skype time and they access their own email in outlook. Those are totally separate from your allocations of those resources.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: when you share, they can install on more than one computer also, up to your combined total of 5 machines!&nbsp; As the owner/"admin" of the license you have control to deallocate those installations.</p>

    <title>IE11 process memory increases despite no apparent JS heap leaks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> handasa_it  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 process memory increases despite no apparent JS heap leaks</h2>
                    <p>We have a web application based on the Google Maps JS API which causes IE11's process memory usage to grow despite there being no apparent JS heap leaks reported by IE11's memory profiler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have created a self-contained test page which simulates some of the behaviours of the application and demonstrates the problem. We have a test page and does the following once the 'start' button is clicked:<br />
* initialises a Google Map<br />
* performs rapid marker movements on the map (simulating lightning strikes)<br />
* plays a sound for each marker movement using Howler.js<br />
* performs frequent AJAX requests to back-end a) JSON and; b) XML end points used by the application using jQuery</p>
<p><br />
I can provide this test page on request, but prefer to keep it private for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, there is no observable JS heap leak but the process memory increases until the browser is unable to operate normally. The process memory follows the same pattern when the test is run without opening dev tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aspects of the test may be disabled by commenting out the relevant lines in the start() method and reloading the page. Our tests thus far have shown that the marker movements and sounds result in the most rapid increases however the process memory still
 grows when these are disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to pay for someone at Microsoft / community to look into this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>SH</p>

</p><p>As a student, your subscription depends on your university's subscription. From your description, it is A1. To switch to A3, as your account is managed by admin of your university, to do that, your admin needs to purchase A3 and then assign it to you. Please
 contact your admin to evaluate the situation.</p>
