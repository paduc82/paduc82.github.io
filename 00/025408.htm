            I’d suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem. 
<br />
<br />1 ) Go to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />2) Click the drop-down arrow in the blue download button
<br />
<br />3) Select Get classic Skype
<br />
<br />4) Run the downloaded program

<h2>            Can&#39;t publish Access 2010 reports to SharePoint 2010 site</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2010 Access database that contains data fueled from a 2010 SharePoint list. From this data, I have created several reports that I would like to make available on the same 2010 SharePoint site in which the data came from. I'm
 attempting to do this via Save &amp; Publish&gt;Publish to Access Services. After I enter my SharePoint site's URL and Site Name (I have also run the compatibility checker with no issue), I am asked to verify my credentials. I then receive this error message from
 Access:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(URL) did not respond. Either the server does not exist, Microsoft Access Services are not enabled on the server, or the server is using an older version of Microsoft Access Services that is not compatible with Access 2010.</p>
<p>According to our IT department "The SharePoint 2010 Central Farm is configured for Access Services. The feature has to be enabled at both the Site Collection and Site level."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also noticed if I right click on a report, and select Export, "sharepoint" is greyed out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A blank site is fine. You can always give users a direct URL to your database.</p>
<p>Once you get the reports working, then you can build a nice "menu" form, or navigation form in Access. This form is easy to build with drag + drop, and it will build you a nice menu.</p>
<p>So, it really don't matter too much what kind of site you create. However, it was/is important that you obviously can create sites (knowing this solves + answers about 100+ questions here).</p>
<p>And as noted, you probably want a blank site. However, you might want to try/test a few of the database samples as this will confirm that your setup has Access web services running correctly – we still don't really know this as of yet.</p>
<p>So if you can easy create some of the database sites when using the create new site on SharePoint, then this would suggest you have no problem publishing to that site.</p>
<p>So for sure create a blank site, and THEN in that site try creating a database, or try publishing to that blank site location.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that each Access application you publish does in face create a whole new site. (and thus publishing to the site you are creating will in fact create what are called sub-sites).
</p>
<p>This whole process is very much like creating folders inside of folders. You can create a site and then create sites inside of that one.</p>
<p>So, create a site, it really does not matter too much what template you choose. I often creating a site called AccessTest, and then I publish many test applications into that site.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Planner slow when creating&#47;editing tasks</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_other-mso_win10-mso_o365b/microsoft-planner-slow-performance/cb48574b-58ea-4c04-a019-184dea6f99eb" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the delay is in creating/editing tasks. &nbsp;It happens on existing plans AND newly created plans. &nbsp;The most recently created plan was started a few days ago and only has 3 tasks in it. &nbsp;Someone else created the plan and tasks. &nbsp;Then I opened a task
 to edit it with my comments. &nbsp;Or I may just have to open it to assign to another person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience is that the first time opening the task takes the longest time. &nbsp;But, it also happens going back to a task over a few days as we update comments, etc. &nbsp; I leave Planner open in my browser all day and that was not a problem until the past few
 months. &nbsp;Since the update, I now make sure to refresh my browser before opening any tasks. &nbsp;I work mainly with "My Tasks" open constantly and refresh that during the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open an existing task, it opens immediately but takes between 15-30 seconds (on average) to load the comments section and allow me to click in the comments box to type my notes. &nbsp;A few months ago there was NO wait time loading tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My whole hub has under 50 plans. &nbsp;Each plan could have between 1 and 10 tasks. &nbsp;Rarely do we have more than 10 per plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A task can have 1 comment or 40. &nbsp;No way for me to break that down further.</p>

<p>Hi Darlene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, can you confirm that refreshing the browser before opening any tasks solve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I would also like to confirm that the issue is not the tasks itself, but specifically the comments inside the tasks, which takes 15-30 seconds on average to load, am I correct with these assumptions?</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#39;t query IMAP folders from Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcrowley203  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t query IMAP folders from Outlook 2007</h2>
                    <p>I manage a web domain name and, associated with the domain, an email server that is hosted by HostMonster. &nbsp;I use Outlook 2007 running on Windows 10 as my desktop email application. &nbsp;I also read and send mail via my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently, I had the server configured as a POP server. &nbsp;I recently changed over to IMAP. &nbsp;I'm able to send and receive email via both devices, and the in-box seems to sync up just fine on both. &nbsp;However, in Outlook, I am unable to subscribe to the
 server-side folders. &nbsp;(The iPhone subscribed successfully with all folders.) &nbsp;Specifically, in the Navigation Pane, I right-click the top folder for my IMAP account, I click "IMAP Folders ...", I leave blank the field "Display folders whose names contain:",
 and then I click "Query", but in the folders list I'm told, "No folder names contain the current search string" (which, as I've said, is blank), so there is nothing to which I can subscribe. &nbsp;In Outlook, deleted emails continue to show up in the InBox, but
 with a horizontal line through the headline text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone into the Navigation Pane, right-clicked the top folder for my IMAP account, and hit "Update folder list". &nbsp;I've closed and restarted Outlook. &nbsp;I've created a new mail profile from scratch. &nbsp;I've rebooted the machine. &nbsp;None of that changes my result.
 &nbsp;I've gone into the mail server via HostMonster's webmail application, and I can see that folders other than InBox do exist on the server, as you would expect given that my iPhone syncs up fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've thought about reinstalling Outlook, but I can't locate the installation disk. &nbsp;I suspect there may be an issue related to the registry, but I'm reluctant to tinker with that, especially since I'm not very familiar with it and would essentially be making
 random guesses as to what changes might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            OK, I've solved this. &nbsp;When I set up the IMAP account in Outlook, I specified a "Root Folder Path" on my local drive. &nbsp;That field should have been left blank. &nbsp;Having cleared that field, I can now subscribe to folders on the server.

            Yup. Exact same thing happened to me. And they won't do a darn thing. I talked to two representatives. My advice, dont do the online repair, it resets everything to default. Apparently my account wasn't listed under my product key, but I wouldn't have
 been able to use it if it wasn't.

<h2>            How to Compare two documents and change the differences to italics and magenta. </h2>
                    
<p>In my workplace, we are constantly updating and revising a large document which has chapters, sub-chapters and sections. When a section changes, we post the new version with what has changed shown in italics and magenta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently we use the Compare feature in MS Word to show us the changes between the section as it looks today and what it is being revised to. Does Word have an efficient way of turning all of the changes into italics and magenta? Right now we highlight all
 ofteh changes using Highlighting and then do "Find and Replace" to change the highlighted text into italics and magenta but is there any easier way?</p>

<p>You can probably use a macro containing the following code.&nbsp; There is no wdMagenta color however.</p>
<p>Dim arev As Revision<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each arev In .Revisions<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; With arev.Range.Font<br />

    <title>help needed to configure 2730 classic on AT&#38;amp&#59;T - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newyorkirene  say:</h3>
<h2>            help needed to configure 2730 classic on AT&#38;amp&#59;T</h2>
                    
<p>I've been speaking to Nokia and AT&amp;T for two days trying to see if they could help me configure the new 2730 classic (bought in Asia) to work. It's on S40 and uses GSM data and packet data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No configuration I could find via public forums has worked so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One AT&amp;T agent said that since GPRS is not available on the 2730, they can't help me manually put it in. But Nokia agent said AT&amp;T should be able to send GPRS settings to me by sms (while another AT&amp;T agent kept saying that since it's not a AT&amp;T phone, they
 can't help me). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Malaysia, I'd buy a sim card for less than US$5, and wap and mms settings are sent to me within the hour of putting in the sim card, why is it so difficult to do the same in this country??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is "global connectivity" a myth? &nbsp;Is this a conspiracy to make people a buy new phone wherever they move? Or is there some truth to the fact that the 2730 is just not compatible with the system in the US?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes you need 2 packet-data accesspoints. One for&nbsp; WAP browsing and one for internet browsing using html. Check the gprs settings with your service provider or/and check their website.</p>

<p>I'm in the exact same boat. Here's my situation. I bought an unlocked 2730 online with the understanding that it would support AT&amp;T's 3G network. Yet, out of the box, it will not connect to the internet. &nbsp;Since AT&amp;T doesn't sell this model, they don't have
 it in their system and, therefore they can not or will not provide me with the proper settings and a walkthrough to set up the device to access the web. &nbsp;Similarly, Nokia can not or will not help me either - they keep telling me to contact AT&amp;T. &nbsp;I would greatly
 appreciate if someone would walk me through setting up this handset so I can access the internet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>If you bought your 2730c in EU, you won't be able to use 3G because of different frequency bands in US. Anyway, you can try setting up a packet-data (gprs) connection manually as described in the manual. Here is some advise, but it could be outdated. I guess
 there's not much you can do, exept making calls and texting.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help. Unfortunately, no luck. The setting labels don't match up between the 2730 and the model you referenced. Also, there are certain settings the 2730 has fields for that aren't covered in that example. &nbsp;As such, I'm still getting the
 "subscribe to packet data first" message when I try to connect to the internet. &nbsp;I've scoured the internet and I still can't determine what that message means. &nbsp;How do you "subscribe" to packet data? &nbsp;UGGH! &nbsp; I really want to keep this phone but if I can't
 get this thing sorted out by Friday I have to send it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for where I purchased the phone, I bought it in the U.S. (I live in California). I figured since it was a U.S. version, built for the AT&amp;T 3G network, it would work here! Ironically, I also ordered a C5, which is a European import which I knew going in
 would only give me EDGE coverage here, and THAT one connected to the internet right out of the box! Unfortunately, it's twice as expensive as the 2730 and I couldn't justify spending $180 on a phone that only gets EDGE and doesn't have Wi-Fi. &nbsp;Now I'm stuck
 with a 2730, built for 3G in the U.S. and I'm not getting ANY coverage at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other advice would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>

<p>Oke so, there are versions of the 2730c with support for 3G frequencies as seen in the specs (850, 1900 MHz). With the C5 (2100, 900 MHz) you can use 2G in the US. Are you using a new SIM card with the C5? Use the packet-data settings or switch SIM card
 from the C5 to set up your 2730c.</p>

    <title>Hiding&#47;viewing the &#34;markup area&#34; &#40;comments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeb1978  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hiding&#47;viewing the &#34;markup area&#34; &#40;comments sidebar&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I regularly want to do the following when writing, reading, or editing documents in Word 2016:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a comment (note to self or to document's author)</li><li>Continue reading the document</li></ul>
<p>When I begin reading a document I adjust the size/dimensions of the window it's in, as well as the magnification of the document within the window, establish the horizontal position (with the horizontal scrollbar) etc. In other words, I set it up just how
 I want it, for maximal reading comfort. Adding a comment undoes all those adjustments! It knocks the horizontal position off center and it changes the magnification of the document's body (zooms out). So I want it back to where I had everything set up before
 adding the comment. But as far as I can tell the only way to hide the comments again is with the rather esoteric item on the ribbon, under Review &gt; "all markup" &gt; "no markup". Hiding the comments really should be easier, so I wonder if there's a command I
 don't know about. It should be like showing/hiding the navigation pane/sidebar, with a convenient x at the top.
</p>

            <p>If adding a comment disrupts the layout too much, try adding a callout. These are text boxes with handles that can point to specific text or graphics. Since they float above the document, they don't disturb the layout:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Word, click on the <strong>Insert tab</strong> (<em>not</em> the Insert menu at the top of your screen).</li><li>Click on <strong>Shapes</strong>, then scroll down to the bottom.</li><li>Choose a <strong>Callout</strong> shape, then click and drag on your document to draw it. After drawing it, you can click on the handle or extension and move that independently to point exactly where you want it.</li></ol>
<p>The first time you create a callout, it will wrap text around it by default. It will also have a colored fill. To fix these:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the callout selected, click on the <strong>Shape Format</strong> tab, then click on
<strong>Wrap Text</strong> and choose <strong>In Front of Text</strong>.</li><li>Still on the Shape Format tab, click on <strong>Shape Fill</strong> and choose white.</li><li>Right-click on the callout and choose <strong>Set as Default Shape</strong>. Now all callouts will not wrap text and will have a white fill.</li></ol>

    <title>List aliases assigned to Office 365 Group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            List aliases assigned to Office 365 Group</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much ado I discovered one could use the following PowerShell command to add aliases to an Office 365 Group</p>
<p>
</p><p><code>Set-UnifiedGroup</code><span style="color: rgba(76, 76, 76, 1)">
</span><code>-Identity</code><span style="color: rgba(76, 76, 76, 1)">
</span><code>&lt;groupname&gt;</code><span style="color: rgba(76, 76, 76, 1)">
</span><code>-EmailAddresses</code><span style="color: rgba(76, 76, 76, 1)">
</span><code>@{Add=</code><code>"smtp:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</code><code>}</code></p>
<p>
</p><p><code>My
 question what command gives a list of already assigned aliases? </code></p>
<p>
</p><p><code>The
 browser interface does not show them but they work .... so they must be there. </code>
</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>PJ</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try the steps below and check the result:</p>
<p>Open Excel in safe mode:</p>
<p><span>Hold <strong>
Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>· Copy and paste, or type the following command in the
<strong>Open</strong> box, and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Excel /safe</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: There is space between
<strong>Excel</strong> and<strong>/</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in Excel safe, then try to disable the add-ins associated with Excel 2013 program and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>· Click on File menu, Options and then Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>· Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.</span></p>
<p><span>· Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may also empty the Excel startup folder and check if it helps. Go to the following locations on the computer then delete all the contents for the specified folders:</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams &#62; Headsets and MIC ON&#47;OFF buttons not interacting with client &#33;</h2>
                    <p>When using TEAMS for meetings or for 1:2:1 calling - it seems that my headset does not interact properly with the ability to MUTE myself on and off. I can press the MUTE key on my headset and it has in fact muted but the TEAMS app does not reflect that so
 I never really know if I'm on mute or not without shouting down the ear piece to see what happens. The soft buttons in the TEAMS app work fine on their own but as a combined setup of screen to headset - wired or wireless there seems to be a disconnect ! We
 all have Skype/Lync approved headsets .... so what's the story ? Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Apologies I did not see a dedicated TEAMS category !</p>

<h2>            Broken n97 screen, please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My n97 was knocked from my hand as I was walking down the street and the screen broke inside. When the phone is off it looks in perfect condition but once switched on it won't work and nothing can be seen. Does anybody know if I can replace the screen by
 myself or where to even get a replacement screen?? Any kind of advice will help!</p>

<p>I have tried all&nbsp;the instructions as listed on the Microsoft site&nbsp;several&nbsp;times to no avail.&nbsp; Has anyone solved this problem?</p>

            I got the same problem with HTC 8x today since I want to send some video to my friend.<br />
But finally I could do the other way which is installing the skydrive on PC. <br />
Therefore, from my PC I can access to any source on my phone which is great.<br />
Give it a shot! Good luck!<br />

<br />
Goto Phone dial pad and dial<span style="font-weight: bold"> ##634#</span>&nbsp; This will take you to embedded tool menu. Just disable everything there. Especially modem commands for debug using USB ports on HTC 8X. Phone will ask for reboot. After reboot.. it works
 100% fine. I can see my drive and my songs :) <br />

            ##634# and ##3424# just brings up "HTC Self-Diagnostic Intruction Manual" and installs CSDDiag where you can test your Flashlight, LED and vibrator. No embedded tool menu comes up. :(&nbsp;

            Yes I have. The problem there is that there is no driver in my&nbsp;<b>C:\Windows\Inf\</b><span> folder. So step L. can not be done. No drivers found it says or something like that.&nbsp;</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>And the drives you can manually download doenst work either "no drivers found" maybe because the drivers you can manually download is for win 7 and below. I have windows 8 on my pc.</span></div>

            k.. I&nbsp; saw your screen shot... so there is definitely nothing wrong with your phone itself.. Its the specific windows 8 PC installation you have which is the culprit.. The fact that it works on windows 7 PC also proves that. Just FYI... Win 8 has WP8 drivers
 built into it( atleast I observed this )... <br />
<br />
So here is my solution --<br />
1) Connect your phone to any other windows 8 PC using the same OS architecture (32/64 as yours). Lets call this PC - NEW PC. Then, after the phone gets detected and you can see the USB drive of the phone, just copy paste all the files from NEW PC`s c:\windows\inf
 folder to your own PC`s folder. Say no to all existing files to be replaced. New files, if any will be copied.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
2) Connect your phone to your own PC and you should be fine. If it dosent work, then let me know if you have 32bit win8. I have one copy of 32bit win 8 . I am a bit busy but I can help you and give you files from my PC (if point 1 dosent help).<br />

</p><p>Unfortunately, my&nbsp; MS account changes are pending at the moment, so I&nbsp; could not login to send the feedback off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot see a technical problem here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cause WharApp does allow deleting pix messages, for instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merely, MS does not want to take into account the interests of the users generally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just imagine: Your mum or a girl friend would be getting pix from your "enemy partners", and these pix cannot be deleted! - I cannot see the MS's reason!</p>
