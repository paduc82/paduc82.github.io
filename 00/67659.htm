<p>Greg,</p>
<p>thanks for the reply but the post doesn't explain how to copy your project files from one computer to the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried copying the project from the following directory</p>
<p>C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Packages\21336V3TApps.MovieMaker-PRO_bzg06mxvgh4fa\LocalState\Projects</p>
<p>
</p><p>This allows me to see the projects on the new system when I am at the main screen of MVP and click the Open Projects button.</p>
<p>It presents the importing message but then later gets the message "Loading error code (80)".&nbsp; So I have obvisouly not done something correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all my media files are in the the same directory structure on both systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions?</p>
        </p>

</p><p>I have had windows 10 for 4 days. For the first 2 days there was a slide show in a small window top right of the desktop. It only accessed a limited number of my photographs in spite of going into the settings and directing it to the full collection. After
 2 days it has disappeared altogether. Our family miss the function which we got used to seeing on Vista. Is there anyway of replacing the function as on vista?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your first upgrade to Win 10 from Win 8.1 (if that was your previous OS) created the new partition. It did so by shrinking C: for space.&nbsp;It is the Win 10 Recovery Tools partition &amp; is placed right after C:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your second upgrade to a new version of Win 10 might have adjusted the Recovery Partition to be larger. I know mine grew from 471 MB in Win 10, build 10240, to the&nbsp;504 MB it is now. Not sure whether it was 1511 or 1607 that did that, or both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 8.1 Recovery Tools partition was left behind, I guess for use in case one chose to revert. And it is not removed even after the 30 day period for reversion has expired. Someday I'll remove mine on my own!&nbsp;Mine has never moved or changed from its
 original size of 750 MB.</p>

<p>however this is pc that had free upgrade with no issues except backup not being available that was then installed with a different build of win 10 by microsoft support.</p>
<p>backup is now available but will not complete always shows a error which may be connected to extra partitions it now has.</p>

            <p>most of those problems do not relate to current system as stated.</p>
<p>i had a clean install from dvd of windows 8.1 and i upgraded using the free windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>however the backup version win 7 would not work.</p>
<p>so microsoft support took control and they did another update to a different build version of windows 10. so it was windows 10 to windows 10 but a different build version. something to do with anniversary update being different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my issue is there are two partitions that are both in use for windows restore.</p>
<p>unfortunately this has caused <strong>48gb of 256gb on my ssd to be of no use </strong>
at all. as the new partition was made at the end of the c drive data system area and created a second recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so this question now relates to this issue of two recovery partitions and how to get it back to one and how to move partition area so i can get back the locked 48gb of space that was used for over provisioning of a samsung ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so lets forget other posts. they are not relevant here. <strong>please. </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>450mb recovery&nbsp;partition&nbsp;is blocking use of remaining overprovision which can no longer be used.</strong></p>

<p>custom refresh will be no use now as relates to a windows 8.1 image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so do i just delete old partition 1 or <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
is there another method</span> to be used as it holds i &nbsp;suspect win 8.1 info <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
but could hold old win 10</span> before <strong>microsoft did build change</strong>.
<p>
</p><p>options to get system running with partitions removed that are not needed and also images for windows RE and custom image are all correct for current windows 10 and current
<p>
</p><p>i forgot how to do it been so long since i made custom image.</p>
<p>plus move partition 5 so before partition 4 so that from end of partition 4 system/data to end of disk is clear so i can use rest of ssd.
<strong>as it is build change blocked use of ssd overprovisioning area.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>do not know what microsoft support did to make this happen as when i updated to win 0 from win 8.1 there was no issues with partition layout.</strong></p>

            <p>You've pretty much scared me off with that List Disk, Samantha. Especially with those dynamic disks, I wonder whether there are interconnections between your 11 disks we need to understand before we proceed. There could be RAID things going on here or other
 shenanigans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also wonder whether you are multi-booting, &amp; whether one of the other OS may miss a partition we decide to delete. What shows up at "R-Clk START, Run, type 'MSConfig', hit ENTER"? Is there more than one OS at the Boot tab...?...</p>

            <p>yes they were same pc but as all now sorted and new op system purchased win 8.1 and most issues related to free upgrade. that too was finally solved. then it was a issue with backup and that was due to free upgrade and need to put on anniversary build. which
 was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the anniversary build created the new 450mb recovery so i guess other recovery can now be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but the position of 450mb recovery has caused issues as it stops the over &nbsp;provision area being used by ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as to all other disks. there is no raid in use.</p>
<p>i have <strong>2 x 1td wd blue spanned</strong> <strong>internally</strong> and ssd as op system.</p>
<p>i then have <strong>2 x 6tb wd red pro &nbsp;as external drives in a docking station</strong>.
<p>only two installed when diskpart was done.</p>
<p>hope this answers <strong>both members</strong>&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>i just need to know how can i move the 450mb recovery partition</strong> and
<strong>correct the custom refresh image</strong> so that it goes to same as windows re or i will make a new image as a custom refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but <strong>i need to remove old partition recovery area</strong> and also <strong>
move new 450mb recovery area</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or</span>
<strong>c: drive area</strong> so i can get use of <strong>48gb at end</strong> so
<strong>ssd will function correctly</strong>.</p>

</p><p><strong>i can not remove the customrefresh or replace it.</strong></p>

<h2>            Installed Windows Pro instead of Home</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I accidently downloaded Windows 10 Pro instead of Home. My digital license only works on Windows 10 Home, so it is not letting me activate the operating system. I created a boot drive from my previous laptop and I am trying to install windows 10
 Home on a new PC. How can I uninstall the "Pro" version and install the correct "Home" Version?</span></p>

<p>Hi Rekeoe,</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What exactly happens when you try to uninstall?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the exact error message or error code displayed when you try to uninstall?</p>
<p>When you are working on your computer and installing a new program, the installation suddenly fails. Now you are left with a partly installed program. You try to install the program again, but you are unsuccessful. Or, maybe you have problems trying to remove
 an old program because the installation files are corrupted.</p>
<p>Windows Installer CleanUp Utility might be able to help. You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program
 from your computer. However, it will remove the installation files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over.</p>
<p>Access the link below to download the Windows clean up utility and proceed with the installation.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</a></p>
<p>As additional information, the compatibility of Halo Combat Evolved is currently unavailable; it may or may not be compatible to run on Windows 7.</p>
<p>For more information on the same you may refer the link below.</p>

<p>I don't know why Microsoft doesn't have a phone number that you can talk to a live person when you get an error like this, but here's what the problem is.</p>
<p>I bought this and the rest of the parts for a computer I built on Newegg.&nbsp; This is an OEM copy of Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I double checked the key, but it's still coming up with error 0xC004C003, The activation server determined the specified product key
 has been blocked.</p>
<p>Now this was BRAND NEW, in it's packaging, with the agreement tape securely on both sides of the case.&nbsp; This has not been used with any other computer, but I cannot activate Windows.&nbsp; I need help...</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are in the USA then you can call 1-800-936-5700 and speak to a customer service rep then give them your name phone number and then give them the product key if they ask they will create a case number and connect you to tech support, tech support has
 a tool to verify if the specified product key you have is on several other computers, if thats the case tell them frankly whats the problem.</p>
<p>the only resolution to this is a new product key and without speaking to them and expaning them the problem you cannot get one. if you ahve a valid proof purchase then it would be helful for them</p>
<p>all the best</p>

<h2>            Touchpad double-tap scrolling not working on Windows 7</h2>
                    Title basically says it all... I turned off a bunch of background programs, hit restart, turned them back on, hit restart again, and now my scrolling isn't working. As in, double tap on the side scroll bar in any window, and keep your finger held down
 to move it up and down. When I double tap on it now, it only acts as a double click... it won't let me hold and scroll, even while my finger's still held down.<br />
<br />
Drag and drop feature is still enabled on my touchpad, so I'm not sure what the problem is.<br />

<h2>            Help installing Windows 10 - 0xc1900101 - 0x20017 SAFE_OS phase during boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was after some help if anyone is able - it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to upgrade for a wile to previous builds of the Insider builds. I got stuck on 10130 due to this same problem&nbsp;so went back to 8.1 to take the official upgrade path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It reboots and immediately fails and boots back into the previous version with this error. I even tried the upgrade app rather than the Windows Update route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system,&nbsp;Asus H81M-C motherboard, Pentium G3258, 8GB RAM and a HyperX 120GB SSD formatted as NTFS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had various errors to do with what I thought was&nbsp;the installation media not being the UEFI in the past so I have a hunch it may be to do with the format of this disk maybe. I originally had the SSD in a non UEFI system but I formatted it since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried clean install from 10240, removing all non essential USB/PCI/SATA&nbsp;peripherals and boot up programs etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the output from the setuperr file:</p>

            <p>i've been getting this since Insider build 10160, and 10240 (and possibly one in between 10130 and 10160), no matter if i install from an SHA-1-verified burned ISO, natively mounted ISO (in 10130), USB stick, or even legitimately (and freshly installed and)
 activated 7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10130 works perfectly fine (in most aspects. there may have been a GPU driver issue until i updated to a 10 RTM driver set).</p>

<p>Thanks KiaY, like im going mad. I no longer feel </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try doing some of those suggestions. I am overclocked so that might be the problem and why some can resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't think to add that to my spec list! Doh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>come on Microsoft, time to fix this in a fresh new iso build please? 😃 </p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was after some help if anyone is able - it would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to upgrade for a wile to previous builds of the Insider builds. I got stuck on 10130 due to this same problem&nbsp;so went back to 8.1 to take the official upgrade path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It reboots and immediately fails and boots back into the previous version with this error. I even tried the upgrade app rather than the Windows Update route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system,&nbsp;Asus H81M-C motherboard, Pentium G3258, 8GB RAM and a HyperX 120GB SSD formatted as NTFS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had various errors to do with what I thought was&nbsp;the installation media not being the UEFI in the past so I have a hunch it may be to do with the format of this disk maybe. I originally had the SSD in a non UEFI system but I formatted it since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried clean install from 10240, removing all non essential USB/PCI/SATA&nbsp;peripherals and boot up programs etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the output from the setuperr file:</p>

            Ah, great link. Resetting my motherboard to optimized defaults worked for me. Although when I load any of my pre-saved overclock profiles and it enters a boot loop. Shame, as this processor is great for overclocking and I suspect is a very common problem.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Have you made any changes to your computer except the Windows update prior to this issue?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It’s strange to hear that the Windows Update cause issue with Antivirus software. We really don’t think that the problem is appeared with Windows Update.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, in Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update
 might temporarily cause issues with your device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to perform a&nbsp;</span><strong><span>System Restore</span></strong><span>&nbsp;on the computer so that it restores back your system to the previous state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore</span></strong><span>&nbsp;is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state. It offers a way to undo all the changes in the system files, registry keys, installed programs, etc., to a previous state, without
 affecting personal files such as documents, photos or e-mails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><span>Windows key + R</span></strong><span>&nbsp;keys to open Run window.</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>On run command type “</span><strong><span>rstrui.exe</span></strong><span>” (without double code) and press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>OK</span></strong><span>.</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>Select the restore point and follow the onscreen instruction.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore Disclaimer:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the issue with office outlook 2010 I suggest you to post your query in office forum support, refer to the below link.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It would be highly irregular for any Windows&nbsp;OS to not support optical drives, especially if the laptop came with Vista in the first place. So I fear that you have been misinformed. However, this link may help you fix the problem...</p>

<h2>            Replace Rubberised Grips - DeisgnLabs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a DesignLab Controller back in July 2017, over the time I have been used this controller the rubberised grips have become stretch and deform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of replacing them? or reform in to the shape?</p>
<p>

            If this is a software issue, reinstall the drivers for your wireless network adapter. Get them from Sony's tech support site for your specific model Vaio. If this is a hardware issue, then contact Sony tech support for repair/replacement.

<h2>            OneDrive keeps crashing wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OneDrive keeps crashing any wifi that I connect to. I have it on an Acer R7 laptop running Windows10. When OneDrive syncs, the wifi only holds up for about 5 minutes and then just disconnects. After that, no other devices can connect to the wifi. The
 only fix would be restarting the router, but it would crash again after my laptop connects. A quick fix though is pausing OneDrive syncing. But then again, if I keep doing that, OneDrive would be useless for me. Hope you guys can give me a permanent fix. And
 yes, I have done network troubleshootings and all. I've even reinstalled windows10. Problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you're having issues with your Wi-Fi is because of an outdated wireless and network driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask a few questions to better assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried connecting to other networks and see if you're also experiencing the same issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you already tried?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further troubleshoot the issue, please try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Try other wireless networks. If you're able to connect with other wireless networks, please perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Try to remove the wireless profile by going to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Network &amp; Internet</strong> &gt; <strong>Wi-Fi </strong>&gt; <strong>Manage known networks</strong> &gt; Select the wireless network which you're having issues connecting to then click Forget. After doing that, try reconnecting to the networks.</li><li>Check the <strong>"Wireless Mode"</strong> setting of the wireless driver, and make sure it's set to
<strong>Auto</strong>.</li><li>If you're still unable to connect only to specific wireless network, we suggest contacting your Internet Service Provider.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Uninstall the driver and install the latest wireless driver from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Temporarily disable your Anti Virus and see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: </strong>Check if you're able to connect to wireless networks in Clean Boot. To do this, please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please provide us an update.</p>

            Hi nsegre.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try adjusting the resolutions for each individual monitor:  <a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/different-resolutions-for-multiple-monitors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/diff...</a>
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Nj.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Those USB 3.0 devices appear to be working correctly, at least no errors shown there.  Open each one to see what it says on it's General Tab in Dev Mgr.  
<br />
<br />Update the USB3 drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page for your exact model, serial number or Dell Service tag from sticker on PC. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
