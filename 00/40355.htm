<h2>            Windows not detecting Mic or headphones in new Asus Soar strix sound card.</h2>
                    I purchased this sound card hoping to have a work-a-round for another issue. I was told in this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-only-detects-head-phones-from-front-panel/21d297cf-4fd5-459a-a60a-51bec3fe1244?messageId=bbba2e5c-e24d-4d3a-af9e-b9d8082551c7">
thread </a>I needed to downgrade from windows 1709 for windows to detect my headphones. I was hoping a new sound card would correct the issue without a downgrade. I have installed the new card and it appears is moving through the device called "headphones Strix
 Sound card" but I hear no sound and It does not detect the mic. I am wondering if the device that I see sound on is actually the head phones that are plugged in and if so how to I correct it.

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
An incompatible driver is one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. First, we recommend following the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to see if it helps.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, try checking the audio manager for your sound card and see if you can make some settings to enable headphones and microphones. If you can't find the audio manager for your sound card, recommend, contacting Asus support to help look
 for the audio manager on your computer.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.<br />

    <title>Moving Mail files from one computer to another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bacchus41  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Mail files from one computer to another</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers remote from each other. One is Win 7 and one is Vista but this doesn't seem to make any difference if they are both Windows Mail programs. When I change locations, I copy the Windows Mail files from Computer 1 to a flash drive and take
 it to Computer 2, and it doesn't seem to matter which Computer is 1 or 2. When I get to Computer 2, I go to the Windows Mail file and erase the contents (contents, not the entire sub file) of each sub file and copy the contents of that sub file name from the
 flash drive to the file in Computer 2 that I erased. Complicated but I found I have to do it that way because Windows Mail only recognizes the sub file names that it generated in that computer but it will recognize the transferred files from another Windows
 Mail computer that are copied into those file names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides this being infinitely more time consuming and problematic that transferring Outlook Express between computers, my problem is that there ends up being multiple email message names for the same message but all but one of them will be empty with the
 message that this message cannot be found. My question is therefore, is there somewhere in the Windows Mail combination of files that remembers the headers of all the messages that it contained&nbsp; after I erase the messages within the sub files? When I copy
 these files from another computer back and forth a couple of times, are all of the message headers still there from old erased messages but have no content because I erased only the content? If I can find that file and if it is structured in some sensible
 way,&nbsp; can I delete that also and just copy that file from the Computer 1 files from the flash drive that I bring to Computer 2. As it is, the sub files become very large because they are full of null messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is difficult to understand and it took me a long time to even figure this out but I will never understand why Microsoft didn't keep the same file structure as Outlook Express that allowed me to just copy and paste the entire set of mail files
 from one computer to another.</p>

            <p>I am using Windows Mail 11 in the Win 7 computer and Windows Mail in Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply but this isn't practical for my situation because it requires me to keep track of the new&nbsp;messages I've received, sent, stored, etc. so I can copy&nbsp;only them to the flash drive and then to the other computer. I have several mail sub
 accounts in the Local Folders account&nbsp;with hundreds of messages in each and it isn't practical to keep track of which messages are new and I don't want all copied files to go into the Inbox.&nbsp;This is why I copy them all in the "from" computer, erase the messages
 in the computer I am transferring to and then copy all of the messages&nbsp;from the flash drive. The problem is that apparently Windows Mail remembers the headers of the deleted items and they reappear as empty messages so there is a file somewhere with all of
 the message names that doesn't get erased when I&nbsp;erase the sub account files.&nbsp;With whatever its&nbsp;problems were, Outlook Express was simple and it worked without a hitch for this purpose. If I erase all of the messages from the Windows&nbsp;program itself rather
 than from the files stored as Windows Live Mail in the storage location,&nbsp;will this erase all memory of the files?</p>

<p>Windows 7 does not have a Windows Mail program.</p>
<p>Do you mean Windows Live Mail 2011?</p>
<p>You can import Windows Mail files into Windows Live Mail or you can drag emails to an open folder, but you cannot replace files.</p>

            <p>Ron, do I have to type the whole Windows Live Mail 2011 every time for you to understand what I'm talking about? And you are wrong. You can replace files. I have done it many times over the past few years. The only problem with it, other than it is very
 time consuming, is that I end up with duplicate messages headers with no message in them. That is why I am asking if there is an index or other file in Windows Live Mail 2011 that remembers messages after they are erased out of the stored file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can only import or drag files into Windows Live Mail 2011, it is even more useless than now because you would have to keep track of which files are new so you aren't importing files that are already there.</p>

            Hi MNewsome,
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Windows Vista Forums.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I'm afraid there is no such option present to record through remote assistance in vista. There are many third party software’s which will help you record. You can download it from one of your favorite search engines as we do not recommend non-Microsoft products.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However in Windows 7 you can record steps on your computer with the help of a device called Problem Steps Recorder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can use Problem Steps Recorder to automatically capture the steps you take on a computer, including a text description of where you clicked and a picture of the screen
 during each click (called a screen shot). </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please go through the below article which tells you

    <title>Surface book 2 throttling and over heating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dulainabeyratna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book 2 throttling and over heating</h2>
                    I bought a 13 inch surface book 2 around june last year. It has horrible thermals and throttles like crazy even when using chrome. A video from Linus tech tips says that there were a batch of surface book 2s that had terrible thermals and aim worried mine
 is one of them. Fortnite, which is not a very demanding game, at the lowest settings really heats up the laptop. The same applies for photoshop and visual studio. Some times it overheats and i cant use the laptop at all until it cools down. Further more this
 is the i7 model with the gtx 1050. Can i have some advice on what to do? I heard that Microsoft is exchanging those laptops as well.

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/dbf1017d-8b6d-425f-8c43-6ca8b91c0924" title="DulainAbeyratna">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you have mentioned, we suggest you to download and run &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">Surface
 Diagnostic Toolkit</span></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp; </strong>Which can often fix most software and driver issues. This tool will ensure that you have the latest driver and firmware updates on the Surface and also check for software issues that may be affecting
 the device's performance. After running the tool, perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for 10 seconds or until the screen goes off. When you restart the Surface, the updates will be applied and the software will be loaded properly.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
</p><p>After running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit and issue still occur, please do the following basic troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Check the power mode slider: </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>On applicable models, the Power mode slider is found by clicking the battery icon on the Windows taskbar.</span></span></li></ul>
<span>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a674b965-9466-4807-aa23-c4031dcd3942?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a674b965-9466-4807-aa23-c4031dcd3942?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>For improved performance, the slider should be set to Better or Best performance.</span></li><li><span>Setting the Power mode higher than Recommended will impact battery life, so the customer should connect to a Power Supply&nbsp;Unit &nbsp;if possible or remember to lower the slider when they no longer need the CPU performance boost when on battery.</span></li><li><span><span>The setting is configured separately for when the device is plugged and when it is on battery. This allows you to have this set to Best performance while on Power Supply Unit and for it to automatically change to Recommended
 while on Battery.</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Check Task Manager.</strong></span></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>From the </span><strong>Startup</strong><span> tab in
</span><strong>Task Manager</strong><span>, disable unnecessary programs and then restart.</span></li><li><span>After the restart, from the </span><strong>Processes</strong><span> tab in
</span><strong>Task Manager</strong><span>, view any items with abnormally high CPU usage. Click the
</span><strong>CPU</strong><span> column heading to sort by it.</span></li><li><span>Go </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/windows-stops-responding?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><span> for more info.</span></li><li><span>Unnecessarily running programs can cause slow system behavior and affect overall stability of the PC.</span></li><li><span><span>If issue is app specific, troubleshooting should be performed on the app (remove and reinstall and/or contact publisher).</span></span></li></ul>
<span><span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Scan for virus, spyware, or other malware.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Use </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/17464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Defender</a><span> to update definitions and scan.</span></li><li><span>Virus, spyware, or other malware are a known cause of performance issues on PCs.</span></li></ul>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Free up space.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Remove unnecessary temporary and system files from the computer.</span></li><li><span>From </span><strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage</strong><span> select
</span><strong>Free up space now</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Unnecessary temporary and system files can cause slower performance on systems that are low on free disk space.</span></li></ul>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Reset your Surface.</strong></span></p>
</span></span></span></span>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Go to&nbsp;<strong> </strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fresh Start</a>. follow onscreen instruction.</span></li><li><span><span>Go to </span><strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery.</strong></span></li><li><span><span>Under "More recovery options," select </span><strong>Learn how to start fresh with a clean installation of Windows</strong><span>. Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></li></ul>
<span><span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>After doing all the steps above issue still occur, pleases contact our <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft Support</span></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>they will definitely assist you on the advance trouble shooting steps and they can also process the replacement of the device if needed.</p>

<p>Same here. I also tried the latest Skype Preview (8.16.76.8 at the time of writing), and my camera didn't work in it, either. The name of the camera is present in "Audio &amp; Video Settings", but the camera output window is black and the camera's LED doesn't
 light up. The camera is a generic UVC webcam whose VID/PID is&nbsp;058f:a014.</p>
<p>Downgrading to 8.11.0.4 fixes the problems and everything's hunky dory again.</p>
<p>Using Debian Jessie 8 with Xfce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit : 8.13.0.2 and 8.14.0.10 are also okay for me. 8.15.0.4 seems to be the first release that's broken.</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the questions below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>We're there any changes made on the system? </li><li>Was there a recent update on the system? </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're able to boot the system in safe mode, you may try the methods below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1 : Uninstall the video driver and software.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Device Manager and uninstall the video driver. Also, uninstall the programs associated with the video adapter. Restart the system in normal mode and let Windows install the generic driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2: Perform a clean boot.<br />
</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows<span>. To perform a clean boot, refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. </span></span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 3: Restore system to an earlier time.
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring won’t affect your personal
 files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. To restore the system, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold (or right-click) the <strong>Start&nbsp;</strong> button, and then select
<strong>Control Panel.</strong></li><li>Search <strong>Control Panel</strong> for <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Open System Restore</strong> &gt; <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next </strong>&gt; <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response. </p>

            <p>I wasn't aware of any update as I was away from the computer as it happened, but going from what you've just told me, I've found there was an update at 12:06pm this morning which is exactly the moment my laptop began having this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I system restore will it restore to yesterday for instance? I have no system restore date set so I'd hate for it to reset to when I bought the laptop as I don't want to lose my files.</p>
<p>

            <p>It's fixed! Thanks for everybody's help! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you know what I did for anybody reading this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did turn out it was my graphics driver causing the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I couldn't get into safe mode, I went into the boot options via F2 on startup and on the boot tab I disabled my Nvidia Graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This stopped the crashing on startup but resulted in a black screen with a cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once at this stage, I rebooted into the troubleshooting screen where finally the "Reset my PC" button FINALLY worked, rather than crashing everytime I tried!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So relieved, kept all my pictures too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I was facing exactly same issue with my Lenovo Ideapad Z570 laptop. </p>
<p>I did all sorts of things like formatting the full hard disk and reinstalling Windows 10 Home edition number of times.</p>
<p>Fresh Install worked till I connected my Laptop to the internet. As soon as I connect it to network, Windows starts to auto update and then it freezes leaving no choice but to hard reboot.</p>
<p>After a fresh install and before connecting it to the network, I create a restore point and disabled Windows Update service and then tried to search and install drivers manually. But I couldn't get hold of reliable drivers from the internet, not even from
 Lenovo Support page. I think Lenovo should release compatible drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>Then I came across&nbsp;your post and Bingo !!! Right on target.</p>
<p>I too disabled Nvidia card from bios and then performed all required updates on Windows 10. Now everything works smooth.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your Post.</p>

<p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was facing exactly the same problem. Thanks to your advice, I was able to run Windows 10 again. I just wanted to ask you a last question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you finish downloading the updates, do you enable the Nvidia graphics card again? Or, from now on, I will have to work with the Intel graphics card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help with this last step because I don't want to run the Windows 8.1 again.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jackie,
<br />
<br />I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s), to see if they can show any more detail on the cause of the system crashes
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

I searched for "ACER Aspire Dritek" and any individual work or combination and also the block message.&nbsp; Finally searched under "Launch" and found the Acer Launch. Removed it and it solved the problem for our family "kids" account.

<br />If you enable Notifications in Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications then it will warn you when it's going to Pause Synching in Battery Saver mode, and will have a choice to not do this.  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/onedrive-desktop-client-getting-battery-saver-improvements-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/onedrive-desktop...</a>

            Hello dypsis, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />You cannot delete or uninstall OneDrive but you can disable it.
<br />To do so: 
<br />Begin by opening the Start menu, right-clicking on the OneDrive icon, then selecting Unpin from Start. Next, you'll need to open PC Settings&gt;OneDrive, and turn off all the various syncing and storage options.
<br />
<br />You may also refer to:

<br />Thank you and good luck.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I don't want to uninstall OneDrive. I use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is to stop OneDrive from automatically pausing when it goes into battery save mode.</p>
<p>Surely, MS gives the user an option to enable it or disable it. It is very annoying, and I don't have the time to be messing around re-enabling it manually all the time. I simply want to turn "automatic pause" off.</p>

            I gave you exactly the correct answer which has worked for everyone else on your issue.  There is no other way to disable OneDrive Pausing in Battery Saver mode except to enable the Notification which always offers a way out.  You said nothing about receiving this Notification so I assumed you didn't have it set.  Instead of interacting with me you gave me a bad rating as though I hadn't taken the time to try to help you with the ONLY answer.

<p>Hi Greg.</p>
<p>Let me try to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the answer is that there is no way to disable it. You need to have user interaction every time via Notifications?</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how does it work if you're not at the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trust Microsoft to implement something without giving the end user an option of disabling it.</p>

            If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.

<br />There's also already feedback started in this location for you to add to:

<br />
<br />If you've enabled the OneDrive Notification and miss it's popup, you can check the Action center at right end of Task Bar which is where Notifications are queued until cleared.

            Provided I follow the answer you are looking for, left click on the OneDrive icon in the task bar, click on "More", click on "Settings", go to the "Settings" tab, and uncheck the "Automatically pause sync when this device is in battery saver mode".

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you regarding your concern, we would like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you check if your computer is on Fast Startup?</li><li>Have you tried restarting your computer on a safe mode?</li><li>Have you tried performing an Automatic Repair?</li></ol>
<p><br />
If your computer is on Fast Startup, kindly disable it. Some computers are not compatible with the Fast Startup and it causes the restart option to not work properly. To do so, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong><strong>key</strong><strong>+</strong><strong>X</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Control</strong><strong> Panel</strong>.</li><li>Change the folder view to <strong>Large </strong><strong>icons</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Power</strong><strong> Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Choose</strong><strong> what </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>power</strong><strong> buttons
</strong><strong>do</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong>.</li><li>Click the check box for <strong>Turn</strong><strong> on </strong><strong>fast
</strong><strong>startup</strong> to disable it.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong><strong> changes</strong>.</li><li>Shutdown and boot your computer.</li><li>Do a restart from your Start menu.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to restart your computer on a safe mode. If it the issue persists, kindly perform an Automatic Repair. To do so,
<span>go through
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold"><span>Settings
 &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Restart now</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>(Under
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold"><span>Advanced
 start-up</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>).</span></span>
 After doing so, your Windows will boot with advanced settings. From there, click
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong>, Click
<strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Repair</strong>. By then, it should perform an automatic repair.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding. &nbsp;After the update prior to yesterday's, I did as you suggested in steps 1 - 10 above. &nbsp;It did not correct the problem. &nbsp;After yesterday's Windows 10 update (10/27), I chose
<em>shutdown</em> and <em>not restart</em> after update. After Windows updated and my laptop shutdown, I tried to start it. &nbsp;It "churned" for more than 20 minutes after which I turned it off and restarted it in safe mode-networking (F-12 key; F8 didn't work).
 &nbsp;After it started, I proceeded to following your instructions for "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>," to perform an automatic repair. &nbsp;The repair process started but I eventually got a response that "Startup Repair couldn't repair my PC." &nbsp;So, unfortunately
 I still have a restart problem after Windows 10 updates. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I uninstalled my printer andd made some progress but failed to get the printer reinstalled.</p>
<p>I then decided to check that the printer driver had been removed but made the stupid mistakes of trying to do this with DriverToolKit which deleted my driver and when I &nbsp;tried to reinstall them. I was presented with alicence subscriptions screen. Realising
 too late that I had been scammed, I &nbsp;considered my options and decided pay licence fee and reinstall my drivers. When I had done that and restarrted my Dell 420 PC, it did not "restart properly", done an auto restart that analysed the problem, collected diagnostics
 but failed to restart and offered some options. I tried several of these, including turn off &amp; turn on, reset PC and system reinstall, none of which worked.</p>
<p>The only useful information that I got was a Stop Code of " no boot device available" from the restarts and "Could not extract file c:\Program\Data\User\...\fms_..._o.js" from the two sysrtem reinstalls. I also web cionnected my printer kin san eariler stage.</p>
<p>At this point, I abandoned my efforts and left my PC with my local PC repair shop (who &nbsp;I trust) on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>They will not be able to look at it until tomorrow (Wednesday).</p>
<p>Is there any advice that you can give that will help me\them return my Windows X 64 bit Dell 420 PC to working order please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            This service cannot be started, either because it  is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it</h2>
                    <p>Hi, first time posting and not very computer savvy so apologies in advance if I don’t give enough/redundant information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping someone could help me. Recently my windows 8.1 laptop has been playing up, crashing several times and at first I thought it was google chrome, but after uninstalling it, using different browsers, running malwarebytes, I found that it was the
 whole laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I refreshed my laptop and at first this was fine. I noticed that my CPU and disk were always near or around 100% and that my laptop lagged sometimes. So I checked for windows updates – I downloaded the updates and this took 4 days(perhaps this was &nbsp;sign).
 Once completing the download and restarting, I got the message "we couldn’t complete the updates, undoing the changes" – it did not change and after searching on the internet I went into recovery mode and did a system restore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, now it seems, my laptop won’t let me run things as administrator; I tried to open system restore and I got a message “system restore could not start”. I tried doing a windows update but it is just constantly searching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I run in safe mode and would I then be able to do a system restore? I just can’t seem to access anything as I keep getting messages – “This service cannot be started, either because it&nbsp; is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with
 it.”</p>
<p>What exactly has happened to my laptop?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need any further information – and thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype Video Calling Issues - &#34;Call failed, internal error&#34;</h2>
                    Hi, my girlfriend and I were trying to skype call each other (she is using a MacBook Pro and I am using a HP Spectre x360 running windows 10) and we are having issues connecting in a video call. IMing between us works perfectly fine. I called Echo test
 calling and connection there was perfect. However, whenever I call her it says connecting for anywhere between 10 seconds and a minute and then I get one of two messages: 1) "Call failed, internal error" or 2) "The content of this message is unsupported".
 My call attempts don't pop up for her and hers don't pop up on my screen. We are both online and connected to a wireless internet connection. I can say that mine is pretty fast and reliable. I am using my school's wifi which can be affected by the number of
 people using it, but other similar services (like FaceTime on my iPhone) seem to work just fine with great quality. Anyone have any idea what might be causing my issue? Any help would be appreciated! I can give any additional informat

<p><span><span>Make sure that you and the person you’re calling with are on online status (Green dot colored) and using the latest version of Skype. Also, are you using
 Skype for Desktop or Skype for Windows 10 (UWP)? If you’re using the Skype UWP, I suggest try using the classic version of Skype which is the Skype for Desktop and make a call on that contact and check if you still having the issue.</span></span></p>

I don't understand the question. If you use OE for mail, why are you looking for it in IE? Please elaborate.

</p><p>I don't know if this is the issue with you, but it was with me. I assumed that what I was trying to do was to turn off the Narrator. That was the wrong function, What I was trying to turn off was the voice that read out the search results. That is not the
 narrator. &nbsp;To turn off the search voice, &nbsp;you must turn off Spoken Answers. See</p>
