<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2011 keep getting error message 1025 &#34;this message is too big and can not be appended&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am looking for a solution to this problem.... I keep getting the error message "this message is too big and can not be appended" when i use Outlook and it pops up continually. I am using version 14.6.2&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked at the post that talks about moving data to a new identity however this seems a little involved and i feel there must be a quick fix for the problem. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Why are my Facebook photo albums now limited to 100 photos&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> focususerwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are my Facebook photo albums now limited to 100 photos&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Samsung Focus (SGH-i917) running WP 7.5. One of my favorite features, and the thing I always show off to non-WP-users, is the deep Facebook integration, particularly the way that photo albums automatically update on my phone. Until last week,
 I was always able (with a good connection, of course) to see my entire photo albums, regardless of how many images were in the albums. Now however, the albums appear to be limited to 100 images. (My largest album is still less than 200 images, and I was always
 able to see the complete album before). <br />
<br />
Additionally, I can go to the Me part of the People hub and under "what's new" I can see the additional photos I've posted to those albums (beyond image 100), but when I tap on them, it briefly resolves, but then snaps back to image 100. So the phone is still
 somehow connected to those photos, but refuses to download them, although it did before.<br />
<br />
I've tried deleting and re-entering my Facebook account, and also deleting and re-connecting my Microsoft account and Facebook accounts, with no effect. If this is a policy change, it seems arbitrary - Facebook doesn't limit their photo albums to 100 images,
 so shouldn't my Facebook albums on my Windows Phone simply reflect the way they look on FB (as they always did in the past)?
<br />
<br />
Is anyone else experiencing this issue, and if so, is there a fix for it? <br />

            I think it is a Windows Phone issue, but then again, I have no proof of that.&nbsp; Mine is acting funky here lately as well, but with posts in general, not photos.&nbsp; None of my albums have more than 100 photos so I can't replicate the issue.<br />
<br />
According to https://www.facebook.com/help/118731871603814/, 1000 is the limit for photos, so if you have 100+, I don't see why you can't view them.&nbsp; Looking at their 'Known Issues and Bugs' page, I can't see any reference to this.&nbsp; Then when I go into Facebook
 Mobile, there is no "FB for Windows" mobile FAQ or anything, it's iOS, Android or FB for Every Phone, whatever that is.<br />
<br />
Try their mobile site, m.facebook.com and see if you can view the albums over 100 photos.&nbsp; If not, then you may want to submit a report using "Report Something" using the link above.&nbsp; I wish I could replicate, but I don't have anywhere near that many photos,
 even with all albums full, sorry.<br />
<br />
Also, did you try going to the bottom and seeing if it would load, say, 20 more after you got to the 100th?<br />

            Thanks for the quick reply. I did try (on multiple occasions) scrolling to the bottom as that used to prompt additional photos loading, but that no longer works. And I do use the Facebook mobile site at m.facebook.com and can see the full albums that way,
 but it's not nearly as good an experience as the integrated albums in the Pictures hub.<br />
<br />
I think the most frustrating thing is that it used to work fine, for years, and now it doesn't. Because of the timing (I noticed it last weekend) right after the Windows Phone 8 launch I'm inclined to think that has something to do with it, but I'm not sure
 what. <br />
<br />
Any idea where else I could report the issue to try to get it resolved?<br />

            I just started to notice this behaviour yesterday and it's been very annoying. I hope it's just a minor bug in the Facebook API and it'll get fixed soon.

            <p>I also have the same issue on my LG Optimus7 (E900). </p>
<p>Guess it's not a FB issue, 'cause the WP FB app has the same. If you try to browse an album with more than 100 pics it stops loading others ("load more") at 100th.</p>
<p>Hope someone will clarify soon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, it's still broken.&nbsp; Could it be that Facebook messed up the API somehow?&nbsp; Windows 8's Photos app and People app have the same problem with only being able to access the first 100 photos within an album.</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick reply.&nbsp; Yes, I can access the files offline on my ipad.&nbsp; My problem is being able to search for a a file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Currently, the only way I can get to the file (not connected to the internet) is to open files, browse, OneDrive--Personal Locations, and all the file show up, and then I have to scroll through all the files in the folder until I get to the one I am looking
 for.&nbsp; Sometimes I'm not exactly sure of the name.&nbsp; And scrolling through 1500 word files can get pretty tedious.&nbsp; When I type a keyword in the search bar I get nothing.&nbsp; So searching is my real problem.&nbsp; And when I open the Word app it doesn't even find the
 files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I am accessing OneDrive and Word both with the app.&nbsp; With no internet access I am able to open the files using OneDrive, just cannot search for a file (just have to scroll through all 1500 files).&nbsp; After I open the file I can then save it to word and then
 it I seem to be able to access through word.&nbsp; But that is the only way to get to a file through word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping to just be able to search or browse on my ipad using word, onedrive or file browse (when I don't have internet access) but it appears my only work around is to manually save a copy or scroll through all the documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the Word app, I am not seeing File&gt;Open, only Open.&nbsp; I then touch iPad (other Locations) and the only files showing are the one's I manually saved.&nbsp; Even clicking on Recent Folders, wants to open my OneDrive (which of course it can't because
 of no internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I can get to the files, better than nothing.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint Broadcast service not working -- Office 2011 14.2.2 SP2 not solved this problem</h2>
                    This is really weird problem. Two identical systems, iMac and MacBook Pro. Both running Lion 10.7.4 and Office 2011 14.2.2
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MacBook can connect to Broadcasting service and upload presentation normally. Presentation streamed and watched with iPhone, worked just fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But this iMac, can't connect to Broadcasting service. I've already done clean install for Office 2011, because I realized that his iMac once had 2008 installed. No luck :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas what to try next?</div>
                </div>

            OK. Problem solved. And this note for other who may have similar problems.
<div><br />
<div>After clean install I started to believe there is something wrong with the system itself. And yes, that it was.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had mixed up DNS settings when testing this broadcasting functionality. I had two DNS services configured in network settings and they didn't change without reboot. (Never happened to me before, but anyway)</div>
<div><br />
<div>So in my configuration OpenDNS 208.67.222.222 or Google DNS 8.8.8.8 didn't do the trick. When I removed those and used ISP's automatic DNS setup Powerpoint Broadcasting started to work just fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Old wisdom, always suspect your network settings :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Luckily I now have very clean Office 2011 installation it is remarkable faster than before, so not all this time was useless.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks to all for listening :)</div>

<h2>            How to spell check Pinyin in Word 2010 - have language pack and IME</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to spell check HanYu Pinyin in Word, but cannot find any way to do so. I have installed the Chinese language pack and the Chinese IME dictionary, and use the PinYin&nbsp;Simplefast Input method for entering Simplified Chinese characters. But
 I cannot find any option anywhere to get the spell check working in PinYin.</p>
<p>In particular the spell check needs to be able to spot the correct tone marks</p>

<p>ok I've tried the fix it tool and the suggested steps above re compatibility, but fix it is not removing the downloaded trial versions from my desktop, and the run in compatibility box is already unchecked. Office 2010 trial does not show up in installed
 programs at all, I assume because it was not fully installed the first time I tried to do it when it told me there was an unspecified error. Yet even though this is the case every time I try to install it again it keeps saying there is an existing trial version
 installed on this machine and therefore gives me the error message quoted above.</p>
<p>Any more ideas please?</p>

            All those tools won't work anymore, I think the trial period is over. I've tried every trick on this forum to get it to install, and there is no solution, only suggestions. For example, you could re-install Windows, and try to install it and it won't.

            This is a network setting. You may be able to change it in the phone or on your operator's website. Otherwise you will need to phone the operator.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with decrypting .p7m files sent to me. I've already added my s/mime certificate in my password keeper and it's selected under the advance security settings associated with the account. However every file being sent to me continues to show,
 "The security of this message cannot be verified because of an error."&nbsp; I was able to see these files using an older mac on outlook 2016 with sucess--but not on this new imac and new version of outlook.&nbsp; I'm hoping someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System:</p>
<p>MacOS Mojave version 10.14.4&nbsp; (2019 iMac)</p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2019 version 16.25</p>

<h3> remady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Onenote 2016 &#34;Content not yet available&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So I've had a sheet in my OneNote notebook for about a week or so - continuously being synced and whatnot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But suddenly today, when I haven't even used or opened the page, two of my sheets inside a section decided to show up as "untitled" and display "Content not yet available.&nbsp;<span>Sorry, it looks like this page was added from
 another computer and hasn't synced yet. Click here or press ENTER to reload this page."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of this, I've had a page that I created in the morning just disappear out of plain sight. I've had a recording and a lot of content on that page which I really need!!!</p>
<p>And I know it's been synced because I accessed it from both my computer AND my mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Potential Solutions I've tried:</p>
<p><span>1. I've tried logging out of all devices and logging back in, no solution.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. I've tried opening the notebook from multiple devices (computer, online, and mobile app) again with no avail.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. When I try to display the past versions of the sheets which are now named "untitled" (the "content not yet available" sheets), nothing shows up.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. I tried copying the pages to somewhere else but that displays an error as well.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There is nothing in the recycling bin of my notebooks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can anyone help me out? It hasn't been long since I've started using OneNote and the fact that I've already gotten problems really raises concern in its reliability...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I use office 365 business (offered by my university). All documents were created on my macbook and there are no devices that display anything correctly (all of them are looking at the same screens) hence no syncing to be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            French-language New Page gallery in English-language OneNote&#58; why and how to change that aberration&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Though Dutch and living in the Netherlands I only use software with user interface in English.</p>
<p>My Office 2010 OneNote has a strange 'feature': the New Page template gallery has by default only templates in French.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>under Academic: Notes simples sur le cours;</p>
<p>under Blank: Carte postale;</p>
<p>under Business: Notes ínformelles sur la réunion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why this aberration? How can I change it?</p>
<p>Where are these templates saved?</p>

            There should not be issues in uninstalling and reinstalling the language pack.<br />
If you are not comfortable and if the issue is not of much importance, then its better you do not try to do so.<br />

    <title>Creating a page Total at the foot of each page. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrispycb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a page Total at the foot of each page.</h2>
                    I have a column of data "Time", (in hours and minutes), over 4000 rows long (approx. 120 pages) which has a Total time on the last page.
<div>Im trying to create a sub total (or page total)l at the foot of each page, in line with the same time Column.</div>
<div>What function do I use to achieve this?</div>
<div>Im using the SUM function to add the entire column of time and I obviously don't want each sub total to be added to the grand total.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards &amp; thanks.</div>

            Thanks for that reply James, much appreciated.
<div>Ive tried that but unfortunately I get an error message saying "not enough arguments were entered for this function". &nbsp;Im not having much luck with the formula builder either!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Im inserting a blank Row &nbsp;at the foot of each page (very tiresome with 4000 rows), then using the formula:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=SUBTOTAL(K2975:K2998)</div>
<div><br />
<div><font><span>Is there something missing in my formula string?</span></font></div>
<div><font><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font><span>My data comprises 3 column (a start time, an end time, and the time duration).</span></font></div>
<div><font><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font><span>One row looks like this:</span></font></div>
<div><font><span><br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font><span>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Start time</td>
<td>18:00</td>
<td>End time</td>
<td>19:54</td>
<td>
</td><td>duration:</td>
<td>01:54</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
</span></font></div>
<div><font><span>The duration column uses the following formula:</span></font></div>
<div><font><span>
<p>=IF(<span style="color: rgba(27, 68, 223, 1)">S1</span>&lt;<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 0, 1)">Q1</span>,<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 0, 1)">(</span>1+<span style="color: rgba(27, 68, 223, 1)">S1</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 0, 1)">)</span>-<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 0, 1)">Q1</span>,<span style="color: rgba(27, 68, 223, 1)">S1</span>-<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 0, 1)">Q1</span>)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Where Q is Start Time and S is End Time</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is so I can subtract time that goes past 12 midnight.</p>
<p>All these cells are formatted to the time definition {HH} MM.</p>
<p>I can total all the durations at the end of the sheet without any problem.</p>
<p>The problem appears to be creating a SUBTOTAL on each page, using a total of the DURATION column.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help provided.</p>

<h2>            WHY YOU DON&#39;T LIKE PINK, Microsoft&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>WHY YOU DON'T LIKE PINK, Microsoft?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't show any shades of PINK at all in their basic palette of colours in PowerPoint, Word, Excel... etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not PINK?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft includes THREE columns dedicated to Blue and NONE to Pink!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quite like highlighting some text or background often, and unless I want to use the basic orange, green and a million shades of grey and blue presented by Microsoft, I have to search for any shades of Pink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter has been making her birthday invitations in PowerPoint, and guess what: I had to teach her how to find Pink because it is not shown in the basic pallet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell me, what should I tell my daughter WHY there is no Pink among the 70 standard colours chosen by Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By including only traditional basic "Male" colours (plenty of Blue and Grey), Microsoft is ignoring the population that loves Pink, and that includes all the Little Girls in the planet, and all the Big Girly Girls!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: </p>
<p>Not a Pink lover myself, but as a mechanical engineer I quite like using Pink when preparing presentations to be shown to the company's 95% of male staff, if only just to make a point that I'm a woman, not a man in disguise (to be accepted as a professional
 woman we females tend to copy the male standard style, I imagine in an attempt to be accepted, and also to camouflage ourselves: trousers and shirt, in Blue or Grey colours in particular, what a coincidence…).

<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>in the standard Theme colours that appear when you first click the shape or text fill, there is no pink on sight, of the 70 colours Microsoft decided to show:</p>

<p>You are looking at only 1 theme that is provided with Office, the default Office theme. But Office 2013 comes with 22 color themes beside the one you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find themes containing pink, please look at the other John's screen shot again. On the
<strong>DESIGN tab</strong>, look for the <strong>Variants group</strong>, then click on the dropdown in its lower right corner (the icon looks like a dash with a down-pointing arrowhead below). Click on
<strong>Colors</strong>, then scroll down the list of color themes displayed to the
<strong>Red Violet</strong> theme. Viola! Pink!</p>

            And that is the attitude that makes the (male) Blue and Grey colours very very important, and Pink a colour that must be hidden. Same culture that we have to had to put up with for the past many hundred years...

            There is nothing inherently masculine in blue or grey, nor feminine in pink. Baby boys were often dressed in pink and girls in blue until the 1940s, when the garment industry decided to switch.

<p>If Elon Musk invents the time-machine, then Microsoft can launch Office 1940. Can't wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until then, we are living in an era where girls love/adore/identify themselves with Pink. These girls are learning to use PowerPoint at school, with the inherent message that:</p>
<p>"Pink is not important, Blue is much much more important, therefore there are 20 shades of Blue in Microsoft's default theme palette, and no Pink on sight".</p>

    <title>Bug and Solution for Word 2016 Chicago Bibliography Style - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron w. hsu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug and Solution for Word 2016 Chicago Bibliography Style</h2>
                    <p>I ran into this problem and the solution required a rather technical fix that I am not sure many other Word users will want to do. I submitted a report on this to the Feedback Hub, but since it does not seem that the Feedback Hub and the community are connected
 (or at least, I do not see how they are) I am submitting the following solution to the community in the case that some other people may benefit from this research.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current Chicago Manual of Style (sixteenth edition) states, "Two or more references in a single parenthetical citation are separated by semicolons." However, when I have attempted to use the Chicago style in Word for Author-Date citations, I note that
 the style uses a comma to separate multiple references in a single citation, rather than a semi-colon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The offending line(s) in the file <em>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style\CHICAGO.XSL
</em>are lines 2757 - 2759:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;xsl:if test="not(/b:Citation/b:LastAuthor)"&gt;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &lt;xsl:call-template name="templ_prop_ListSeparator"/&gt;<br />
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Note the use of <strong>templ_prop_ListSeparator </strong>
instead of the more appropriate <strong>templ_prop_GroupSeparator</strong>. If you use the GroupSeparator instead of the ListSeparator you will get the semicolon instead of the comma for separating multiple references in a single citation. The result looks
 like this:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;xsl:if test="not(/b:Citation/b:LastAuthor)"&gt;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &lt;xsl:call-template name="templ_prop_GroupSeparator"/&gt;<br />
&lt;/xsl:if&gt;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The way that I fixed this was to create a copy of the
<em>CHICAGO.XSL </em>file and make the change their, and then use that new file instead of the old.&nbsp; If you do this, you will need to find the block testing for
<strong>b:StyleNameLocalized </strong>(line 2124 in my version) and go through the names and change them to something other than CHICAGO or you will not be able to differentiate your copied file from the original file in the style menus.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I hope this helps someone and allows them to get the citations that they want without the trouble. I couldn't find any direct help on this online, so good luck!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" />

    <title>How do I prevent pictures from being split across pages when - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I prevent pictures from being split across pages when printing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using OneNote 2010 to annotate a document, and then I want to save the OneNote page as a PDF.&nbsp; So what I've done is, I used a file printout of my blank PDF into the OneNote page.&nbsp; Then I covered the "printout" with arrows and explanations and whatever
 else.&nbsp; At first when I saved the annotated version as a PDF, it worked fine -- one "file printout" page per physical page on the pdf.&nbsp; But then I replaced a page and moved things around, and now when it saves the PDF each "file printout" page spans two pages
 on the PDF, getting cut in half.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from doing it all over again, is there a way to fix it so that it doesn't split pages in two?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't think there's any surefire way to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that when you printed things out the first time, it worked because the way the PDFs were inserted just happened to align with where the page breaks occur when OneNote printed/saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, once you move things around, all bets are off as OneNote doesn't show you where page breaks are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess you could have 1 PDF per OneNote&nbsp;page and use the "Paper Size" option in the view tab to limit the page size. Then each OneNote page you print should fit on a physical paper page.</p>

<p>Hello!&nbsp; &nbsp; Thankyou for taking the time to help us!</p>
<p>The OS Build Number is 10.0.15063.968 and the problem started while downloading information on JW Library, the App returned to Homepage and then would not 're-load' (it would get as far as the logo and then return to the Homepage)&nbsp; I re-installed the App
 several times, and made sure my Phone was updated. The problem seemed to start when a Microsoft update occurred?</p>
<p>(?) ......... anyway I finally 'reset' my Phone last night and re-downloaded JWLibrary and now all is working correctly, but&nbsp; I also uninstalled many of the 'new' added apps that came with that Microsoft update. (This phone is used as music/video player
 so isn't always connected to the internet, I only connect it to WIFI when I want to download something) I also downloaded JW library onto the device rather than onto the SD Card, and maybe that helped?</p>
<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
<p>Jan</p>

<p>Here is another approach you might like. Select the cell you want copy and then run this macro...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub CopySingleCell()<br />
&nbsp; If Selection.Count &gt; 1 Then Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; On Error GoTo NothingSelected<br />
&nbsp; Selection.Copy Application.InputBox("Select the cells you want to copy that value to...", Type:=8)<br />
NothingSelected:<br />
End Sub</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It will ask you to select the range to copy that cell&nbsp;to (note.... you can select as non-contiguous range if need be)... click the OK button once you have made your selection.<br />

<h2>            Assigning Message Policy in Teams</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a couple of issues trying to assign messaging policies in Microsoft Teams &amp; Skype for Business Admin Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm trying to assign messaging policies to users in Microsoft Teams but for the majority of them I am getting an error. (<span style="color: rgba(22, 35, 58, 1)">Error&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(22, 35, 58, 1)">We failed
 to assign the Teams Messaging policy.</span>) From all the searching that I have done I have found that this is linked to Skype for Business. I have assigned all users the licence for Skype for Business the issue I am having is that the messaging policies
 will only apply to those "Users in Cloud". We are using a hybrid setup with all users being created in active directory first, I just don't know how to sync them up to be users in the cloud.</p>
<p>

</p><p>2. Trying to apply the messaging policy to multiple users at once. I have tried multiple ways to try to get this to work but cannot work it out. I'm not sure if there is even the option to be able to do it.</p>

<p>Hello Benjamin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post in the forum. Based on my tests, the Messaging policy works for the users in the cloud. Based on the error message your provided using PowerShell, may I if the users you created in the Active Directory are synced to the cloud? Please
 go to <strong>Office 365 Admin Center-&gt;Users-&gt;Active users</strong>, there is a column called
<strong>Sync Type</strong>, please let me know the type of the affected users and the unaffected users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/grant-csteamsmessagingpolicy?view=skype-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, please make sure that when running the PowerShell cmdlet, you are using the user’s Active Directory display name.
