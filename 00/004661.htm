<h2>            9926 trashed after chkdsk run</h2>
                    <p>I rebooted 9926 and the system requested chkdsk. It took quite a while for the check to run and I could see many changes being made.
</p>
<p>When the system booted 9926 wouldn't start. It tried to repair itself but couldn't. Long story short I rolled it back and reinstalled 9926. Has anyone</p>
<p>else had this happen?</p>

<h2>            earned schedule management</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At todays date&nbsp; earned schedule management (in stead of earned value) seems to be commen knowledge. Literature tells you that this allows an accurate prediction of when a project will be finished. People use SV(t) and SPI(t), that are different from SV and
 SPI. However I do not find these parameters back in MS Project.&nbsp;Am I overlooking something. Can somebody tell me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>

            Eddy,
<div>To be honest I've never heard of "earned schedule management" but then I don't actively use earned measurement metrics so I haven't kept up with the latest. However years ago when I did work with EV, (a requirement on the contracts we performed under),
 I never did buy into the concept of schedule variance expressed in terms of money. In my mind expressing schedule variance as dollars (or whatever currency) is as misnomer - time is NOT money except for those who only understand money.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nonetheless, the classic concept of earned value runs deep and that apparently has been ingrained into Project. Reading a little bit of the literature about earned schedule management, it certainly sounds like a better approach and in fact the basic data
 for its implementation is already available in Project. It potentially could be implemented through the use of custom fields with formulas or for sure with some VBA, but as far as I know, the parameters for direct use of earned schedule management are not
 currently available in Project. The reason I say, "as far as I know" is because I do not have Project 2013, but I doubt it's available in the latest Project offering either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is sufficient demand from large customers, (i.e. those that drive the bulk of new features added to each new version of Project), then my guess is that other methods of earned value, (e.g. earned schedule), will be added to future versions of
 the Project application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Those are my thoughts.</div>
<div><br />

            The simplest way is to set the rate for each resource to $1/hour. Then earned value and earned schedule are the same thing. Otherwise you need formulae as John suggests to calculate the values, but you can't calculate timephased earned value in a custom
 formula. Us the same calculation as for earned value assuming $1/hour.

            <p>Hi Folks, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. I just&nbsp;found a very easy way myself.</p>
<p>You know earned schedule management means looking how much value you have created at date x and then see according to the plan when this amount of value should have been created date y. So you just look to how far your project is and then change the date
 of evaluation untill the numbers match about. </p>
<p>For completion :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) AT = how many days your project is busy - this is easy</p>
<p>2) have a look to your EV (BCWP) of today</p>
<p>3) play with the date till you find a date that your EV (BWCP) of today matches PV (BCWS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ES(t) = date - AT</p>
<p>SPI(t) = ES(t)/AT </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allows you to estimate project end time = Actual duration +(Planned duration-ES(t))SPI(t)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Imprint29,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;presented it at a conference for project managers. Send me a mail on eddykunnen'apple'hotmaildotcom.</p>
<p>I'll give you the presentation. Basically it was fun to do. And I still use it although differently sometimes, depending on the need.</p>
<p>It helps me to make progress visible to my stakeholders en give a better indication where you are with the project.&nbsp;The team always needs to get used to such metric, so I'm carefull when showing it. Depends a lot on the environment / position you are.
</p>
<p>From the conference I learned that it should be available in MS project somehow.
</p>
<p>(For a simpler project I just used, tracked how many tasks where completed as function of time, since here we don't spend too much effort yet on estimation effort., and people could update when they finished a task in excell)</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards,</p>

                    <p>Hello All,<br />
New to this so apologies in advance.<br />
<br />
-I want to have a track record for changing data expressed as a dated series of values to check trends.<br />
-I have a series of cells linked to the same data source. I want to fix/freeze the value from the linked source at pre-determined dates.<br />
-As a result I would like to end up with a series of value points showing a trend in the data<br />
<br />
My problem:<br />
I can link and date but I do not know how to fix/freeze the data at particular dates in time<br />
<br />
Here is the sort of formula I am using: =IF(TODAY()=DATE(2018,7,3),'Summary'!S4,"")</p>

</p><p>Hi Neha,</p>
<p>Thank you for the direction.</p>
<p>In this grade spreadsheet, I want to link each of these columns I:AU &nbsp;to the same source which generates a number grade.
</p>
<p>At the end of each unit I want to capture the value at that point. For example, in the week 12-18 Sept I want to capture the value at that time in column I. I want to keep all the rest of the columns O:AU blank until that point and keep the value in column
 I static. Then in the week 7-13 Nov I want to capture the value from the source at that time in column O. etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking something like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(TODAY<span style="color: rgba(0, 97, 7, 1)">()</span>=DATE<span style="color: rgba(0, 97, 7, 1)">(</span>2018,7,3<span style="color: rgba(0, 97, 7, 1)">)</span>,'SEM 1 Summary'!S4,"") to capture the value for each
 unit keeping the others blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is capturing and freezing the value for each unit.</p>
<p>I've been advised to use vba&nbsp;something like this:</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cells(Target.Row, "G") = Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            Why is Outlook.com so slow for IMAP and certain web operations&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm recently in a process of trying to switch from GMail to Outlook.com. There are things that I like better with Outlook.com, but there seem to be more areas that I'm having problems with. Two of the major problems are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If a folder has a large number of emails, web operations in that folder become super slow and almost never finish. For example, if I select all emails (~600) in a particular folder and try to categorize them, the operation would fail with a message "<span>Something
 happened on our end. Please refresh your browser or close it and sign in again.". The operation did complete for a few emails in the first screen. The same thing happened when I tried to empty the Deleted folder which had thousands of emails. I ended up deleting
 one screen at a time, which is extremely time consuming. The Deleted folder wasn't even able to load and show all the emails in it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Accessing Outlook.com using IMAP (e.g., the Windows 8.1 Mail app) is very slow. Although I selected "Download emails as they arrive", new emails often take a long time before being synced to my computer. When I try to manually sync the account, it often
 reports "xxx isn't available". Many people appear to be experiencing the same issue and there are multiple questions asked on this site (e.g., http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/06978cf8-9423-4115-8579-6dead78aa092), but I can't find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that my Internet connection is very fast (Speedtest.net shows ~1000 Mbps both download and upload) and I've tried different computers and different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and IE), the above problems exist regardless. And for point (2), as
 a comparison, Gmail and Yahoo IMAP performs much better so it's not some mysterious software problem with my environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any suggestion as I'm trying to get the transition to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to us.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing some issues while accessing Outlook.com through a web browser and the app.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In regards to the first issue you are facing, as Outlook.com is a web based product hence at times server might get busy and because of that the website may or may not work as expected. It may take some time
 to load all the messages from the server and to show up in your web browser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate for all the troubleshooting steps that you have taken to resolve the issue and I am sorry for the inconvenience you have faced for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to optimize your browser by following the steps provided in the article below and see if it helps:</span></p>

</p><p><span>As far as second issue is concerned please try running the Modern UI App troubleshooter from the link below and see if it resolves the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Komal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) First, the webmail problem doesn't just happen occasionally. It happens every time. I tried doing this for several days and at different times of the day -- it always failed with the same message "Something happened on our end ...". Resetting IE doesn't
 help at all. As I mentioned, I also tried different computers and all major browsers. It's more like a software/scalability issue with Outlook.com servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I tried App Troubleshooter, but it didn't find any problem. Again I wouldn't think it's software problems with my particular machine environment as I have the same problem on two different Windows 8.1 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If I may ask, what's the resolution for the post I linked to (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/06978cf8-9423-4115-8579-6dead78aa092)? There appear to be some private messages that I can't see.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4) Also the slow IMAP problem seems to be confirmed by many users. Considering how small the fraction of users that would actually take the time to report the problems they have, I would say this issue
 is affecting lots of lots of people -- have it ever reached your development team at all and what's their response?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5) One user was saying he had almost a year of back-and-forth&nbsp;correspondence&nbsp;with Microsoft tech support, and basically got the information that Outlook.com server throttles IMAP speed --
 can this be confirmed so that we can cope with it in the right way?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks a lot for the help!</span></p>

            <p>I am experiencing the same issues trying to sync a new macbook pro mail app with my hotmail account. &nbsp;I have spent countless hours with apple care tech support, over the phone and using screen sharing I might add, sending reports and screen shots to their
 engineers. &nbsp;We isolated the problem to the outlook.com servers. &nbsp;I can send and receive emails through gmail in milliseconds but with hotmail, I still don't have messages showing up. &nbsp;Interestingly as well, the apple care tech person I was working with has
 never seen this happen before. &nbsp;Sending messages takes forever and receiving them takes just as long. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have done some testing on the IMAP issue with outlook. &nbsp;Basically I created a simple test to retrieve email header information from outlook's IMAP server and Gmail's IMAP server. &nbsp;The folder being retrieved from is the INBOX. &nbsp;Both have about a few 1000
 emails in the INBOX folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My test: Retrieve the latest 1000 email headers from provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: &nbsp;Making the IMAP FETCH call to retrieve the latest 1000s email headers take a few seconds using Gmail's IMAP Server. &nbsp;Whereas, using Outlook's IMAP server it take minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: IMAP implementation of Outlook's IMAP server seems faulty. &nbsp;It seems that email headers are being retrieved one at a time from the Outlook IMAP server. &nbsp;Whereas for Gmail, they come in batches of 100s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continued testing other email providers: &nbsp;iCloud, AOL, Yahoo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result of other email providers: &nbsp;Email headers are retrieved very quickly and come in batches of 100s of headers at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let me know if this information helps and please resolve this ASAP.</p>
<p>

            <p>Same problem here with IMAP protocol and Outlook.com. Why Microsoft does not do anything to fix this? Maybe they do not want us to use IMAP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, are you planing any improvement on IMAP protocol in any near future? I think Outlook.com IMAP implementation is by far the worst compared with GMail, iCloud, etc. If they want to keep customers happy they should listen and improve the service.</p>
<p>

            Hi, everyone!<br />
<br />
Do you continue to see any issues syncing your contacts with the new version of the Microsoft My Phone service launched today? If yes, please post to a new thread.<br />
<br />
There were many improvements introduced with this new version and you shouldn't continue to see to some of the issues reported below.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

    <title>arrow button gets confused at end of page in hebrew - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bnabutovsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            arrow button gets confused at end of page in hebrew</h2>
                    Very simple problem: I have a page of hebrew text (which goes from right to left). I am going along the line with the left-arrow (this is going forward in Hebrew). When I reach the end of the page, instead of going to the next page, where the text continues,
 the cursor starts jumping from the end of the line back one character, then forward to the end of the line again, then back again, ad infinitum.&nbsp;
<div>Sounds like a bug to me.&nbsp;<br />

            It occurs in ALL documents. I think this is a new bug that appeared after I installed the new service pack for office (which, of course, the windows update tool detected and downloaded automatically).

            I jsut noticed something similar: in Russian (yes, I work in all those languages), the same left-arrow doesn't work either. When you reach the top of the page, it doesn't want to jump to the previous page, it gets stuck on top. Russian goes left-to-right,
 just like English, so, unlike in Hebrew, the left arrow signifies going back in the text.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked your account and it shows that email forwarding is currently enabled on your account. We recommend that you disable email forwarding on your account and then check if you are then able to receive emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can disable email forwarding by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>.</li><li>Click the <strong>gear</strong> icon located at the upper right part of the page and choose
<strong>More mail settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Managing your account</em>, click on <strong>Email forwarding</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Don't forward</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2>            IMS settings Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this has been asked already. I have a sim free Lumia 950 on the EE network, this supports 4G calling (VoLTE) but it requires the IMS settings to be registered. Is there any way this can be done to enable 4G calling?. I have copied this from the Microsoft
 website. Only OEMs can do this!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read below, can this be enabled in a OS update?</p>
<p>

<p>OEMs can configure the default settings and toggle for IMS services to meet mobile operator requirements. Users can later manually change the default values for these settings if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Constraints: None<br />
This customization supports: per-IMSI value, per-device value<br />

Specify an Owner.<br />
Add the resource-only .dll file and the language MUI packages (*.dll.mui) for the languages you are supporting. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
Add the resource-only .dll that contains the custom display string by setting the BaseDll asset to point to the location of your base MUI DLL file. For example: C:\Path\DisplayStrings.dll.<br />
Add the language MUI packages (*.dll.mui) for all the languages you are supporting and have localized strings for. To do this:<br />
Set the asset's Name to LanguageDll/$(langid) where $(langid) corresponds to the language. For example: LanguageDll/en-US.<br />
Set the asset's Source to the location of the .dll.mui file for that language. For example: C:\Path\en-us\DisplayStrings.dll.mui.<br />
Repeat the previous steps for the other languages.<br />
The following example shows the customization answer file entries for en-US, fr-CA, and es-MX languages:</p>
<p><br />
&lt;Asset Name="LanguageDll/en-US" Source="C:\Path\en-us\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" /&gt;<br />
&lt;Asset Name="LanguageDll/fr-CA" Source="C:\Path\fr-CA\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" /&gt;<br />
&lt;Asset Name="LanguageDll/es-MX" Source="C:\Path\es-MX\DisplayStrings.dll.mui" /&gt;<br />
For more information, see Create a resource-only .dll for localized strings.<br />
Define Targets or conditions for when a variant can be applied, such as keying off a SIM's MCC, MNC, and SPN.<br />
Define settings for a Variant, which are applied if the associated target's conditions are met.

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Beginning with Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;GDR1, the ShowVoLTEToggle setting under the CellCore/PerDevice/CellUX/Critical settings path must be set. This ensures that OMA-DM VoLTE features for certain mobile operators are functioning properly. Once you have made this
 change to your answer file, the ShowVoLTEToggle setting in the CellCore/PerIMSI/$(__IMSI)/CellUX/Critical settings path will be ignored. You may remove or leave the per-IMSI setting in your answer file.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Set the value for ShowVoLTEToggle to one of the following to hide or show the VoLTE toggle.<br />
0 or 'No'<br />
Hides the VoLTE toggle in the Settings &gt; Cellular+SIM &gt; SIM screen.<br />
1 or 'Yes'<br />
Shows the VoLTE toggle in the Settings &gt; Cellular+SIM &gt; SIM screen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Testing:<br />
Flash the build containing this customization to a phone.<br />
Go to the Settings &gt; Cellular &amp; SIM settings screen.<br />
Verify that the correct settings and toggle values are showing up depending on the values you specified for ShowVoLTEToggle, SwitchIMS, SwitchSMSOverIMS, and SwitchVoiceOverIMS.<br />
If you customized the VoLTE toggle label and description, verify that the correct localized strings are showing up based on the phone language.<br />

<h3> sanjosecharley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suppressing ruler in &#34;old&#34; full-screen view</h2>
                    I prefer to edit a document without any of the ribbons, toolbars, menus, and other distractions. In Word 2007, I can do in the&nbsp; full-screen mode (alt-v-u). But the ruler has showed up, even&nbsp;in this mode, and I can't get rid of it! Any idea how to get rid
 of the ruler in this full-screen mode?

            I don't have Word 2007 to test. However, I see no ruler in Full Screen view in either Word 2010 or 2013, so whatever this was, it must have been fixed.

            <p>Stefan, I don't understand what it is&nbsp;that Greg confirmed...? I certainly hope you don't think that he confirmed that&nbsp;my problem doesn't exist! Would you like me to post a screen shot of the ruler in "old" full-screen view?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found a link for&nbsp;Word&nbsp;2003&nbsp;that says this: "This is a combination of tools &gt; options &gt; general &gt; provide feedback with animation and View &gt; ruler. With the former checked and the latter unchecked, you get the auto-hide view. With the latter checked you
 get the constant display mode." I guess you must know about that since your name shows up in a lot of these old posts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I suspect there is some unlikely combination of switches within Word 2007&nbsp;that I chose that has turned on this ruler and won't let it go away. I sure would appreciate help figuring out what it is!</p>

            I just meant that Greg confirmed my experience of Full Screen mode.<br />
<br />
I always have both the horizontal and the vertical ruler displayed and I don't see any rulers in Full Screen. Could you please provide a link to the thread that discusses the options you mention?<br />
<br />
As far as I know, the ruler display options are stored in the registry, not in Normal.dotm, so renaming the template wouldn't make a difference.

            I ultimately bought a new computer and installed Word 2010 on it, and as of right now I don't have that silly ruler on the top. I'm paranoid about changing anything in File-Options-Display or File-Options-Advanced for fear of bringing back the rule, but
 so far so good.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb3c2449-9d87-422f-8e8e-f4c3b65336aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb3c2449-9d87-422f-8e8e-f4c3b65336aa" /></a>

<h3> mollyelizabeth  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reverse the column order of a list box at runtime&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>In certain conditions, I need to reverse a form to read from right-to-left at run-time.</p>
<p>I've had success with almost everything, but I'm stuck on multi-column list boxes, where the column order would need to be reversed to be logical. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?</p>
<p>I need this to work with multiple list boxes on multiple forms--like to check the control type and if it's a list box, run a routine to reverse the column order. To complicate matters, some of my list boxes have a rowsource that is set in code and changes
 based on other selections on the form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>In English, my list box flows like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Category&nbsp; |&nbsp; Title&nbsp; |&nbsp; Subtitle&nbsp; |&nbsp; Author&nbsp; |&nbsp; Price</p>
<p>In right-to-left languages, the column order doesn't flow logically, instead it would be (translated, of course):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price&nbsp; |&nbsp; Author&nbsp; |&nbsp; Subtitle&nbsp; |&nbsp; Title&nbsp; |&nbsp; Category</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep feeling like if I think hard enough then a simple solution will come to me, but it hasn't yet. Any advice? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            How to circumvent the infamous &#34;Please wait while the installer finishes determining your disk space requirements&#34; issue</h2>
                    <p>I realize this isn't technically 'installing'or 'activating' Office, but I don't believe the other choices apply.</p>
<p>Working with a MS virtual machine...Windows Vista Enterprise SP2.&nbsp; I'm trying to do a 'Change Microsoft Office' from Programs and Features to enable the Web Components option (which is already installed).&nbsp; Every time I try to do the&nbsp;'Change', the first screen
 comes up OK, but when I click Next, I get the "Please wait while the&nbsp;installer finishes determining your disk space requirements" message.&nbsp; It never completes.&nbsp; I've rebooted the VM and host PC multiple times, but get the same result every time.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get around this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any/all your&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>
<p><span>Try executing the following command in the elevated mode of the command prompt which does the trick.<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start; and then on All Programs.<br />

While the above suggestion didn't work by itself, it did help.&nbsp; I was able to figure out the following&nbsp;ridiculous sequence in order to get around the issue.&nbsp; I have no idea why it works, but it does (for me anyway).&nbsp; I did this on 3 different VMs and it worked
 every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Log in as local Admin</span></p>
<p><span>Start Task Manager and let it run</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Processes tab</span></p>
<p><span>If an msiexec process is running, end it</span></p>
<p><span>Map a drive to \\Server\Installation Folder</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Right-click Command Prompt &gt; Run as Administrator</span></p>
<p><span>At Command Prompt, type Z: (or whatever drive was mapped to \\Server\Installation Folder)</span></p>
<p><span>Type msiexec /i pro11.msi - this will start one MS Office setup routine</span></p>
<p><span>The screen will give you choices - choose Add/Remove Components (the first selection)</span></p>
<p><span>Click Next</span></p>
<p><span>You will get a message saying "Please wait while setup finishes determining your disk space requirements"</span></p>
<p><span>Don't cancel setup</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Right-click MS Office 2003 &gt; Click Change &gt; Click Next</span></p>
<p><span>This will start a second MS Office setup routine</span></p>
<p><span>You will get the same "Please wait while setup finishes determining your disk space requirements" message</span></p>
<p><span>Don't cancel setup</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Task Manager:</span></p>
<p><span>End process on the msiexec process that has the largest memory size (started by local Administrator) - this will shut down one MS Office setup routine</span></p>
<p><span>End process on the remaining msiexec processes, ending the one belonging to System last</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Applications tab and end task on MS Office 2003 Setup - this will refresh the entire screen aside from Task Manager and the Command Prompt</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go back to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Right-click MS Office 2003 &gt; Click Change &gt; Click Next</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This time it should work properly</span></p>

<h2>            How do I get a response from an escalated issue</h2>
                    <p>My Skype account is locked, and have looped on the support page for days, I rang Microsoft and they told me they do not do phone support for Skype. &nbsp;As I was not able to get on to anyone on Skype online, they escalated the issue and told me I would get an
 email 24 to 48 hours. &nbsp;That was 5 days ago and I have only had an email 1 hour later with the support page which they agreed would not help me. &nbsp;The email was from a no reply email sender. &nbsp;In other words - I am not able to speak to anyone about my account.
 &nbsp;Only robots who send you around in circles on the support site.</p>
<p>Microsoft have charged my Amex card for monthly subscription, locked me out. &nbsp;I need to cancel that and get my last year's billing account for taxation.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having the same problem. Microsoft locked me out of my account. It wants me to use the email I used to set up Skype originally to reset password. That email was cancelled years ago and email addresses on my Skype account were updated at the time.</p>
<p>I go through endless questions from a robot to prove that I am me, and no matter what I try, no luck. It now tells me to set up a new account. How stupid. There is no way of deleting my old account and I'd lose my Skype credit (even after access was cancelled
 it still accepted top-ups to my account, which I'd also lose). And my contacts will now have two of my Skyoe addresses, one of which I can no longer access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to contact Helpdesk or customer service centre, either by phone or email, and tells me robot email address is unmonitored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that Microsoft always manages to turn a perfectly good bit of software into something absolutely useless. Why is there no accountability, Helpdesk, or complaints centre. And why is it impossible to get my Skype credit back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated. Sjaak</p>

<h2>            Possible to change outline level without changing paragraph indent, font, alignment details&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to change the outline levels on a document without changing its details like paragraph indent, font, and alignment. I though I had the document properly formatted in terms of spacing, indentation, font, and paragraph alignment, but then learned
 that the outline levels were done incorrectly. When I try to change a line from Level 1 to body text it removes the details that I had (from ex. Bold and centered alignment to left and italic). Is there anyway for me to keep my details, or is it something
 that I need to redo throughout the document?

            <p>After you have applied one of the built-in headings, you can't change the Outline level. You will have to use some other style, such as Normal (Ctrl+Shift+N) or simply apply the appropriate heading level. The latter solution is the easiest, by far.</p>

            Just select <i>Format &gt; Document</i>, select the <i>Layout</i>&nbsp;tab at the top and click on "Different first page." That will give you an&nbsp;<u>independent</u> header/footer for the first page, and a common header/footer for the rest of the document.
<div><br />
<div>As for the page numbers being bold, just select them and cancel the bold attribute (<i>Command B</i> or use the Ribbon's
<i>Home</i>&nbsp;tab and click on the <b>B</b>&nbsp;button).</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you choose one of the Built-In header styles from the dropdown menu in the Ribbon's
<i>Header and Footer </i>purple tab (which only shows after you do <i>View &gt; Header and Footer</i>), pay attention to the clarifications in parenthesis, as Word can also give you different headers/footers for even and odd pages. This will confuse you if you
 don't realize that you chose it. At any rate, this setting is also controlled through
<i>Format &gt; Document &gt; Layout, </i>plus Word shows it inside a light blue tab as you access the header or footer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You don't have to use any of the Built-In styles, which are simply pre-made sequences. You can do
<i>View &gt; Header and Footer</i>&nbsp; and type your own text. The Ribbon's purple <i>Header and footer
</i>tab&nbsp;includes buttons for adding stuff like date and page numbers as well.&nbsp;</div>
