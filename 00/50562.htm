<h2>            printer EPSON XP-205 and WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a home net with two computers, the first one using WINDOWS 7 and the second using WINDOWS 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the computer with WINDOWS 7 is capable of printing with EPSON XP-205 printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May be, the IP printer adress for the WINDOWQ 10 computer is not correctly given.</p>
<p>How is it possible to correct the IP adress of the printer, say that it is à net printer with AUTO IP adress ?</p>

            <p>I answers myself.</p>
<p>The problem is solved.</p>
<p>The trouble was not due to WINDOWS 10 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
!</span></p>
<p>My home net has two branches : the "WIFI one", and the "not WIFI one".</p>
<p>And my computer functionned on the "not WIFI branch".</p>
<p>After connecting my computer on the "WIFI branch" of my home net, the re-installation of the EPSON XP-205 printer solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now WINDOWS 10 and EPSON XP-205 printer are working perfectly togther.</p>

            <p>Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please clarify?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by wifi branch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a machine that has Windows 10, I have unistalled and installed Epson software severall times and went through severall tries (the steps availabe online) and it does not work. It's tiring to lose hours in front of a screen like that and still have no printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have tried using the printer connected with wifi and connected with a cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is wifi/cable that branch opposition wou mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for any help you can provide,</p>
<p>since the update to windows 10, my parents have no printer and are forced to go to a shop and pay for documents they need printed. It's been several months. (I was the one that advised my parents to update to windows 10, and now they are angry - I use Linux,
 but at the time was really impressed by the new windows effort, until it started failing like this).</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to contact the developer of that device for the latest drivers and to find out about compatibility with Windows 8 for the device.</p>

            First of all, you should rethink using Java in the browser. It can easily be disabled in the Java control panel. The reason for this is that Java in the browser is one of the biggest threats to computer. If you don't have any programs dependent on Java,
 I would uninstall it completely. <br />
<br />
If you insist on using it you are way behind in updating it. A new version came out a week ago that closed a lot of security holes.<br />
<br />
Please download and install Java 7 Update 25 from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261</a>.html Accept the license agreement and then tick jre-7u25-windows-i586.exe. Don't get the one from java.com as it comes bundled with ****. Always use Oracle, the makers of Java.<br />
<br />
In the Java control panel set to check for updates daily so that you don't get behind again. An orange icon will appear in your notification area when a new update is released.<br />
<br />
If you chose to install it be aware that it may or may not fix the problem you are encountering but this is a Windows XP support board, not a Java support board.

<h2>            Advanced Warfare&#58; Cannot play online</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I cannot play advanced warfare online. I can play other games online, but not AW. When I go to play the game it signs me out of xbox live, and then when I try to sign into xbox live while in the game it says "your connection to xbox live has been lost. please
 sign in again." I used the install disc for AW then tried reinstalling, now I have deleted everthing from the install disc. I did download the update for AW as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I test my connection everything is fine except it says xbox stores: service alert. I have opened up the proper ports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I contacted Activision support and they said they are aware of this issue and are working on it. &nbsp;But they did not give an estimate of when it will be fixed. &nbsp;It obviously is not affecting everyone. &nbsp;Because I can still spectate the match. &nbsp;When I attempt
 to pick a class it freezes my xbox up and then I have to reboot the xbox. &nbsp;I can do anything else but join MP games. &nbsp;I hope either XBOX or Activision fix this quick or under my Christmas tree will be anything but a ONE.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that </span><span>you are facing an issue while changing Internet Explorer
</span><span>automatically detect settings option</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>This issue occurs if Proxy is enabled on the computer or due to virus/malware infections</span>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following questions so that we can help you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you using a proxy connection to connect to the Internet?</span></li><li><span>Is your computer connected to Domain?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Proxy servers are mostly used by networks in organizations and companies. Typically, people connecting to the Internet from home will not use a proxy server. Proxy settings are used to tell Internet Explorer the network address of an intermediary server
 that is used between the browser and the Internet on some networks. Changing proxy settings is something you usually only have to do if you are connecting to the Internet through a corporate network. If you use an Internet proxy server that requires authentication,
 you may encounter problems when you use apps that connect to the Internet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to the following article for more information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Using authenticated proxy servers together with Windows 8</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2778122/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2778122/en-us</span></a>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the following methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check the permissions on Internet Settings in registry. Refer to the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Type ‘<strong>regedit’&nbsp;</strong>and hit enter.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to the location below:<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings</strong></span></li><li><span>Right Click on <strong>Internet Settings</strong> and select <strong>Permissions</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Ensure that your user profile has <strong>full control</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><strong><span>Reset Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
I suggest you to Reset Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps. Refer the Microsoft help article below to Reset Internet Explorer:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11</span></span></span></strong></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental
 control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Method 3: Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could occur due to virus/malware infection. Let’s try to run the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is free from virus. Download and run the link below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong><span>:<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></strong></a></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist, I suggest you to follow the&nbsp;suggestions provided by&nbsp;<strong>DeepakHanda replied on April 14, 2014</strong>&nbsp;mentioned in the following link:&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>I have a Surface 2. My public library offers audiobooks to borrow, but requires that I install Hoopla. The MS store doesn't offer Hoopla, and I haven't been successful downloading directly from the app's&nbsp;website. Is there a work-around for this problem?
 I had no difficulty getting this app onto a pretty low-end Android! Thanks.</p>

    <title>Not able to turn on the Windows Firewall in Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not able to turn on the Windows Firewall in Windows Vista</h2>
                    <p>original title: Vista Scam to turn offf firewall</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Started getting message that services were closed and two days later got a call saying they were from windows. They had me go to my computer, bring up a screen that had my IP address on the right and another number on the left and asked for that number.
 Then they asked me what version of windows I was running. I figured the real windows people could tell and hung up. Now I can't turn on my firewall. I reformated my drive reloaded my software but a few minutes later the firewall was down again. My question
 is if I format the drive again and load a new copy of win 7&nbsp;instead of vista will I be safe? I don't know what the number&nbsp;I gave them represents.&nbsp;

            <div>Hi Lester52,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you get any error when you try to turn on the firewall?<br />
2. Which edition of Windows Vista do you use?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the following methods and check:</div>
<div><strong>Try the steps from the following article and check:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Diagnose and fix Windows Firewall service problems automatically</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/en-us</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to boot in safe mode with networking and check if you face the same issue.<br />
To boot into safe mode refer to the link provided below:<br />
a) Restart the computer.<br />
b) Start tapping the F8 key.<br />
c) You will get advanced boot option window.<br />
d) Select the option “Safe mode with Networking”<br />
Refer to the link provided below for more information on safe mode:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Try the steps mentioned here in Safe mode with networking and check:<br />
<div>“<strong>0x8007042c” error message when you try to start Windows Firewall</strong></div>
<div><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2530126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2530126</a></strong></div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The article is also applicable for Windows Vista.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires after 10 days from the date of installation.
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            Thank you for the suggestions. When I reformated the drive and reloaded a clean copy of the original windows disk I assume that should have cleaned out any viruses but they still were able to pull down my firewall. I figure I need to turn off the ping
 responce since they seem to know immediately&nbsp;when I&nbsp;hook back into the network. I am not sure how to turn that feature off. If that dosn't work the only two options I can think of would be to change from Vista to 7&nbsp;and if that dosn't work just replace the
 mothorboard and cpu.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Window 10 start menu critical error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timgpayne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 start menu critical error</h2>
                    <p>Have had this from first week after install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left click on start shows critical error. Functions will not work. Restarting has no effect. Right click allows limited access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This same problem is listed all over the net so it's a very common problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have limited computer knowledge so complex fixes and workaround a are of no use &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be great. But as this is such a common problem Microsoft should be issuing a correction patch. Let's face it theory issue loads. Why not for this problem when it's so extensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. Tim</p>

            Hello Tim,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you install all pending updates?<br />
2. Are you facing this issue in local account or Microsoft account?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are using a local account, you may sign-out from the current user account and login to the Microsoft account and check.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-microsoft-account</span></a></div>
<div><br />
If the issue still persists, you may follow the below methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1:<br />
Run a Powershell script using the following steps:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;1. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del. Select Task Manager.<br />
&nbsp;2. From the File menu, select Run new task.<br />
&nbsp;3. Type powershell, put a check mark next to Create this task with administrative privileges and tap or click OK.</div>
<div>Paste or type the following at the Powershell prompt, and hit Enter: </div>
<div><br />
Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Close the PowerShell window.<br />
5. Reboot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2:</div>
<div>This issue might occur, when some of the Windows files got corrupted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us run SFC scan by following the below steps and see if it brings any difference.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The sfc /scannow (System File Checker) command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with correct Microsoft versions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Press ‘Windows + X’ keys. <br />
2. Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin)’ to bring up an elevated command prompt. <br />
Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.<br />
3. In the command prompt type in the following command and then press Enter.<br />
sfc /scannow</div>
<div>To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 3:</div>
<div>If it doesn’t solve the issue, Let us try to run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management command (DISM).
<div><br />
It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available.
<div>1. Press Windows key + X. <br />
2. Click command prompt (Run as administrator). <br />
3. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</div>
<div>To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If SFC and DISM commands did not resolve the issue, I suggest you to place the Desktop system in Clean Boot and check if the problem exists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</div>
<div><br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
(The above link also applies to Windows 10)</div>
<div><br />
Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would recommend you to check for latest Windows Updates. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates. If you have any pending updates remaining to install, kindly install them and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>No relief. &nbsp;I tried all of this, but I got an error message with the Restorehealth command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a new (unusable) Surface Book. &nbsp;What's next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: &nbsp;no help from Microsoft, but my IT support said the only fix was to wipe it and start over. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are thinking about a Surface Book, my advice is to just say "No!"</p>

            <p>made my way all the way through and checked for updates (there was one outstanding) and it worked!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Not sure which process worked but something did. &nbsp;Ill keep my fingers crossed that it maintains.</p>
<p>The process was OK but it was difficult to find the update and we came accross it almost by accident, the search was not working as part of this error so just a matter of opening things and looking &nbsp;we got there in the end.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I wiped my computer and started fresh on January 2. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using the computer despite issues since then. &nbsp;(Removing the screen causes a forced restart every time I attempt to do so. &nbsp;The odds of this computer replacing my iPad given the hassles are pretty much zero.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where am I three weeks later. &nbsp;Critical Error with my Start Menu again. &nbsp;Where is Microsoft with an update to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the new work computer that I was looking forward to. &nbsp;I'll be turning it in. &nbsp;My Surface Book is quite simply garbage.</p>

            <p>Hi Kailashsajnani,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you cannot recover it since the recording hasn’t been recorded successfully. Do you get any notification about this when you are recording the meeting? What’s the detailed version of your Skype for business (****)client and **** Recorder Manager?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why can't I activate Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>If you received a message saying that Windows couldn't be activated, here are a few reasons why it might not have worked, and some things you can try to fix the problem.</p>
<b>
<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>contact support</u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-productcode/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>A different version of Windows or product key might have been used as part of a repair</p>
</b>
<p>If you took your PC to a repair shop or to a friend who builds and fixes PCs, it's possible that a different version of Windows was installed to complete a repair. Or if the repair shop or your friend used a different product key for your PC, that key might
 be blocked if it was used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>If Windows was activated before you took it to the repair shop or your friend, then re-entering the product key that came with your PC or original copy of Windows might solve the problem. You can also try reinstalling your original version of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-productcode/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>One copy of Windows might have been installed on multiple PCs</p>
</b>
<p>If you have one copy of Windows and installed it on more than one PC, activation might not work because the product key has already been used on another PC, or it's being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Normally, the rule
 to follow for most copies of Windows is 1:1, meaning that one copy of Windows can be installed only on one PC.</p>
<p>If your product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow, you'll need to buy a product key for each one of your PCs in order to activate them.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-productcode/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Counterfeit software</p>
</b>
<p>If you have a counterfeit copy of Windows that wasn't published and licensed by Microsoft, activation won't work because Microsoft won't be able to create a match between your PC's hardware profile and your 25-character product key.</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=71144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>How to Tell</u></a> website can help you figure out if your copy of Windows is counterfeit. If it is, you'll probably need to
 buy a new copy of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-productcode/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Used PC</p>
</b>
<p>If you bought a used PC with Windows already installed on it, it's possible that the product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>You might need to ask the seller you bought the used PC from for the original Windows DVD and product key. If the DVD and product key aren't available, or if you tried them and still can't activate, you might need to buy a new key.

<h2>            Countless problems when trying to download Halo 5&#58; forge.</h2>
                    <p>I'm just going to list a few of the problems i've had...<br />
While writing all of this, i realised that what i'm writing is pointless, but i didn't want to delete all that i've written. And hopefully if any solutions to any of these problems are found here, then it can help other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- So the first problem is pretty common, halo 5 forge was unavailable to me (and to many people) when downloading it directly, and the solution to this was to download the bundle and then cancel the other item in the bundle (or not, and download it too)
 so this is not really a problem anymore.</p>
<p>- The second problem is with the windowsApps folder in program files, because i have a slow-ish download speed halo 5: forge would take around 9 hours to download if it was consistent, however, while it is downloading, nobody in my house can use the internet,
 so this is a problem. My brother had already successfully installed it, and therefore i decided i would try to copy the files onto my computer, which i discovered where in the windowsApps folder. Anyways, it is impossible, as far as i can tell, to copy these
 files, after giving myself permission to the folder (and all of its subfolders) it still refused to allow me to copy the halo files, even running cmd as an admin and using xcopy, is still gave me "access is denied", i also tried doing this in the command prompt
 in the advanced startup menu, but to no avail, so i pretty much gave up on this (i was considering taking the harddrive out and plugging it into another computer to copy the files, or running another OS off a disc to copy the files where it would not care
 about the permissions, but i didn't try that yet)<br />
Even if i could copy the files, i'm not sure windows would allow it to run on another computer anyways, but i never got that far.</p>
<p>- My third problem is similar to the second, i tried to move the app to my harddrive from my brothers computer (with the legit move button), but it fails after about 5gb is copied and spits out an error (0x80070057), other people have had the same problem
 and nobody seems to have a solution, no help here. So i gave up on moving it this way.</p>
<p>- My latest problem seems to have fixed itself while I've been writing this, the download speed on the windows store of halo 5: forge went very slow while my internet was fine. Pausing and resuming the download allowed it to speed up again for about 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
That's all the rant i can think of. Many people are having trouble downloading this game, and I've seen other people having trouble moving it too.<br />
My First download got around 80% done before it failed because my hard drive didn't have enough space, then i went to install it on another hard drive and it restarted at 0% (which is probably fair enough)<br />
So now I've been running the download again all day and i hope it doesn't fail...<br />
<br />
Any ideas on a way to fix my move errors, or to somehow copy the halo install directory?<br />
Its sucks having another installation of halo 5: forge, but being unable to copy it.<br />
This entire discussion is probably more suited to reddit...</p>

            <p>My PC froze while 75% finished with the download, then I restarted the PC and was able to finish the download pretty quick. But when I try to PLAY the app/game it says
 the same message... And I cant even find the files to manually delete them bc uninstall apparently doesn't delete the glitched out files. I cant even do a system restore bc the windows apps are impossible to restore, or something. I'd really hate to have to
 completely WIPE my hard drive and re-install the base Windows 10, then have to update it into W10 Anniversary, then try to install forge again.</p>
<p>PLS HELP!!!</p>

<p>I finally got in touch with a Microsoft representative. &nbsp;I was told I may need to wait as long as 7 business days after the June 15 release date. &nbsp;Silly me, I thought that pre-ordering the product would help me get it sooner than buying it in the stores.
 &nbsp;Lesson learned. &nbsp;I feel bad for my son, because I set the expectation he would have it this week-end as a graduation present. &nbsp;Shocking that MSFT did not think they needed to get the pre-orders out for Dads and Grads.</p>

<div>if in stock, consider making the trip and getting it there (and asking them to</div>

            Hello, For what ever reason I also thought preordering would get it to me sooner. My experience is that you need to wait it out. The physical store can't help with the online part. I tried. They can however return the one you purchased online. Next time
 there won't be a next time! MS should have made it clear that you can just go buy it in store on the 15th.&nbsp;

            Same boat, horrible experience. Even the call center guy can't cancel my order because it is "processing". &nbsp;A week after release (when I could have just bought at my local Microcenter) and I'm still no closer to knowing if I'll have my Surface before I
 leave the country Monday, despite preordering 5/23 . Never again....

    <title>Relocate Windows 10 partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smilinmelvin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Relocate Windows 10 partition</h2>
                    <p>I want to upgrade the disk drive in my laptop, and my existing Windows 10 partition is not aligned properly for the new drive. Moving the partition and its contents is easy. Unsurprisingly, Windows fails to boot and just sits with a black screen with a cursor
 in the top corner, no disk activity, and, judging from the fan running at its slowest speed, little or no CPU activity either. As I said, no surprose there. What
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span> surprising is that there doesn't seem to be any recovery/repair tool that can deal with this. I've tried the install disk's automatic repair tool, which announces failure. I've tried the manual steps with
<em>bootrec</em> (/ScanOS, /FixBoot, /FixMBR, /RebuildBCD) to no avail. I've tried "bcdboot c:\Windows", which simply "fixes" things such that "bootrec /ScanOS" can no longer find a valid Windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to reinstall and lose all of the configuration and settings work I've done over the past few months. I would think there should be a way to make this work, but all my searching has failed to find one. I have just a single Windows partition,
 no "System Reserved" partiton. Yes, I can restore the state of that partition to undo my "fixing" attempts. Suggestions??</p>
