<h2>            Messenger,Imo,Viber etc apps for Windows  Phone&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Messenger: It is now popular apps for mobile platform.But interestingly windows phone has this app with limited features.No voice and video call option like Android and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imo: Microsoft Store has a Imo app but surprisingly that app is spam.No true Imo app is present in Store!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viber: A nice viber app has in store but with no video call option like Android and iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is that how long windows phone users served by this types of less featured apps?What is the actions from Microsoft to solve this issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Above that 3 apps representing the whole scenario of apps for Windows Phone. Windows phone can't succeed untill solve this issues.</p>

</p><p>Hi AndyTraum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You can follow this steps on creating a Local Profile for Windows 10</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p><p>step 1: click windows start menu</p>
<p>step 2: Search for PC settings in search bar</p>
<p>step 3: turn off internet access via Network page in PC settings as it makes it easier to just add a local account</p>
<p>step 4: go back to PC settings main page and click users and accounts</p>
<p>step 5: make sure that network access is off and click add user</p>
<p>
</p><p>the rest is straight forward</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Domain Settings what I know is certain restriction applies that depend upon your IT support. You might want to get in touch with them as well</p>

    <title>How to require one of three cells must be filled in before other cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenny.l  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to require one of three cells must be filled in before other cells can be filled in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Excel 2010 on Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have tried researching this, as shown below after the requirements description, and have tried applying different ideas, but have yet to get anything to work right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel sheet with locked cells and unlocked cells. The unlocked cells are the cells that users need to fill in. The range of unlocked cells requiring user input is J5:AA279.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unlocked cells that users need to fill in have data validation (DV)&nbsp;applied to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm looking to change is that users will not be able to fill in some cells until certain ones are filled in. I'll explain in detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>J5:L5 Current, and needed:</p>
<p>Unlocked with DV applied as Allow List with Source X (capital letter&nbsp;X) with ignore blank checked, but in-cell dropdown Not checked</p>
<p>There is also a custom error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>M5:O5 is currently set up in exactly the same way as J5:L5</p>
<p>
</p><p>What&nbsp;we need to change is&nbsp;to have it so&nbsp;users need to fill in 1 capital X in <em>
either </em>J5, K5, Or L5 <em>before</em> they can fill anything in to M5:Z5. </p>
<p>They must be able to enter information in to AA5 at any time, and AA5 can be blank.</p>
<p>Users should be restricted to entering in to only 1 of those cells; so, if K5 is filled in with the required capital letter X, then J5 and L5 need to remain blank so users shouldn't be able to enter anything in J5 or L5 if K5 is filled in accordingly. There
<strong>must</strong> be an X in either J5, K5 <strong>or</strong> L5 before they can move on to the next "set" of cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After users fill in 1 capital X in either J5, K5, or L5, then they can and need to&nbsp;fill in M5:O5, but cannot yet fill in P5:Z5.</p>
<p>They must be able to enter information in to AA5 at any time, and AA5 can be blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The capital letter X is still required, but users can fill in different combinations for this "set" of cells. For example, filling in M5
<strong>and</strong> O5 is valid here. Filling in just N5 is also valid. Leaving M5, N5, and O5
<strong>all blank</strong> is also valid here.</p>
<p>Note: If it's needed, I could add a fourth row here for "N/A" (not applicable) if a formula or coding needs an entry for this "set." (This would change this range to M5:P5, of course.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After users finish filling in M5:O5 as described, then they need to fill in P5:Q5, and cannot enter anything in to R5:Z5 until P5:Q5 are filled in.
</p>
<p>They must be able to enter information in to AA5 at any time, and AA5 can be blank.</p>
<p>This again has DV applied for the capital letter X as described above.</p>
<p>Users need to fill in either P5 <em>or </em>Q5 before they can move forward to R5:Z5. If a user puts a capital letter X in Q5, then they can't fill in P5, and vice versa.</p>
<p>They shouldn't be able to fill in P5 or Q5 until M5:O5 is complete as described above. Again, I could add an "N/A" to M5:O5 if needed&nbsp;(which would change that to M5:P5, and this one to Q5 and R5 accordingly, etc. - as described above).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This type of pattern continues, but I think that's enough to provide you with an idea of what we're looking to do.</p>
<p>The difference is that column X needs a date entered, and is only one cell unlike the above "cell sets".</p>
<p>Column Y can be any text, but is an optional column, and is only one cell unlike the above "cell sets".</p>
<p>Column&nbsp;Z can be any text, but is an optional column, and is only one&nbsp;cell unlike the above "cell sets".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously stated, they must be able to enter information in to AA5 at any time, and AA5 can be blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While users should not be able to progress horizontally until the proper information is filled out as described, users Should be able to randomly jump around vertically after one row is completely filled out.</p>
<p>For example, if row 5 is all filled out, then a user can jump down to row 270, and then move back to row 20, etc. However, if row 5 is not fully completed as described above, then they can't jump to a new row until all of row 5 is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users should always be able to open, close, save and print the document at <strong>
any</strong> time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have tried tweaking the data validation. I tried putting this in M5:O5 DV.</p>
<p>One suggestion was to try and use a COUNTA(J:L)&gt;0 formula, but I haven't had any luck with that.</p>
<p>I also tried =AND(COUNTA(J5:L5)&gt;0,EXACT(J5:L5,"X")), but I haven't had any luck with that, either.</p>
<p>I additionally tried =AND(COUNTA(J5:L5)&lt;2,EXACT(M5:O5,"X")), but couldn't get that to work either.</p>
<p>I also ran across something like =J5:L5&lt;&gt;"", but don't know how to get that to work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to find VBA code online. </p>
<p>The closest I've come is displayed below, but it seems to restrict the entry only to J5:L5, and won't let anything be entered until J5:L5 is completed. I'm also at&nbsp;a loss on how to tweak it to meet all of the above criteria.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what is best? </p>
<p>Is it tweaking DV with a different formula?</p>
<p>Is it using VBA coding? </p>
<p>Is it using VBA coding with the currently applied&nbsp;DV?</p>
<p>I'm really at a loss here. Is it even possible to do this in Excel as described?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
Dim i As Integer<br />
If Intersect(Target, Range("J5:L5")) Is Nothing And WorksheetFunction.CountA(Range("J5:L5")) &lt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "You must answer J5:L5 first", vbCritical<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 5 To 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Range("J" &amp; i) = "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Range("J" &amp; i).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please note:</p>
<p>We need to use Excel as described for this at this time. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I have an update. After a lot of more research, I found the following code that is working in combination with the existing data validation (as mentioned above). This takes care of the part where only 1 cell of 3 can be entered at a time. Now, I just need
 to figure out how to incorporate the rest of the requirements as stated above. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;Dim i<br />
&nbsp;For i = 5 To 279<br />
&nbsp;If Application.CountA(Range("J" &amp; i &amp; ":" &amp; "L" &amp; i)) &gt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;Application.Undo<br />
&nbsp;MsgBox "You can provide an answer for only J or K or L, but not more than one.", _<br />
&nbsp;vbOKOnly, "Invalid Entry"<br />
&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;Next<br />
&nbsp;For i = 5 To 279<br />
&nbsp;If Application.CountA(Range("P" &amp; i &amp; ":" &amp; "Q" &amp; i)) &gt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;Application.Undo<br />
&nbsp;MsgBox "You can provide an answer for only P or Q, but not both.", _<br />
&nbsp;vbOKOnly, "Invalid Entry"<br />
&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;Next<br />
&nbsp;For i = 5 To 279<br />
&nbsp;If Application.CountA(Range("R" &amp; i &amp; ":" &amp; "T" &amp; i)) &gt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;Application.Undo<br />
&nbsp;MsgBox "You can provide an answer for only R or S or T, but not more than one.", _<br />
&nbsp;vbOKOnly, "Invalid Entry"<br />
&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;Next<br />
&nbsp;For i = 5 To 279<br />
&nbsp;If Application.CountA(Range("U" &amp; i &amp; ":" &amp; "W" &amp; i)) &gt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;Application.Undo<br />
&nbsp;MsgBox "You can provide an answer for only U or V or W, but not more than one.", _<br />
&nbsp;vbOKOnly, "Invalid Entry"<br />
&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;Next<br />
&nbsp;End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I also just saw that in data validation for J5:L5, this formula, =COUNTA($J5:$L5)&lt;2, also seems to do the same as the above code. But, then it doesn't incorporate the required 'X' or date, etc., along with it. So, I would still need this to meet the other
 criteria as mentioned above if this is instead the best route?</p>
<p>The mentioned code here works with data validation, so that code seems to give me more at this time than this formula since this formula doesn't incorporate the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I on the right track with one of these here?</p>

            <p>Create a test worksheet, where your data validation 'X' cells are A1, B1, and C1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in D1, create a data validation, type=custom, and insert this formula:</p>
<p>=LEN(A1 &amp; B1 &amp; C1)=1</p>
<p>uncheck the box that says "ignore blanks"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try changing the value in D1 with blanks in A1,B1,and C1</p>
<p>
</p><p>then change any one of those cells to 'X' and try changing D1 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>try changing a second of those cells to 'X' and try changing D1 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that works, repeat the D1 data validation formula in E1 and F1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For the date cells, you can either add up the date values and see if the value is less than today, or check each cell and count the number &lt;&gt;0</p>

            <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it's tweaking it for the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I previously had =AND(COUNTA($J5:$L5)&lt;2,($J5:$L5="X")) in the custom data validation of J5:L5 with ignore blanks checked, in-cell drop down&nbsp;unchecked,&nbsp;and a custom stop error message. That required the capital letter X, and made it so an X could be entered
 in only J5, K5, or L5. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why, but when I apply the =LEN($J5 &amp; $K5 &amp; $L5)=1 in the custom data validation of M5:O5 with ignore blanks not checked, and in-cell drop down not checked with a custom stop error message, I get error messages when I try to enter a capital letter
 X in J5:L5; M5:O5 works just fine, but not J5:L5. How can I require the capital letter X in only J5, K5 or L5 with this method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me make some progress on this!</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If J5, K5, and L5 all have their own ["List" type] data validation (where the only option is "X" in an in-cell drop-down) then you don't have to check it in this other cell's data validation formula; X is already the only entry the users will be able to
 make in those cells, regardless of whether they select it via the drop-down, or if they hand-enter it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, selecting it will be the easier approach- if they try to type a lower-case "x" the data validation would reject it and that might cause them momentary frustration. You could work around this with a "custom" data validation that only accepts upper
 or lower case X, but then you lose the drop-down.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I just got confused- if you are selecting "Custom" as the data validation type, I wouldn't expect you to have the in-cell drop down option, as that applies to "List" data validation type. Note that I am using a different version of Excel so maybe that's
 the difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for it working in M:O but not J:L, can you post the validation you are using in each&nbsp;group of cells,&nbsp;for clarity?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preferred method: open the&nbsp;DV dialogue, and press Alt-PrintScreen. Save the image (my habit is to paste (Ctrl-V) into a blank powerpoint&nbsp;slide, then right-click and "save as picture" in jpeg format). Then in this forum window, you can insert the pictures.
 If you do that with both of your validation rules and indicate which cells they are applied to, that saves you some typing, and ensures the forum has a clear understanding :-)</p>
<p>example: </p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are actually not using drop-downs (on purpose), but we do still need to restrict it to a capital X as being the only valid entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like your idea of posting screen shots, and I thank you for asking. I used a new, clean document to obtain these just to ensure there are no conflicts with other&nbsp;settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I think I understand some of your confusion, and this has slowed me down some to realize it; my apologies - I've been trying to "speed" through this perhaps a little too much. When custom is selected, the 'in-cell dropdown' option isn't there; I wrote
 the above thinking it was still&nbsp;there since I didn't check the actual setting/screen before I wrote the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this is&nbsp;entered everywhere it's needed, it&nbsp;requires the capital X without a dropdown (and has custom stop error message):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=02cafd09-31ec-4be8-b75e-2162cdff6c9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d02cafd09-31ec-4be8-b75e-2162cdff6c9a" height="223" width="314" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I change the above in M5:O5 to the below, it requires an entry in J5:L5 before anything can be entered in M5:O5 just as needed.</p>
<p>It does not require the capital X, of course.</p>

            <p>for simplicity, my test workbook used A1:C1 as the equivalent to your J:L</p>
<p>
</p><p>note that I locked the cell references. In your case, you'll probably be auto-filling the DV down, so you'll remove the anchor ($) from the row number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This changes what you are doing in J:L from a 'hidden' list, to a custom formula that only allows a capital X, and only in one of those three cells. This DV is applied to A1:C1 in my example.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I then tried to combine the two formulas with AND, but I'm receiving failure messages. In M5:O5, I'm looking for both formulas to work together so that only X can be entered in M5:O5, and so that M5:O5 cannot be filled out before J5:L5 are. I tried several
 combinations of trying to put them together with AND, but I'm receiving error messages?</p>

            <p>First, to explain the parens: </p>
<p>Technically, I don't think the interior parens are needed- you could use </p>
<p>=AND(A1&amp;B1&amp;C1="X",D1&amp;E1&amp;F1="X")</p>
<p>but I find it visually easier to keep track of the order of operations when I 'group' the strings together inside an extra set of parens; e.g., (A1&amp;B1&amp;C1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on to your followup question- note that in the example from my last post, both parts of the AND are set equal to "X". In your sample, you retained the LEN([string])=1 which will allow
<em>any</em> character to be in the J:L range. However, I did not expect this to be a problem, because I thought you had a separate set of data validation already applied to just&nbsp;J:L that prevented any entries other than a single "X".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you don't have DV on J:L, then users will still be able to enter a lowercase "x" -or any other character(s)- in J:L... they just won't be able to subsequently enter anything in M:O. That could be frustrating to the users (especially if they
 don't understand why M:O is 'broken', which is why I'd suggest keeping the DV on J:L.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your concern about forwarding a calendar invite, please be informed that if the owner of the calendar sent you an invite that was shared to public, you'll be able to forward the invite via email. To do this, access the Invitation sent via email
 then forward the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private calendar cannot be forwarded via email. It is always better to have the owner of the calendar send the invites to multiple contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other questions or clarifications, don’t hesitate to reply.</p>

            <p>What is meant by "shared to the public"?&nbsp; I'm assuming that if you, @Amira_D, sent me an invite, then I would

<p>
</p><p>This is a major gap in the calendar system, IMO.&nbsp; This can be done with Google Calendar.&nbsp; What's the risk or problem in adding this feature in Outlook.com?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 message received times different from system time</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have found that the message received times on my inbox differ up to 10 mins ahead of the system time.&nbsp; I have checked the system time and it is correct.&nbsp; My ISP says it is not their problem.&nbsp; This is happening on both&nbsp; my laptop and desktop computers.&nbsp;
 My daylight saving times are set correctly.&nbsp; There are some messages, but rarely, that display the correct time, I must admit, this one has me very perplexed, any help much appreciated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, your ISP could actually display the Sent time rather than the Received time in webmail which would then again explain the difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you say that your time is configured correctly and your message headers are basically stamped "in the future", then Outlook does it still correctly as it is reading this information from the message header.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't get your ISP to update the time on their mail servers, you can configure Outlook to show the Sent column rather than the Received column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this choose:<br />
tab View-&gt; View Settings-&gt; Columns...<br />
From the left column, choose Sent and click on Add-&gt;<br />
Use the Move Up/Down button to place it above the Received field on the right.<br />
Select the Received field and click on Remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do your times show correctly now?</p>

<h2>            Canceling unwanted subscription after trial period</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a&nbsp;<span>Office 365 Home</span><span>&nbsp;trial subscription. I think it was free for the first month. But
 then I had to cancel it within 30 days otherwise I would be charged for the full subscription. The thing is, I forgot to do it.&nbsp; And I was charged for full annual&nbsp;</span><span>Office
 365 Home</span><span>&nbsp;subscription, which I don't want. Also, it was quite expensive (£79.99) and now, to be honest, I cannot afford it as I am unemployed.&nbsp; I tried to cancel it but
 even if I cancel there is a message saying that I am gonna loose access to the subscription at 16 January 2020 which is after the subscription is going to end. So, it means that I cannot really cancel it and get my money back. Is there any way to cancel it
 and get a refund ?</span></p>

    <title>Animate Two Objects at the Same Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajofsoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Animate Two Objects at the Same Time</h2>
                    
<p>I want to start two objects at the same time. I realize that setting the second object to start 'With Previous' typically accomplishes this. However, my first object's animation consists of seven 'Draw Custom Path' sequences. My second object won't start
 until the first object has completed all motions. How do I get the second object to start at the same time as the first object?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>AJ</p>

            MS confirmed this is&nbsp;a bug.&nbsp;<span> </span>
<p><span><span><span>The issue is due to a change in Office 365 ProPlus since end of 2016. User can type emoji by shortcuts, Office PG made a change to use
</span></span><span>“</span><span><span>Segoe UI Emoji</span></span><span>”</span><span><span>font
 to replace </span></span><span>“</span><span><span>Wingdings</span></span><span>”</span><span><span>font
 to render emoji. </span></span><span>“</span><span><span>Segoe UI Emoji</span></span><span>”</span><span><span>font
 is available on Windows 10 (seguiemj.ttf), but not available on Windows 7. That is why the emoji cannot by displayed in newer version of Office 2016 on Windows 7.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Now we have a workaround for this issue, could you please try it in your environment?</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy the Font file ”seguiemj.ttf” attached to “</span></strong><strong><span>c:\windows\fonts”,
</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">you can also find this file from your win10 system.
</span></strong></li><li>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then double click it to install in your win7 system.</span></strong></li><li>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then you can create a new Word/outlook file and try to type the Emoji characters, it will be displayed normally. If this is not applied immediately, please restart your computer.</span></strong></li></ol>

 IE 10 had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who said IE 11 is faster that IE 10 must show in which scenario its faster?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least provide option to uninstall update, and go back to IE 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE 11 is the reason I don't want to upgrade from Windows 7 to any newer version.&nbsp;There also if they don't allow to go back to Windows 7 then what are we left with. We need choice&nbsp;.</p>

            Pages of what? Have you tried searching google before asking your questions?<br />
<br />
Pretty much everything that there is to know about the N97's capabilities has already been written, you just need to search.

<p>There is NO answer, How long is a piece of string ? Different web pages (if that is what you're referring to) use different amounts of data ! As do different apps (you have 8 running in the background on boot up) If for some reason you opened Maps, Music
 Player and Opera Mobile the phone would freeze/crash, non data intensive apps like notes, calculater, messaging,Xplore etc, &nbsp;would allow the phone to function with a dozen or so running. As they all use processing power, once it's all used up the phone stops
 functioning. As a general rule I can have four or five pages open in Opera mini,have music in the background, and not have a problem if I get a message or call, much more and you're goosed !! Navigation REALLY takes processing power and the phone struggles
 if much more activity is going on,&nbsp;this is not definitive, it's just what happens with my N97, and I'm very careful with memory management and use RamBlow on my phone. As the N8 has far more memory on C and more processing power than the N97 so should be able
 to multi task better, do the maths, there is no substitute for power !!!!!!</p>

<p>Visited nokia shop today and had a go of the new N8(&nbsp;yes they had one but not for sale) &nbsp;VERY DISAPPOINTED don't know what nokia are doing it should be a great phone but it isn't<br />
1 it has 1 speaker below the camera and if the hole is covered or in your pocket you cannot hear the phone ring<br />
2 the camera 12mp but not a good zoom so no good<br />
3 the scrolling is slow and jerky and unresponsive<br />
4 the internet isn't that quick even on wifi<br />
5 the display isn't that good either<br />
6 the embossed nokia logo on the back is sharp and uncomfortable<br />
7 whilst playing flash on the internet couldn't get the play arrow off the middle of the screen<br />
sorry to be so negative I am a nokia fan I even had a N900 but I will stick using my E72 5800 and iphone4 (even though I don't like my iphone 4)</p>
<p>my daughter has a N97 and its better</p>

    <title>Sorting a sheet with drop down does not work properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sorting a sheet with drop down does not work properly</h2>
                    I am using Excel 2010 on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I have an Excel sheet (created by someone else who has since left) that has 13 columns, and all but the last have drop down lists. However, when I try to sort using one of the drop down lists, it does not sort the last column and the first row of data. I noticed,
 when I undid a sort, that it had highlighted all the data except the last column and the first row. How do I get it to include these in the sort?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            My initial feeling on this is that when the drop-down lists were created there were only 12 columns of data, with the 13th added at a later date.
<div><br />
<div>The drop-down lists are probably the Filter drop-downs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try this:</div>
<div>Click into your data</div>
<div>Select the Data Ribbon / Sort &amp; Filter Group / Filter</div>
<div>This will toggle the Filters off</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then</div>
<div>Select all 13 columns (Just in case you have blank lines lurking in your data)</div>
<div>Click the same filter button again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should have all 13 columns with filter drop-downs now and they will always sort all the data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>May I also suggest that a list of data can be formatted as a table.</div>
<div>Home Ribbon / Styles Group / Format as Table.</div>
<div>This very effective at keeping data together.</div>

            Thank you, Nayana and Mike. <br />
<br />
Nayana, the workbook was created in Excel 2003 and I've opened it in Excel 2010 (our computers were finally upgraded!). I don't really know the answer to your second question. It seems to work fine without using the dropdown list.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try following Mike's instructions and will get back to you if it doesn't work, or let you do if it does. Thanks for your help!<br />

<p>Hi Foxview,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I would like to point out that, to meet your specific requirements, we need to use
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive sync client </a>to sync the entire library to your computer (Go to the library, click
<strong>Sync </strong>button and then move forward as instructed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, we go to the OneDrive sync folder and search for the "<strong>.</strong> "+ file extension (e.g. .docx) in the search box to get the results and then delete all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there is any misunderstanding on my side about the background with some related screenshots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Tina</p>

<h3> jackblackzero  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to log out my account from my stolen Android phone&#63;</h2>
                    Hello.
<div>My Android was stolen today and my Hotmail account was open. I didn't use a browser to log in, but the predetermined application my cellphone had when I bought it. I used auto-sync, so I never wrote my password, it just opened as it was always logged on.
 My question is, how can I log out remotely and close that app before it is used for other purposes? I tried changing my password but it didn't work (my account was also open on my brother's laptop and after I changed my password it didn't ask me to write the
 new password, it just logged in normally). I could do this for my Gmail accounts, but Hotmail seems not to have any sort of solution.</div>
<div>Please let me know how to do it, there is very personal information I need to protect (bank passwords, etc) and even though I may delete those e-mails now they will keep appearing as caché on my lost phone allowing those who stole it to read them.</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

There is no facility in Outlook.com to remotely log out another device.&nbsp; I would go to the secure online form to try and change the password but that will not log the device out.<br />
<br />
This is the main reason why we recommend against auto log in.<br />

    <title>Why is my email showing different font sizes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yolandar2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my email showing different font sizes&#63;</h2>
                    I have noticed that my emails always come back with different fonts and sizes when someone sends a reply and attaches a copy of my email at the bottom. &nbsp;Why is this happening? &nbsp; I noticed the font seems to be affected when I copy and paste something to
 the email, especially if I go back to a paragraph I had already typed and was at the end of the email. &nbsp;I tried the options /email/ font and signatures and even though I chose Times New Roman 12, and save it, when I type a new email it starts with the right
 font but 16??? &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the color of your notebook provides a visually categorized content in OneNote. As of the meantime, this feature is available for OneNote for Windows and the application version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, we recommend that you post this on our <strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote UserVoice</a></strong> forum or vote for an existing feedback. This way, our developers will become aware
 of it and consider this in the future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concern, don't hesitate to post back. </p>

<p>Applications such as Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013, and others, are the Outlook application that has the option that can change the color of your OneNote notebook. Thus, the Android application is excluded with this. With that, we encourage you to post this

            Are you syncing your phone to Outlook on your computer?&nbsp; If so, you can change the appointment settings in ActiveSync or Windows Mobile Device Center to sync more than just 2 weeks' worth of appointments.

            <p>Hi Chico,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's hard to be certain.&nbsp; Sometimes it's obvious - you see emails being sent using your e-mail account (and appearing in your sent items folder) that you aren't sending - BAM!&nbsp; Sometimes it's subtle (your system is running much slower or your network usage
 is much higher than normal including when you aren't using the system and have no background tasks running that you know about).&nbsp; It depends how you've been hacked (directly, through malware, by access through a hole in your firewall, by getting in through
 a router that isn't secure or that has been compromised, by allowing someone access to your computer (in person or remotely) who installed and/or did who knows what).&nbsp; It depends on the results of a bit of research and checking to see differences or changes
 that you didn't do (like an unknown user or network connection, files and programs that you didn't install - especially if processes are running, sudden increases in SPAM or seeing accounts or websites accessed at times you know you didn't do it or suddenly
 seeing charges on your financial accounts that you didn't make, system reports that exist and/or that you've installed, and so forth).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to prevent?&nbsp; Well, a great deal of information about that is in the first article above (and the various links in it).&nbsp; But let me tell you what I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While my work requires me to take risks that are higher than most so I use some measures that are more than an average user needs (but while some like the bold parts and even some of the others can/should be done by everyone, maybe you don't need as many
 programs and/or don't need to run scans as frequently), here's what I do <span>(and it isn't 100% but nothing is, and in some cases only catches things after they've already gotten into the system, but it's a good process while remaining reasonable and they
 can all work together - as proven by the fact that I use them):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use MSE for real-time protection and run scheduled daily quick scans with a scheduled bi-weekly full scan.&nbsp; If you aren't and would like to switch to it, please post back as it isn't as simple as many programs to do it right and I'll be happy to
 provide you with detailed instructions if you'll tell me your Operating system and what security software you are using now (all names and versions).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I update and periodically (every couple of weeks or so) run full scans with Malwarebytes:
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a>
<span>and SuperAntiSpyware: </span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and ESET online scanner:
</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span> Get only the free versions. Any that also have paid versions include features like real-time protection that cannot be used along
 with MSE anyway (in these cases), so there's no point in spending the money anyway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use Secunia PSI </span><a href="http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scanning/personal/</span></a><span> to make sure all my programs are updated and current (since updates often
 plug security holes in the software and thus can be important as many people never check and/or update their software unless prompted - and this way I don't need to check everything since notifications and sometimes updates are automatic).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I use WOT (Web-of-Trust) <a href="http://www.mywot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mywot.com/</a>&nbsp;to help me avoid potentially dangerous sites (to assist SmartScreen).&nbsp; It's not a guarantee either way, but it's a good indicator - especially with searches.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Always use strong passwords (see the first link above which contains information on how to do that) - but not so complicated that you'll forget them without writing them down (which defeats the purpose) and change them periodically.&nbsp; Do not use the
 same one everywhere.&nbsp; Avoid the temptation to have your computer automatically save your passwords and/or login information as that just makes it easier to find and access other things if they get their foot in the door.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If&nbsp;using a wireless router, make sure it is secured as tightly as possible with the best method compatible with the device, your network, and your computers.&nbsp; Your ISP will&nbsp;often assist you in setting that up (if it's a supported router) or sometimes
 the router manufacturer will assist you (though unless done with online&nbsp;information or while still under warranty,&nbsp;they sometimes will charge a fee).&nbsp; If neither will help, it's possible you can get help from these forums starting:

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I always follow the following advice from Stephen Boots - MVP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled. </span></strong><span>No other firewall truly offers better protection or is needed. This one is perfectly fine.&nbsp; But make sure that you only have the ports you use and need enabled.&nbsp; The default
 allows many that most users will never use but each is a hole in your defenses.&nbsp; Pare it down to the minimum needed (but don't go so far that you block yourself in the process).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</span></b></p>

            Most of the time, you are supposed to be able to set the page length with-in the scanner software and the scanner's drivers.&nbsp; Make sure that you have installed the correct scanner Windows 7 driver module for your all in one printer.<br />

            As has already been suggested, the size of the scan is dictated by the scanning software. Unless you use OCR software to effect the scan, the scan will be simply an image of the document. If scanned directly into Word - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/scan_into_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/scan_into_word_2007.htm</a> - then that image will shrink to the width between the current margins.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The first time you launch Office 2016 Home and Student, it will prompt you to activate by signing in using an email address or phone number. Therefore, you need to have an internet connection to activate it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can start using Office 2016 offline after activation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Select the range of your raw data, on the Insert tab, click insert table (mark headers)..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change your pivot source in Pivot, Options, Change Data Source and set the table created in sheet input.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheet2.PivotTables(i).PivotCache.Refresh<br />

Indeed I use my INPUT page for the raw data, and would like to copy it dynamically to the pivot table, there it&nbsp;gives me the correct format, info and allows me to filter and via a macro to write it to&nbsp;a file.<br />
<br />
But my problem is it works fine, it copies&nbsp;all my data dynamically via the macro.<br />
unfortunately I'm not able to paste it via script in the pivot table.<br />
Manual it works fine (for several rows), but because&nbsp;there're 72000&nbsp;rows I would like it be done via a macro.<br />
So fill only the&nbsp;first 3 columns in with data and the rest is automated to create the correct data.<br />
</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong,&nbsp;your code is to&nbsp;update it, not?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the code is to update the pivot and because it is linked to a table, the data source of the pivot is automatically expanded to the new range of the table, I don't see the need to copy the raw data into the pivot. IMO, you can put all you need in the
 table and just refresh the pivot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not really clear what you mean with:</p>
<p>"So fill only the&nbsp;first 3 columns in with data and the rest is automated to create the correct data."</p>
