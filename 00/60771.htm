            Will&nbsp; do, and let you know....I believe it has something to do with Flash Player or Java...it only happens around the time I am playing a game or right after.&nbsp; I think I 've done what I was supposed to do with Flash player for Windows 8....but isn't there
 a security issue with Java as well..and not sure my java is working the way it should.

            I&nbsp;have this error and run windows 8.1, and get a lot of these errors since my last Microsoft update which happened a week ago.&nbsp; This primarily shows up when I am on ebay and other online shopping sites, which also tends to freeze my screen, and states
 webpage not responding, or webpage needs to be reloaded.&nbsp; VERY frustrating!

            I have Win8.1 and had Error #2060&nbsp;suddenly start appearing a couple of days ago. After researching, it appears the problem comes from&nbsp;Microsoft's security update for Flash Player #3087916 (August 11)&nbsp;which loaded the wrong version of Adobe Flash Player
 (the "debugger" version) in . Flash Player is embedded within Internet Explorer so can't be uninstalled and reinstalled as a separate program. To check if you have the debugger version, go to
<a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.adobe.com</a> and in the lower rh corner of the home page in small print you should see a list of Adobe&nbsp;products. Click on Flash Player and find your way on succeeding pages to a button that says something like "Check Flash
 Player". If FP is current on your system it should show version 18.0.0.232 for Win8.1. If the debugger version is loaded instead, as it was on mine, it will show 18.0.0.232 (debugger). To correct the error, Microsoft recently issued update KB3089023 which
 I installed along with other important updates. The debugger version is now gone so I hope the issue is resolved. My suggestion is to install all important Windows updates, especially KB3089023, and restart. Hopefully that will take care of it. Good luck.

<p>First of all, I've been using computers for a long time but I am far from a tech wizard so I can just relate what I did and hope it helps. I don't know your level of&nbsp;experience with Windows&nbsp;so I will go through the basic steps below and I apologize if you
 already know them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check Windows Update for the list of updates waiting to be installed (at the Win 8.1 start screen, type Windows Update which then will appear in the search box in the upper rh corner, and select Check for Updates from the list that appears below the search
 box. Be sure you are at the start screen and not in the desktop view app.)</p>
<p>2. You will go to the Windows Update screen. If it says you are set to automatically download updates, you should be able to click on View Details in step 3. Otherwise, click on Check&nbsp;Now and wait while it checks for updates.</p>
<p>3. Now click on View Details to see the list of updates waiting to be installed, separated into Important and Optional. The length of the list will depend on how recently you installed updates. Look for KB3089023 in the Important list. Select it and install
 if needed. Be sure to restart after it installs.</p>
<p>4. If you don't find it in the list of updates to be installed, you might look in your Update History list (click on View Your Update History on the Windows Update screen in step 1--btw, that is&nbsp;NOT the File History in the LH column on that screen). If it
 is on the history list, it will have the easily&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;title of&nbsp;Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 8.1 (KB3089023). It will also tell you when it was successfully installed, and I assume would tell you if it wasn't successfully installed.</p>
<p>5. If you don't find it listed anywhere, or if it is installed and you still have the problem after restarting, I'm not sure what you do. You might try the Microsoft Knowledgebase support function and search for KB3089023. There is an article that&nbsp;gives
 details about the update including&nbsp;how to download the update directly. Adobe also has a user forum that may have useful information although the last I saw they had referred users to the Windows update we're discussing after it came out.</p>
<p>6. That's all I know. Good luck.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are worried about the battery high usage in Windows 10. One of the new features in Windows 10 is included in the new Settings app.&nbsp;It's called "Battery saver" and as the name implies, it's a feature to help Windows 10 devices
 to save battery life by limiting background activity and automatically adjusting different system settings. This is in addition to battery usage reports for you to understand what is draining your battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access the new battery settings, open the <strong>Settings</strong> app, go to
<strong>System</strong>, and navigate to <strong>Battery saver</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows 10 features that your device can't handle won't be shown as an option. If you're running the operating system on a desktop computer without a battery, the
<strong>Battery saver</strong> option won't be available. The same is true for other features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you arrive at the settings, you'll see two sections: <strong>Overview</strong> shows you the battery level and an indicator when your device is charging or draining.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0d3ddca-0bf3-4394-81d9-5ab7c8fa9bf4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a link to access <strong>Battery use</strong>. This section is very useful, as it can show you battery usage across all your apps. This information can be very valuable to understand better which apps you probably want to be careful or stay away
 from when you're not plugged in.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do let us know if you have any queries related to Windows, we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p>My opinion: AC is cool, but after playing 1, 2 and Brotherhood, I'm kinda expecting the same game from Revelations, so it's not really an exciting choice for me. I played Just Cause 2 at a friends house and man, was I lost. I had no idea where I was going
 or how to even start a mission. Now, Batman: AC, I played at another friends house for 6 hours straight. I didn't want to stop, but I had to leave. Though I don't think I'd buy it anytime soon myself. Why not wait for Saint's Row: The Third? :)</p>

<p>If you haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 or Brotherhood, then do not play Revelation. Catching up on the story via Youtube doesn't really do it justice. Go play AC2 and Brotherhood before you get Revelations. Brotherhood is a sequel to Assassin's Creed 2,
 and Revelation is the end of the Assassin's Creed side trilogy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I never played Arkham City, did beat Arkham Asylum and every Assassins Creed game. My recommendation is STRONGLY to Just Cause 2 if you are just looking for a sandbox game. Avoid the new AC game at all costs.</p>

<h2>            Suggestions for Fingerprint Scanners that do more than Windows Hello&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my Windows 7 Pro computer to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I was disappointed to find that my Digital Persona software and scanner no longer work with Windows 10.&nbsp; I have searched far and wide on the Internet and asked stores if anyone makes a fingerprint
 scanner that works with Windows 10 AND also saves passwords for websites, encrypted documents, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have so many passwords for websites and somehow don't trust the web browser to maintain total security.&nbsp; The Digital Persona software had 128bit encryption, so I could safely save banking passwords, and other sensitive material.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has one or can recommend a product, I would really be grateful.</p>
<p>

            Hello miaclockman57, I’ll be helping you.
<br />You could try this to get your fingerprint scanner working but it may only work for logging onto your pc.
<br />Found here: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/solved-why-cant-i-use-my-biometric-fingerprint/ba07945d-68fa-484c-96d2-5bd20d3dfeaa">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />If you were using that software with Windows 7 and upgraded your Windows 7 installation to Windows 10, the DigitalPersona Personal" software will not recognize that the device is hooked up to your system and (according to the installed devices list) is working properly. This appears to be because the Windows 10 upgrade installed device drivers for this hardware that was written by Microsoft not Digital Persona. to get it working again you will need to uninstall the DigitalPersona Personal software and the install the drivers for this hardware that was working for you under Windows 7. Reboot and then reinstall the DigitalPersona Personal software (version 4.00.3691). Reboot again and after you system loads back up you will need to open the DigitalPersona Personal software by double clicking on its icon in the running apps part of the taskbar and the re-registering your fingerprints.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Here are a couple third party fingerprint readers that are known to work with Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Eikon Mini is an affordable fingerprint reader for any PC and Windows ...

<br />
<br />If none of these options work for you, I recommend you go back to Windows 7.

<p>First of all, I must apologize.&nbsp; The software that was bundled with my fingerprint reader was "Protector Suite".&nbsp; I attempted the first suggestion which was to install the drivers from the original CD instead of the Windows 10 drivers.&nbsp; I got stuck in a
 never-ending wait at "installing drivers".&nbsp; I crossed fingers because the only way to close it after waiting 15 minutes was to reboot the PC.&nbsp; I had to uninstall and reinstall the fingerprint reader and allow Windows Update to reinstall the Win10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, my desktop is NOT a branded PC.&nbsp; It is a custom one that I built myself.&nbsp; It has an ASUS 64-bit AMD motherboard with an AMD 6-core processor, SoundBlaster Audigy Sound card (use instead of the one with the MOBO because I have professional sequencing
 and sound editing software), NVidia Windows 10 compliant video card, 32MB on-board RAM, 1TB C:\ drive, and 2- 1TB each RAID 1 (mirrored) drives for redundant data, photos, etc.&nbsp; I also have a WD My Cloud Mirror 6TB backup device for additional redundancy.&nbsp;
 The upgrade from Win7 Pro to Win10 Pro went all too smoothly - it was SCARY &lt;LOL&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 DOES recognize the scanner and I can use it for Windows Hello to login to the computer.&nbsp; However, I'm looking for software that's Win10 compliant that allows me to use the scanner to store website and application passwords into an encrypted locally
 stored vault like Protector Suite did with Windows 7.&nbsp; I have so many different passwords (and complex ones, at that for security), that it's impossible to remember them all.&nbsp; I don't trust MS Edge or MS IE to keep them safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check the links that you provided and give an update as to whether any worked with my scanner to do what I need it for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi Miaclockman,<br />
<br />
<br />
We've noticed that this thread has been idle for a while now.<br />
<br />
Can you share with us if you're still experiencing the same issue with your fingerprint scanner? If yes, how did Time Lady's and Andre Da Costa's suggestions work for you?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />

<p>This is Miaclockman.&nbsp; TIA means "thanks in advance" and I'm a male. &nbsp; No, I haven't found a viable solution yet and am very frustrated because every store that I've contacted is reluctant to recommend anything for fear of having an irate customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need a software app that recognizes me Eikon fingerprint scanner (windows 10 recognizes it and it is working properly) and allows me to capture and save different website passwords using MS Edge and saves them in an encrypted "vault" locally on the
 computer (I'm not a fan of using cloud storage for something like this as these passwords include financial and sensitive information websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>MIACLOCKMAN</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.&nbsp; I am happy wit Windows 10 Pro (and also bought the retail version for $199), so I am not rolling back to Win7</p>

<p>I thought that I would share this on the thread - I did a little research and though it won't work with my fingerprint reader on the desktop PC, "logmeonce" looks like a great password management software.&nbsp; I'm going to try the free edition (which got rave
 reviews in several major computing magazines) and will report back how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The beauty of it is that it will save passwords across all of your devices including tablets, phones, laptops, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll give it a good two weeks and report back.&nbsp; If successful, I'll close the thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.</p>

    <title>Unable to connect to microsoft account, windows update, and store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noah blaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect to microsoft account, windows update, and store updates.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi, over the last few days cortana has been asking me to login to my microsoft account several times a day, every time I would enter my password and the prompt would just disappear and it would ask me again in another 10 minutes.
 It's was quite obvious there was some sort of problem logging into my account even though it gave no error. Today I saw online that there was an update for windows 10 and when I pressed the download button it never moved from 0%. Also, I realized that I was
 not signed up for the windows insider program (I was since the program has been available and would like to continue to be). When I press get started I get a prompt to login to my microsoft account, when I enter in my password it says i'm not connected to
 the internet (when I clearly am). I then reinstalled all my network drivers and try again (windows update still stays at 0%), This time I get the error code 0x800704CF. At this point I can tell there is a problem with my pc communicating with microsoft servers,
 so I go check the windows store. I have 8 updates trying to update and all of them are at 0%.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I also have another pc logged into my microsoft account and they both seemed to be synced correctly. For instance, when I change my wallpaper on my laptop (the one i'm having issues with), it also changes on my other pc.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">EDIT: When I posted this I saw that it had the little "Insider" tag under my name, so microsoft knows that i'm an insider yet I get the option to become an insider in the advanced options menu under 'update and security'</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t upgrade Microsoft Solitaire Collection to Premium</h2>
                    <p>When I click to upgrade to Premium I get an error box titled "Reinstall from the Store". It goes on to say I should uninstall and then reinstall from the Store and that my license needs to be refreshed to make in-app purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to uninstall and reinstall but afterwards when I try to upgrade the same thing happens. I have tried clearing the store cache but that didn't change the situation. I tried to look up the error code (which changes periodically) but the search returned
 no results.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Try this, I am almost certain it will work:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstalled the game and rebooted;&nbsp;</li><li>Ran the Windows apps troubleshooter;&nbsp;</li><li>After the troubleshooter finished doing its thing, I downloaded the game again from the Store;&nbsp;</li><li>Before completing the installation, I noticed the Store was "restoring user data" and I thought it probably wasn't a good thing. So,
<strong>immediately after it got installed and <em>before even trying to open it again</em>,</strong> I went to Settings, System, Apps &amp; features, found Solitaire there, clicked on it and then on Advanced options. It took me to the screen below where I clicked
 on Reset. If you launch Solitaire before completing this process, you'll need to start over.</li><li>Next, to into the Store app and follow the steps above and reset it as well. <strong>
This is critical, too!</strong></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>I tried resetting the game before following the procedure mentioned on steps 4 and 5 without running through the previous steps, but it would fail every time. Now the game is running like it's supposed to, and I only lost two weeks of premium without any
 response at all from Microsoft.</p>

            If you are the target of such attacks, Call your ISP (internet service provider) and tell them what is happening. They will change your IP for you and escalate this to the authorities as it's a federal crime in the USA (and other countries) to do that.
 After you're online, block the person who you think was doing this, report him on his gamercard and avoid party chats and voice chats with them. Also, stay away from the games that they're hosting.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 store &#34;Extensions for Microsoft Edge&#34; page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanielnewhouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 store &#34;Extensions for Microsoft Edge&#34; page won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>This is a problem I never expected to encounter - Every page in the Windows Store loads perfectly fine, and I can install the actual extensions just fine - I just can't load the specific page that appears when I click "See All," or "Get Extensions from the
 Store." I have already tried many recommended solutions to this problem including at least five different powershell commands and the wsreset program and none have solved it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Home, completely up to date with the&nbsp;anniversary update.</p>

    <title>PROJECT DEATHWATCH is recruiting for Halo&#58; Reach&#33; &#40;VETERAN - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PROJECT DEATHWATCH is recruiting for Halo&#58; Reach&#33; &#40;VETERAN CLAN since 2006&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I'm F4ceYourFe4rs, and I'm an Overlord of the multi-gaming clan, Project Deathwatch! We are currently recruiting for Halo: Reach, but plan to expand to another game in the near future (most likely Modern Warfare 3 or Battlefield 3).
</p>
<p>By joining {PD}, you will not only be a part of an awesome gaming group, but a friendly and fun, active community. It's also a great way to meet new people from all across the world, and can benefit you in many ways!<br />
<br />
But what makes {PD} different from the thousands of other clans, you say? Well, to answer that simply, we have experience. Let me give you a little history lesson.<br />
<br />
Project Deathwatch was founded in late-2006 by a group of high school friends, consisting of myself, COM 5, Knightof5orrow, and ohbandit4. We originally operated on multiple games across the Xbox console, but then strictly ran on Halo 2 as it was the most popular
 game of the time. During the time, we won approximately 90% of our clan matches, and faced formidable competition such as IGA, KSI, and EOT.<br />
<br />
However, in 2007, a major "civil war" between the founders and other leaders at the time caused the clan to break apart. But after a couple of months apart, mostly everyone came back to restart activity on Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4. From 2007-2009, we remained
 active, and even expanded to Modern Warfare 2 and World at War. Unfortunately, due to being overwhelmed by the large workload, the clan went into a state of inactivity for 2010.<br />
<br />
But now, we're back! We're now playing Halo: Reach, and plan to add Call of Duty: MW3 once it is released (this, however, is always subject to change; we're also looking into Battlefield 3!).<br />
<br />
Now that you have a short history lesson, there's not much else to know about our group. I've made a promotional video for the clan that can be found
<a href="http://youtu.be/FlEna0WYBlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>HERE</b></a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/FlEna0WYBlo?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/FlEna0WYBlo?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>!<br />
<br />
Our primary website is our <a href="http://z6.invisionfree.com/Project_Deathwatch/index.php?act=idx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>FORUMS</b></a>, but we also have a general information website located <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/projectdeathwatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>HERE</b></a>, which has enlistment info, media, clan match history, and other things. We are still in the process of cleaning up things from the older days of the clan, so pardon us for that.<br />
<br />
We are also taking challenges for clan matches, so if you'd like to do that, you can just visit our forums and post in the Halo: Reach Clan Match Discussion.<br />
<br />
You can join by going to the New Recruit section of the forums and filling out an application. If you have questions, you can reply to this, send me a message on XBL, or PM me on the forums. I'm usually always reachable somewhere! :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, we at Project Deathwatch hope you will join us and get involved in one of the best clans you can find on Xbox Live! See you on the battlefield!<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
F4ceYourFe4rs</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before Skype updated to a new theme on my phone this morning, some of my contacts had phone numbers attached to their Skype call names in my list. I could select from a drop down list if i wanted to call them on Skype or phone. Thei is no longer the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now only the Skype name/call option remains and all of the phone numbers are gone!</p>
<p>Please let me know how to recover them.</p>
<p>

<p>Strange. I am using Skype on various Apple devices and have done so for years. This weekend I decided to tidy up my address book which had started to collect duplicates for various reasons. So I edited the profile of many contacts adding their phone numbers,
 etc.. At first it seems to work, but later when I go back into some of the contacts their numbers have disappeared again! So it seems MS are busy dressing up software to make it look good!!!! No message, no disabled feature, just misleading functionality.
 More interesting is that some contacts still retain their phone numbers, but they had numbers before this weekends activity. This kind of implies MS has made Skype worse since buying it!!!! Yes I am using the latest version, latest op system, etc..</p>

            i found the answer....i was told by the HP live chat support person that my pc both hardware and software were uncompatible with windows 7, she then told me that she could sell me a new pc, a P6100z series pc with 320 gb hd and 2 gb memory and a bunch
 of things for a hugh discount, and it would include the windows 7 update. she said the new pc sells for 299-499 but that she would give me a discount and sell it to me for 269.99 ....anyway, i ran the windows 7 upgrade advisor and it said my computer can upgrade
 to windows 7 32 bit home premium or ultimate. everything was fine...i should have know it was just HP lying just to scare someone and sell another computer....

    <title>Change taskbar swipe in pure tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change taskbar swipe in pure tablet mode</h2>
                    <p>I have my taskbar positioned at the top of the screen (personal taste). When in pure tablet mode - that is, no keyboard or mouse, the only way to display the taskbar is to swipe up from the bottom of the screen. It would be more friendly and consistent if
 the swipe direction had followed the taskbar to the top edge of the screen (I realise it wouldn't make sense to follow a left or right side taskbar, but there doesn't seem to be any swipe associated with the top of the screen).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there's a way to set the taskbar to respond to a swipe down from the top of the screen instead?</p>

                    I just loaded Windows 8 and can't get my old sound card to work.&nbsp; The sound card is a Turtle Beach Montego A3DXStream (AU8820).&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at the Turtle Beach website and it appears this sound card isn't supported beyond&nbsp;XP (my previous OS). &nbsp;Are there
 any compatible drivers that can be used; I just need basic functionality.&nbsp; Thanks,
