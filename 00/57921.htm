Make sure you installing the architecture you are running 32 or 64 bit<br />

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing. I understand how frustrating if things don’t work as expected.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to log-in with Microsoft account and check under All apps. If you have the apps that you have already removed, then you can re-install those app.<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>Here is my problem. When upgrading from 8.1 to Win 10, the upgrade stopped and after no other available solution,&nbsp;I saw the need to go for REFRESH PC in order to have access to the laptop. Many apps were removed and I am trying to reinstall them, one being
 Internet Explorer. All my searches (Win 10) point to reinstalling it on 8.1 or older. It appears that a restore point to the day of the failed upgrade, 8/18/15, may affect Windows 10.</p>
<p>Please advise how to reinstall the most current version of I.E.&nbsp;I could not find Windows Explorer but it must be somewhere or other programs would not work (I guess). Here are some of the removed programs: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, Google Toolbar for I.E.,
 Microsoft Visual C+, Viewpoint Media Player, and others already reinstalled or left for later. Thank you.</p>

<p>I also had this problem after a refresh of Windows 10. First I need to know if anyone is also experiencing problems with startup after a restart or closure of the PC or device. Windows 10 had been working fine up until I automatically had the last security
 update for win10 installed and was activated after a normal restart. Since that time I have had major problems getting thew system to start and open up. It takes hours to go past the plain wait page with the swirling starred circle continually turning indicating
 system is activating, if I haven't run out of patience and pressed restart to take other options, I may get to the windows sign in page but no username panel is displayed so that signing in isn't possible. If im lucky it sometimes allows me to sign in, but
 then again it sits and displays that it is confirming, but nothing happens for hours again. But some few times, somehow it does go all the way to opening, still with long delays, but I cannot seem top fix problem by going back to last restore point, because
 after I do and windows 10 works beautifully again, sometime very soon my system will automatically upload and install the security update again and a repeat of the problem occurs again. I then took the option of refreshing my system and after awhile the same
 has happened again. I've tried numerous ways to try and turn off the automatic update settings, but I cant seem to be able to find that option. Nor are there any options given to choose to; refuse or accept; select from a list; or confirm or deny, on either
 the download, the install or the activation stages. How do I fix this upgrade install-startup problem? I have also been experiencing screen flicker and graphics display issues along with the startup problems and again only since the security upgrade. Is there
 a forthcoming patch being released soon to rectify this? Is it a problem in the security update files themselves, caused by either, compatibility problems with certain hardware or software brands, or an across the board flaw in the upgrade files? Or is it
 possible that the upgrade itself is fine, it is just that I have chosen, or I already had set, some conflicting settings in; Other software, i.e: Anti-virus and security software; my Windows Settings; or my PC's Bias settings?</p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed RegCure Pro and at the restart after "Fix All", System Fonts are unreadable. Filenames, Tooltips, Browser Window Menus, Everything basically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried reading the forums but so far, Windows 10 seems too far advanced and everything is from a service which I can't open/find/search/read and if i knew cmd line instructions as a Noob, I would't be posting this.&nbsp; I've taken a pic if the screen and this
 post sent by still manageable Android S5 super tiny keypads phone. (Shows Explorer Window, Fonts Folder and FireFox Window respectively)<br />

<p>
</p><p>Please advise Whattf, Howtf, Whytf, this is happening and Whattf I have to/can do to fix this?</p>
<p>
And apologies for the sarcasm and "Advanced Win10" reference as it might be uncalled for though mitigated by frustration and anger.
<br />
</p><p>
Thanks in advance!<br />

Had Japanese Language Pack installed long ago but removed it before posting with no change. So can I reinstall Jap Language Pack?

<p>Sorry, this is what you get for installing and running registry "cleaners". Experts in these forums have been saying for years that such products are snake oil. They make no difference to a PC's performance (if you're lucky) but they can do a lot of damage
 in some cases. The registry does not need cleaning or optimising and allowing third-party programs to hack it is high-risk stuff.</p>

            <p>Hi PeterCon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I couldn't launch the Command Prompt as the "Start/Search" window would immediately close as soon as I pressed any key.&nbsp; I eventually re-boot from disc and did a system system restore with fingers crossed as I wasn't sure the first
 or second "blank" restore point was ideal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, your attention to my query is much appreciated and having tried it now, I get a long list of font names I assume to be
<strong>installed</strong> <strong>system </strong>fonts? There is no other comment or message after the last font name followed by command prompt again so I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p />

    <title>MS&#47; Onigiri Update QA&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elohmn  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS&#47; Onigiri Update QA&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">So, the Onigiri Community of both the PS4 &amp; Xbox One have been waiting for the newest Update to Onigiri (Edo Expansion) since last year. The Developers of Onigiri Cyberstep have been open and on the record for stating they were
 waiting (and working with) both Sony and Microsoft on the QA side of the Update since last year (November 30, 2015).<br />
<br />
Now as of March 31, 2016 the "Edo" Update will be going Online for the PS4 but not the Xbox One. They (Cyberstep) state they are still waiting and working with Microsoft in regards to the QA and have even brought in a Third Party to help with QA to pass on
 the Xbox One and the Microsoft Platform.<br />
<br />
With all that has been stated its staring to look pretty clear that MS is at the end of delay with its QA. If more Developers start getting this kind of Platform "cooperation" from Microsoft, Microsoft can start kissing those Developers goodbye as they migrate
 in greater numbers to other Platforms.<br />
<br />

<p>Xbox Players: We apologize that your patch cannot be released at the same time - a third party QA team has been brought in to expedite this release, however we simply cannot continue to delay the release of a
<span>patch that was completed last year for both consoles. We are doing all we can to get it released as soon as possible but simply cannot wait any longer.

<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I know this doesn't impact many Users here but given this occurs enough with enough Developers and it will begin to effect everyone who uses the Xbox One/ Microsoft Platform.<br />
<br />
Kinda answers why MS demands Platform "parody" in regards to Third Party Development Support. I guess some Developers are willing to take the risk of losing "parody" and releasing an Update for a Platform regardless of what MS wants.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?-</span></p>

<p>I do believe that Lost Kauz is employing "parody" as a paranomasia for "parity" the pun being that some developers insist that a game didn't come out for both consoles because of the Microsoft insistence on "parity" but then this rule does not seem to be
 being applied in practice to games that are out for both consoles in the case of "Onigiri" and select others.</p>

<h2>            Display Language Fails to Install &#40;Windows Embedded Standard 7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install a new Display Language (Japanese) language MUI pack in Windows Embedded Standard 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into Control Panel / Region and Language / Keyboards and Languages&nbsp; and click Install/uninstall languages, Install Display Language and Browse Computer or Network, before finding my lp.cab file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It identifies it as a Japanese MUI language pack, 140MB</p>
<p>I click on "Next", Accept the License terms and the progress bar starts filling up.</p>
<p>It fills up about a third of the way and then stops and just says "Failed" </p>
<p>There is no error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a link "What can I do if display languages failed to install?" below the list box, but clicking on it does nothing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what can I do if display languages failed to install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows Live Mail - inbox &#39;empty&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martincurry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail - inbox &#39;empty&#39;</h2>
                    One of my email accounts in Windows Live Mail shows 'there are no items in this view'. The view setting is 'show all messages', if I search for messages they can still be found and the properties states they are still located in the inbox.
<br />
<br />
The other email accounts are displaying fine but have identical view settings to the problem one. All signs point to a view setting problem but I can't work out why it's not fixed. Could other settings be overiding these options?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi Fuzion.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) Try resetting the games or reinstalling in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Game name &gt; Advanced Settings.  Reinstall from MS Store app Settings &gt; Your Library. 
<br />
<br />4) Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How to get an email &#40;from the mail Windows app&#41; invite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get an email &#40;from the mail Windows app&#41; invite &#40;.ics file&#41; to show on a calendar &#40;using the windows app&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I am receiving emails to both my hotmail and gmail accounts through the mail app on Windows 8. Some of these emails are event invites which include a .ics file attachment. If I go to the gmail or hotmail website, I am able to click yes I will be attending
 and the event is added to my respective calendar. However, I cannot do so using the Windows mail app. So, how can I get the event to show on my calendar directly from the mail app rather than having to go to the website?

            Jessen P,
<div><br />
<div>I am receiving the attachments in my email. The problem is getting the event to show on my calendar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example, I got emailed an invite for a meeting for next&nbsp;Wednesday. The email invite includes the .ics attachment. I now want this meeting to show on my calendar, but cannot figure out how.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for the syncing done properly, I logged in using by Microsoft Account which is a @hotmail.com email and both the mail and calendar apps synced. So I am assuming it is done properly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if you need any additional info. And thanks for your help.</div>

<div>Thanks for the link, but I am already on the last step - contact the app publisher. Since these are both (Mail and Calendar) Microsoft Apps, I am here&nbsp;writing&nbsp;on the Microsoft forum.</div>

<div>Is there a setting or a button that needs to be clicked to send information from my email (the Mail app) to my calendar (the Calendar app)? Or should this information sent automatically?</div>

<div><br />
<div>Thank You for the response. If I am understanding you correctly, what I want to do is (at least for now) not possible. I have to either check my mail outside the app and accept the invite (which will sync it to my calendar) or go to the calendar site and
 import the ics file. Is that correct?</div>

                    <p>My question is simple. I just got a BSOD and my PC was forced to restart. I had plenty of log messages at 16:38 which is when it booted up and there was one log message at 16:36 which is an "informational" message:&nbsp;<strong>Application pop-up: Windows - Application

<p>I have never gotten an issue like this before on this PC and nothing was recently installed. It could very well be a one-time issue but I'm posting here as it could be a possible bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what caused this error?</p>

    <title>Skype on Panasonic TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdskypeontv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype on Panasonic TV</h2>
                    <p>My family have enjoyed Skype communication between UK and Australia using a Panasonic Viera TV with Panasonic camera.</p>
<p>Today a message has appeared on screen stating that Skype for TV will cease on June 30th 2017. I know that I could probably use a PC alongside my TV and use the TV as a monitor but wonder if anyone knows of a much neater way of getting Skype onto my TV screen.
 Is there a Skype enabled camera that could connect to an HDMI on my TV? that would work and still be supported by Skype long term?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of June 2016, Skype no longer supports TV applications; there will be no more updates to the app. Thus, some are still working depending on the TV model.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>TV manufacturers may remove the Skype for TV application from some or all of their models. If you have questions, please contact your TV manufacturer for information on the availability of Skype enabled camera that could connect to an HDMI port on your TV
 model. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a simple reminder though, third-party applications/device have not been checked, verified, certified or otherwise approved or endorsed by Skype. Applications/Devices may be subject to the third party provider’s own terms and privacy policy. Skype does
 not control and is not responsible for the download, installation, pricing, quality, performance, availability, support or terms and conditions of purchase of third party applications.

<p>Hi JDSkypeontv,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add to Rhiza_E's comments and answer the only other question you asked that wasnt answered. The only other way to get Skype on your TV is to buy an Xbox One / Xbox One S with a kinnect which has a natve Skype app included.</p>

<p>Thanks Rhiza_E for your reply I had already e-mailed Panasonic and their reply was as follows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Thank you for your e-mail.
</em></span></p>
<p><em><span>In response to your enquiry, we want to inform you that our information and software is limited to Panasonic products, if there are any companies that do manufacture such device we do not have such
 information. </span></em></p>
<p><span><em>I trust that the above information will be of assistance to you. However, of course, if you should have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I don't think they were particularly helpful given that when I purchased the TV it was a top end spec and the "Panosonic camera" made for Skype that cost over £100 will now be obsolete soon so I'm rather miffed
 to say the least.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am now planning to use a Google chromecast dongle in the HDMI socket on the TV and cast Skype from an Android tablet.

</p><p>The software used in these TVs is not compatible with our new infrastructure and it was not possible to update them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunatly the TV's will stop working with Skype on or shortly after July 1st, there is no workaround the only options are the ones I already mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where there is a will there is a way!</p>
<p>Further to my earlier posting I have found that the Panasonic Skype TV camera TY-CC10W that currently sits on top of my TV is not totally obsolete it does in fact work albeit with basic video and audio functionality when plugged into a USB on my desktop
 PC which suits our needs.</p>
<p>However as the PC in my study is remote from the TV in the lounge I have purchased at minimal cost a 10m long USB extension cable with signal amplification to run between the two so the camera can stay on top of the TV.
</p>
<p>By using Google Chromecast on the desktop PC and choosing to mirror the desktop I can transmit video and audio to the TV from my PC and from the Panasonic camera feed video and audio back to the PC.
</p>
<p>We can all as a family still enjoy the pleasure of seeing each other on a BIG SCREEN in the comfort of our lounge without having to huddle around a tiny screen and image on a phone or tablet. Nice when your grandchildren 12000 miles away want to see and
 share things with you.</p>
<p>I am also running the latest version of Skype for Windows on my PC</p>

            is there any other option besides a Kinect to get video chat through Skype if I were to go out and buy an Xbox?&nbsp; Looking to avoid laying out $300 to "repair" a feature that I already paid for in the TV.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind upgrading my old PS3 to an Xbox
 (min $250), but if the only way to get Skype to work on it would be to buy a Kinect and adapter (which is another $100 between the two of them) I would probably just pass on the whole darn thing and just quit Skyping.

            thanks for this info. &nbsp;At least I can maybe still use the relatively expensive webcam I bought to Skype with my kids on the Panasonic TV. &nbsp;I think I will try out google hangouts though. &nbsp;

    <title>Is It Necessary to Install ALL Updates &#38; Can I Remove Old - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ladybbramfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is It Necessary to Install ALL Updates &#38; Can I Remove Old Ones&#63;</h2>
                    All this confuses me greatly, but sometimes the Updates show a list of many updates, most of which say important.&nbsp; Is it really necessary to install all marked important?<br />
Once done can I remove all the older Updates?&nbsp; So many old and new updates seem to be for the same things<br />
<br />
Thank You in Advance.<br />

<br />
But this query has nothing to do with the problem I have in the other thread.&nbsp; I am merely asking in this thread if it is necessary to install all MS updates and can I remove older updates?&nbsp; That is nothing to do with the message I am receiving about not having
 a copy of genuine windows (which I have by the way)<br />
<br />
I started this new thread about a different subject so as not to distract from the topic of my other thread.&nbsp; That is the polite procedure on any site is it not?<br />
<br />
I still havent receive a reply to my query in this thread.&nbsp; &amp; I did as you suggested and searched for your reply in my other thread but you never posted on it, so I am a bit confused here<br />
<br />
Are you saying that I shouldnt have started this new thread on a different subject, before my other problem is solved?&nbsp; That is not what it says on the instructions on how to use this site, because I read all of MS advice before I started posting.<br />
<br />
Thanks from....<br />

            Some useful advice on your post PA Bear and I have learnt from it.<br />
<br />
I have C &amp; P some of your points within it to reply:<br />
<br />
Fact: Important updates are not necessarily security-related. Left to its own devices (i.e., set to Automatic), Automatic Updates will (attempt to) install all Important updates - whether you or your computer need/want them or not.<br />
<br />
<b><i>That is very useful info and exactly what I needed to know</i></b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Tip: Obtain any driver updates you really need from the device or computer manufacturer's download page only, NEVER via Windows Update (i.e., hide any driver updates offered via Windows Update).<br />
<br />
<i><b>Good advice and I am grateful for it.</b></i><br />
<br />

One assumes the Image used to install Windows on the brand-new computer you got for Christmas was created on 10 October 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, you should not "remove" any updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that many of your newer updates (i.e., those installed after you got the computer) superseded updates which were already installed. Since the newer update superseded the older one, chances are the older one is no longer listed in
<strong>Installed Updates</strong> (so there's nothing to remove).</p>

                    Why is my "Protected Mode" turned off now? It was on before, but some how got turned off and I can not reset it to the "On" position. Can it be turned back on? Or has something like a virus turned it off?

<div>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are logged in as ADMIN or you run IE with ADMIN privileges then Protected Mode is not available.<br />
Also UAC has to be ON for it to be available.<br />
<br />
You can turn Protected Mode ON and OFF by double click the little Blue Globe Internet | Protected Mode<br />
on lower IE status bar. The Security tab comes up with the Enable Check Box then APPLY / OK.<br />

            This is not really the right answer. what he should do is right click on an empty space in the task bar and select "Cortana". You will notice that Cortana has 3 states: 'hidden', 'Show Cortana Icon', and 'Show Search Box'. Choose whichever you prefer.

    <title>Windows pushing endless loop of failed upgrades for Windows 10 version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean502  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows pushing endless loop of failed upgrades for Windows 10 version 1709</h2>
                    <p>I have a Bay Trail Windows tablet (Nextbook Flexx 10.1 Model NXW101QC232T) with Windows 10 version 1607 (14393.2035). It has an Atom CPU, Z3735F @1.33GHZ.&nbsp; Windows 10 is repeatedly attempting to install an incompatible OS upgrade (Windows 10 version 1709).
 This endless loop goes like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. System automatically downloads 1709 and prompts me to reboot in the Update settings during active hours.</p>
<p>2. I reboot the system.</p>
<p>3. It attempts to install</p>
<p>4. The OS installs, then reboots again.</p>
<p>5. Upon reboot, it shows a QR code with an error message saying "Your PC ran iinto a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart it for you. Stop code: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED.</p>
<p>6. It again reboots, and shows the same message as in #5 above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. It reboots again and says "Restoring your previous version of Windows"</p>
<p>8. It eventually succeeds and I can log into the system and it notes the update failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.. Soon after, it begins attempting to once again download version 1709 to repeat this entire process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears 1709 is incompatible with this device, yet Microsoft continues pushing this incompatible update. I see that even if I block automatic updates, that Microsoft will stop providing security updates later this year.&nbsp; Is my only option to discard this

<p>Hi Sean,<br />
<br />
<br />
The <strong>SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED</strong> error message you're seeing when your tablet tries to install an update might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to an outdated driver.<br />
<br />
That being said, can you check if you have the latest drivers for your device? You may check it from the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong> Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.<br />
</li><li>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards, expand the <strong>Display adapters
</strong>category, right click your graphics card and select <strong>Update Driver</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Have you confirmed with your device manufacturer if Windows 10 is supported by your device?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the steps above with all of the different device drivers and a downloaded over a dozen new drivers using Device Manager, including several system drivers, although not the video driver (Intel HD).&nbsp; I don't see any separate drivers available
 on the tablet manufacturer's website. The video driver remains Intel HD driver version 10.18.10.4358 12/21/2015 since it didn't identify a new version of that. I also ran SFC /scannow and ran checkdisk and there were no issues.
</p>
<p>The tablet had Windows 10 pre-installed when I bought it new and hasn't had any problems until trying to upgrade to the Fall Creators version (1709).</p>
<p>I will attempt to re-install 1709 and see how it does this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sean</p>
        </p>

<p>Updating the drivers made no difference as far as installation went. It did exactly the same thing as before. Some of the drivers that Device Manager downloaded don't actually even work, including the ones handling the touch interface and sensing the tablet's
 orientation to change from portrait mode to landscape mode. I have a copy of the originals that I'll use to restore that.</p>

            I really appreciate you sharing with me those results, Sean.<br />
<br />
Since your device came with a Windows 10 pre-installed, it's latest updates should be compatible with your device.<br />
<br />
Have you checked if you have a stable internet connection? Unstable connection might lead to failed updates as well.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, have you tried running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong>? This can find and repair problems
 with your device's Windows update files. Just download the troubleshooter suitable for Windows 10.<br />
<br />
You may also consider <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting your Windows Update components</a></strong> for a refresh of the said components. Make
 sure that you follow the steps carefully, as serious problems might occur if you modify it incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result.

<p>I made another attempt to locate an updated driver. There is an automated tool on Intel's website that I used and it located an updated IntelHD video driver that Device Manager didn't identify (version 4643, 5/23/2017). I installed it, rebooted, and then
 attempted to do the upgrade to 1709. It again failed with the same error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no internet access issues or issues with Windows update itself prior to 1709 attempting to boot. I had previously tried to use the troubleshooter but it didn't change anything. No modifications have been made to the Windows update components. The
 1709 upgrade successfully installs and attempts to boot afterwards, but this is when the error code noted above appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message doesn't provide a driver name like they sometimes do with that message. I don't see any additional way to install this upgrade.
</p>
<p>This error appears to require Windows developer involvement to fix it. I understand Microsoft already identified incompatibilities between the previous generation of 32 bit processors (Cherry Trail) and have allowed these devices to only receive security
 updates for the next few years. I suggest they do the same with this model or else do additional regression testing to identify why Windows 10 1709 doesn't work with this device before continuing to push this upgrade automatically. I've managed to block the
 automatic updates by changing my WiFi connection to a "metered" connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Here's another update regarding this issue. I installed a fresh copy of Windows 10, using only those drivers installed by Windows (no OEM drivers at all). This predictably broke several features, like touch screen interface, landscape/portrait screen orientation
 sensors, sound, microphone, camera, and battery power indicator. However doing this made it possible for version 1709 to successfully install. The issue is an incompatibility between one or more OEM-provided drivers, which are not available through Driver
 Manager or accessible to Windows 10 upon installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've submitted this issue through the feedback hub as you suggested and also attempted to get support from the vendor (Nextbook USA).&nbsp; Other users have posted online that the hardware vendor doesn't help with drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The obvious solution, assuming the vendor isn't up to the job of supporting its devices, is to treat the Bay Trail devices the same as they're treating the Cherry Trail devices. Only push security updates to them.</p>
<p>I don't need or want minor feature updates on a Windows tablet if it's going to break basic features. The device only needs security updates. I decided to do so only because I typically use it with an external keyboard and mouse, which is likely only common
 among a small percentage of the user base since it is a tablet. If it weren't for the lack of security updates in the not too distant future, I wouldn't have bothered updating to 1709. As I mentioned in the feedback hub, this is exactly the kind of hassle
 that's driven many users to simpler experiences on iOS, Android and ChromeOS. A feature that trashes thousands of Windows installations is no feature at all, but a very costly bug.</p>

            Hi Humphrey,
<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />However, for that particular error, this is the recommended fix from Microsoft:
<br />
<br />According to the event log, the issue is related to Schannel. Please try the following steps:
<br />
<br />1.In Control Panel, click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Local Security Policy.
<br />
<br />2.In Local Security Settings, expand Local Policies, and then click Security Options.
<br />
<br />3.Under Policy in the right pane, double-click System cryptography: Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing, and then click Enabled.
<br />
<br />4. Run gpupdate /force
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t work, please go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA and grant "Network Services" Read permission to "MachineKeys" folder. Then restart server to have a try.

<h2>            CTRL shortcut not working just after double click</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a really annoying and strange problem on my new Asus laptop with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every CTRL shortcut (like those for cut and paste) doesn't work if I use it IMMEDIATELY after any mouse double, but it works if I wait for a moment (a second maybe) after a double click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may look like a stupid problem but I have never experienced it on any other laptop and it's really frustrating when I have to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a specific app problem. It is the whole system that seems to not detect CTRL when typed.</p>
<p>I attach a video for better explaining the problem:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s1oofzhayddju4x/CTRLWTF.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/s1oofzhayddju4x/CTRLWTF.mp4?dl=0</a></p>
<p>In the video:</p>
<p>I double click, wait, press CTRL+X, it works</p>
<p>I double click, immediately press CTRL+X, it doesn't work. It sees only the 'X'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you any idea about why this strange behavior?!<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>I have tried an external keyboard. The problem is exactly the same.</p>
<p>I have tried to use the same external keyboard and the same external mouse on an other laptop. There, I have NOT had the same problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for that information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us isolate the issue if this is a problem with your keyboard drivers or with the hardware itself. We suggest that you perform the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Clean boot. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and start up programs. It will also eliminate software conflicts that could occur when you install a program, or an update, or when you run a program in Windows.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong><em> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Disable Anti-virus / Anti-malware software.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly to above, as performing a Clean Boot sometimes fail to unload the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: File Signature Verification Tool.</strong></p>
<p><br />
This tool help maintain the integrity of your Windows operating system by checking if there are any unsigned drivers in your operating system.<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>R </strong>to open the run command.
</li><li>Type <strong>sigverif.exe </strong>and press enter</li><li>Check if you see a list of unsigned drivers.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4: Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X</strong>, and click on <strong>
Search</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>and select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> and select <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> and click on
<strong>Next </strong>to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks, I have solved the problem with a clean boot (all services disabled).</p>
<p>Disabling one service a time I also have seen that the issue was caused by one service (QTranslate).</p>

<h2>            File&#58;&#92;Boot&#92;BCD missing 0xc000000d</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to boot, with the dvd&nbsp;drive empty, with Windows7 Home Premium disk or the repair disk as&nbsp;per instructions, I receives an error message of:&nbsp;File:\Boot\BCD missing. Status: 0xc000000d. Info: The Windows Boot Configuration Data file is missing required
 information. I loaded Windows7 with this same&nbsp;drive and initially everything was working correctly. Then this problem began, the drive is working with all of my other disk. Changed the the statup boot cycle to the harddrive, and this system starts right up???</p>
<p>History: I had had&nbsp;problems with using the upgrade, I would lose&nbsp;everything but the background on startup,&nbsp;so I formatted the harddrive and then loaded the full version of Windows7,&nbsp;from the upgrade disk. The problem mentioned began then.</p>
<p>If the file is actually missing , why will it work with the harddrive,&nbsp;and yet&nbsp;not with the disk drive?</p>

<p><span>Hi deerhunter3,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you’ve setup DVD drive as the first boot priority in System BIOS (Basic Input/output System), the Boot
 configuration database (BCD) would be containing incorrect information about your DVD drive thus preventing you to log-in.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 - 100&#37; disk usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amerebreath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - 100&#37; disk usage</h2>
                    <p>My computer is currently useful for nothing more than a doorstop. A few weeks ago (right after restarting my computer after a Windows update), it began taking around 20 minutes to boot up. For the past few weeks, it has also been periodically shooting up
 to 100% disk usage and becoming very slow or frozen. Yesterday it shot up to 100% disk usage and it's been hanging out there ever since. I've been searching the internet for solutions all day and have tried many things to no avail - disabling superfetch and
 windows search, disabling cortana, adjusting advanced settings in chrome, running a disk check, and probably more I forgot. You must understand as well that everything I try is incredibly painful as I click one button and then walk away while it thinks about
 it. Every restart requires close to 20 minutes as well. It's more than a little frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest culprits are Local System processes. I was just about to check specific titles, but it's completely frozen again so it will be quite some time before I can see them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now?</p>

<p>Thank-you for the suggestion and sorry for not responding back sooner. I went to try this suggestion, but couldn't because after waiting for 2 hours, my computer would not boot up. So I shut it off and did nothing with it for about 4 days - at which point
 I tried turning it on again and I received a message telling me to reboot with the proper boot device. I had someone over that day whom I wish I would've thought to ask for help sooner. He knew how to pull up more information and test my hard drive. I lack
 proper terminology, but I can tell you he said, "The good news is the only thing wrong with your computer is your hard drive." (Ha ha ha)</p>
<p>
</p><p>He now has my computer and was going to see if he could get my files off of my hard drive for me. I'm pretty much just bitter about the fact that Windows 10 destroyed my computer.</p>

    <title>RF module dies, constantly need to pull power from console to restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theglow  say:</h3>
<h2>            RF module dies, constantly need to pull power from console to restore</h2>
                    
<p>I had a chain going for a bit on Twitter, but I find twitter a horrible mess and cant even see all my posts, etc.</p>
<p><br />
Basically Ive had this issue since I first purchased my Xbox one in March. Basically I pick up a controller and press the Xbox guide button to turn on the console, and it doesnt power on the console. When this happens, the console will not interact with either
 of my wireless controllers until I pull the power out of the console, wait 5 seconds and plug it back in.</p>
<p>On one occasion I plugged in a usb Mini controller and held guide, shut down, turned it back on and wireless controllers works. A handful of times I went to the power options and did a hard reset. But silly to need to plug in a wired controller to do this.</p>
<p>I have since gotten into the preview program hoping it would help, but it doesnt. I can stream to my pc then plug the controller in via micro usb and it will work. Once I unplug the wire, the controller goes back to blinking.</p>
<p>I can try synching again but nothing happens. Controllers blink forever.</p>
<p>Now I can press guide button, watch the controller blink, unplug console, plug it back in, press power, watch the controller LED go solid because now it is connected.</p>
<p>This is sporadic. I can go 3-4 days fine. Longest was nearly 2 weeks. But then it comes back.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? I had a Wii U near the system but that has been unplugged and behavior is still happening.
</p>
<p>I work in IT/Networking and have everything hardwired, no wireless devices near the console.
</p>
<p>It is getting to be very annoying to sit down, pick up the controller, see it doesn't turn on the console, and have to get up and go over and pull the plug and restart everything. If I had a game in progress, that is lost.</p>
<p><br />
For reference when I'm done I always hold the guide button and select Turn off(or whatever the syntax is).</p>
<p>I forget what the&nbsp; results are if I plug a wireless controller into the system directly with a usb wire if it works, but again I've already jumped through enough hoops.</p>

<p>Is this an official support forum? Or where else should I go because I am getting a bit frustrated with this.</p>
<p>Same happened again last night only not sure if my testing with a wire on Windows 10 did something but now after the hard reset, 1 controller synced fine but my main one had to be resynched as well.</p>
<p>Also I'd rather not have to deal with being without the system or getting a refurbed unit back.</p>

<h2>            Laptop won&#39;t wake up from sleep mode automatically anymore.</h2>
                    My laptop, a Samsung QX-411-W01US, used to automatically wake up from sleep mode whenever I opened the lid. However, since I had to run a full system restore, which returned the computer back to basic factory settings (I had to download all the drivers
 again) it no longer wakes up by itself, I have to press the power button. How do I change it back?

            <p><span><strong>Hi Stufooy,</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you installed any new software or hardware on your computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you have the latest <strong>
Graphics Card</strong> drivers installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>This issue can occur if the Power plan settings need to be changed or if the Video drivers need to be updated or reinstalled.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1- </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong>You need to <strong>Run</strong> a <strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> scan to repair damaged Operating System Files.<br />
To do so, you need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below –</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2 –</strong></span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
You need to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> to prevent any conflicting applications from interfering with the functioning of your programs.<br />
You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to place the computer in a
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> state –</p>
