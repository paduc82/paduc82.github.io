    <title>Word updates causes me to lose my list of all recent documents listed. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word updates causes me to lose my list of all recent documents listed.  Why&#63;  Same happens for Excel</h2>
                    <p>I do my periodic Microsoft updates like a good soldier (do I have any other choice after all?) and after many of them I reboot and go to reopen some or all of my recent documents both in Word and in Excel. &nbsp;I find the list is blank and is reset to the default
 of 4 most recent documents with the box unchecked and with all of the recent documents I had open not listed. &nbsp;I always immediately recheck the box and run it up to the max of 25 documents but this continues to happen again and again, perhaps with every second
 or third round of MS updates. &nbsp;No online searches I've done to troubleshoot this have ever addressed this very annoying problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I once again have Word set on both Word and Excel to save the 25 most recent documents so we'll see how long it takes for this to happen again. &nbsp;I've now started typing a list of what documents I had open before the updates are installed so I can go back
 and reopen them. &nbsp;It's not always easy to remember which ones are open and they are often in various stages of review. &nbsp;What an unnecessary waste of time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These documents are in various folders as well and I have to go to each folder to reopen them. &nbsp; I frequently have a dozen or more word documents open (not so many with Excel but still quite a few) when the regular update cycle comes around again. &nbsp;It really
 is a waste of time to have to do this over and over and Microsoft surely can come up with a solution to not cause Word to reset this to default settings. &nbsp;Help? &nbsp;Is there a reason this happens and anything that can be done to work around it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 and Office 2010. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Ran the suggested program and it said my virus definitions were out of date. &nbsp;Updated them and then even updated the app with a newer version when that popped up too. &nbsp;Then I reran the this test program and it said the same thing.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have a screen shot below of what it looks like when it happens. It looks the same in Word. Before the reboot this screen might show a half dozen files under Recent Worksheets, several pinned above the line, and the box is checked with 25 documents showing.
 I might add that yesterday after merely putting the computer to sleep overnight, it happened again. &nbsp;Never done that before so twice in just 5 days or so. &nbsp;It takes 5-10" to re-open files which is a time waste and I'd love to know how to prevent it from happening.

            The MDI to TIF converter is a command line tool. You will need to open a command prompt window, locate the folder - C:\Program Files (x86)\modiconv
<br />
and run the command mdi2tif.exe<br />
<br />
This will give you the command line switches necessary to batch convert MDI to TIF.<br />
<br />
If you still have the installation disc for Office 2003, you should be able to install just the Microsoft Office Document Imaging application from that disc, using advanced office customisation - uncheck everything except MODI<br />

            You can get a "free" copy of MODI by getting the free installer of Office 2007 SharePoint. When you install it, do a custom install selecting just MODI.<br />

    <title>Email Migration from IMAP Server to Exchange Online where the IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil hawker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email Migration from IMAP Server to Exchange Online where the IMAP Host doesn&#39;t support Authentication Encryption</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I'm planning a migration of my family email from PlusNet (UK ISP) to Exchange Online. As part of this I want to migrate the IMAP mailboxes, but the Exchange Online / O365 EAC tools for IMAP migration seem to require either SSL or TLS encrypted authentication
 for the IMAP Logon. PlusNet support only Basic (non-encrypted) logon authentication - part of the reason I want to move away from them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone performed this type of migration without IMAP authentication encryption? Does EAC support it??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phil</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - not sure that this is the correct forum / category for this topic but can find no alternative for Exchange Online migration questions - if there's a better forum or community site than very happy to hear about it!</p>

            <p>OK, I've answered my own question.... Here's a summary:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The "simple" email migration tool provided within the O365 / Exchange Online Portal (the "Office 365 Admin Center") does
<strong>not</strong> support migration from IMAP mail accounts with non-encrypted password authentication. It only provides access to servers / accounts with SSL or TLS encrypted authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However....</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If you open the more complex "Exchange Admin Center" (access via the last menu item on the left under "Admin Centers" you gain access to a more capable toolset designed for migrating multiple mailboxes. In order to work with an IMAP Server only supporting
 non-encrypted authentication you <strong>must</strong> define a "Migration Enpoint" (buried under "&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Recipients</strong> &gt;
<strong>Migration</strong> &gt; <strong>More </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f148718eb-ebbd-4aa5-99bb-bcf5a6d7d942.gif" />&gt;
<strong>Migration endpoints</strong> ") as per: <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bda3ed61-50a4-4809-926e-81a75b59310d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bda3ed61-50a4-4809-926e-81a75b59310d" /></a></p>
<p>where the options now do include "None" for encryption, as described&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Migrate-other-types-of-IMAP-mailboxes-to-Office-365-58890ccd-ce5e-4d94-be75-560a3b70a706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Basic Help page for migrating batches of IMAP mailboxes with support for non encrypted authentication.">Here&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;
 and in more detail&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.ecp.emailmigrationwizardimaplearnmore(v=exchsrvcs.149).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Old TechNet article describing mailbox migration.">Here</a> . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then have to upload one or more .CSV files specifying details for the account(s) to be migrated, and the dialogue presented when you upload a file claims (again..) that it will try to authenticate using SSL. However, the migration does actually work,
 suggesting that the options in the "Migration Endpoint" definition are honoured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a bunch of other gotchas on the PlusNet side which make migration of a private domain far more difficult than it should be, but I'll describe them within the PlusNet Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall the process isn't exactly intuitive, but I hope that Microsoft don't remove the more complex toolset as it provides the only route to getting migration to work from older environments such as PlusNet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else....</p>

It is not possible to separate your Skype profile from your Microsoft account.<br />If you close your Microsoft account, in addition to not being able to sign in to or access Skype, you'll no longer be able to sign in to other Microsoft consumer products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows.<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/can-i-use-skype-without-my-microsoft-account?q=close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/can-i-us...</a><br /><br />If you want to close your account click on this link<br /><br /><a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1524756075&amp;rver=6.7.6655.0&amp;wp=FORCE_SA_20MIN&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2faccount.live.com%2fcUS&amp;uaid=1ef7b7194937405583f52a87d78f91loseaccount.aspx&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=38936&amp;mkt=en-35" target

            Hi Ruth
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account and use the available options of transferring your contacts and credits to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If you wish to continue:
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.

<h2>            I can&#39;t access my inbox for Microsoft Outlook It shows &#34;Something went wrong&#34; and &#34;Something went wrong and we couldn&#39;t complete your request&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a few weeks now where I am unable to access my outlook email account. I am able to sign-in just fine, but when it tries to direct me to my inbox, it shows an error with a ":(" face. It also states that "Something went wrong" and "Something went
 wrong and we couldn't complete your request" statements. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've waited a couple weeks in the hope that it would start working again, but it still hasn't started working. I am not sure what to do, and I was hoping someone could guide me. I am expecting a few important emails, so I would appreciate it it if someone
 could help me. Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Thanks for replying back so quickly.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am accessing my account through the Microsoft Office Outlook website from my laptop, so web-based interface. I use the Google Chrome interface more specifically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to sign in successfully but when it tries to redirect me to my inbox, it says "Something went wrong". So there is no left panel with other folders appearing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try a soft reset , back up contacts , calendar and notes ONLY, dial *#7370# followed by 12345 and the phone will reset to 'out of the box' condition, you will have to set up your phone again but it should be like new. If music player won't refresh try this</p>
<p>Try connecting phone in mass storage mode and select show all files, look in 'private on E and delete the files listed, has worked for me in the past !</p>

<p>OK, i have found a solution to sharing your omnia internet connection with your macbook OSX without the Internet Sharing program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start off, on the omnia go to Start&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Data Connection.</p>
<p>From there change the setting from "Internal Data Call" to "As the modem through USB"</p>
<p>after that plug the Omnia into the Mac via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Mac go to the navigation bar at the top of the screen, and click on the internet drop down menu (the thing that shows your Wifi connectivity status) and from the drop down menu, click "Open Network Prefrences..."</p>
<p>In this menu it should have a pop-up of some sort that says "New connection options" or something like that and then in the same pop-up it will say something like "SAMSUNG Technologies". In the sidebar of the Network Prefrences window, at the top you should
 see the SAMSUNG Technologies connection. Click on that connection and do as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telephone Number: #777</p>
<p>Account Name: (your # here)@vzw3g.com</p>
<p>Password: vzw</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>click on the "Advanced.." button towards the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendor: Vodaphone</p>
<p>Model: VC701SI</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; enable error correction and compression in modem.</p>
<p>Dial Mode: Wait for dial tone before dialing</p>
<p>Dialing: Tone</p>
<p>Sound: On</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on PPP towards the top of the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only selections that should be Check-Marked are:</p>
<p>1. Disconnect When User Logs Out</p>
<p>2. Disconnect when switching user accounts</p>
<p>3. Redial if busy</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Redial 1 times</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Wait 5 seconds before redialing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click ok at the bottom of the window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Apply at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Connect and it should connect in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one draw-back to this method is that you must delete the SAMSUNG Technologies connection after everytime or it will not connect. and when you delete the connection that obviously means you have to redo all of these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, after your done using the connection on your mac, make sure to go back to Start&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Data Connection on your Omnia and change the setting back to "Internal Data Call" to use your internet on your phone again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Ok Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just figured out that after the first connect, the SAMSUNG Technologies message wont pop up like it does the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to connect, go to the "Open Network Prefrences.." step again and on the bottom of the left navigation bar, the one with all the connections, click on the "+" sign. in the window that comes up, click on interface and one of the options should be SAMSUNG Technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2>            IMs stuck in sending ...</h2>
                    <p>I got new skype for win 10 that came with new Win 10 and new PC week ago. All my messages are not received. Skype just displays "sending ..." and message is never sent. I've tried to re-install but, I can not find skype on list of "Programs and Features".
 I've tried to switch back to classic skype, but every link I've tried forwards me back to skype for win 10 installation on windows store, and not the classic skype. My skype for win 10 is up to date (v 12.1803.279.0) at least MS store says so. Skype for business
 works just fine. I'm using private skype with some of my business partners and this is frustrating for me and them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody resolved this issue and how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>We removed the option to download the classic Skype for Windows desktop from our website.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(22, 35, 58, 1)">There was an issue with an older version of

            Hi Jason,
<br />
<br />Sorry, Office 365, is licenced to a specific Email Address/Microsoft Account, therefore other users on that PC will not be able to use that on the same PC. Previous versions of Office were licenced to the PC, which did allow multiple users, but that changed with this new licencing model . . .

            Hello JasonW_132,
<br />
<br />Thanks for choose the Microsoft community services.
<br />
<br />When office is used for different users can cause credential conflicts, but there is the option to switch between accounts if you need to access to a files where specific users have specific permissions.
<br />What I would suggest is to create different window profiles for that different users.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope my suggestion helps, please let me know if you have any other question.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<br />
<br />Hello Jason
<br />
<br />You have two options
<br />
<br />Option #1 - using the same Windows logon account then
<br />
<br />- create a different Outlook profile for each user
<br />- set Outlook to ask which Outlook profile to use at startup. The caveat is that any user will be able to open any existing profile and see the other person's email etc
<br />
<br />Option #2 - create a different Windows account for each user
<br />
<br />- a new Outlook profile will be need to be created for the WIndows account user

            You have "2 strikes" against you. You mention OEM version and Network install.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Office OEM licenses CANNOT be transferred. They are only good on the hardware they are initially installed on. That is why they are cheaper than retail.&nbsp; You can identify OEM licenses by going into the help pane: File tab &gt; Help command. On the far right of
 the pane near the bottom, look for the "Product ID". If the second group of characters is "OEM", guess what type of license you have. This only works for OEM.<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;(HINT HINT MS, add a display of LICENSE CODE to the help panel. It would simplify troubleshooting installation and activation questions GREATLY)
</span><br />
<br />
A "network version" of Office may mean you have a "Volume License". There are 2 types of volume license keys, one allows a limited number of transfers the other does not. Unfortunately we do not have any resources that can identify the type of license key used.
<br />
<br />
Your best bet may be to call the phone activation telephone number to see if they will tell you the license types associated with the product keys. You may have to ask to speak to a supervisor to get the info.<br />

Your other option is to investigate the volume license purchase plan. When you buy more than 5 licenses at the same time you can get volume price discounts.&nbsp; You will have to do some research on the license types to figure out the best approach for you.<br />
<br />
Remember, "Office 15"&nbsp; is expected to be released the end of 2012, start of 2013.(that would affect your choice of volume license options, particularly "SA", which includes "free" upgrades and the "HUP" (FREE, Home Use Program)<br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span>In most firms with more than a couple of computers the best solution is actually Microsoftâ€™s Volume License program.&nbsp; Their Per Device licensing has the same advantages of the Retail license â€“ the license CAN be reassigned
 to a different device later if you choose to replace your computer and you can install a copy on a portable device that is used by the same primary user as the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>The pricing tends to be favorable on Volume Licensing compared to the retail boxes you get at Best Buy, though perhaps not as favorable as you might expect.</span></p>
<p><span>The other big advantage is in management of the licenses.&nbsp; With Retail Licenses every box comes with a product key â€“ a series of numbers and letters that looks like this:</span></p>
<p><span>A1B2C-D3E4F-G5H6I-7J8K9-0L1M2 <br />
</span><span><em><span>(obviously that oneâ€™s fake)</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>The thing is you have to keep track of which product key goes to which machine.&nbsp; And when you install the software on multiple machines you have to enter the product key for each machine manually.&nbsp; OEM versions these tends
 tend to print the product key on a sticker, attached to the system.&nbsp; Makes sense, the license goes with the system so the key might as well too.</span></p>
<p><span>With volume licensing, however, you get ONE product key, which youâ€™re allowed to install on as many devices as you bought licenses for (plus additional portables if applicable; see above).</span></p>
<p><span>â€œBut I donâ€™t have hundreds of machines!â€ you may say.&nbsp; You donâ€™t have to.&nbsp; Volume licensing agreements start at just 5 (yes FIVE) licenses.&nbsp; And they donâ€™t have to be 5 licenses of the same thing.&nbsp; If you only have 3 machines
 you can buy 3 licenses of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 and 2 licenses of something elseâ€¦maybe Microsoft Streets and Trips or â€œMicrosoft Math 3.0â€.&nbsp; Something cheap.&nbsp; Ask your software dealer they can probably find you something.</span></p>
<p><span>Adding additional licenses later is easy â€“ once you have the initial five licenses you have a Volume License Agreement and you can purchase additional licenses as needed.&nbsp; You add another member of staff?&nbsp; Buy one more
 license of Office 2010 for them.&nbsp; No problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Most firms with 3 or more computers should be using Volume Licensing in my opinion, if for no other reason than the simplicity of management.&nbsp; No need to track a bunch of product keys â€“ just use one and your licenses are
 NOT handcuffed to the physical computer.</span></p>

<p>Most large organizations have Software Assurance (SA) as part of their licensing agreement and there are many benefits that are included that go unused every agreement period. We have found that many of the people who would use the benefits
 donâ€™t know that their organization has them. Those who do know about Software Assurance associate the program with getting the next version of software at no additional cost, however there are other benefits that can save you money from your budget on training,
 support and services. If you know your organization has an Enterprise Agreement, then you also have Software Assurance. If you are not sure what kind of licensing agreement you have, check with the person who works on Microsoft licenses to see you if you have
 Software Assurance. Some of the most popular benefits are technical training days, home use licenses, online training for users, and 24x7 support. In this post, I will highlight some of the benefits, talk about eligibility, and let you know who to contact
 to find more information or to start using the benefits. </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>What is Software Assurance?</span>
<p>Regardless of where you are in your software lifecycle, Software Assurance provides benefits to help you upgrade to new software, get more productivity out of existing software, and support your current environment. When you are ready
 to upgrade to a new version of software, SA provides new version rights at no additional cost, deployment planning services and end-user readiness benefits such as online training and home use licenses. To keep your IT department up to date and to help your
 end-users be more productive on existing software, SA provides classroom, technical training and online training for end-users. And to help you maintain your environment, SA also includes a 24x7 support benefit.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Software Assurance Benefits:</span>
<p>There are over a dozen SA benefits and the amount of benefits your organization has depends on the licensing agreement. The list below highlights the most popular benefits associated with Office.</p>

<p><a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/download/global/40029941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Click here</span></a><span> for
</span>more even more detail on benefits eligibility by license type. </p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>In order to find out what benefits your organization has and to start using them, you will need to contact your SA benefits manager. Your organizationâ€™s SA benefits manager is likely in the IT department and will have access to the online
 Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) where the exact benefits your organization has can be looked up. If you know who manages your Microsoft licenses, then that person can likely look up your SA benefits manager. The benefits manager activates the benefits
 in order to make them available for you to use.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives you an introduction to Software Assurance benefits and the resources you need to learn more about what they are and how to use them.</p>

<p><span>In reduced-functionality mode, programs function similarly to a viewer. When running in reduced-functionality mode, many menu items are unavailable (dimmed),
 thereby blocking access to that functionality. Some of the limitations of reduced-functionality mode include the following limitations:

</span></span></span><span>You cannot create any new documents.</span></p>

            <p>Just kidding. Seriously, though, it does work.</p>
<p>First of all, I would not edit the standard calendar. It is useful to have the standard calendar available in its original form 5 days, Monday - Friday, 08:00 - 12:00, 13:00 - 17:00.</p>
<p>I would use change working time to make a copy of the standard calendar, with a distinctive name such as "AA My Project Calendar", then edit this calendar by nominating nonworking days as exceptions (ie exceptions to the default nonworking days), working
 days as exceptions ((ie exceptions to the default working days), change the working hours for each day of the week in work weeks etc.</p>
<p>Then assign this new customised calendar to be the project calendar (Project, Project Information).</p>
<p>Then assign this new calendar to also be the Base Calendar for the resources.</p>
<p>In the Gantt Chart View, the bars always span across the nonworking days, no gaps.</p>
<p>The vertical shading of the nonworking days is determined by which calendar is chosen for nonworking time. Right click on the chart area and choose nonworking time, then select your new calendar from the drop down list.</p>
<p>Try a simple example. Make Wednesday a nonworking day. Make a task which starts on a Monday and has a duration of 5 days. When the standard calendar is the project calendar, the task will finish at the end of Friday. When the new calendar is the project
 calendar, the task will finish at the end onf the following Monday.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know how you get on.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1020 wont play music via bluetooth</h2>
                    Hi guys, trying to pair my 1020 to a Nolan helmet Bluetooth system to play mp3s but am having no luck. The phone pairs ok but only for voice (voice shows in blue in the Bluetooth menu in the phone, but not music). This system works / pairs fine with my
 808. Any ideas? Txs in advance! Joseph

            Txs... I am not connecting to other helmets. Still music doesn't gets streamed, only voice. In the phone's bt menu, under the paired helmet, it says "voice" not "voice and music". My 808 works just fine (including GPS voice guidance)... What to do????
 Many thanks, Joseph

<p>I was hitting this with my headphones (Sony DR-BT22). I found that for whatever reason the order of&nbsp;starting BT on both them and the phone mattered. I had my 1020 BT on (usually do for connecting to my car) and would turn on my headphones; always seeing
 only "connected voice". I tried turning the headphones on before enabling BT on the phone; "connected voice, music"...hopefully that works for you. Either way, it's pretty buggy &amp; I'm hoping will be fixed with GDR3.</p>

    <title>Please verify your account. We&#39;ve noticed some unusual activity in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jadynsilver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please verify your account. We&#39;ve noticed some unusual activity in your Outlook.com account. To help protect you, we&#39;ve temporarily blocked your account. ALSO DEALING WITH SUPPORT.</h2>
                    <p>I made an email on the 30th of March, and was immediately unable to send any messages. The strange thing is, how did outlook notice any 'unusual activity'? It is a brand new account. Is the act of creation 'unusual'? That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refuse to 'verify' my account with a phone number, so I was looking for a different option. I was hoping that providing the security key from a different email would help, but it did not. I don't understand how the only way to get an account working is
 to give microsoft your phone number! Even if they 'only use it when I tell them they can', I don't want to tell them they can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>03/30/2014 11:07 - I contacted support about this, and described my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>03/30/2014 11:16 - I received the usual 'we got your email', with this added: "If you donâ€™t see a message from us within 24 hours, check to see if email from @css.one.microsoft.com is in your junk mail folder."</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/01/2014 21:12 - Had not received any response, this was past 24 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/05/2014 09:15 - still no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/05/2014 23:05 - still no response. (you are going to see that a lot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/06/2014 17:06 - A RESPONSE?? Witchcraft! I was told that outlook limits the amount of users I can send an email to at once for new accounts. Completely reasonable, as that would help to deter spammers. I was also told I might need to wait 30 days to 'build
 up a reputation'. Problem is, I am trying to send *one* email to *one* address. Any address!</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/06/2014 17:15 - The follow up 'tell us how we did' post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/13/2014 09:09 - I replied, reiterating what I said in my original support request, that it was sending to any single address that was the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/13/2014 21:43 - An escalation agent replies. They say they understand that I don't want to provide my phone number (this is important), and ask that I give permission for them to look at my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/14/2014 21:14 - I do so. I include a screencap of the error I'm getting. I had to use internet explorer to actually use the attachment feature, it would not work in firefox, even with ghostery, noscript, and adblock all turned off. I also tried my email
 in IE, and it still didn't work, so it's not a browser issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/15/2014 01:44 - The escalation agent tells me that there isn't a problem with my account? But they don't mention what they've actually checked. I can log in fine. Why did they say they understood the whole no phone number thing, and then not mention it
 in the follow up? I assume this is two separate people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/15/2014 09:26 - I tell them the problem isn't fixed. I try IE with add ons (before it was the 'no add ons' one) and it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/17/2014 03:40 - Escalated to private support! Yay! Things will start to move now, right? They told me that I couldn't send emails *at all* until I'd verified my account, or it had built up a reputation after 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/17/2014 09:03 - I question how I am supposed to 'build up a reputation' with an account that cannot send a single email. I question if I what I was told earlier was in error, that I couldn't send to *multiple* recipients until this reputation thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/18/2014 01:49 - I am escalated (again) to Microsoft Community Private Support. The message says that they will tell me when there's something to tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/22/2014 08:11 - I wait four days, before messaging again. I felt, with the original time frame being 24 hours, that four days was appropriate. I already waited a week for that original 24 hours, doesn't that mean I've waited long enough?</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/23/2014 08:55 - Five days, Still no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/24/2014 09:26 - Six days, still no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/25/2014 20:29 - Seven days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/26/2014 20:50 - eight days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/27/2014 23:28 - Nine days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/28/2014 20:19 - Ten days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/29/2014 10:01 - Eleven days, no response. This is also 30 days since I made my account, that reputation thing I think they were hoping would magically fix the problem failed to materialise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>04/30/2014 10:25 - Twelve days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>05/01/2014 10:05 - Lucky thirteen days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>05/02/2014 09:46 - Two weeks!! No response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>05/03/2014 09:44 - Fifteen days, no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>05/03/2014 10:26 - I include a link to this post. Man, I wish I could compose a song about how hotmail breaks guitars... I mean hearts. That makes more sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 30 day anniversary of reputation building has come and gone, and I am still unable to send any email. At this point, I'm just being stubborn. It doesn't actually make sense to stay with outlook after this, because this. Has. Been. FRUSTRATING. However...
 I remember the heydays of hotmail, back in junior high. I remember the flurry of new email addresses everyone around me was getting, thinking up cool email names and then telling everyone. I remember the excitement of hotmail. I've used hotmail as my primary
 email address since I first started using the internet, and with the loss of geocities and web 1.0, I apparently want some sense of continuity with my pre-google self. What I'm saying is that I *like* hotmail, I just want it to like me back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we in a bad relationship, hotmail? If my friends could see all this history, would they start an intervention?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I've pretty much decided that this is where they stick troublesome people who they hope will get tired of bothering them, and just go away. I won't. I would be incredibly grateful to this community if you can point me in the direction of the
 equivalent of a 'manager', because dealing with these agents is getting nothing done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO: As I was typing the subject line, I was told that there were other messages with similar content. I followed the link, and found that it boils down to 'verify with SMS', which I have already stated isn't an option, or 'contact support', which I have
 done.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've filled out three surveys now, explaining my experiences. Hopefully they and this message will get some help!</span></p>
<p><span>Edited to add: The other problem with the support website is that my ticket is now, as one would imagine, very long. I only realised that the entire page turning grey meant that there was a box to click, in the approximate middle of the page, waaaaaaay
 below where I was looking. I can't just hit 'enter' on my keyboard to make it work. I just assumed it didn't like firefox, and went with that. So maybe that little happy 'post success!' box should appear in the middle of my screen, instead of the page?</span></p>

<h3> nathan wakefield &#40;nathan&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging Office 365 domains in one tennant</h2>
                    <p>We have multiple domains within our Office365 tennant, lets say @domaina.com and @domainb.com<br />
</p>
<p>I have been asked to assign every mailbox that currently has a @domainb.com address, a @domaina.com email address.</p>
<p>I need to do for all groups &amp; mailboxes.</p>
Is there a simple way that this can be done via PowerShell or do I need to manually go through and update every mailbox?

Office 365 online Power Shell,</a> then use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoluserprincipalname?view=azureadps-1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Exchange Online users - some reporting slow opening of calendar entries Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're in the middle of piloting some users on Exchange Online.&nbsp; We're noticing some users report very slow experiences (10+ seconds) opening some calendar entries, while other users aren't able to reproduce this issue. We are using Outlook 2013 and our company
 enforces cached mode via GPO.&nbsp; I can reproduce the issue moving between my two machines, a co-worker can't.&nbsp; One thing I've noticed, is it seems to take longer for meetings with recurrence than single instance meetings.&nbsp; Anyone else run into this issue?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Markuslrby,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>By saying â€œI can reproduce the issue moving between my two machines, a co-worker can'tâ€, do you mean that the issue happens when setting up the same Office 365 account into another PCâ€™s Outlook 2013 client?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If so, it probably means the issue is related to the specific PCsâ€™ Outlook 2013 clients. Here are some suggestions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make sure the Outlook 2013 clients of the users who open the calendar entries slow are same as the Outlook client of the users who didnâ€™t encounter this issue. For example, their Outlook versions, Outlook client settings and network environment needs
 to be the same.</span></li><li><span>Ask the problematic users to start their Outlook 2013 client in safe mode to see if the issue persists.<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72</a></span></li><li>Try running a clean boot to help eliminate the software conflicts.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, to better understand the situation, Iâ€™d like to collect some information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did this issue happen in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> (OWA) of the problematic users?</span></li><li><span>If the problematic users create a new meeting with recurrence in their OWA, did the same issue happen?</span></li><li><span>How did the problematic users set up their Office 365 accounts into their Outlook clients, via Exchange connection, POP or IMAP? How about those users who didnâ€™t encounter this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p>

            <p>I ended up opening a case with premier support that is still ongoing.&nbsp; The delay is due to the client opening the entry up on the server (even though I'm in cached mode).&nbsp; We're still in the process of trying to find out why.&nbsp; Disabling the Skype for Business
 addin seems to make a difference.</p>
