<h2>            Unrecognized items in Deleted Items</h2>
                    <p>In the deleted items folder there are several messages that I do not recognize.<br />
The names are written in red and most of the subjects say "(No message text)". Most have the date 13/07/2016.<br />
When I click on them, they all say "This item must be returned to its original folder before it can be viewed." and give me the options of "Delete" or "Move to Contacts". Please see the attached images.</p>
<p>I am wondering if my account has been hacked.</p>

    <title>E7 or N8 external microphone info - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E7 or N8 external microphone info</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Just to confirm you can get a microphone into a nokia n8/e7. To do this you will need to use a CA-75u which comes with any n series nokia.It is a three way RCA (phono) split giving you a yellow white and red RCA to a 3.5mm (mini) jack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have your CA-75u you will need to plug your microphone to start with into the red RCA and in the software make sure your default accessory is the headset. Then you plug the mic into the red RCA and then the 3.5mm jack in the top it should ask you
 which type of connection you want, select headset. Now take the mic and plug it into the into the yellow RCA. Now you can use sound recorder to record from the mic!.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is obviously a work around and it would be much easier for nokia to produce a microphone interface or even better bring out a usb x/y configuration microphone like the zoom recorders use. Come on nokia give me a new gadget!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some notes about mics and connections into an RCA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Electret mini mics should be fine, but I am personally using a lo impedance condenser microphone which has internal power (battery) such as a AKG C1000 or Audio Technika AT33a I myself am using a sennheiser shotgun from the early 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the correct connection from an XLR plug to the RCA you will need to create a mono lead the easiest way to do this is to connect the white or cold or pin 3 on the XLR to the screen or pin 1 on the XLR. Then terminate them to to the screen or outer
 part of the RCA. Then terminate the red or hot or pin two on the XLR to the center of the RCA. Alternatively go to maplins or radio shack and buy one.</p>

<p>I have the n8, which I think is a fantastic machine.</p>
<p>I work in commercial radio broadcasting, and frequently have used my (old) cellphone to record audio for broadcast when unexpected news breaks. It was "ok" - but with my new Nokia n8, I knew there was potential for something a lot better - so this post is
 for the radio broadcasters out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, after looking at a handful of options, I downloaded and trial tested the ALON MP3 Dictaphone software (available on Handango.com), then I bought it. It's great software and loves the n8. It offers both mp3 and WAV audio recording among several set-up
 options. Mp3 is great to speedily e-mail audio back to the studio direct from the n8 for quick broadcast (like news). WAV is great for returning to the studio for some post-production (as in recording a client for a commercial).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found this post after setting up my n8 - but made my own mic cord. I ordered a 3.5mm 4 conductor plug/cable assembly from Mouser.com.</p>
<p>To the other end of this cable, I attached an XLR for the dynamic mic I usually carry with me. Wire the XLR as peteaudio indicates. Don't forget the short jumper wire from pin 3 to pin 1 on the XLR. It's important.</p>
<p>On the 4-conductor plug end, you want the wire for the 4th ring of the plug, and also the ground/shield wire. I snipped off the remaining two wires, as I was not in need of them for my set-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have your cable made and tested, plug it into your n8 WITHOUT the microphone attached. Your phone will have you "Select accessory:"&nbsp; Select "Headset". Now you can connect the microphone end, open the recording software, and record away!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the n8, this jack can also serve as <em>video out</em> (the 4th ring on the plug) OR as
<em>audio in</em>. This is why it's important to leave the mic UNPLUGGED until you have told the phone what circuit you want assigned to the jack (by choosing "Headset") .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another post on this forum indicates a USB mic will work through the USB-OTG port. I have not tried this, as I did not want a mic cable sticking out the side of the phone. I like the top jack for on-the-spot recording as it is out of the way while handling
 the phone in the field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi All,</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble formulating the total&nbsp;amount for duplicate values, and displaying those values correctly. See the example table below (a mock table that represents a significantly more complex excel document). Column A represents the order numbers, which
 might have multiple charges within them (for example, a charge for a product and a charge for shipping) which are represented in Column B.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A - Order number</td>
<td>B - Charges within order</td>
<td>C - Total charge for order</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>12.40</td>
<td>24.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>11.60</td>
<td>24.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>52</td>
<td>6.75</td>
<td>106.76</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>52</td>
<td>100.01</td>
<td>106.76</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Column C does not yet exist; it is what I would like to end up with-- the sum of the amounts of the overall total of any orders with the same number. The logic here is "if values in A match, add together values in B."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help or advice you may have.</p>

<li>Does my original Microsoft account email address and password stay the same with the new account?</li><li>Will the new account ask for an activation or product key? </li><li>If I close and reopen my account, will there be one or two accounts for Office on my computer?</li></ol>

            <p>Yes, you can sign of of Office and then sign in with a different account, but that is not changing the email associated with your current account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So do you want to be able to access Office using 2 differently paid for licenses via different email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to continue using the current license but access it via a different email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a couple of things you can try to make the second option work.&nbsp; I know the alias works, I don't know the process that claims to use an alias and then cancel the original account.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>You changed email service providers.</span></li><li><span>You changed your name or how you want to be addressed.</span></li><li><span>You want to use an email address that you'll remember more easily.</span></li><li><span>You prefer to use your phone number to sign in (available for use on Xbox One, Xbox.com, or account.microsoft.com).</span></li></ul>

</span></p>
<p><span>When your old email address doesn’t suit you anymore, but you want to save your contacts, online storage, subscriptions, and settings, then add an alias to your existing Microsoft account. An alias is another email address that works with
 the same account. </span></p>

<p><span>You can change the way you sign in and show up by adding aliases to your Microsoft account. An alias is an additional account name that can be an email address, phone number, or Skype&nbsp;name.&nbsp;It uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings
 as the primary alias. You can sign in to your account with any alias—they all use the same password.
</span></p>
<p><span>Some reasons to use aliases on your account include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You’re ready for a new email address, but don’t want to lose all your settings and data. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You&nbsp;want the flexibility of having&nbsp;several aliases that share the same subscriptions and&nbsp;inbox.
</span></li><li>Note</li><li>You cannot add an alias that is already associated with another Microsoft account. Aliases cannot be used to share information between two existing Microsoft accounts.

</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; When activating Office 2013 home and business I had a typo in my email address domain name.&nbsp; Now I am stuck because the verification email isn’t going to an actual email box, so I can’t verify.&nbsp; If I try to start over the product
 key is rejected as it is already in use!</span></p>
<p><span>HELP!!</span></p>
<p><span>Update, after waiting 90min on hold MS the fix is to install the product (I happened to have the download) and then click “I want to activate with product key”, then put a bogus code in so it will switch to give you a ‘I want to activate
 by telephone”.&nbsp; Call the number on the screen and explain everything, then they will activate your OFFICE 2013!&nbsp; The last step is to start a new live account and switch accounts.&nbsp; What a pain MS! &lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>Answer</span></p>
<p><em><span>“Now why would anyone ever want to do something like that”</span></em><span>&nbsp; &lt;heavy sarcasm&gt;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but apparently MS did not think that anyone would ever want to do that when it designed the Office 365 activation system.&nbsp; There is no easy fix for your question</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Well after nearly 2 hours of hold time, someone finally picked up. &nbsp;I&nbsp;explained&nbsp;my situation and he said he’s been getting a flood of phone calls in the past week regarding the issue. &nbsp;He explained that many people have registered for
 Office 365 with incorrect or&nbsp;misspelled&nbsp;email addresses/accounts and they currently have no power to change this. &nbsp;He only offered to escalate the issue to the next level and take down my contact information.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For anyone with the same issue, you should keep calling and make some noise over this because it’s insane that MS locks in your account, giving you no ability to change it. &nbsp;If I get no reply back on this in a few days, I will try and
 cancel my Office 365 University subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>However, I am now running into a roadblock because they require me to re-verify my university status. &nbsp;When I go enter my .edu address, they tell me it has already been used for verification of the 365&nbsp;subscription&nbsp;that customer support
 just cancelled. &nbsp;I’ve emailed them back about it and hopefully they can correct this.</span></p>

<p>#1 No.&nbsp; MS can only conceive of a user/email account having 1 Office license ((password is irrelevant to licensing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 yes, and the new license will wipe out the old one totally if it is a different license type. 365 Home and 365 Personal tend to extend each other. 365 University wipes both of them out and they wipe it out. I don't know where 365 Education stands. And
 I don't know much about business licenses, but you typically cannot use a "personal" account to activate a business license, and to the best of my knowledge different types of business licenses tend to wipe each other out (but I stand to be corrected on that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 See number 2</p>

<h2>            Centre Text in a MsgBox</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some questions about the use of MsgBox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Know you cannot centre text with a command in MsgBox, but I have thought of a round it, but not sure if it will work, but I'm stuck, and would like some help please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Can you set the Height of a MsgBox?</p>
<p>2. Can you set the Width of a MsgBox?</p>
<p>3. Can you set where on the screen that it will be displayed, ie. can you Centre it in the centre of the screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to use the following code to centre the Text...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MsgBoxWidth = Width/2</p>
<p>TitleWidth = len(Title)/2</p>
<p>Space = MsgBoxWidth-TitleWidth</p>
<p>Gap = Chr(32) * Space</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MsgBox(Gap &amp; Title)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure How do you set the Size of a MsgBox, and How do you convert the Gap to show the space&nbsp;size as in Space.</p>
<p>Ie. If Space = 10, how would I show it in Gap as "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ", so I can use code above so that the Title will be centred in the MsgBox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neil</p>

            You would use<br />
<br />
Dim Spaces As Long<br />
Dim Space As String<br />
Dim i As Long<br />
Spaces = Round(Len("Hello World")) / 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '5.5 rounded to 6<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 1 To Spaces<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Space = Space &amp; Chr(32)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox (Space &amp; "Hello World")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Hello World" 'original<br />
<br />
but frankly it doesn't look any better. As HansV has said you need a userform, and it is not as difficult as he implies. Add a userform to your project and add a label and a command button to the form. Don't worry about any of the relative sizes, element names,
 or positioning. (see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Userform.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Userform.htm</a> )<br />
<br />
Assign the following code to the form <br />
<br />
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
Unload Me<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
and then add the following code to your macro to call the userform and display the message in bold.<br />
<br />
Dim strMessage As String<br />
strMessage = "<b>This is a demonstration of the userform to display a message.</b>"<br />

    <title>Speeding up VLOOKUP calculations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wox33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speeding up VLOOKUP calculations</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am looking up values in 2 different tables and placing those values into a third table. My lookup tables are very large, the first is about 25,000 rows, and the second about 50,000. I have found that using non-exact vlookups (with lookup values in table
 sorted) is instantly faster than if I use exact match. However, I need to determine if a lookup value is present in the first table, and if not, find the value in the second table. In this case I use exact match and see if the vlookup returns an error as&nbsp;
 in:</p>
<p>=IF(ISNA(VLOOKUP($A2,Table1,3,FALSE)),VLOOKUP($A2,Table2,15),VLOOKUP($A2,Table1,3))</p>
<p>Is there a way to determine if the lookup value in table 1 is present or not in a much more efficient way? Just by changing the other vlookup functions to non-exact, I was able to cut calculation times from about 20min to 5min. Can this time be cut any further?
 Would INDEX-MATCH speed up the process any? Is there any other way to determine if the lookup value is not present in table 1?</p>
<p>Thank you for any help,</p>
<p>wox</p>

<p>Thank you Biff,</p>
<p>I like this idea as it will do away with the non-exact vlookups altogether. However when implementing the formula, =MATCH(A2,INDEX(Table1,,1)) it returns the position of the lookup_value in the table, but where it should give an error for a missing lookup_value,
 it returns the position of the most recent row. I assume that position is the number of the closest lookup_value to the one that is being searched for that row? It does return an error in rows prior to the first matching lookup_value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Ooops!</p>
<p>My fault.</p>
<p>Should be:</p>
<p>=MATCH(A2,INDEX(Table1,,1),0)</p>

<h2>            Cursor dissapears when using keyboard shortcuts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Word 2010, I use the keyboard shortcuts for navigation a lot, such as &lt;CTR&gt;&lt;Left-Larrow&gt; to move left one word, I often hold this down to move several words in quick succession.&nbsp; When I do this the cursor dissapears and does not re-appear until
 I loose the keys, making it impossible to accurately track where the cursor is.</p>
<p>I've tried adjusting cursor blink rate and making it thicker but this does not help.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on this please, it's driving me nuts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just loaded that application to my mac, and it's working well *EXCEPT* why is it only backing up my sms' that are on my internal memory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>do you know how to back up the texts on my memory card? because that's where the bulk of my sms' are and I'm very sad to lose them...</p>

<h2>            Error Code 9C57 fix needed</h2>
                    <p>Since 3-1-13 my PC has been unable to download an "important" update called "Windows IE9 for Win 7 for x64 Based Systems".&nbsp; I always get the "update failed" message and the dreaded "Error Code 9C57 (Windows Update_00009C57 Windows Update_dt000)".&nbsp; I run
 IE 9 on a Win 7 64bit system and I have been current on all "important updates" to that time.&nbsp; I use the MS automatic update feature and it has always worked fine in the past.&nbsp; I&nbsp;didn't download or change anythng around 3-1-13 to have caused this problem to
 my knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 3-1-13, my PC has successfully downloaded the same annoying "security update for Windows 7 x64 based systems (KB2799494) about 20 times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried MS Fixit tool many times, as well as all the suggested solutions I could find on the community forums.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; The damn update just won't install.&nbsp; I even tried to install the new IE 10 separately and it too won't work.&nbsp; I get the 9C57
 error code and a message saying that I can't update to IE 10 until an important update is installed on my PC.&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; This is driving me nuts as I've wasted hours on it with no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would seem that Microsoft would have a fix for 9C57 since they have identified it and assigned it a code.&nbsp; Why can't a specific fix be applied by MS for a specific error.&nbsp; Maddening.&nbsp; That Macbook Pro with retina display is looking better every day!!!</p>

Hello,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
I recently downloaded the ADMX and ADML files to update by GPM so I could manage the O365 software a bit better. &nbsp;I did this in the hopes of turning off the "Get Office Updates" that pop up in each O365 application for my domain users. &nbsp;However, after configuring
 my GPO, and running gpupdate /force on multiple machines, the application still shows "Get Office Updates" in the notification bar in the application. &nbsp;Is there anyone that can provide some insight?</p>

            Hi C.obrien,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We can configure update settings for Office 365 ProPlus with GPO referring to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn761708.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article </a>(GPO related section).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the configuration doesn’t work for you, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. Choose one computer, open one of the Office applications&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of Product Information.<br />
2. In the same computer, check if the value of registry key below is 0.<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\ClickToRun\Updates\UpgradeAdvertised (For Office 2016, change 15.0 to 16.0)<br />
3. Capture a screenshot of the update notification.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim

How do I keep on running Office 365 ProPlus 2013?</a><br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> After configuration, you can continue to receive updates for the Office 2013 version of Office 365 ProPlus until February 2017. After February 2017, there will be no more updates for Office 2013. Therefore, we recommend that

    <title>OneDrive for Business is Turning Off Read-Only File Property - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyranallo  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business is Turning Off Read-Only File Property</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Does anyone know how to prevent OneDrive for Business from turning off the read-only property when syncing read-only files? I'm using Windows 7 64-bit and am referring to Word and Excel files. To be clear, I do NOT need help sharing the file with someone
 and setting view-only permissions; I am looking for help simply keeping some of my files as read-only.</p>
<p>For example, I create Document A. I want Document A to be my starting point for many other documents and prevent any changes, so I use Windows Explorer to modify the file properties and check the "Read-Only" box. Now when I open the file and try to save,
 I am forced to save as a copy (Document B) because the file is read-only.</p>
<p>However, now OneDrive syncs the document and removes the read-only property from the file. Now every time I open the file and try to save, the original file is overwritten rather than me being forced to save a copy. Now I am modifying Document A rather than
 creating Document B.</p>
<p>Please help me understand how to fix this behavior and retain the read-only property. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>FYI the problem persists in Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Office 2010, Office 2013, and Office 2016.</p>

<p>So am I to understand there is no way to prevent changes to a file unless it is being shared with someone outside of the source OneDrive account? This seems like a rather large oversight because I know for a fact I am not the only person who needs this.
 After all, that's why the read-only property was created; seeing as Microsoft created OneDrive and Office 365, you'd think this core functionality would be retained.</p>

<h2>            One Drive Business Customer auto camera upload feature.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys</p>
<p>Currently the One Drive Business customer auto camera upload feature has over 10,000 requests on your feature vote section. Why has this not been implemented?</p>
<p>Personally my role within my company heavily relies on me uploading images and sharing them internally. This feature is the sole reason i keep a Dropbox account. It makes absolutely no sense to have this as an option for a personal account and not a business
 account. If customers don't want their personal photos uploaded then they should simply turn this feature off. for those of us who do require this feature we can choose to turn it on.. simple.. everyone is happy.</p>

<p><span>Hi Gerard,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For syncing photos on the phone to the OneDrive application, currently we can only use the personal account to achieve this while the feature doesn’t support our work or school account. This is mainly because
 the personal OneDrive is designed for personal use and it can sync our own photos on our phone and the OneDrive for Business is designed for Work. The photos on our phone mainly belongs to our daily life instead of working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, the statue for <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/suggestions/6621582-allow-automatic-upload-of-photos-and-video-from-mo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&nbsp;</span>We would suggest you keep monitoring to our related team as this is the best way to improve the product. Many features have been designed or upgraded based on our customers' constructive comments.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your patience. </span>

                    In Publisher 2003, before publishing my website to the web, when adding keywords to Meta Tags, do I add spaces after the commas that separate the key words?

                    I have some spreadsheets using macros on Windows Excel that have been used on 2003 and 2010 versions. I would also like to be able to use them on my mac in Excel 2011, however the buttons with assigned macros do not seem to work. The macros when run manually
 work fine. However it would be a real pain to have to go through each and every spreadsheet and create new buttons. Does anyone know of a way round this problem? As I would like the spreadsheets to be mac compatible. Thanks.

            If you used ActiveX buttons, there's no workaround. ActiveX is currently a Windows-only technology.
<div><br />
<div>When developing cross-platform, you must use controls from the Forms toolbar (called "Legacy controls" in recent WinXL versions).</div>

            Based on JE's response,there is no way other than to change each and every button to forms control buttons. That means deleting the active-x button and adding a new forms control (legacy) button and assign the macro to it. It may be a real pain but it
 is the only way. The result will work fine on both windows and Mac platforms.<br />

            <p>There is no use of ActiveX, I was sure to check that as I am aware that Mac does not support it. But ok, thanks, I will have to recreate the buttons. What a pain!
</p>
<p>And I have tried to use the files under several different file types and his has not made a difference. The issues seems to be only that the macro driven buttons are un-usable, despite the macro being ok.</p>

            If these are not Active-X controls they should work. Can you post a workbook somehwere on a public site and then reply with a link so we can see one of the non-working controls?

    <title>Need hyperlink from concatenation of two other cells - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin28025  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need hyperlink from concatenation of two other cells</h2>
                    
<p>Trying to create a hyperllink using the =HYPERLINK function.&nbsp; Cell b2 contains start of URL in format<a href="http://xxxx.xxxx.xxx:9090/(additionalparameters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xxxx.xxxx.xxx:9090/(additionalparameters</a>) which remains constant. Cell c2 contains final
 information that needs to be concatenated with b2 to form the full URL.</p>
<p>Have confirmed that both b2 and c2 are seen as text (=ISTEXT(cellref) returns TRUE for both).</p>
<p>Using formlua =HYPERLINK(b2&amp;c2) returns #VALUE! with further explanation of 'A value used in the formula is of the wrong data type."</p>
<p>Evaluating the formula through Show Calucation Steps seems to show a properly constructed URL.</p>
<p>Any assistance appreciated.</p>

<p>Highlight the B2&amp;C2 in the formula, copy it, go to the Web &amp; paste it in the address bar &amp; see if it takes you to the right place. Works fine for me using:</p>
<p>=HYPERLINK(A2&amp;A3)<br />
where A2 had <a href="http://www" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www</a>.</p>

<h2>            MS projects - You moved .... to start on a nonworking day</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Ms Projects latest version (365 cloud with desktop application) I'm trying to move on the desktop app a 1 day duration task to Friday which in the default calendar (Sunday - Thursday) that I've set is a non working day, so I'm getting an error&nbsp;You moved
 "Task Name" to start on a nonworking day and it only let's me continue if I agree to move it to next working day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All sound reasonable, BUT my issue with it is that the resource I've assigned this task to does work on Friday (M-F) and it's calendar is set correctly to work on Friday, so I do not understand why I can't set the task to Friday...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does work the other way, if I set that task to Sunday it automatically moves to Monday...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>haim132,</p>
<p>Tom caught it and I later noticed that your screen shot of the Task Information window shown in your post of March 8 says that "some fields above are not editable because the task is manually scheduled". So something is amiss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use leveling but don't want splits, I suggest you uncheck the leveling option that says, "Leveling can create splits in remaining work".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
