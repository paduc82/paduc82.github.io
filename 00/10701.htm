            If the location is failing a reflash won't change anything I don't think it really sounds like a hardware problem if it's simply an Ariel issue it will not be very expensive to fix you can pick up an Ariel for a few dollars but if it's not the problem
 it's impossible to say how much it will cost you say you have done a reset on it was that a hard or soft reset? If it was the latter you could try a factory reset but again it sounds like a hardware problem rgds Roy

    <title>Office 2010 IMAP deleted messages still show with strike-through - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 2010 IMAP deleted messages still show with strike-through</h2>
                    
<p>We had been on Office 2003 and had the strike-through issue with deleted emails on our new IMAP server. So we purchased a copy of Outlook 2010 and installed that. However, when we delete a message, it still shows up with a strike-through instead of actually
 deleting the message. I configured the account so that deleted messages would go to the Deleted Items folder. When&nbsp;I delete an item, it does go to that folder, but it also stays in the Inbox with a strike-through.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Diane,</p>
<p>Just wanted to follow-up that setting up a new account resolved this!</p>
<p>When I installed Outlook 2010, I had it do an upgrade to the existing version. And it automatically imported/converted the existing accounts.</p>
<p>So, if anyone else has this issue, creating a new account in Outlook 2010 takes care of it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

                    I pick up my email using my N95. Can I use my PC to somehow send a reply using my PC like I do with text messages? There appears to be no app similar to the SMS/MMS ones that there are in PC Suite.

            Why would you want to use your PC to reply or send a mail thru your N95, while I suppose your PC is already connected to the internet... ?<br />
<br />
Maybe you could use IMAP access to your mailbox on N95, and configure your mail client on your PC to also access your mailbox via IMAP. At least you'll make sure the view you get on your mailbox is fully synchronized.

            Why would I want to send email on my phone and not my PC? Well because I received the email on my phone and so therefore the email message is on my phone. If I want to reply and quote the original email then I can't can I ;-)

            I have a similar request.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to write/create email messages using PC Suite, or an alternative application, and have it sent via my Nokia mobile (in my case, the E61i) as we can with SMSes?<br />
<br />
The reason this feature would be useful to me is that whilst I can receive and send emails via my mobile connection, I don't actually have internet connection on my computer at home - don't ask why, it's a long story.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas how this can be done?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            That solution doesn't work for me - I wouldn't go into the long story, but when at home, I have a "quirky" method of receiving and retrieving emails that uses the mobile operators 3G services. It's not a proper internet connection at all. I can't get on
 the web on this connection.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?

            How can we help if you don't give the specifics of your case?<br />
<br />
Note that using the phone as a modem doesn't mean using the web. The web is just part of the Internet. Accessing mail servers is another, as is IRC, VoIP etc. and the list of protocols goes on. If your phone can access a mail server then your computer can through
 the phone being used as a modem.

            Let me give this a try.<br />
<br />
My mobile service provider is "3 mobile" in Australia (<a href="http://www.three.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.three.com.au</a>).<br />
<br />
As part of their 3G packages, I get unlimited access to emails (both receiving and sending) if I go through their servers, i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. In order to do this, I've set up the E61i to access my three.com.au email account using the 3G connection.<br />
<br />
I have tried using the E61i as a modem through PC Suite - the feature that says "connect to the internet". Unfortunately this does not work and I suspect it's simply because I'm not signed up for internet access with the mobile provider.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I can use the E61i's keyboard to type my emails but of course, it would be so much easier to be able to do on a "proper" computer - much like using the SMS feature on PC Suite.<br />
<br />
My workaround so far is to type my emails as if they were SMSes on PC Suite, save them as drafts, then go to the E61i, cut and paste the draft into a new email message. It's not perfect, but it's a workaround.<br />
<br />
What do you reckon?

<p>
</p><p>I am having a similar experience in SharePoint Online where there is a<em> phantom "unassigned" grouping with one file that is not visible</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Modern View Grouping shows an "unassigned" file when it is expanded with default set to collapsed</strong>.</p>
<p>- Modern View Grouping does not show an "unassigned" file when the default is set to expanded. The "unassigned" does not show up when collapsed and re-expanded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- No variation of Classic View shows the "unassigned" file.</p>
<p>- Grouping by different columns does not show any "unassigned" files in Modern or Classic views with any setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Grouping is by two columns, but "unassigned" always shows up for either of these columns individually when Modern View and collapsed is selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- There are documents awaiting check in.</p>
<p>- There are no documents waiting assignment of the metadata.</p>
<p>- The columns are both choice types. There are no extra strings or funny characters on any row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- There are only 45 documents in library currently. No "unassigned" data exists on any row in the all documents view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not horrible, but the user group wants an explanation as they are convinced there is a file out there they cannot see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jbee_11<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed information.<br />
<br />
The <strong>Group by</strong> option in view settings is just according to the column value to set a display mode by group. It has no effect on the items in library.<br />
For example, when we select the <strong>Tittle</strong> column for the first group and
<strong>Modified</strong> column for the subgroup, items will show as the following picture shows:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If this is not your situation, please provide the following information to help us clarify it:<br />
1. The two <strong>columns</strong> you select in<strong> Group by</strong> option.<br />
2. A screenshot of the display shows in group as the above picture.<br />
3. A screenshot of the columns you have checked to display.<br />

<h2>            Publisher MasterPage - how do I fill the boxes on a normal page&#63;</h2>
                    I started a new document in Publisher 2013. Made some master pages. Used them in the document. When I go to the "normal" pages of the document I can see the textboxes I created on the master page. Now I want to put text into the text boxes, but I cannot
 select them, so I cannot write text or paste text into these boxes. Neither can I change text like "Headline" from the masterpage to the actual headline of the article on the normal page. I am used to work with InDesign, where I just control-klick the box
 and can add text (I think it was ctrl-klick...). There must be a way to do this, otherwise I would'nt need masterpages! I am not talking of web pages, just plain old magazines.&nbsp;

<p>Master Pages in Publisher are intended to contain content that is seen in each page of the publication. You can also create multiple master pages and apply them to different pages. If you inserted text boxes on the Master Page then you must be in Master
 Page view in order to insert or edit text in those boxes. If you insert a text box on the normal page then you also insert or edit text in that view, not in MP view.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

<p>I have the same problem, I have tried out all thinkable combination’s of port 80, 443, Non-provisionable devide, but nothing works. I can log on to the web exchange server I can see that the N9 has been in connection, but it seems that it fails before completing.</p>
<p>My company exchange server forces me to create a phone lock code and that remains active even after deleting the exchange account. I am not able to change this, only by resetting the phone deleting everything I can get rid of the code.</p>
<p>I have no doubt, that this is something to do with the settings on the company exchange server that are very strict. And the N9 can for some reason not deal with this.</p>
<p>I can use the exchange account with no problems on my e52, 5800 and N8 so the problem is the N9 and not the server.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 technical preview zoomed things in&#63;</h2>
                    I just updated the latest build of WIndows 10 and everything is extremely zoomed in now. Its extremely annoying. I tried changing my tv settings, tried changing resolution on my pc, nothing is working. This messed up my image so much. Is this a bug that
 will be fixed or is my system completely messed up now?

            Ive tried the resolution fix, nothing worked, and my graphics card did need an update. So i ran the update, restarted, and its still the same. Images are a bit clearer, but still larger than normal. One way I know its not supposed to be this big is the
 bookmarks on my Google Chrome browser could fit around 10-15 on the main bar, now it can only fit about 6-8. I have a custom built pc so I dont know how to give you a make or model. I am running an AMD Radeon HD 7800 series graphics card.&nbsp;

<p>Must have been coincidence.&nbsp; I "me too'd" your post (can't click "me too" on mine) and I still can't get the app to stay open long enough to finish the sign in process.&nbsp; I can enter my login and password and they are accepted.&nbsp; But then it wants my MS password
 again and about half way through typing it, the app closes.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and <span>
I recommend you to leave your findings, comments and feedback related to this product using the “<strong>Feedback app</strong>”. Members of the Windows Insider Program can provide feedback about the Tech Preview directly to our engineers by using the
<strong>Windows Feedback app</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to this article by “<strong>Nirmal S</strong>” to know more on “How to share feedback on Windows 10 Technical Preview?” :
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winipp/how-to-share-feedback-on-windows-10-technical/5e501781-a580-43e3-8926-40ae19343805"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winipp/how-to-share-feedback-on-windows-10-technical/5e501781-a580-43e3-8926-40ae19343805</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that within few days new build is going to launch, so I would suggest you to update the insider preview and see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Large PowerPoint Mac Files Corrupted - Save but Cannot Open</h2>
                    <p>Am trying to create PowerPoint file containing videos and loaded with hi-res images. For example, I start with an already large pptx file (4 GB) that edits, saves and opens normally. Then I add a slide containing a large (1.5 GB) video. The file then seems
 to save normally. But attempts to re-open get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/289a5980-1442-4d40-aec0-1da8d9ac12e8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/289a5980-1442-4d40-aec0-1da8d9ac12e8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>When I click 'Repair' I get the spinning rainbow, and then....</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/431c5697-e62b-4598-bef1-d934e2a00baf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/431c5697-e62b-4598-bef1-d934e2a00baf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens every time.... There is no escape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a pptx file with just the video on a single slide, the file saves and opens normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there seems to be some size threshold above which PowerPoint goes south and cannot properly save and reopen a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running PowerPoint for Mac 16.20 on an iMac running OS X Mojave 10.14.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Since 16.20 is pre-release, you may experience bugs that wouldn't exist in the final version. In addition, there are quirks introduced by Mojave that haven't been patched yet, since it's a new OS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd try this with a variety of videos before concluding that PowerPoint can't handle it. The error message you see is most likely related to an XML syntax error, possibly only incidentally related to the videos or their size. That explains your ability to
 create a 1 slide deck with the video that works correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround to get you through your current task, you can try linking the video instead of embedding it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the video in the same folder as the presentation. </li><li>Choose <strong>Insert&gt;Movie&gt;Video from File...</strong> from the menu at the top of your screen or
<strong>Insert&gt;Video&gt;Movie from File...</strong> on the Ribbon.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Options</strong> button.</li><li>Check <strong>Link to File</strong>, then click on <strong>Insert</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you have to send out the deck, specify that the video must remain in the same folder as the presentation.</p>

    <title>Oauth authentication in AddIn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martaszurko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Oauth authentication in AddIn</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have made an Office addin (MVC web app) that I would like to use in Excel. I use Oauth authentication and next I try to get the token. This web app is working fine in the browser where it gets access token from Azure but in Excel 2013 (and 2016) it is
 not working. When I enter username and password, it open an Internet Explorer window outside Excel 2013 an the following error has been displayed: "AADSTS90056: This endpoint only accepts POST requests".
<br />
Please help me configure correctly Oauth authentication to work in Excel.</p>

            Most likely the developer used Active-X controls, which simply do not exist on the Mac. The form must be re-created using standard (aka legacy) controls, not Active-X.

<h2>            Refreshing data from another Excel file without losing changes to existing file.</h2>
                    I have an Excel file that is generated from a query in Access and will be updated on a daily basis. &nbsp;In the Excel file, there are additional columns for users to add more details that will be part of formula as well as columns for notes and such. &nbsp;I need
 to have the data from the Access query add the new information to the existing Excel spreadsheet without erasing any of the information that was entered in the spreadsheet. &nbsp;Also if information is filtered out of the Access query it should be removed from
 the spreadsheet. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not want users to make changes in Access only in the Excel file and the information entered in the Excel file should not go back to the Access tables. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On top of that I am using Office 2003.</div>

            <p>In a Purchasing Department they had to download the list of active POs every day, and add comments if there were new POs, but keep the comments for the other POs active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the query will change the position of the rows, and some will come and go, a solution was needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They had six columns updated from a query.</p>
<p>PO</p>
<p>Vendor</p>
<p>Buyer</p>
<p>Item</p>
<p>Required Quantity</p>
<p>Due date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in column G they would enter their comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution was to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Copy the sheet as it was, with all the comments, and paste it as valued to another sheet called "old comments".</p>
<p>b) Comments would be retrieved by using a VLOOKUP in column G. The VLOOKUP looked for codes in "old comments".</p>
<p>c) Upon refreshing the data, buyers would update column G in the refreshed sheet.</p>

<h2>            Can only access 1st page of search results</h2>
                    I often use Bing instead of Google as my search engine. &nbsp;Last week however I started having a problem with Bing - it will only allow me to access the first page of the search results. &nbsp;When I try to go to the next page it just reloads the first page of
 results. &nbsp;I'm using a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). &nbsp;Has anyone else ever had this problem? &nbsp;Any ideas on what's wrong and how to fix it would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            &#34;internet explorer has stopped working&#34; in windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Previous posts do NOT address the specifics of this issue.&nbsp; Here's the basics:</p>
<p>HP Pavilion, W8.1, IE11.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In <strong>desktop</strong> the popup message "internet explorer has stopped working" comes up with every address entered.&nbsp; The only one we can get to with repeated "check for solution" is Facebook.</p>
<p>In IE <strong>App</strong> there are no error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the other half for some reason had to add Chrome, which works without error (but we would prefer not to use it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Just remember, we're not computer experts so be specific and don't presume we know the advanced methods&nbsp;(including reg edit).</p>
