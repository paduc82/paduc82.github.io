<h2>            How do I get back to Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title:- Windows 10 has left me in a rut. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have upgraded both of my computers to Windows 10 and it's made my computers impossible to use, and though it has not been 30 days yet, I can't seem to find any recover to Windows 8.1 options anywhere. I have called Microsoft and after telling them my situation
 they told me to, "Just call the manufacturer." So then I called the Sony Vaio support and they went ahead and tell me my one and only option is to pay them $100 dollars to revert me to my previous version of Windows. I am almost sure they are just trying to
 get money out of me for something I can probably just do myself. Can anyone provide me with advice? (I don't want to pay $100 for this for each of my computers.)</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows on a Mac, setup, security, etc.</h2>
                    <p>I am on a Core i5 iMac running MacOS X 10.10 Yosemite. I am planning to upgrade to MacOS 10.12 Sierra, but that will be some time down the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install Microsoft Windows 10 and be able to launch Win10 through Boot Camp, making my iMac a dual-boot machine. I want to do this so I have the ability to run Microsoft Access (Windows-only) as well as a few other applications. (I intend to purchase
 a subscription to Office 365 along with Windows.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Is it best to just buy a download copy of Win10 from Microsoft's web-site, paying for it directly to Microsoft? Are there any other means of acquiring to proper license/copy of Win10? Any inexpensive deals for CD or DVD installation copies for sale anywhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: Since I intend to only use it for specific applications and MacOS X will remain my primary operating environment, how do I turn up the security in Win10 to avoid problems/viruses/spyware, etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3: Are there any instructional videos about installing Win10 that I should look at for special tips, tricks, and basic how-to's?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4: Is there any special online training or tips I should seek about using SharePoint and OneDrive on my iMac? I want to be able to collaborate on projects with other Office users using these online services. If I do this, are there any special security systems
 I should activate to protect my team's projects and my iMac?</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Digital download licenses are just as valid as purchasing a physical shrink wrapped copy in a store. In fact, the digital download is recommended, since you are getting the latest version, while the shrink wrapped physical copy, is stuck at version
 1507 (build 10240). The Digital download gives you version 1703 (build 15063). You can also create your own bootable copy on a USB or DVD using the Boot camp wizard.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Security is pretty much an out of box experience in Windows 10 due to its software as a service mechanism, which ensures that you install the latest updates and patches automatically. The most important thing to do is to ensure Windows Updates, Windows
 Defender definitions are installed, applications are kept updated and new Feature Updates are installed as they become available. You can check out the following article on Groovypost for more information about enabling advanced security features in Windows

<p>I asked this question before the new forums came out, which I'm still getting use to (although I wish I didn't have to). My friend said they had put 3 months membership on, then put another 3 months on, the second lot cancelled out the first lot. Is this
 possible? And if I put 12 months on then, then another 12, do I get 24, or does only the second count? Thank ye</p>

    <title>Microsoft Narrator reports the wrong state of &#34;Caps Lock,&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ÊÆony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Narrator reports the wrong state of &#34;Caps Lock,&#34; &#34;Num Lock,&#34; and &#34;Scroll Lock&#34; if typematic is invoked</h2>
                    When Microsoft Narrator is used to Echo User Keystrokes, and when the Caps Lock (or Num Lock or Scroll Lock) key is pressed and held long enough to trigger Typematic (typically 0.5 seconds), then when the key is released Microsoft Narrator will announce
 the wrong state of the toggle.&nbsp; For example, if Caps Lock has just been turned on, it will announce "Caps Lock Off."&nbsp; This anomaly occurs in windows 7 but did not occur in Windows XP.&nbsp; (I don't know about windows Vista.)&nbsp; While this behavior is no big deal
 for a sighted user, it could be a source of confusion for a blind user.&nbsp; Can Microsoft provide a fix via windows Update?<br />
<br />
It is also true in windows 7 that if a key is struck after another key has been repeating (Typematic), Narrator may announce the key that was released in preference to the key that was just struck.&nbsp; For example, if the user holds down the "a" key, then releases
 it and immediately strikes the "b" key, Narrator may announce "a" but not "b".&nbsp; I don't know whether this anomaly is another symptom of the same problem, or whether there are two separate bugs.<br />

            <p>Thanks, Mr. Wilson.&nbsp; I looked at connect.microsoft.com, but it appears to be only for products in beta test.&nbsp; At least, I couldn't find anywhere there to report bugs in Narrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it's working for you but not for me because you're running a newer (or older) version of windows.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit edition with SP1 and all "important" fixes that are available from Windows Update installed.&nbsp; The Narrator.exe
 in my system32 directory is version 6..1.7601.17514 dated 11/20/2010.&nbsp; What are you running?</p>

            <p>As suggested, I have downloaded and run the Microsoft Safety scanner (full scan).&nbsp; It found no problems.&nbsp; (I would have been surprised and disappointed if it had caught anything.&nbsp; Microsoft security Essentials provides real-time protection for my PC, and
 I hope that everything which the Safety Scanner checks is also checked by Security Essentials.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three user accounts on my PC, one administrative and two standard accounts.&nbsp; The bug manifests itself in all three accounts.&nbsp; I have also had a colleague try it on his machine, running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit edition, and had my wife try
 it on her laptop, running Windows 7 Professional 32 bit edition.&nbsp; (As noted previously, my PC is running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit edition.)&nbsp; The same bug is manifest on all three machines.&nbsp; I have also tried the scenario on two older machines, one running
 Windows XP Professional and one running Windows 2000 Professional.&nbsp; Neither of these older machines manifests the bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the evidence I have been able to observe supports my original supposition that the bug was introduced with Windows 7 (or possibly Windows vista) and affects all versions of windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retandeep, are you running a Windows-based system?&nbsp; What version of Windows and what version of Narrator do you have?&nbsp; Do they exhibit the bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure for reproducing (one case of) the bug is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Be sure your speakers or headphones are turned on and operating properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Start Microsoft Narrator.&nbsp; Be sure the "Echo user keystrokes" checkbox on the Narrator main window is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. On the keyboard, press and hold the Caps Lock key for 2 seconds or longer (long enough to invoke Tupematic).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Release the Caps Lock key and note that Narrator announces "Caps Lock Off" whereas caps lock has actually been turned on, as reflected by the indicator light on the keyboard and the fact that letters typed into a text field appear in upper case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know whether you are able to reproduce the bug.</p>

            <p>As suggested, I ran the system file checker, which found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due respect, I'm becoming fed up with the irrelevant suggestions posted on this issue.&nbsp; After all, how likely is it that a corrupt system file would manifest itself in an identical bug in three different computers, owned and operated by three different
 people, obtained from two different suppliers/refurbishers, and running three different editions of Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To all would-be helpful people: please DO NOT REPLY to this thread until you have checked your own computer, using the simple procedure documented above, to find out if the bug is present on your machine.&nbsp; If you have the bug, please don't suggest a fix
 to me until you've tried it and found that it fixes the bug on your own machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a machine running Windows 7 or later that does NOT show the bug, I'd be interested to hear what version&nbsp; of the operating system you're running.&nbsp; I'd be pleased to learn that Microsoft has fixed the bug in Windows 8, but somehow I doubt they
 have.</p>

            Hi Janet.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps for fixing Windows Hello:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />    Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />    Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> 
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Compatibility - Paint Tool SAI - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Compatibility - Paint Tool SAI</h2>
                    <p>I have used my Paint Tool SAI program (by Systemax) on my old PC, however, it doesn't work on my new one. It works but the text and everything are really small. When I was going through compatibility I saw the option for 640x480 resolution. That's the problem,
 it works much better with this resolution but it's a bit too small. (It worked well with 1920x1080 on my last PC) I was wondering if I could change that option so it would be1920x1080. I don't want to have to manually change my resolution every time I use
 this program.</p>

<p>IP 192.168.1.X (X= numeri da 2 a 14)</p>

<p>Per le console connesse direttamente alla Wodafone Station funziona.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Comunque per il tuo problema, l'MTU non dipende da te, purtroppo il problema √® di Vodafone, chiama il loro call center &nbsp;e gli spieghi il problema. Non fermarti al primo operatore a meno che non ti risolva il problema...</p>
<p>Il problema non √® della tua console, n√® di Microsoft, ma √® della tua connessione ed in generale del Vodafone station che d√† spesso questi problemi.</p>

<p>Ecco come aprirlo, ti basta aprire il browser e digitare l‚Äôindirizzo 192.168.1.1 e entrare nella pagina dal menu sulla sinistra ‚ÄúFirewall‚Äù e poi in ‚ÄúPort Forwarding‚Äù</p>
<p>L'elenco delle porte da aprire √® questo: <br />
<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>80<br />
</td>
<td>TCP<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>88<br />
</td>
<td>UDP<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3074 <br />
</td>
<td>TCP<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3074<br />
</td>
<td>UDP<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>53<br />
</td>
<td>TCP<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>53<br />
</td>
<td>UDP<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
Devi specificare quindi:</p>
<ol>
<br />
<li>numero della porta </li><li>il protocollo [TCP o UDP] </li><li>l'indirizzo IP della tua <b>Xbox</b> </li></ol>
<p>Scegli l'indirizzo IP della tua <b>Xbox</b> a piacere.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> L'importante √® che sia uguale all'indirizzo IP del tuo router ad esclusione dell'ultima cifra</span>, ad esempio se il tuo router ha come indirizzo 192.168.1.1
 puoi usare 192.168.1.7 o 192.168.1.35 ecc.. <br />
<br />
Per finire devi settare un indirizzo statico sulla tua<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Xbox</span>. Vai sul menu di impostazioni di rete - impostazioni IP e scrivi:</p>
<ol>
<br />
<li>Indirizzo IP su cui hai sbloccato le porte </li><li>subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 </li><li>gateway: Indirizzo IP del tuo router (es. 192.168.1.1) </li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Network Computers not shown consistently in Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Laptop from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; The system seemed to perform fine for a little while, then I began to have problems with Explorer not showing Network Computers.&nbsp; Sometimes, it could not see itself and others it could
 see other computers.&nbsp; I did a Reset Network and it seemed to clear up and all computers were shown, but later in the day, they disappeared.</p>

            Hi BC.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />They've broken networking in Windows 10, which some think is to push us to use OneDrive to share files.  It is a simple solution, just drop the files in OneDrive, or turn on Folder Protections so that Desktop, Documents and/or Pictures live there.
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for files sharing problems so at least something will work. If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />See here for how to share files and printers over network after removal of HomeGroup:
<br /> <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-share-files-and-printers-without-homegroup-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-share-files-...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To troubleshoot  sharing problems:

<br />
<br />If Windows 7 is involved make sure if applicable you have the WIndows Update released to fix Windows 7 sharing issues here:  <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-kb4487345-update-to-fix-windows-7-share-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft...</a>
<br />
<br />Test if turning off Controlled Folder access helps:  <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/controlled-folder-access-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/controlled-folde...</a>
<br />
<br />You may want to change to sharing via OneDrive:  <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/microsoft-windows/how-to-use-onedrive-in-windows-10-to-sync-and-share-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; The links you provided make it difficult for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after I upgraded, things worked fine.&nbsp; I could see all computers in Explorer and I could share files and folders.&nbsp; Today I have an odd problem where A Networked computer that has a remote hard drive (connected to a usb port) is not visible in my laptop's
 Explorer Network section, but when I run a sync file program (FreeFileSync), it can see the drive on the networked computer.&nbsp; I don't understand why the computer isn't showing in Explorer even though it is accessible.</p>

<p>Something odd happened when I hit Windows + R and entered \\computername ... When I did this, it found the computer no problem and the directory on that computershowed up in Explorer Network, but when I backed to just Network, the computername computer disappeared.&nbsp;
 Note too that the Explorer is not showing the computername for the computer I'm on either.</p>
<p>

            How did the links I provide to go over File Sharing carefully, make it more difficult?  These steps usually work if the problem is fixable - which it isn't always.

<p>I went through the links you provided (multiple times).&nbsp; When this problem first started, I had a PC upgraded from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home and a Laptop upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; The problem seemed to be unstable in that it
 would work fine and then it would suddenly not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, I think I determined that the PC running Windows 10 Home seemed to show both computers consistently in Explorer&gt;Network, but the laptop running Windows 10 Pro could not see the PC (only the Laptop showed on the Laptop running Windows 10 Pro).&nbsp;
 I ran sfc/scannow and dism on both computers, but it did not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In frustration I opted to restore the laptop to Windows 7 Pro to see if things were different there.&nbsp; I went in and made sure all the recommended services were running and set to auto or auto delayed in both computers.&nbsp; I also confirmed that the sharing
 is set up correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can get both the PC (Windows 10 Home) and the Laptop (Windows 7 Pro) to show both computers in Explorer&gt;Network BUT ... Every once and a while, the PC (running Windows 10 Home) disappears on the Laptop (running Windows 7 Pro).&nbsp; I have found that if
 I go into services on The PC (running Windows 10 Pro) and stop Function Discovery Resource Publication and then start it again and do the same thing for Function Discovery Provider Host, the PC shows up again on the Laptop (running Windows 7 Pro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this indicate that something is wrong with Windows 10 Home?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance will be appreciated and thank you for your suggestions.</p>

            Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; Per your guidance I just went in and created a Task in Task Scheduler to stop and start Function Discovery Resource Publication on the PC running Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; Hopefully this eliminates my problem.

<h2>            Taskbar pinning problems&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm having problems with pinning programs/shortcuts to my taskbar, I'm not really good at explaining so I just made a video about my issue and how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Video:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fo3BW8Ff9o</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if I can fix this, i'm really sick of it and I just got this computer about 2 months ago... so I don't wanna buy a new one just because I can't pin anything to the taskbar. Oh also, you're wondering in the video how is Skype/Chrome/Firefox
 on the taskbar if I couldn't pin anything? I pinned those when I first got this computer now i'm not able to pin anything. Hopefully I can resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>~ Naufan ;-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>~ Thanks for any help if I can get any with this annoying issue.</p>

<h2>            sign out problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have found huge problem in the latest version of Skype, when I sign out my ID from Skype app. It keeps my user name and can sign in again without asking for password. Which is very big mistake as sign out means completely disconnecting from the app. Please
 update it with option with save password as was previously valid like in desktop app or update sign out with again asking for password along with ID.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> tom_sadowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows can&#59;t verify the publisher -but doesn&#39;t tell me what publisher</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10. At random every few days, a Windows Security message pops up to let me know that "Windows can't verify the publisher of this driver software". The message gives absolutely no indication of the name of the publisher of the nature
 of the driver. I do not "install this driver anyway" as I do not know from whence it came. This has been going on for 2 months now, Can such a defective and poorly worded notice truly be from Microsoft or is there something nefarious going on?&nbsp; Should I just
 let it install a mystery driver and take my chances?

            Hi, Tom_Sadowski
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />‚Ä¢- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />‚Ä¢- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />‚Ä¢- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />‚Ä¢-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<p>Hello Kathleen,</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice. I ran the diagnostics you suggested and came out with a clean bill of health on all counts. However, this did not answer my question about what application is trying to install an unsigned driver update. I will
 have to wait an unknow amount of time to see if error message comes up again before I can tell you if the procedure stopped the message from repeating. You did not mention how this procedure could clear up the problem. Also, for those people like me, who do
 not know, SFC stands for System File Checker; </p>
<p>I do feel a sense of relief that the computer has no problems however. By the way, people should be aware that the procedure will take well over 2 hours (on systems such as mine) and as a minor aside, please note that your instructions
 saying <span>&nbsp;</span>‚Äúenter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key‚Äù really should say ‚Äúpress the Enter key after typing each of the following commands and allowing the processes to finish‚Äù. Just a suggestion to minimize ambiguity.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>

<li>Hit Windows Key + I or open Start Menu &gt; click Settings</li><li>Click Accounts</li><li>Click "Sign in with a local account instead" right above where you change your profile picture</li><li>Set username and leave password blank.</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>Try searching for command prompt with Cortana in the search bar next to the start button and try running it using the Run command by hitting Windows Key + R or right-clicking the start button and clicking run then type in "cmd". If neither of these work
 the executable for Command Prompt may be missing.</p>

There is an option to keep personal files but I would back them up just in case.

            <p>When I try to leave the password box blank, I am told that this is an essential requirement. I either must enter a password or&nbsp;hit Cancel and&nbsp;get back to where I started.</p>
<p>In other words, this method of bypassing the need to enter a password does not work. At least for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried using Windows + R followed by netplwiz and unchecking the "Users must enter username and password&nbsp; .... " box.&nbsp; It worked for several days and I was able to log on without a password. Then it stopped working and I now have to enter a password
 to log on. </p>
<p>Despite repeating the procedures above, I can't stop the need to enter a password.</p>

    <title>Xbox DVR recording corrupt files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normalrug269460  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox DVR recording corrupt files</h2>
                    <p>So I've been trying to get the Xbox DVR that comes with windows 10 to work for about an hour and a half now and it keeps giving me the same error. It will record the game just fine but when I try to watch the video with any video player, it says that it either doesn't support the file type or the that the file is corrupted. I've recorded four different games and it says the same thing for each of them. I have no idea what is causing this because before I started to record a full game (around 30 minutes) of league of legends I tested it out by going into a private game by my self and it worked fine. Now it doesn't work. I didn't change any settings that I know of that would do something like this. I did move the captures folder but that was after two recordings. I have no idea what to do about this so some help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop USB Port Keyboard and Mouse Combo Constantly disconnects</h2>
                    So when it's connected all is well.&nbsp; Keyborard, keypad and mouse all work fine.&nbsp; At varying timeframes on two different computers it loses connection.&nbsp; If I pull out the reciever and put it back in it reconnects for again for awhile then loses connection
 again.&nbsp; This happens over and over never stays connected.&nbsp; All batteries are brand new.&nbsp; Seems like it the transceiver but I hope there is a way to fix this.&nbsp; Note this is my 2nd unit and the 1st works without issue on both PC's I tried the one that is not
 working properly.

            Hi ncinsguy,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Try making sure Windows is set to high-performance mode in Control Panel &gt; Power Options
<br />
<br />Then click change settings for plan.
<br />
<br />Then click change advanced power settings
<br />
<br />Go to USB settings.
<br />
<br />There you will see USB Selective Suspend. This is rather than staying on or completely shutting off, selective suspend allows the operating system to place a single USB port into low-power mode. Maybe this is causing your issue. So turn this off.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi NC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does the same problem happen on another PC which would point to the devices?
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />For USB keyboard or mouse first program the power button first to Shut down the PC at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do .
<br />
<br />Then go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, expand and uninstall the USB controllers, Keyboard and finally Mouse drivers, press Power button to shut down PC, then power on to restart PC and reinstall drivers.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>i am using windows xp on my on my IBM T23 Thinkpad laptop. I am using an Netgear WGT624 router. I recently had to remove my CA antivirus software and reinstall it, since then I have not been able to connect to the internet, I get the limited or no connectivity
 because the network did not assign a network address to the computer.&nbsp; in the details of the network connections i get:</p>
<p>IP 169.254.7.35 subnet 255.255.0.0 automatic private address instead of :</p>
<p>IP 192.168.x.x subnet 255.255.255 .0 assigned by DHCP&nbsp; which i previously got.</p>
<p>I checked the DHCP Client, DNS Client, Windows Zero Cinfiguration are started and on automatic, as far as i can tell the DHCP is not assigning an address, any suggestions?</p>

<p><span>Anti-virus software may be causing this issue; I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Disable the anti-virus software and check to see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn‚Äôt persist, configure your anti-virus software to allow internet access, you may want to check the documentation that came along with the program
 to accomplish this task. </span></p>

<h2>            Receive access denied error when attempting to install printer drivers for  hp deskjet 6127 in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>New computer running Windows 7, trying to install driver for my printer hp Deskjet 6127, HP website says not a compatible driver but I can use hp Deskjet 990c driver and it will give most of the functionality.&nbsp; I follow all the directions and when am at
 point of downloading the 990c driver the computer will give me an error message that says "Driver Installation Failed, Access Denied".&nbsp; Have gone into administrator and lowered slider to bottom, turned off "Window Defender" all to no avail.&nbsp; How do I get this
 driver installed or if you have a better solution to get this printer to work I'd love to hear it!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Most likely the driver package installation failed when adding to the driverstore.&nbsp; You can attempt to add the package to the driverstore using pkgmgr.exe but I'm guessing this will also fail with access denied.&nbsp; The spooler attempts to add the package
 to the driver store then add the one driver you need out of the package to the spooler service.&nbsp; Basically you need to determine why the package install fails.
