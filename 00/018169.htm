    <title>InPrivate Browsing is not disabling flash player. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            InPrivate Browsing is not disabling flash player.</h2>
                    Internet Explorer 8 in internet options&gt;privacy tab under InPrivate "Disable toolbars and extensions when InPrivate Browsing starts" is checkmarked but today when&nbsp;I went to Pogo.com to make a purchase their flash advertisement still loaded up I checked
 by right clicking it and was able to get to adobe's settings and even open a new tab at adobe by clicking about adobe flash player. I thought it would be safer not to have any addons storing information when I try to make a purchase but apparently IE8 isnt
 working as it should or either InPrivate isn't meant to disable flash. Thanks.

    <title>Uploading ALL Folders and Files from My Documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eddygilley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uploading ALL Folders and Files from My Documents</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling for over a week to resolve this. For over 3 years I have used OneDrive for all newly created documents. I now want to upload all the
<strong>Folders </strong>and <em>Files </em>in My Documents to OneDrive. My first attempt, I selected
<strong>Folders </strong>and then highlighted all the <strong>Folders </strong>and
<em>Files </em>in My Documents. An hour later, it was complete. However, all that was uploaded were the
<strong>Folders</strong>. This included all nested <strong>Folders</strong>. However, there were no
<em>Files</em>. I waited for nearly 30 hours hoping they would eventually appear. No Joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then deleted the uploaded <strong>Folders </strong>and chose <em>Files </em>
to upload. At this point, it only uploaded the 70 or so <em>Files </em>that were in the base folder of My Documents. None of the
<strong>Folders</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to upload all <strong>Folders </strong>and <em>FIles </em>including nested
<strong>Folders </strong>with all the <em>Files</em> in them without uploading each
<strong>Folder's </strong>contents individually? This process was quite easy for Google Drive. Highlight all the contents in My Documents and 12 hours later, all was on Drive. Basically One Click uploads. What am I missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For clarification.</p>
<p><strong>My Documents Folder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em> File 1</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>File 2</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Word Folder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>File 1</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>File 2</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Excel Folder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Work Folder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>File 1</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>File 2</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Personal Folder</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>File 1</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>File 2</em></p>

<p>That is disheartening. If that article is correct, I will not be using OneDrive. I am not going to upload the individual contents (more than 14,000 files) to more than 300 folders. I will stick with Google Drive.</p>

    <title>Temporarily disable animations for a specific object only&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Temporarily disable animations for a specific object only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a complex animation of various element on the page, it would be really useful to temporarily hide or block animations for one or several specific objects while letting others run. This would allow me to zero in on some of the problems.. I know I can hide
 objects so I can observe the animation of only the visible objects, but that is not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More generally, am I missing any tools for organising things in the animation pane? I don't seem to be able to group animations arbitrarily, or by object. Is that also not possible? And finally, still on the subject of organisation, I notice that some placeholders
 I animate which are named in the master slide view appear as generic (placeholder 1, placeholder 2 etc) in normal view. Is this a bug? Do I have to rename manually also in the normal view?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>Aside from hiding objects, you can't hide animations. As a workaround, create a duplicate of the slide and remove the animations you don't want to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can group objects, but not animations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Placeholders are inherited from the slide layout, but their names are not. Effectively PowerPoint makes a copy and renames all objects to fit its internal defaults. You should do all your renaming on the final presentation, there isn't any advantage to naming
 the master or layout objects.</p>

<h2>            Switching HUP license from Mac to PC</h2>
                    <p>In short I purchased Office 2016 for my Mac via the Hup program in October 2015. &nbsp;I've switched to a Windows PC and would like this to carry over to my Windows PC. &nbsp;I went into my order history for the Mac purchase, it took me to the Hup site but the link
 to re-download the Windows version was not active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reaching out to Microsoft via the web chat feature but they then asked me to call into the Hup department, then the lady there said she could not help and forwarded me to their sales department (which I believe is outsourced to India), and then the
 line was cut off and no help was provided.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open any office 13 apps &#40;windows 8&#41;</h2>
                    I downloaded office professional pro 13 using to Microsoft home use program a while ago and up until now has been working fine. Today I have tried to open up word and word documents and it won't let me open it at all, just goes to the desktop screen and
 does nothing! I've tried opening in safe mode, updating the computer and removing recent updates. Any ideas?

            I am sorry to seem so dense, but I looked at your sample db and didn't see a button function that would convert the current record to a pdf and email it to the person on that form.

            My demo file does not include any means to send the PDF file as an attachment to an email, but the syntax, while the invoice form is open at the relevant invoice would be like this:<br />
<br />
DoCmd.SendObject acSendReport, "rptInvoice", acformatPDF, "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", , , "Invoice","Invoice attached.",True<br />
<br />
In reality you'd obviously build this from a set of variables for the To, Subject and MessageText arguments rather than using literal strings.&nbsp; If you don't want to see the message for confirmation and editing before it's sent set the final EditMessage argument
 to False.&nbsp; Remember to save the current record with Me.Dirty = False before sending the report to ensure any current edits are reflected in it.<br />

            <p>Thank you very much Ken. I would rather not send a report though, because I don't think I can get all of the information from the main form and 3 sub forms to relect in the report in the same way they do on the form for each unique record.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to be able to open the form, and click on a command button and have it send the selected record on that form in pdf format to the person whose email is listed in a field on that form.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hurting my tiny brain trying to figure this one out.</p>

            <p>Ken, thank you. I have been working on multiple projects at the same time. Forgive me for not getting back to you sooner. It is hard to explain exactly what I am trying to do here. I have uploaded a beta testing version of the database I am working on. Would
 you be able to look at it and give me some advice?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the dispatch workorder form I am working with. I want to put a button on it that will select the current record, convert to pdf format, and then email the form to the&nbsp;email address listed on the form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beta version is stored at: <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?nr=0&amp;ppud=4#cid=FF4F985F98A36B1A&amp;id=FF4F985F98A36B1A%21103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            The basic code would be along these lines, but you'd really need to add some code to first grab the current record's ticket number to a variable, and then at the end navigate back to the record by synchronizing bookmarks after the filter is turned off:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Filter = "[Ticket No] = " &amp; Me.[Ticket No]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />

    <title>Movies in Itunes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Movies in Itunes</h2>
                    I am posting this because I can't seem to find a right answer for my current problem. I was recently trying to add movies I had bought through the Microsoft store to my iTunes and I figured I would be able to just drag and drop or just add to library like
 with any other file. The problem is I never got an error message of any kind, but the movies never appeared in my ITunes. So is there a reason for this or is it just not possible to watch movies bought from Microsoft on ITunes?

            <p>No, it's not possible to view the movies you purchased from Microsoft with iTunes.&nbsp; This opposite is also true.</p>
<p>You need to use the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app, website,&nbsp;Xbox consoles, or&nbsp;Windows Phone to watch the movies.</p>

<h3> ecstasyrealty  say:</h3>
<h2>            A company just told me, flat out, they will not update or even support their Windows phone app any more....</h2>
                    <p>Before I go any further, I want to minimize flame attacks by noting that I've been a Windows Insider for a while now, and have been using Microsoft products for 23 years. I'm running Windows 10 x64 Build 14251 and I submit feedback and suggestions when warranted.
 I bought a Blu Win HD LTE phone just so I would have a Windows phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to publicly disclose which company told me this, but it did shock me. They told me the market share did not justify any further work on the Windows phone app. Yes, I know, I can leave this company and take my business elsewhere. I won't do
 that. I've been with them for 11 years and they've always treated me well and given me a decent deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm probably wasting my time typing all this, but Microsoft, you need to do something fairly drastic to get your market share up. The last rumor I read was that Windows 10 Mobile would be ready next month. That's a good first step. Drastic steps Microsoft,
 or your phones will become museum pieces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm not going to reveal the name of the company because it will come off as bashing, and I have NO reason to bash this company. They have an app for Android and one for iOs too. It's not like they aren't giving me choices, but yea, this kinda sucks.</p>

<h2>            Automatic Scrolling</h2>
                    When I receive an incoming skype, my chat window doesn't scroll down, so at a glance, it doesn't look like I've received a message. I realize there are other notification methods, but this has become a very inconvenient problem. Is there a simple setting
 I need to change, or is this possibly a Windows 10/Skype compatibility thing, or what?

<p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This can be an issue with the application or if there's any add-ins installed on your Outlook. Just to confirm, does the "not responding" error and crashing issue only happens when editing bullet points? Does it work without issues on other function? For
 us to identify what is causing this issue, we suggest that you perform the troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Outlook in Safe mode. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click
<strong>Run.</strong> In the Run box, type <strong>outlook /safe</strong>, and click
<strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Check if there's any available update for your Outlook. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Open any Office 2016 app, such as Word, and create a new document.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Go to<strong> File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> (or Office Account if you opened Outlook 2016).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Under <strong>Product Information,</strong> choose <strong>Update Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Now.</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Close the <strong>You're up to date! </strong>window after Office is done checking for and installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Repair your Office application. Check this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a> for detailed steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if you will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Add individual font to the ribbon in Microsoft Word 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, All!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to place individual fonts on the ribbon for easy access. Is this possible? I know how to add the font drop-down menu that lets me select from all my fonts but there a few fonts that I want faster access to by placing them directly on the ribbon.
 Possible? Alternatively, if it's possible to create a keyboard shortcut for an individual font, I could use that as well. Thanks!</p>

</p><p>Figured out how to add a font as a keyboard shortcut. I went to customize the ribbon, clicked on "Keyboard shortcuts: Customize," scrolled to the bottom of the list on the left, selected fonts, selected the font I wanted on the right, and entered the keyboard
 shortcut that I wanted. Pretty easy! Still interested in adding them to the ribbon though.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. I can synchronise my data from Onedrive, I can also synchronise folders shared with me but if I wanted to synchronise data from SharePoint I couldn't, after the pop-out window - asking me to agree with synchronisation so I click

<p>Hi Marek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your description, you can sync files from your consumer OneDrive without problems. Now, you want to sync SharePoint Online team site libraries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I'd like to explain that there are OneDrive for business library and SharePoint Online library in Office 365 for Business. For OneDrive for Business library, you may get more info from<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-on-Mac-OS-X-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 this article</a>. You just need to add your work/school account for syncing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For SharePoint Online team site library, you may need to firstly check <strong>
Test the feature before you enable it for your organization</strong> (Test SharePoint Online sync for Mac) section in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. After running those steps, check if you can sync that library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know some updates when you have time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
        </p>

<h2>            How to add people to my favorites list which I can&#39;t seem to do now</h2>
                    Before getting switched over to PEOPLE I was able to go to my contact list and was able to add certain people to my favorite list simply by clicking on them and adding them to the favorite list indicated by a star. Now I can't see any way of doing this
 now. It just made it easier sending emails to certain people instead of going through all list.

            <p>Sorry, but this did not work for me.&nbsp; Following your procedure, after clicking on "Groups," then only the groups that I had personally created myself were displayed.&nbsp; The Favorites that were set (under the old system by clicking the gold star) WERE NOT DISPLAYED
 UNDER THE "GROUPS."</p>

<p>Do I have to set up a new group myself and entitle it "Favorites" and then <u>
