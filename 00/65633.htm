<h2>            Cursor and Lock screen problem</h2>
                    <p>hey there,</p>
<p>I've recently updated my windows10 (Annual update) since then am having a issue with the cursor. Every time I open a large file with 2 or more pages or when am online, my page is automatically scrolling to the top and my cursor starts jumping to the start
 while typing something. Even the lock screen starts jumping up and down. And I've tried every possible thing to stop the cursor from doing that it by updating the drivers, uninstalling the touch pad and using usb mouse and is still futile. Can someone help
 me in fixing this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Yogesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that you said you've tried uninstalling the drivers, but they will automatically re-install when devices are refreshed if local driver files aren't deleted from the system.</p>
<p>This sounds like it could be either a keyboard or a mouse issue; what I would suggest to you is to try
<em>disabling </em>the touch pad and keyboard one at a time within device manager to see if you can identify if either are the actual cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Right click on your Start button and choose <strong>Device Manager</strong> from there locate your touchpad in the list of devices, right click it and select
<strong>Disable</strong> and try to test the issue again.</p>
<p>If the issue still occurs re-enable your mouse by right clicking the device and selecting
<strong>Enable</strong> and then locate your keyboard in the list of device and select
<strong>Disable</strong> </p>
<p>Please let us know your findings.</p>

<h2>            Cortana&#47;Search and most Windows 10 apps not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a Windows 10 version 1607 build 14393.447 with an AMD A8-7410 CPU. I don't know how this happened, but suddenly all the Windows 10 apps along with Cortana and search have stopped working. They're all greyed out as shown in the below image. As you
 can see, Cortana is also gone.</li><li><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42e2f96f-dc04-40b5-81eb-21ba66004aa5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42e2f96f-dc04-40b5-81eb-21ba66004aa5" /></a></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I have tried a few methods, but to no avail. I tried wsreset.exe and restarted, but nothing happened. I tried making a new administrator account and then opened the apps from that account, but still nothing happened.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I downloaded the Microsoft Windows store apps troubleshooter and it has been going on for ages without any progress. Also, it says that "Windows store cache and licenses may be corrupt. Resetting Windows Store will resolve cache and license issues and restart
 windows store"</li></ul>

<h2>            BSOD Bug Check Code 0x00000109 Issue</h2>
                    I recently bought a completely new PC which I put together myself. &nbsp;This BSOD issue has been happening since I put this build together, at intervals of about 3-4 hours.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My hardware components are:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i5 2500k 3.3ghz</div>
<div>8gb Corsair DDR3 1333mhz</div>
<div>Nvidia GTX460</div>
<div>Gigabyte GA-Z68A-D3-B3</div>
<div>2 x 1tb Samsung Spinpoint F3s (not in RAID)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've exhausted all the usual steps I find myself taking in these situations. &nbsp;So far i've run memtest to 800% on all my memory (no errors), re-downloaded and re-installed all my drivers, completely dis-assembled my build and methodically checked connections
 for dust / anything else. &nbsp;When this final step didn't solve it, I re-installed windows on my second hard-drive and the issue occurred again just a few minutes ago after restarting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tested my hardware in my mates PC and it all works fine. &nbsp;Each time we left his machine running for 12 hours (most of my BSODs occurred whilst idling) and nothing happened. &nbsp;Also after reading a few of the other posts on here related to a Daemon Tools
 issue being the (possible) cause of these BSODs i've not installed that or any similar program onto the new windows install. &nbsp;It was installed on my previous windows but that drive has been formatted (this is also why I won't be able to provide a log of bluescreens
 that long).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's a screenshot of the bugcheck report:</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you re-installed Windows and still are getting BlueScreens the odds are it is hardware<br />
or something that loads at a low level such as BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and some<br />
other drivers (video is one).<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check were 1E, 0A, and 3B.<br />
<br />
1E CAUSE hardware. Also implicated was Rt64win7.sys Realtek 8136/8168/8169 NDIS<br />
6.20 64-bit Driver which is the RealTek Network driver. This driver may or may not be<br />
related to the hardware cause.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 1E, {0, 0, 0, 0} &lt;-- note all the parameters are " 0&nbsp;" which makes it difficult<br />
to gather a real definitive cause.<br />
Probably caused by : hardware ( nt!KiKernelCalloutExceptionHandler+e )<br />

<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Retest the memory thoroughly if you think there is any need.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Use the methods in the troubleshooters&nbsp;previously posted and those below.<br />
<br />
========================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>The general BSOD troubleshooting methods have been previously posted above.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when<br />
possible)</strong> - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Those are for a PC and about all<br />
that can be done for a laptop is reseat the memory and clear the vents. Make sure the BIOS,<br />
low level chipset drivers, and major device drivers are all up to date by check manually at the<br />
makers' sites.</p>
<p>Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers<br />
which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually for updates<br />
using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above and/or the methods<br />
below (which are the same).<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><br />
<strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>ntstatus.h </em>file located in the<em>inc</em> directory of the Windows Driver Kit.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><em>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</em>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.
 Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger
 is connected and the system is started with the<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p>If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><em>Hardware incompatibility. </em>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p><em>Faulty device driver or system service. </em>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending
 system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware
 diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.</p>

<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites.<br />
<br />
Below&nbsp;I will post a generic bluescreen troubleshooter and in the next message how to update<br />
drivers and BIOS as well as do memory checks.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.
</li><li>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. </li><li>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</li><li>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed. </li><li>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination. </li><li>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Before upgrading to a new version of Windows, remove all third-party device drivers and system services, and disable any virus scanners. Contact the software manufacturers to obtain updates of these third-party tools.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x3B: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION<br />
<br />
</strong>Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and&nbsp;vents. On<br />
a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the vents. (Of course remove<br />
ALL power prior to opening the case.)<br />
<br />
<strong>3b is usually a graphic's driver (display adapter/video driver), other possibilities include<br />
but are not limited to antivirus/antispyware/security programs and even memory (mapping).<br />
<br />
BCCode: 3b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000003b<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.<br />

<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

                    <p>Every time I download a file (no matter what kind), when it's in the downloads folder it's fine, I have full control. Properties&gt;security tells me that the system, my user, and administrators have full permissions for the file.</p>

<p>When I go to the file's properties&gt;security it tells me: "No groups or users have permission to access this object. However, the owner of this object can assign permissions."</p>

<h2>            &#39;Multimedia Settings&#39; in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having this problem that while playing music in my laptop, it goes to sleep and the music stops, I made some research and I found this post:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/how-to-prevent-sound-driver-from-sleeping-while/1e192275-8b6a-4315-b679-71f418936313">How
 to prevent sound driver from sleeping while music is playing</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That says that I have to go to Multimedia Settings (in advance power options) and select:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multimedia settings<br />
&nbsp; When sharing media<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plugged in: Prevent idling to sleep</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that I can't find this 'Multimedia Settings' options, any ideas???</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I found this thread: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-10-how-to-not-go-into-sleep-mode-also/af9171c5-acec-4b15-a63f-48ae9132657a">
Windows 10: how to not go into sleep mode also while watching movie and full screen web video</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That explains how to boot in Safe Mode and edit the Power Options, where you can set up the Multimedia Settings. I've donde that, and in the 'Balanced' Power Plan selected under Multimedia Settings to do not allow the computer to go to sleep while sharing
 media (I think that is the option), but it is not working, after a few minutes the screen goes off and the music stops. I touch the pad or press a key and the screen goes ON and the music continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Nathaniel,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already donde that. First of all I don't see the 'Multimedia Settings' in any Power options, I have to boot in Safe Mode to actually see that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the same steps and select the exact same options, restarted the laptop, but anything changes, I leave the computer with music playing from Google play music and after some minutes the screen goes off and the music also goes off, any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<h3> aaa-p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Apps Keep Moving Between Dual Monitor Set-up</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I use a dual monitor set-up while my laptop is in a docking station.&nbsp; Ever since upgrading, applications I'm working with on one monitor move to the other from time to time.&nbsp; I can't think of anything
 I'm doing to activate this.&nbsp; While typing this message in my browser, the app has moved between my two monitors 3 times.&nbsp; This occurs with other apps as well (e.g. MS XLS, Word, etc.). Does anyone know of a setting that is causing this to occur?&nbsp; I don't know
 why someone would want this to happen. The whole reason for the two is for you to use apps where you want on a given monitor.&nbsp; Very frustrating.

            Hi Jaren.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  If it's stable in Safe Mode it points to driver.
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I had already tried to do everything you have told me to do and I am still am experiencing issues. I don't think it would be anything with a visual driver since I am getting audio issues as well.

            If you're not absolutely sure you have the very latest driver for every single one of your devices in Device Manager  - from the manufacturer and not Windows Update which does't even have half of them - then you haven't done everything.  
<br />
<br />What is the installed Sound Device make/model and it's present installed driver date and version number?  
<br />
<br />What is the PC make and full model number?  
<br />
<br />Lags and stutters are hard to troubleshoot, requiring utmost attention to detail and not missing one step I gave.  We often find out later that the fix was the skipped step, so please do not skip any. If you need help performing any step I will help.

<p>if the OP does not say they have already done that step.</p>

            No it just randomly started happening to my knowledge. And it doesn't crash into a black screen it just doesn't let me do anything moment before and then the screen goes black and the audio either cuts out or buzzes for the duration of the black screen
 (which is about 5 - 15 seconds) ive only been having fps issues with Fortnite, Just Cause 3, And Rainbow Six Siege. My cpu is a Ryzen 5 1600 my gpu is a gtx 1060 and I belive my power supply is a 600 watt bronze certified from EVGA. With out gaming my cpu
 is at around 35 degrease and my gpu is around 45 degrease (Celsius) My graphics and audio drivers are both up to date.<br />

<br />
I am trying to install a Wasp WWS500 Freedom barcode scanner and the bluetooth add a device wizard does not allow me to select add without using a passkey which the instructions for the wasp tells me to do. Windows will find the device but won't allow me to
 install without a passkey as the directions call for. How can I get around this? Please visit this link to see a screen shot of what I'm talking about. No one seems to understand me.

            I will try this. I did install this device yesterday on Windows XP with no problem. The add a device wizard allowed me to choose "install without using a passkey". Now if I could just get windows 7 pro to allow it.

I'm also having this same issue and that fixit did nothing to help. Any other thoughts? The problem as stated before is that we need to be able to set this scanner up WITHOUT a passkey but for some reason Windows 7 see's this scanner as a keyboard and assumes
 that a passkey can be created and&nbsp;grays&nbsp;out the option to install without a passkey.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to connect to internet,getting Error 651 on Win 7 PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I'm looking for some help as I can't get my new PC to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently bought&nbsp;a new PC and have just&nbsp;installed Windows 7 on it tonight.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it completed the installation, I noticed that the option to connect to my home network didn't appear automatically like it has done whenever I've clean installed my PC in the past&nbsp;and the Network Connection icon in the task bar keeps saying there's
 no connection. When I've tried to go into the Network Sharing Centre from the Control Panel, connecting to a network just brings me error 651 constantly. I've ran Windows diagnostic and it said something about a driver missing. I've re-installed Windows a
 second time and I'm still getting the same messages. I have however,&nbsp;hooked my old PC up (the one I'm using to write this now) and everything on it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting very frustrated and I don't know what to do or why this is happening.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have broadband with&nbsp;Virgin (in the UK), my PC is connected to my hub via Ethernet cable and I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not very tech savvy either and have limited PC knowledge. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are unable to connect to internet on your
</span><span>Win 7</span><span>. I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue, I will surely help you on this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 7 contains several troubleshooting programs that can automatically fix some common problems with your computer. One among them is Internet Connection troubleshooter. If you’ve a problem establishing
 Internet connection or if you’re not able to connect to the Internet using the existing connection, then the troubleshooter will diagnose and repair the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Use the Internet Connection troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open the Internet Connections troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Internet Connection troubleshooter.</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check the status of the network adapter driver in device manager if it is enabled or disabled and also check whether there is any exclamation mark.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>Please refer to the following Microsoft article on how to check the status of your network adapter on your Windows 7</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">NOTE: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 4: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reset the TCP/IP</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Is it my router, wireless adapter, or is Live just messing with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brutishtea31214  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it my router, wireless adapter, or is Live just messing with me&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I live in Iowa, USA and use a Linksys E2100L for my router. I have 2 xbox 360's that I uses, rarely together, and have had no issues with dual boxing games over live using a wireless connection. I have an older white xbox 360 that was a newer released model
 with a wireless external adapter and a Gear of War 3 edition xbox360 slim with a built in wireless adapter. Both are set with Static IP's and are reserved in my routers DHCP reservation table along with their corresponding MAC addresses. I use single port
 forwarding if only using the one xbox with Upnp turned off. If I use both xboxes then Upnp gets turned on and I also switch to port triggering. Before you say test your network connection, I have had this setup for years and no problems until now and the connection
 is always OPEN.</p>
<p>So the issue I am having is that for the past week, I keep getting errors (8007274c &amp; 80151904)&nbsp;when trying to access live functions from only the GOW xbox; such as the apps, games with gold, marketplace, and online game servers (like dark souls 2). When
 the xbox starts up I am logged in automatically and signed into live, I also have my profile on a USB drive for portability and have had it for several years without issues. When I try to start a game, like Dark Souls 2, I get disconnected from live. If I
 try to log out and sign in at the games main menu, I get the error message saying the console cannot connect to live (80151904). When I leave the game to test the network, it is either a DNS error or live is fully functional, it is inconsistent. In the case
 of an error, I can disconnect from the network and re-sign into it and test without a failure (without powering off the console or router). But the issue still persists when trying to access a game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marketplace is another problematic area. Trying to access things like Games with Gold or any other live service will either time out, freeze the console, or provide an error message saying that this feature is temporarily unavailable. Please try again
 later. STATUS CODE: 8007274c-00000000-00000000</p>
<p>I have tried the following to troubleshoot the problems.</p>
<p>Remove/re-download profile, clear system cache, cleared latest live update, removed the hard drive, reset wireless to factory settings, try new wireless settings, power cycled the router, and finally - attempted 3 different times to use the support chat
 feature to communicate directly to Microsoft support. All of their tips were simply repeating steps of things I already tried, while expecting different outcomes. The final suggestion they had before ignoring me was to send it in for maintenance and pay them
 even more money... If I need to open this console with a hammer to fix something inside, I will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here is what I know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. ITS NOT A NETWORK ISSUE! So please do not refer me to the generic troubleshooting steps that say, clear system cache, power cycle the router, test xbox live connection... I HAVE!</p>
<p>2. It is isolated to only one of my Xboxes (the newer one at that). Profile, games, and marketplace works fine on the second xbox.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></p>
<p>So I am left with thinking it is a malfunction with the built in wireless adapter, so I have ordered a replacement for 5$ and see if that works. Otherwise please let me know if there are any other suggestions that may help besides the standard troubleshooting
 procedure. Thanks in advance. Also, I have included the Network Statistics review of my router connection after getting kicked from live while starting a game and subsequently testing the connection without resetting or restarting anything.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 update crashes with BSOD IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.</h2>
                    <p>Original title :Windows 8.1 update crashes with BSOD, cannot boot up any more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've just tried to update to Windows 8.1 Pro (French) from Windows 8 Pro (French) today and I'm having some problems:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before updating I had checked that all the drivers were up-to-date and updated the BIOS for my motherboard (asus &nbsp;P8Z77-V);</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Downloaded the update ok from the Windows Store;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I customised the configuration for the update - I didn't like the default setting for Skydrive - shouldn't have really affected things..?;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The screen displayed that the system was being configured for the update;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BSOD of the type IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer rebooted and I get a blank screen and no HD activity after the blue 4 panel windows logo. Upon rebooting I get the same thing. A few reboots,later I get through to the "preparing to repair automatically" screen: the rebooting option doesn't
 work (I've already tried it); so I try the advanced options:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Quit and continue to windows 8.1 doesn't lead anywhere (same problem as already mentioned);</div>
<div>The other options, well, I haven't really tried them yet - I want to try and recover everything in the best possible way and am not sure what the best course of action might be. So, does anyone have a good idea of how to attack and resolve my problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Duncan</div>

            Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7cf0967c-b6b8-4c2c-9b46-186f0f236271">Viji</a>n,
<div><br />
<div>Ok, I've read carefully what you've suggested.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had thought myself of using a system restore, which normally I had configured, however windows cannot locate any restore points!!?!?! So, that's a no-go!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The system recovery USB disk that I had created (and tested to check that it worked) under windows 8 is no longer recognised under windows 8.1 (under startup recovery it mentions windows 8.1 at least).</div>
<div>I cannot refresh the computer either - neither my recovery disk, nor my windows 8 installation dvd are recognised.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried the automatic repair from the advanced boot options - it fails :(&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can boot into windows using Safe Mode (with/without networking). There windows is windows 8.1. Startup recovery doesn't manage to repair the computer, and normal (re)booting fails.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the devices list there is nothing that looks like its causing a problem (I mean nothing gives a warning about a driver problem explicitly).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess that the update was partially successful, but to what degree I don't know.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've had a private message from one of the forum moderators asking me to supply logs so that he can have a look at what happened. I reply with any further news when I have some...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in any case,</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi Yasar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good to hear from you. So the Xbox Chat headset seems to be recognized by the console but can you not hear people when you are in a party chat or in a game chat? I believe the chat headset has a wired headset adapter that plugs into the USB looking port
 at the bottom of your controller. Usually the audio jacks in the controllers can start deteriorating and be the source of the issue but the adapter will work best most of the time. Based on the indicator you mentioned, the chat headset should at least be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried a complete <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> yet?</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button&nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait&nbsp;5 minutes.</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a try and let us know if it helped!</p>

            Hello Jim, <br />
<br />
I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.<br />
<br />
Any changes made to the system that might have caused the issue? <br />
<br />
And do confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation.
<em>(Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)
</em><br />
<br />
Had this been the case ever since or was this just recently after a certain configuration in your system?<br />
<br />
If you're getting any error messages, please <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027213/windows-open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
attach a snip of the complete error message</a>. <br />
<br />
We will keep an eye out for your response.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hi, I didn't make any changes that I'm aware of to the system, and no this has never been the case. It happened when I accidentally removed my music library, but when I tried to add it again it wouldn't let me.&nbsp; This is the error that I have been getting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the sonos help desk, it recommended changing my network to home in my mcafee, which I did but then I got a different message, that I can't replicate. But, when I try to add my music folder, there is an icon that looks like the windows defender
 icon shield in blue and yellow. I tried to follow sonos' instruction for the firewall in windows defender, but once I get to a certain step, I cannot go any further because my defender does not have the option to do what sonos recommends.&nbsp;</p>
