That's a feature that is provider dependent, some providers in other countries are offering it for business men for personal number &amp; business number it comes with the sim card. To my knowledge any modern GSM phones can use that particular service specially
 your N95, no need for activation. Inquire about it to your provider if they are offering that service.<br />

            This is a network service, assuming that your operator and your SIM card support it. The operator would have to tell you how to activate it on your account. You may have a separate SIM-services menu in your phone with certain operators.

Not known anything like that on a Nokia handset mate as far as i know.<br />

Maybe a dual sim card holder could be of some use to you.

            Yes, I have this feature. It worked on my last mobile (Nokia N80) without any problems. When I put the same SIM card in the N95 it doesn't work.

    <title>Outlook 2013 slow to start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anabas910  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 slow to start</h2>
                    I installed Office 2013 on my Windows 7 where I had Office 2010. So, it did the silent upgrade and this was uneventful.<br />
<br />
Word, Excel and PowerPoint works well but Outlook has been a trouble.<br />
<br />
It did not start and I let it run and after 45 minutes, it showed the Outlook Client. I though that this was the first time so it might be doing some upgrade to mail file. Going to any folder was extremely slow.<br />
<br />
Stopped and started again and it takes 45 minutes. Searched community site but no solution after doing the suggestions.<br />
<br />
A. Start outlook /safe - It starts immediately<br />
B. Disable Add-ins.<br />
C. Outlook start is still slow and it takes 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
So, I called support and someone logged on to my machine using their www.support.me site they took remote control of my desktop and everything worked fine. So, I thought that it was the magic of the support person that outlook started to work again as if it
 was afraid to see the Microsoft Support. No problem and the ticket was closed and I felt embarrassed.<br />
<br />
But, after the remote connection to my desktop ended and I tried to start the outlook, it is back to again 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
So, I started scratching my head as what made it to work and I realized that when the remote desktop connection was used by the support person, it changed my windows to basic color and outlook worked fine.<br />
<br />
I do not know how to make it working again given the facts given above. I replied to support to not to close the ticket but I did not hear anything from them.<br />
<br />
Have any of you seen this and how to fix it?<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Ok.<br />
<br />
The problem is finally solved with the help from Microsoft Support. They were really very good to see an end to this annoying problem.<br />
<br />
It was fixed by going to Outlook &gt; Options &gt; Advanced and in the Display section, put a check mark against "Disable hardware graphics acceleration".<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>Dependent drop down list in Word 365 form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucyschagen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dependent drop down list in Word 365 form</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a form using Word 365 on Windows 10 and I need to do the following. I have found some tutorials online, but none seem to work with this version of Word as I keep running into problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to ask for certain information where the reader can only choose from certain options, so I'm using drop down lists. After the item in the first drowp down list is chosen, I need the next drop down list to only show the specific choices that are relevant
 to the first answer. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Country: [drop down list with countries]</p>
<p>State/Province: [drop down list showing only the states/provinces that are in the country that was selected in the previous question]</p>
<p>City: [drop down list showing only cities that are in the selected state/province]</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a work related form I cannot give the exact questions people need to answer, but it is the same principle as the above example and we absolutely cannot allow people to fill out their own answer, as this leads to a lot of problems later on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how I can do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Lucy</p>
<p>

<p>I can give you an overview of what's necessary, but to be specific I'll need answers to a number of questions about the form and how it will be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overview: This task requires macro programming to fill the second and third dropdowns as the user makes selections in the first and second ones. The macro(s) must be made to run automatically as the user moves the cursor from one dropdown to the next. The
<p>
</p><p>The questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If users are expected to complete the form on their own computer, what version(s) of Word do you expect them to use?</li><li>Do the dropdowns have to be in the form document itself, or can they be in a userform (a custom dialog box) that lets the user make choices and then click an OK button to transfer the results to the form document?</li><li>If the dropdowns are in the form document, which kind of dropdowns are they?</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Are there other form fields elsewhere in the form? If so, what kind are they?</li><li>Where is the data for the dropdowns stored?</li><li>What is the maximum number of entries you expect to put in any of the dropdowns?</li></ul>

<p>To add to what Jay posted:</p>
<p>• ActiveX controls are not supported on Macs;</p>
<p>• Content Controls on PCs are supported from Word 2007 onwards and on Macs from 2013 onwards;</p>
<p>• Formfields <span>are supported on all Word versions on PCs and Macs, but formfield dropdowns are limited to a maximum of 25 entries.</span></p>
<p><span>Your other option, since any solution will require VBA programming, would be to employ a userform. Do note that VBA is not supported on Word for Mac 2008.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also important to know whether, if you were to use a custom template for your document creation, your users will have access to that template:&nbsp;</span><span>if so, all the code, etc. can reside in the template;</span><span> if not, all the code,
 etc. will have to reside in the document itself.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello, I am just trying to understand when is the push line up/push line down feature supposed to work. Please see screen shot below. If I have a full page of text and then right-click the first paragraph on that page and select push line down, all paragraphs
 will incrementally move down the page as I keep doing it. However, if I go to the last paragraph on that same page and do that same thing, the paragraphs neither move down or up. Is this how its supposed to work?</p>

            I don't have these options in Word 2013. I'm wondering if they're something that is added when you enable Asian Typography. In that case, they would not be intended for use with Latin text.

    <title>Word for Office 365 Templates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pa311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Office 365 Templates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just started working on updating a 312 page training guide that is now 5 years old.&nbsp; The new application will be rolled out immediately after Labor Day, so time is limited.&nbsp; &nbsp;Rather than rewriting it completely,&nbsp; I can update descriptive sections, Find
 and Replace will take care of much of that,&nbsp; and then rewrite the training exercises to conform to the desktop commands and controls.</p>
<p>My question relates to the training guide template. The template in the existing document is no longer used.&nbsp; I recall in a previous version of Word, one could convert the template that a document was created in to another template, updating all the styles
 and other built-in features.&nbsp; </p>
<p>How can I do that in Word 365?</p>
<p>Thank you in advanced for any help.</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Attach the document to the new template and check the box to update styles from the template. I recommend doing this after saving a backup.
<br />
<br />Developer Tab &gt; Document Template &gt; Attached Template
<br />Developer Tab: <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/developertab.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://addbalance.com/word/developertab.htm</a>
<br />After you have done this, go back to the dialog and uncheck that box to update styles!

This could be due to a busted battery.<br />
The power of busted battery depletes fast.<br />
Try a new battery and see whether your battery is<br />
busted.<br />

            I would suggest it may be a software fault.<br />
<br />
You could try a software update as these can often cure powering off problems.<br />
<br />
Go to <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4579163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4579163</a> to download the Nokia Software Updater.<br />
<br />
Remember to back up your information as this can be lost during the upgrade process.

<strong>Outlook Web App</strong> (OWA)? <br />
3. Do you send a lot of e-mails? <br />
4. How long has this been an issue? <br />
5. Do you recall taking any recent action that could possibly result in this? <br />
6. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
<em><strong>If you are using Outlook.com (personal user),</strong></em> please be informed there is a limit of 300 e-mails a day.
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>If you are a non-personal Microsoft user,</strong></em> please reach out with your IT Administrator about this. He can check your account for details of what happened and he will resolve it for you.
<br />

            Hi lostkauaiboy, 
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below:&nbsp;
<br />The first step to troubleshooting is to clear the browser cache/cookies and restart your computer. 
<br />
<br />If using Internet Explorer -  Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press  Delete&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Google Chrome -  Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press Clear Browsing Data&nbsp;
<br />
<br />For Firefox- Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press Clear Now&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Now restart your computer. Click Start Power and restart. 
<br />Once computer has restarted log back into OWA and try to send. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work open outlook in a private browser and try to Send.
<br />Private Browsing
<br />Chrome Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys and press N
<br />Firefox and IE Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys and press P 
<br />In the address bar put in <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a> and log in. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask questions and let us know how it goes.&nbsp;
<br />Regards,&nbsp;

<h2>            Why does my last endnote attach itself to the Works Cited that follow&#63;</h2>
                    I've written an essay for publication.&nbsp; The endnotes come directly after the main body of the essay, and for some reason the last endnote has gathered to itself the Works Cited that follow.&nbsp; A section break might be the answer, but I don't know how to
 make one, and the Help column is unedifying.&nbsp; The Mac is a 10.6.2 model, and I'm using Word 12.3.6.

            Your tons behind on the System Version. You should be up to X.6.8 at least if they haven't updated in the last update cycle which was one day last week. I haven't used Office2008 in a while so I don't know what the current Level is 12.3.6 sounds about
 right.<br />
<br />
The direction for inserting a section Break are the same whether using 2008 or 2011.
<br />
<br />
From Main menu (shows the apple symbol) click on <b>insert</b> then choose insert section break.
<br />
In 2011 there are two type Insert Section break Continuous and Section Break Next Page. Choose appropriate one. See if your endnote items works as you need<br />

I tried what you suggest, and got a dialogue box reading, 'You cannot put section breaks into a header, footer, footnote, endnote, comment, text box, callout, or macro.'<br />

Is there any way around this?<br />

            <div>Under certain circumstances, the section break, or actually the&nbsp;blank paragraph containing the section break,&nbsp;may cause an extra page (this might happen below a table, for example). Formatting it as 1 pt font size, exact line spacing 1 pt, zero&nbsp;spacing
 before/after should fix it. You may also want to format it as hidden text. In fact, you can create a paragraph style with those characteristics and apply it to the empty paragraph in question.</div>

<h3> rod at work  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I determine what version of OneDrive for Business we&#39;re using&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got a problem saving any Office files. My problem also is I've no idea where the problem lies. Briefly, here's what happened yesterday. I had to change my Windows password and Exchange/Outlook password. I did so. After changing it I discovered I could
 no longer edit/save any Word or Excel document. Especially (I think) if I saved them on OneDrive for Business. I tried multiple restarts and turning my PC off entirely, leaving it off for 5 minutes. Nothing helped. Now, here, 24 hours later, I still have the
 problem. Every time I tried to edit a Word or Excel document I'm presented with a command to enter my corporate email account/password. But it never lets me actually do that. Instead, once I've entered my username (work email account), it immediately presents
 me with this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0a0eb64-26ad-4b08-8944-240a99bda453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0a0eb64-26ad-4b08-8944-240a99bda453" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This has become a show stopper. So, I'm wondering, could our version of OneDrive for Business be so out of date that a mere changing of one's password is all it takes to hose things up?</p>

<p>Hi Rod,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your OneDrive for Business version, regarding there is no<strong> Settings
</strong>option when you right-click on OneDrive for Business icon, you should use the legacy version of OneDrive for Business sync client.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To obtain the best user experience, we'd suggest you right-click on OneDrive for Business icon and select
<strong>Stop syncing a folder</strong>, then Exit to stop syncing document library with the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client. Then perform the steps in my last post to clear credentials.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then try using the new OneDrive sync client to sync your SharePoint document library to see the result. For your reference:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-users-to-sync-SharePoint-files-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-22e1f635-fb89-49e0-a176-edab26f69614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Enable users to sync SharePoint files with the new OneDrive sync client</span></a><span>,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists when you use the new OneDrive sync client, since I notice you are working on the issue with another engineer in this thread:
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_account-mso_winother-mso_o365b/i-cannot-log-into-office-365-for-business-anymore/4f3eef60-3de6-4140-9e7f-7d891cac5829"><span>I cannot log into Office 365 for Business anymore.
 Why not?</span></a><span><span>&nbsp; </span>It seems your organization deployed ADFS, which may be related to the sign-in issue. We'd suggest you continue collaborating with Robert to investigate the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it prompts you to sign into Office 365 when you try to opening a document from local synced folder after the sign-in issue is fixed, feel free to post back here and we will continue assisting you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Rod,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, my understanding is the following:</p>
<p>--After you changed your Office 365 account's password, you can't edit or save your Word and Excel document from the local synced folder, and you get an error after you enter your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my understanding is correct, regarding you have changed your password, it may be related to the credential, please try the following steps to see if you can edit and save files in local synced
 folder:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right-click on OneDrive icon in the task bar, select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span>&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Account</span><span>
 tab, click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Unlink this PC</span><span>
 and click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Unlink account</span><span>,
 then exit OneDrive.</span></li><li><span>Quit all applications, and go to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel</span><span>&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">User Accounts</span><span>&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Credential
 Manager</span><span>&gt;Windows Credentials, remove all credentials related to Microsoft Office and OneDrive under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Generic Credentials</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Relink your Office 365 account to OneDrive sync client to see the outcome.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your OneDrive settings is different from step 1, you should be using the legacy OneDrive sync client, you can check your OneDrive version by the steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-version-of-OneDrive-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which version of OneDrive am I using?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my understanding is not correct or the issue persists, feel free to post back with more details to clarify your situation.</p>

</p><p>Sometimes we need to list those cases, in alphabetical order as they appear in the TOA within the Table of Contents (TOC), instead of providing a TOA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am killing myself trying to figure out how to get those cites to incorporate within the TOC where they belong without doing the old cut and paste.&nbsp; I would like for the page numbers to update as my document is worked on.&nbsp; Is there anyway to make this happen?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Right now I have the TOA at the end of the document and I am cutting and pasting when changes are made but I feel certain that there is a way to make this work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been at this for almost two days now and although Cut and Paste is the easier softer method, my employer really wants me to get this to work.</p>

            TC fields can be used for any information you want included in the TOC. Whether it also appears in the document is irrelevant. In fact, if it appears in the document, this is even simpler, since you can select the citation in the document and press
<strong>Alt+Shift+O</strong> to insert the TC field.

<h2>            Build 9926&#58;  Photos app doesn&#39;t appear to give ANY information about the photos</h2>
                    <p>Build 9926: &nbsp;The Photos app doesn't appear to give ANY information about the photos. &nbsp;Specifically and most importantly, there's no title (or file name). &nbsp;Of course, we also need access to ALL &nbsp;the metadata associated with the photos. &nbsp;But, for a perfect
 example of how much this lack hurts, the Photos app has apparently "enhanced" many (if not most) of my photos. &nbsp;So, I've got two photos sitting there with no idea which one is which (enhanced vs original). &nbsp;If the miserable ones are "enhanced," then I need
 to turn off that option. &nbsp;But, I can't tell which is which.<br />
<br />
Oh, and there's no option to delete the app</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;I found how to display some of the metadata: &nbsp;double-click on a photo's thumbnail, hit the three-dot menu in the upper-right, and select File Info. &nbsp;This is bad. &nbsp;If the information is not displayed by default in the right black panel next to the
 picture, then there should be an option to turn that behavior on. &nbsp;Also, what happened to right-clicking on an object to see what we can do with it? &nbsp;If I right-click on a picture, at the very least, I should see the same options as I'd get by clicking on
 that 3-dot menu. &nbsp;Why add mouse movements to a step that shouldn't need them?</p>

<h2>            Disappearing Messages</h2>
                    What on earth is happening to Skype? There have been more problems to sort out with this once excellent software since Microsoft intervened. I now cannot send messages! As soon as I try to send, everything I have typed suddenly disappears. I have searched
 for answers, but come up with nothing that resembles a coherent answer or solution. The version I am using is 12.1815.210.0. Is there anyone out there who can actually give me a proper answer?&nbsp;

            Hi GeoffLe,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:
<br />

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            Thanks for the responses. I had tried to download the classic version on several occasions, but without success. Each time I tried to access the appropriate link, I was redirected to download the latest version. I have now managed to get back to using
 version 7 and have successfully managed to send IMs now. My friend seems to be running version 8 and until today I was running version 12. I am by no means a computer guru, but I do normally manage to find my way around. Heaven only knows how some folks manage
 to even use Skype these days. Thanks for your help. I do wonder just how long Microsoft will actually continue to support version 7. Confusing or what? I do hope that it is true Microsoft are continually working on this and that we do finally manage to get
 to a version which starts to offer some of the facilities which went missing. Thanks again to those who responded. Geoff

<h2>            Build 10130 - Why can&#39;t I safely remove USB Devices&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it a bug in WIndows 10 Individual Preview Build 10130, a need for an updated device driver, or an incorrect setting that prevents me from being able to disconnect USB devices using the 'Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media' link located in the Windows
 10 task tray?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my attempts to do so result in the display of error messages informing me that "Windows can't stop your' Device Name 'device because a program is still using it. Close any programs that might be using the device, and then try again later.'</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have found that Taskmanager and probably others, cause this in Win 8\8.1\10, . After closing Taskmanager the Devices... mostly HDDs in my case... will Safely Remove" in Win 8\8.1, but not Win 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only way I can get a USB HDD to properly Safely Remove in Win 10, is to restart the machine with it hooked up and turned on, and then Safely Remove it
<strong>before</strong> accessing it. If I even open the drive, it will not work...</p>

            <p>As far as I can see, this has been reported to Microsoft since 2011, with no resolution. So I'd advise no one to hold their breath on this one. I've only seen it on my system since Windows 10, so I think it's been triggered more by this release.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I use to overcome this, is to put my laptop/computer into sleep mode, disconnect the drive, and wake up. I'm prety sure that sleep mode flushes all caches to disk before sleeping, so that disk pointers are all coherent on the disk itself.</p>

            <p>This is in response to an email I received today from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, asking me:</p>
<p>
"Remember that question you asked on Microsoft Community a few days ago?<br />
<br />
Title: Build 10130 - Why can't I safely remove USB Devices?
</p><p>
</p><p>We noticed that the question hasn't been marked as Answered yet and we were wondering if you resolved the issue."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then requested to return here to provide my response and additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My response is, No, my question has not been answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The the problem continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes Windows 10 detects the connection of USB devices, and sometimes is doesn't, When it doesn't, I have to restart Windows 10. &nbsp;And NEVER can safely remove ANY USB devices without having to shut down my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only additional information which I can offer is that:<br />
</p>
<p>1. I did not experience the problem with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, or Windows 8.1 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The problem first appeared with my initial installation of the Windows 10 Technical Preview 64-bit back in the middle of October, 2014, and has continued through each and every subsequent build through, and including that of Windows 10 Individual Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for asking.</p>

            So why is no one at Microsoft answering the direct question? Why at build 10240 has the issue not been resolved? Why does "Safely Remove Hardware" tell me that my external portable USB drive can't be removed because it is in use when I know for a fact
 that I am not running any apps or accessing the drive in any way?<br />

<p>Mine is an installation of Windows 10 Pro 64-bit, Build 10240 for which there is only one, uninstallable update ( Today's NVIDIA driver update for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 - Error 0X800705b4) currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem no longer occurs with every attempt to disconnect USB devices, and external SATA drives. But it still occurs several times each day. There is no difference when Task Manager is running, or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just yesterday there were 11 attempts to disconnect USB devices, and 2 attempts to disconnect external SATA hard drives. Only three of the USB disconnections were successful. All of the other disconnections required that my computer first be shutdown while
 the devices were disconnected, as I don't have the time, or desire to deal with any possible corruption of data due to the unsafe removal of those devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the programs/apps inherent to an installation of Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, there are no performance monitoring programs/apps installed/running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The detection of the connections of external USB devices is much better than before. It's now unusual that the connection of a USB device isn't connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the connection of external SATA drives which are never detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When external USB and SATA devices aren't automatically detected, opening the Device Manager, the NECESSARY highlighting of the computer's name, and the menu selection of "Action" -&gt; Scan for hardware changes" always results in the detection and installation
 of those devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem doesn't appear with my usual installation of Windows 7 installed to a different hard drive used in replacement for the hard drive upon which Windows 10 is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Color me frustrated, annoyed, and disappointed as this problem is consuming more time than the running of Windows 10 is worth to me.</p>

            <p>No third party security. Only Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only software or drivers that weren't installed from the Windows 10 ISO, or by Windows Update, is Google Chrome, which was installed after I posted my initial questions on June 1, 2015, which started this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come to the conclusion that I'll be sticking with Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate, while keeping an eye out for future updates that might finally provide a remedy to the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to explain that both the Business Essentials and the Business Premium plans use Exchange Online Plan 1 for mail feature. For you reference: Services in

</p><p>When you said that you "published" your project, I assume you mean you published it to Project Online.&nbsp; You also indicated you are looking at the Tasks list item in the Project Site for your project.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; If so, there is no way to publish your
 task list in Microsoft Project in collapsed form and then have them show up in collapsed form in the Project Site.&nbsp; In Detailed Project views (accessed by clicking the project name in the Project Center page), it is possible for the administrator to collapse
 the task list.&nbsp; However, this would affect every project and not just your own project.</p>

<p>Hi Howard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the issue is when we publish tasks from project client to project online we are facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are able to successfully publish it to project online site&nbsp;but Tasks are showing up in Detailed view.(when we pulblish it in clollapsed mode from project client it is showing up in Detailed view in project online).</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any project level setting available ? just to know with out impacting other projects.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my previous reply, your application administrator can set the Outline Level to display the project with summary tasks collapsed in Detailed Project views.&nbsp; However, this will impact EVERY project when displayed in a Detailed Project view,
 not just your projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are seeing is not a bug.&nbsp; It is the default behavior of the tool.&nbsp; When you collapse the summary tasks in the Microsoft Project schedule, this does not mean they will be collapsed in Detailed Project views in PWA.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>
