<h2>            Blue Screen while opening attachment from outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a client machine; Aspire X3900 running MS Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. &nbsp;We get a blue screen of death BSOD In MS Outlook 2010 when trying to add an attachment to an outgoing email, literally:</p>
<p>- open new email</p>
<p>- attach</p>
<p>- try and open a folder or attach a doc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Client reckons they have not installed any updates, new gear or made changes. &nbsp;I wonder if some Windows Updates may have been applied though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MAIN PROB IS TRYING TO STOP BSOD WHEN TRYING TO ATTACH A FILE TO A NEW EMAIL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Problem Event Name:<span> </span>BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:<span> </span>6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:<span> </span>3081<br />
<br />
Additional information about the problem:<br />
&nbsp; BCCode:<span> </span>1e<br />
&nbsp; BCP1:<span> </span>FFFFFFFFC0000005<br />
&nbsp; BCP2:<span> </span>FFFFF8800808FC70<br />
&nbsp; BCP3:<span> </span>0000000000000000<br />
&nbsp; BCP4:<span> </span>0000000000000000<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:<span> </span>6_1_7601<br />
&nbsp; Service Pack:<span> </span>1_0<br />
&nbsp; Product:<span> </span>256_1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstall MyWinlocker but prob remains</p>
<p>
</p><p>Confusing in this is Windows tries to apply two critical updates. &nbsp;When these install the system gets BSOD on startup.</p>
<p>Safe start works OK</p>
<p>I can then do a restore and get back to where I was in trying to fix initial error, though on next start Windows Update again tries to install the critical updates and we go round in a circle. &nbsp;The updates are mandatory applied when trying to do a shutdown.</p>
<p>The updates causing this issue are KB2898869 and KB2901126</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run Acer Updater and it finds no updates to apply for this model.</p>
<p>Even so, from Acer site I've applied latest Intel LAN drivers and also he nVidia VGA and audio drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run Registry Repair and also Norton Utilities 16 for registry repair. No Change to symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of the system dump files, but there seems to be no link to upload in this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I reckon it is a driver, yet no idea which one or the fastest easiest way to find and remove it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>Many thanks for above.</p>
<p>Security log was set to 20MB and to overwrite.</p>
<p>I tried "save &amp; clear" which saved OK, then immediately gave me a BSOD</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I uninstalled Kaspersky using their Remove utility, rebooted, checked Kaspersky was not running, went into Outlook, created a new email and tried attaching a file. &nbsp;When I clicked on a folder I still got BSOD</p>
<p>
</p><p>New dump files attached</p>
<p>http://1drv.ms/1fKcplM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still must be a driver clashing?</p>

            <p>As of the latest crash dumps (both March 7th dumps), I still see various Kaspersky drivers loaded (all in fact). Did you use the removal tool properly? Try again, and in safe mode if you must.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I <em>just </em>noticed you have a McAfee driver loaded as well. Was it preinstalled at one point? If so, it appears there are remnants. Run the tool for McAfee as well, please -

            <p>Interesting! I thought the kaspersky had completed OK. &nbsp;As stated, I ran the Remove tool from their folder. &nbsp;I see it is still listed in Uninstall Programs. &nbsp;When I click on it and try to Uninstall I get message "This action is only valid for products that
 are currently installed". &nbsp;Must have left something behind in the directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Mcafee in the program list, though I understand what you are saying. &nbsp;I will download and run that.</p>

            <p>It's my pleasure, really!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, the good news is Kaspersky and McAfee are no more! The bad news... well.. you're still crashing. No matter, we'll get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very curious to see if there are any further 3rd party drivers possibly causing memory corruption and/or conflicts with Outlook. To find out if this is the case, let's enable Driver Verifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            <p>Thanks Patrick. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Did as you suggested, tho there was no option for:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)</span><br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>New dump file at&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1fKcplM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">
IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers drivers and reverted to Windows native before this. &nbsp;Made no change to BSOD</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I even ran Intel's own driver updater and updated the LAN driver. &nbsp;No diff, still got BSOD</span></p>
<p>I guess I'll turn off verifier now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some sort of reasonable blast approach, short of reformat and reload?</p>

    <title>Windows Folder Custom Icon over LAN - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Folder Custom Icon over LAN</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a folder with a few sub-folders. Each subfolder I have created a custom icon for. The folder is Shared on my LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i access the folder from another computer, by default, it seems to load the default folder icon, not the custom icon I've set it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this working properly? If so, how can I change it so that my custom folder icons are cached across the network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I want to set my custom folder icons and see them set that way from any computer on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance,<br />

    <title>How to disable &#34;auto-select&#34; when hovering - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lianele tendre  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable &#34;auto-select&#34; when hovering - Windows 10</h2>
                    Am getting really frustrated. Yesterday, immediately after putting in a brand new flashdrive (Sandisk) on my Lenovo laptop ... I was reading the options list for how to open the file and was simply hovering over the list when the darned system auto-selected
 "Adobe Reader". I didn't click on it or even touch the computer. I was just hovering over the list.<br />
<br />
It's not the first time this has happened. The stupid thing selects and OPENS anything I hover over for more than a few seconds. I have found several complaints about this on various websites ... but have not found an answer to the question ...<br />
<br />
"How do I DISABLE" this really, really annoying "feature"?<br />
<br />
It has added unwanted bookmarks when surfing the web, opened websites I didn't want to go to, opened programmes I didn't want to open ... and on and on.<br />
<br />
I want this thing stopped once and for all. I contacted Microsoft Help and wasted close to an hour of my life. Whatever the young lady told me to do under "Ease of Access" didn't fix the problem at all.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any REAL fix?

<p>Hi LianeLe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the auto-select on mouse hover is enabled on mouse settings that's you're experiencing this kind of issue. You may follow these steps to disable this feature and see if it works:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>On the search bar, type in <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and click it from the search results.</li><li>Once in <em>Control Panel </em>window, set the view to <em>small icons</em>, then select
<strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Explore all settings</em>, select <strong>Make the mouse easier to use</strong> option.</li><li>Under<em> Make it easier to manage windows</em>,<em> uncheck</em> <strong>Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse</strong>.</li><li>Once done, click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please observe if the mouse still auto-select and then update this thread with the result so I can assist you further if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Unauthorized Access Investigation Now at 65 Days &#40;Fraudulent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> droning silence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unauthorized Access Investigation Now at 65 Days &#40;Fraudulent Region Migration&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have been through Xbox Support on the phone numerous times, but since no one can directly contact the Investigations Team, I have no idea what the real status of my support request is. I originally called
 Xbox Support on 09/10/2011 and the investigation was opened the same day. My account had been hijacked (even though no one knew my password and it was DIFFERENT than passwords used elsewhere), points purchased, points spend and then my region changed to Russia.
 I was told the standard 25 day script and that was that. I had called a few times in the following 25 days, but I was told there was no new information and that I had to wait. 26 days later I received an e-mail from Xbox Support that stated the following:
 "<span>Your report of an unauthorized access to your Xbox LIVE account has been reviewed by our fraud investigations team. However, there is a delay in processing your request, so we're sending you a free, 30-day Xbox
 LIVE membership code that you can use to create a new, temporary account." Calling Xbox Support again yielded no new information other than "wait". On 10/20/2011 I called Xbox Support yet again to see if anything new had changed and was told that "because
 of export laws" region changes to Russia take however long they take. I was invited to call my congressman because maybe that would speed things along.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
The fraudulent charges were reversed by my bank, but I do not have any resolution in sight in regards to my actual Xbox Live account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
I started a <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/t/115589.aspx?PageIndex=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support forum thread</a> 20 days ago, but it appears I can no longer add new posts to it. Xbox Support on the forum could only tell me that they hope to have a resolution for me "soon". That was nearly 3 weeks ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
It is now&nbsp;65 days with no real information on the process of restoring my account to me and I find it unacceptable. To add insult to injury, I received an e-mail last week from Xbox Russia. According to Google Translate,&nbsp;the e-mail informed me that my Xbox
 Gold subscription had expired. According to my memory, this was about the time that my US Xbox Gold subscription should have expired, so it seems they haven't really done anything with my account sitting in the Russia region. I find it appalling that it appears
 that the only way&nbsp;customers get any movement on&nbsp;their&nbsp;support requests for fraudulent region migration&nbsp;is to contact the
<a href="http://www.bbb.org/western-washington/business-reviews/computer-software-publishers-and-developers/microsoft-corporation-in-redmond-wa-501264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Better Business Bureau</a>, state <a href="http://www.naag.org/current-attorneys-general.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Attorney General</a>, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">United States Attorney General</a> (due to Identify Fraud), the
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Federal Trade Commission</a>,&nbsp;or management at Microsoft itself. I find it unfathomable that customers are being kept in the dark on this issue.</span></span></p>

<p>After 77 days, my Xbox Live account was restored to me. My account region was returned to the United States after a fraudulent migration to Russia. The Microsoft Points that were stolen from my account were also returned to me. I was also compensated for
 my Xbox Live Gold subscription time. Everything seems to be back to normal.</p>
<p>I did not have to contact the BBB or my state Attorney General.</p>
<p>Now I have to re-start Skyrim on my main Xbox Live account. I warned my wife that she may not see me for a few days.</p>
<p>Thank you Xbox Live Support and the Investigations Team.</p>

<p>What's the final email that they sent you look like?</p>
<p>I'm asking cause I'm still waiting after first calling in over 130 days ago.</p>
<p>I have only received the email that was in Portuguese. Called that in. Then got an email 2 weeks after that stating there was a delay in the Investigation. And then a week ago received an email from someone at Exceptions Analyst saying they received my case
 and would be in contact with me next week. Well it's next week and still nothing. Tried calling the person and they don't answer. Keep getting there answering machine. Even left messages and still not contacted back.</p>

<p>Did they send you an e-mail confirming this? Months ago when my account was hacked, they claimed it was impossible to migrate me back to the U.S.... I've seen a couple people claim that recently they've had their accounts migrated back, though. I might have
 to contact them again to see what the deal is, but I refuse to be locked down a few months again when my case has already been taken care of. I just want my account migrated back like I've seen online.</p>

<p>Krazie I was initially told the same. That Migrated accounts can't be Migrated back. It wasn't until about a month or two later that I was informed that's not necessarily the case. That the info I was told is false. That accounts can be Migrated back in
 the case of a Unauthorized Access but if it was an accidental change, something you did on your own and not a part of an Unauthorized Access then it can't be. Over 4 months of waiting here.</p>

<p>Droning Silence, you give us hope, to my recollection you are the first person on the forums whose account has been migrated back, lets hope that this is the beginning and the flood gates will open so the rest of us can be migrated back. I just received
 my 1st email from XBOX support (I'm at the 25 day stage) giving me a free month and informing me that things are taking longer than usual and so I came onto the forums looking for some good news...This is it.</p>
<p>Good luck to all, again now I wait</p>

                    <p>Can anyone please let me know how to hide or disable the Administrator account in Windows 10 which is seen on the start up. Microsoft Support started it up to try and fix a problem (which was sorted by an update) but they did not bother to disable or hide
 in afterwards. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any reply on any instructions on how to do this be done in a way that complete novice would be able to understand it.&nbsp;</p>

            Why can't I open my outlook ? Windows 10 had me set up an live/ outlook.com account and forced me to use that password to log in to my PC. Now I can't use my old password or open my outlook 2010 . It tells me I do not have permission because I am not the
 administrator. Where did I go wrong ? HELP !!!!

            <p>I find the answer by Kiran Kishore rather confusing and unclear, and therefore of no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the " inbuilt administrator account"?&nbsp; Is that the same as the "Admin account"? It does not sound so by this sentence in the answer: " Sign in through your Admin account on Windows 10 (not built administrator account). To pile on more confusion,
 the answer refers to " Microsoft/Loacl account account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me a rather clear and straight forward question was answered by the opposite.

            <p>It is important to note that serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>hidden administrator account</strong> has more privileges than a regular administrator account. We recommend enabling the hidden administrator account only if you're certain that you need it to troubleshoot a specific problem and then disabling
 it when you're done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow these steps to troubleshoot your issue:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Enabled the hidden administrator</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a. Open <strong>command prompt</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b. Type <strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong> then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">c. You should see a message that the command completed successfully.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">d. Log in using the hidden admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run Check Disk</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a. Open <strong>command prompt</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b. Type<strong> chkdsk /r</strong> then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: Check if the issue is resolved</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a. Log out of the hidden admin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b. Log in to your admin profile.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">c. Once you've successfully logged in to your admin profile, disable the hidden admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4: Disable hidden administrator</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a. Make sure that you're still logged in as your regular admin account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b. Open <strong>command prompt (admin)</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">c. Type <strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong> then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">d. You should see a message that the command completed successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have linkedIn, twitter and facebook linked to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter and facebook show correctly in the people hub in windows 8 pro, linkedIn, is connected but it doesn't show any notifications and you are unable to update status on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Here are few Troubleshooting steps that should help you to resolve this Issue:-</u></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same issue. I have connected my LinkedIn Account to my Live Account however the status messages do not appear in the Whats New Section of the people app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the people app, revoked permission from my live account. Restarted the Windows 8 PC, reinstalled the people app, added the LinkedIn Account and waited for synchronisation to complete but still not status updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked to see whether there are further updates for the app but there are not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I add twitter the updates appear instantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not seem correct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically removed ALL connections, not just linked in.</p>
<p>Haven't got any new linked notifications yet,&nbsp;but at least I now have the LinkedIn icon in top right of screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a start. Hopefully is fixed.</p>

<p>Sigh, perhaps not. When I added all the accounts the LinkedIn icon disappeared, but perhaps the '...' at top right means 'more' and that is where linked in is sitting.&nbsp; It comes back if I remove any of the other accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the start...</p>

            <p>You can refer to these steps on how to recover lost or deleted emails in Live Mail:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Remove the account from Windows Live Mail.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2 Click&nbsp;<span><strong>Remove account</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3 Confirm the action by clicking&nbsp;<strong>Yes</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>2. Add the account again.</span><span><br />
3. Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span><span><br />
4. Click on&nbsp;<span><strong>Download all folders</strong>.</span></span><span><br />
5. Wait for Live Mail to download all your folders and email headers.</span><span><br />
6. Check if all your folders have been downloaded. If it does, proceed to the next step, if not go back to step 1.</span><span><br />
7. Press on&nbsp;<span><strong>F5</strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard or click on Send and Receive button to synch all your emails to Windows Live Mail.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Receiving Skype Call on PC Vs Mobile</h2>
                    When I get a Skype video call it appears on my mobile. How can I switch the video call to my Windows 10 laptop? It appears there should be a "phone" icon on my mobile to allow me switch it over to the PC, but there is no such icon on the mobile that I
 can find (I tried them all).

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c673db4f-a9cd-4857-aa66-82ac9e46a90a" title="TerrySkype">
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to switch an answered Skype call to a different device. One possible reason why you are receiving the call on your mobile and not on your PC is because there might have been a misrouting of the notification. This usually happens when a
 user is signed in to multiple devices at the same time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is best to sign in to your account on the device where you want to answer the call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance or additional information.

            <p>The C: drive is where Windows is actually installed and runs from. The red&nbsp; bar is an indication that the drive is full. You will need to do some housekeeping to clean up the computer and free up some disk space fairly urgently. It might be safer to get
 some hands on assistance with this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WinRE stands for Windows Recovery Environment and contains an image of the computer as supplied by the manufacturer. There will be a procedure to go through which depends on the manufacturer as to what it is. The blue bar indicates there is some space left
 on this drive although using it to store files can stop the recovery process working.</p>

That being said my question is this I lost my confirmation number when I enter the Xbox Design Lab contest. but I do still have the email that says I claimed my controller has link with picture and its still on Xbox design lab community gallery not as popular as others but hopefully if I do win and explain my story it will help spread motivation, hope, love and more. Anyway&nbsp; My other question about the contest will we be notified if we lose?&nbsp; or is there a place we can check so who won? will they contact us by phone I'm not sure but its getting closer to 22nd I think that when it ends.

<h2>            USB FAILURE</h2>
                    <p>3 out of my 4 USB ports suddenly (a week maybe) quit working.&nbsp; I went to Device Manager and unchecked the power management option for power saving, but no help.&nbsp; Clicking on each individual port says this divice is working.&nbsp; Rebooting several times was no
 help.&nbsp; The one that is working had a USB distribution device plugged in all the time.&nbsp; The other 3 were not used except occassionally.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />try with these possible solutions
<br />
<br />Method 1: Use the Device Manager to look for changes in the hardware
<br />Use the Device Manager to look for changes in the hardware. After your computer searches for hardware changes, it may recognize the USB device that is connected to the USB port and can use it.
<br />
<br />To look for changes in the hardware, follow these steps:
<br />Click Start, and then click Run.
<br />
<br />Note: If you are running Windows Vista, click Start, and then use the Start Search box.
<br />Type devmgmt.msc and click OK. The Device Manager opens.
<br />In Device Manager, click on your computer to highlight it.
<br />Click on Action, and then click Find hardware changes.
<br />Check the USB device to see if it works.
<br />If the problem has been solved, you are done with this article. If this method does not solve the problem, go to Method 2.
<br />Method 2: Restart the computer
<br />If the search for new hardware did not solve the problem, try restarting the computer. Once the computer is restarted, check the USB device to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If with the restart of the equipment the problem has been solved, it has already finished. If this method does not solve the problem, go to Method 3.
<br />Method 3: Disable and re-enable the USB controller
<br />Use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all USB controllers. In this way, the controllers recover the USB port from their non-response condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in the Device Manager. If you are not familiar with advanced troubleshooting, try the steps in the "Workaround" section.
<br />
<br />To disable and re-enable USB controllers, follow these steps:
<br />Click Start, and then click Run.
<br />
<br />Note: If you are running Windows Vista, click Start, and then use the Start Search box.
<br />Type devmgmt.msc and click OK. The Device Manager opens.
<br />Expand Universal Serial Bus (USB) controllers.
<br />
<br />Note: You may have to scroll through the list to search for this item.
<br />Right-click the first USB controller in Universal Serial Bus Controllers, and then click Uninstall to remove it.
<br />Repeat step 4 for each USB controller that appears in Universal Serial Bus Controllers.
<br />Restart the computer. Once the computer is started, Windows will automatically look for changes in the hardware and reinstall all the USB controllers that it uninstalls.
<br />Check the USB device to see if it works.
<br />If the USB port recognizes the device and you can use it, you are done with this article.
<br />
<br />If with this method the problem is solved, it is over. If this method has not solved the problem, go to the "Alternative solution" section.
<br />
<br />If the above methods do not work please check this link

    <title>Virtualized Folder in Temporary Internet Files______ - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malazan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtualized Folder in Temporary Internet Files______</h2>
                    
<p>I recently located Thumbcache images in a folder called Virtualized in the Temp Internet Files on a windows 7 machine. The pathway was /[root]/Users/[user name]/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary Internet Files/Virtualized/C/Users/[user name]/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Explorer/thumbcache_256.db.</p>
<p>Why is there a thumbcache.db in this "virtualized" folder?<br />
<br />
Are these thumbnails from web pages viewed or are they thumbs from images saved on the computer?<br />
<br />
What is the purpose of the virtualized folder and why is it in the Tempory Internet Files? Thanks for any input.</p>

<p><span>Hi Malazan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The thumbnail images found in Virtual folder are from web pages viewed and<span>&nbsp;</span>they are not the thumbnail files from images saved on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Browsing the net can expose one to certain security risks. You could end up with Spyware on your PC or have a Trojan downloader surreptitiously download an unwanted
 program or you could even find your browser hijacked. <span>&nbsp;</span>By clicking a link, innocently, in an e-mail or even mistyping a web address, can find your browser visiting a 'hostile' site.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To mitigate against these threats, Internet Explorer<span>&nbsp;</span>7 in Vista and Internet Explorer 8 in Windows 7 runs in Protected Mode. The Cache is now considered
 as a virtual folder with the same low privilege as that of the Internet Explorer process itself.&nbsp; Virtual folder is by default located in Tempory Internet Files folder to store the cache files.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the operating system creates Virtual Folders in Tempory Internet Files&nbsp;to store files that Internet Explorer tries to save in protected locations. So, instead of causing an 'add-on' to fail when it tries to write a data file
 to the Windows folder or Program Files, Windows Vista and Windows 7&nbsp;redirects the write operation to a virtual equivalent.&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and Regards,</span></p>
