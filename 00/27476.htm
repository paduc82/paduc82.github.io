    <title>Composing text in Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Composing text in Word</h2>
                    <p>I would like to request a special mode of operation in Word, possibly titled "Composition Mode."</p>
<p>I am a hobby writer, however composing in Word can be a pain when pop up menus, you know all whiz bag special features you've built into Word over the years like highlighting and the deleting text from the keyboard, suddenly activate and erase your work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This mode, when activated from the control ribbon, would do the following,</p>
<p>1. Disable all keyboard shortcuts (I know you're all proud of them and for some users, they're great, but this user and most neophytes, they are a pain in the ass that just interrupts the creative flow.)</p>
<p>2. Only allows advanced controls to be activated through selection on the control ribbon by selection with the mouse and right clicking or on the text pane by left clicking the mouse in the text pane.</p>
<p>3. Disable research and other pop up panes, if I want them, I'll find them in the ribbon. Usually, I don't and their sudden appearance on my work is just a distraction.</p>
<p>4. Slow down reselection of the cursor position, maybe even require a double click to move it around the work. This is also a huge distraction when composing. In fact, while composing this, I've had to correct that mistake half a dozen times as text is suddenly
 inserted in the wrong place.</p>
<p>5. Auto-save as a working version, to be written over the saved version only when commanded by the user, or maybe not. As an optional feature this may be well worth it to preserve the original work only to be written over after revue by the user.</p>
<p>6. Only allow text selection by actually dragging the cursor over the work and holding down the mouse button, with a sufficient delay as to preclude accidental selection, and then changing of work that is already done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not take offense. Like I stated earlier, keyboard shortcuts, text selection from the keyboard, and all the hyperlinked panes incorporated into Word are just great FOR HYPER ADVANCED USERS, for the rest of us they just get in the way.
</p>
<p>So, can you finally cure this vexing problem that has plagued all us normal people since the '90's? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds like you'd be happier with Notepad or Wordpad, something that has almost no features other than entering text. When it's time to format the text -- if you ever do that -- you can open the text file in Word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the other things you asked for, such as never saving over an existing file without specific user action, can be accomplished in Word by changing your habits: in this case, use Save As (F12) instead of Save, and you will be prompted to overwrite or
 to change the file name. If you don't want keyboard shortcuts, you can remove their assignments (in the dialog at File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts Customize).</p>

<p>Yes and no. </p>
<p>Wordpad makes composition even more clumsy. In fact, I never use it. I only use notepad to publish final products into Mobi e-books.</p>
<p>What gives me fits is gestures, which I HATE, and the wondering cursor. And all the dialogs that open without my command just waist my time. If I want research or any of the rest of it, I know where to find it. I don't want it opening all on its own.</p>
<p>Couple that with the &nbsp;fact that WordPad does not readily translate to anything else, including Android, Apple, or web based applications and your suggestion is a non-starter.</p>
<p>I know Microsoft is the giant in the industry. But it is not the end all be all. Microsoft phones, for example, just flat suck. I've had one, never again. They are not agile enough for mobile business communications. For example, even though I have Microsoft
 Office available for all my mobile devices, I never use it. For the simple fact that the program loading response is measured in geologic time. If I have to stand around for half an hour waiting for the program to come up, it's not a effective use of my time.
</p>
<p>I use Mobi's version, for the simple fact that it doesn't waist my time. I can also save a doc as a PDF, sign it, and share it. It is then a document legally admissible in court. Like a contract. Even though it was composed on the hood of my car.</p>
<p>Try doing that with Office from a phone or tablet. Good luck with that! This same application will also readily flip back and forth to Microsoft office without a hitch. So I can continue work from my tablet or phone on my laptop, save it back to my cloud
 account, and open the same docs in the field. Microsoft phones DO NOT play well with others. I found that out the hard way and almost lost a job. That's why they don't sell well and rarely have repeat customers. Get the point?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you insist on torturing yourself with Word, you can turn off or disable some features, but not all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts: Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon &gt; Keyboard shortcuts Customize (the button at the bottom left corner of the dialog). In the Customize Keyboard dialog, select All Commands in the Categories list. Then work your way down the Commands
 list; each time you see a shortcut in the Current Keys box, click on it and click the Remove button. This will take a long time, but needs to be done only once.</li><li>AutoCorrect and AutoFormat As You Type: Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing &gt; AutoCorrect Options. On the AutoCorrect tab of the dialog, uncheck all the boxes. Then go to the AutoFormat As You Type tab and uncheck all the boxes there. (The tab that says only
 AutoFormat can be ignored, because it takes effect only when you manually start an AutoFormat, and the button for that isn't on the ribbon or the Quick Access Toolbar by default.) More on this at&nbsp;<a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TameAutoFormat.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TameAutoFormat.htm</a>.</li><li>Spelling and Grammar: In the&nbsp;File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing page, uncheck "Check spelling as you type" and "Mark grammar errors as you type".</li><li>To disable the Research pane: Follow the instructions in HansV's post marked as the Answer of November 16, 2013 at
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/how-to-completely-remove-research-task-pane/a25d208b-6ccb-41c1-986a-0207d903c4c7">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/how-to-completely-remove-research-task-pane</a>. (The same procedure works in Office 365 / Word 2016.) If you identify another pane that you want to disable, put its name in the command in place
 of "Research".</li><li>You can slow your mouse movements in Windows (not in Office alone) by going to the Control Panel, opening the Mouse settings dialog, and moving the setting in the Motion section of the Pointer Options tab.</li></ul>
<p>As far as I know, your other requests are not available in Office or Windows, but third-party programs or add-ins that implement them may be available.</p>

I searched for the name of the sender and found the emails in all mail. &nbsp;I created a new file under my inbox and moved one there successfully, but I'm a little worried about losing them again! &nbsp;I still don't understand how they ended up where they did, but
 I guess that doesn't matter since I found them again. &nbsp;I'll move the rest of them, and hope for the best. &nbsp;Thanks for your help.</div>

<h2>            Windows defender will not turn on in the latest build of windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Lenovo G50-70 SERIES laptop. I updated Windows 10 to the latest build recently.&nbsp;I was using an external genuine AV program at that time. When it has expired I uninstalled it from my laptop hoping for the Windows defender to take care of the&nbsp;system
 protection. The Windows defender service started as soon as I uninstalled the AV program. But when I turn on the defender, it redirects to the
<strong>Apps and Features </strong>in system settings. The defender window is also showing
<strong>Real time protection: handled by other AV program.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is no other AV program installed in my laptop. No malware detecting applications, nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me some solution for this problem.</p>

<h2>            Rollback from 14267 to 14257 causes mail app to fail</h2>
                    I had to roll my system back to 14257 from 14267 because of the problems I had with sleep not recovering properly. Now my mail app will&nbsp;not load, just flashes and dies. The app store tries to update the app but it fails. Any way to get this to work?

    <title>Question with choices - order shifting when shared. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question with choices - order shifting when shared.</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a 40-question software survey for my team, with each question consisting of 5 radio button choices. After sharing it with my team, there is an issue of consistency with the choices. The order of the choices is not the same as the original form,
 and can differ between two people, even if they are on the same platform/browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem? Is it a known bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the form via Office365 on an iMac Pro using Safari. If I check the form on my Windows laptop, the questions are in the correct order, so it *seems* that sharing it is where the problem occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance is appreciated.</p>

            Hi Mikein,
<br />
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. Now, we would like to help you promptly. 
<br />
<br />It does not seems a bug, but it's a metter of settings, Shuffle questions, to be more precise. Could you check please, if it's not set it up?
<br />
<br />When you use the Shuffle questions setting, Microsoft Forms randomly shuffles the order of the questions displayed. Each responder sees the questions in a different sequence. The default setting is to display the questions to each responder in the same order you designed the form.

<h3> sam33313  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote OCR function takes too long</h2>
                    <p>One of my biggest use for OneNote at my job, is using it to quickly extract liquid texts from screen shots.</p>
<p>I am able to extract over 500 numerical invoice numbers in less than a minute, compare to if I had to manually&nbsp;</p>
<p>typed them individually off the screen. I also use the keyboard shortcut Winlogo + S to perform the screen capture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I cannot get these done the same way at home with my Mac.</p>
<p>The OCR takes forever to be available, the keyboard shortcut is a combo of too many keys.<br />
</p>
<p>I have Office 365 installed on my Mac with the latest High Sierra.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to extract texts from any images freshly pasted in my OneNote page,</p>
<p>it takes forever to see the contextual menu </p>
<p>"Copy text from picture"</p>
<p>to finally appear over the image&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;But when I perform above procedure at my employer computer, it performs instantly and I could extract my texts instantly.</p>

            Unfortunately, it's quite normal that OCR is much faster on OneNote for Windows (at least the desktop version, eg. OneNote 2016) than on the other OneNote clients (MacOS, iOS, Android, Windows 10 UWP app). The reason for this is, that OneNote 2016 uses an OCR engine that is part of Windows and therefore instantaneous. MacOS, for example, does not offer an own OCR that OneNote could use. So all text recognition is done on Microsoft's servers which process all requests from a waiting queue. That process can take up to several minutes until the indexing is done (I've even experienced hours, but I guess that was a glitch in the service). 
<br />
<br />There is no way to speed this process up, except for at least temporarily opening the notebooks in OneNote 2016 for Windows, to let it's local OCR kick in,

            Go to File &gt; Save As.<br />
For Excel 2016, click "More options…" under the save location. Earlier versions of Excel: skip this<br />
Click the Tools button then General Options in the Save As dialog window.<br />
Check the box next to "Always create backup".<br />
Be noticed that the backup copy saves in the same folder as the original one, if you meet hard disk failure or virus attack, you may lose the two filed simultaneously. Therefore, it is better to
<a href="https://www.backup-utility.com/backup-restore/backup-excel-file-in-different-location.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
backup important Excel file in different location</a> like external hard drive or NAS, etc. If one copy is lost, at least you have another one to recover it to the previous state.&nbsp;

<h2>            Lumia 950 getting hot whilst off and refuses to turn on</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is now repeatedly happening on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone is working fine.</p>
<p>I leave it alone for a while.</p>
<p>I come back to it, and it is red hot.</p>
<p>Phone now refuses to switch on, although glance still works.</p>
<p>Cannot make phone calls to the device (its dead).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone is on regular retail build of W10M (i.e. not on Insider programme).</p>
<p>Phone is unlocked, UK phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello, Guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your queries to Microsoft Community. We're glad that the issues with your phone overheating has been resolved. However, you're not seeing Cortana app after hard resetting your phone and restoring your settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Cortana app supports some <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/557b5e0e-0eb0-44db-87d6-5e5db6f9c5b0/cortana-s-regions-and-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Cortana's regions and languages">
regions and languages</a>. If you're able to see the said app before hard resetting your phone, please try to change the region and language settings of your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Region</strong> and change the
<strong>Country/Region</strong> settings of your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi -</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting the phone several times, and trying the time/region tricks, with nothing working I check the version it had reset to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out it was a very early W10M build. This was a second-hand phone to me (bought on ebay), so I wonder if the previous owner used an Insider build on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I used the device recovery tool to put the latest build on it, and now everything appears to be working again. I have not experienced it refusing to turn on/getting hot again either - so fingers crossed that issue is resolved.</p>

            Next time, mention the actual build number instead of saying the you're in the "regular one", which led people to assume you were on the latest released version, and you clearly weren't.

<p>Simplest way, if it hasn't gone away by now, and you don't know what it is, just shutdown/reboot. If it is still running you will be asked if you want to shut it down.</p>

</p>
<p>under data it show c:\windows\installer\2fa0e.ipi</p>
<p>maybe i am going about it the wrong way . under installer did you mean to remove the folder "InProgress" and therby remove the entry on the right of the screen or did you mean simply to to highlight under name the file shown above ,which is what i did but
 it did not help</p>

            i had open the regedit at the time of trying the install.the reg does not change at anytime during the process.or even after you close it down after failing to get past the start.It opens then you do the product validation ,press continue,check the box
 for agreement ,the it just waits fora moment then hangs with the all tooo familiar note.

            Sorry, I'm out of ideas. If the problem is not a program stub, there are only 2 other possibilities: a registry entry or some sort of a file.<br />
<br />
On the registry side, I have absolutely no idea where it would be hiding. On the file side, as a long shot, try cleaning the temp folder. That is often where installations will expand compressed files. Maybe you are tripping over one of them ...?
<br />
<br />
Use the Fix It in the following tip to uninstall any bits and pieces that may have been left behind after a failed attempt.&nbsp; I would even follow it up with the manual process to be doubly sure that everything is.
<br />

<h2>            mac 2011 pasting track changes into new word doc</h2>
                    <p>I need to copy a document into another doc. The original text has track changes. How do I do it on a Mac without losing the changes? All the fixes I've seen are for PCs.I see below there isn't an option for Mac 2011. Figures. And for devise I have to select
 other/unknown. When is Microsoft going to truly recognize Mac's presence? I suppose they still believe in discrimination on other levels, too. Come on, Bill.</p>

            Hi Suzanne :-)<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right. I have no idea what "<i>devise</i>" or "<i>fixes</i>" the OP is referring to, but it's just as simple as described on Shauna's site...<br />
<br />
For excerpts, turn T/C off in the source*, then copy/paste. [* I prefer turning the feature off in both the target &amp; the source.]
<br />
<br />
If the entire source file needs to be included, <b>Insert&gt; File</b> also retains the changes.<br />

            When you start a thread it asks you for your OS and device. That's what I was referring to. ;)<br />
As for "fix" that would be a solution to a problem. in this case, it is the track changes being pasted into another doc. When I googled 2011 or Mac, nothing came up but the same ones for 2010 so I thought I would try them. I tried the PC "fixes" and they did
 not work, which is why I came here. I don't like bothering people with problems without having tried some solutions first. I will try inserting the file. Also, I had TC off in both files. thank you.<br />

            What changes were you hoping for? You said, "I see below there isn't an option for Mac 2011. Figures. And for devise I have to select other/unknown." That was because you were in the Winword forums; you apparently hadn't noticed that there are entirely
 separate forums for Office for Mac, where you can select Office for Mac 2011 and Word for Mac. I moved your post to there (here).

<h2>            entered wrong password multiple times and locked out, I tried the website solutions to no avail</h2>
                    I entered the wrong password for my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account multiple times and managed to get locked out, I tried the outlook website solutions to no avai. That's to say that
<br />
<br />
1. The number on teh password recovery screeng for the account recovery is old and not in use anymore<br />
2. The answer to the security question is beyond my ability to remember (so long ago)<br />
3. I couldn't fill in the support form with much, in order to evidence the accounts ownership.. (Can't remember much about the account details, but certainly enough to prove ownership just not what the recovery form asks, I don't use it often but it is my most
 important account, in terms of the value of the data trafficking it from time to time).<br />
<br />
I understand this is a very particular case... not everione is unable to recall information required by the recovery process. But here's to hoping there's some sort of solution, if there's no help here I have to turn to those private account recovery companies
 and pay 100$ to give out my personal info and possibly get scammed.. I need that email account back so desperately!
<br />
<br />
I'm happy to give any information you need.. if i was talkign toa&nbsp; person I could easily show them through fact that I'm the owner.. and they could jsut.. unblock it and give me a temp password to log in with and change. oh well it is free in the end isn't
 it.<br />
<br />
a small question, do you get live support with paid outlook membership? I seem to remember there was an option for that...<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance to whoever lends their time to my personal and big problem.<br />

    <title>Backing up ringtones retrieved form the Insider app&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianp.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backing up ringtones retrieved form the Insider app&#63;</h2>
                    I've used the "Insider" app to get a few ringtones, and I've been liking a tune that was there some time ago named "The Quest". Now my problem is that because I moved calendar events from one calendar to another one using Live's web interface,&nbsp;my phone's
 calendar is messed up. Basically,&nbsp;I found out the hard way that Windows Phone does not like this at all. So I'll have to soft reset the phone I suppose. Considering Insider does not make these tunes available anymore - is it&nbsp;somehow possible&nbsp;to retrieve the
 ringtone out of the phone or to get that sound from somewhere else? I mean, if it was on Insider,&nbsp;I guess there has to be some place where to get them from?&nbsp;

            Windows Phone doesn't mind calendar events being moved around at all. So let's figure that out first. THere's no need to reset the phone. So, give more detail to this calendar problem.

            <p>Well, it did mind here, they simply remained in the calendar they previously were on my phone. However, the events in question were repeated events that ended in January and aren't on my phone's calendar anymore.</p>
<p>My question was of a more general nature, because that was more of example of a few issues I am having with the setup, there was also
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wpapps/app-update-issues-different-latest-version-shown/17858ffa-916b-4c94-a3d0-b5f116da4d8b">
this very strange issue</a>&nbsp;for instance. In general, I'd like to reset the phone to possibly improve the situation of such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That aside, I'm almost certain the answer on backing up SMS and ringtones is a negative one - which I find pretty sad considering those with full unlocks or those running Android have these very basic features - and Windows Phone does not. Yet, it would
 be ok for me if I could get the previous ringtones from the Insider app from somewhere else - after all it's an app directly made by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>So disregarding the calendar issue and the issue I had with a non-updatable app, there were these affecting me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some applications (I noticed one, might be more) seem to simply not have updated or having updates being available reported</li><li>Since about mid December I experienced a sudden increase of battery consumption out of nowhere. I believed this was related to applications but it wasn't.</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft is apparently not able to deliver even the most trivial backup facilities. Not to mention that I already lost all my SMS et al. back in November when I switched my Live ID from an external E-mail provider to Live because somehow WP7 is too stupid
 to notice that change or give you any chance to change the live ID (notice here: It was the same ID before and after, just the login mail changed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, I Hard-SPL'd the device now and guess what:</p>
<ul>
<li>BT File Transfer: yes, can do.</li><li>SMS, Favorites backup: yes, can do.</li><li>Fixing Battery issues: yes, can do.</li><li>proper USB storage support: yes, can do.</li><li>receiving 8112, 8773, 8779 updates which include proper MMS support: yes, can do.</li><li>Disabling haptic feedback: yes, can do.</li><li>Setting hours in which the phone is automatically put in vibrate only: yes, can do.</li><li>Changing the search engine: yes, can do.</li></ul>
<p>Seriously, Microsoft? You need to root the f**king device to change the godforsaken search engine? What are you trying to drive me to, custom ROMs?</p>
<p>Goddamn, do something about this with 7.8!</p>

</span>I have tried creating a new file, <span>copying</span> the contents and encrypting the new file (deleting the old one) but the problem persists.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>I’m having the problem on two computers (although the same file):</p>
<p>Home built PC Win 10 Home, Word 2016</p>
<p>HP Pavilion, Win 10, Pro, Word 2013 (note this was an upgrade from Win 7 Pro and I don’t recall the problem before the upgrade)</p>

<p>I have found the root of this problem, but first some background. I was working with a document&nbsp;that had been created in a long-ago version of Word. So naturally I presumed that corruptions had occurred&nbsp;in this document through&nbsp;its various upgrades and conversions
 to the latest version of Word. Wrong! I remade the document from scratch in Word 2016, and still had the problem of my encrypted password vanishing into thin air. I easily replicated this problem with other Word documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was never my document. Given the universality of this problem across all my documents, I got to wondering what common trait had occurred in each document before the password protection was stripped away. The common trait was time. It seemed like
 the longer I had an unsaved document open, the more likely I'd lose the password. So, I thought, what process occurs periodically in all my documents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoRecover! That's the problem. Whenever an autorecovery backup occurred, the password disappeared. After going to File/Options/Save and turning off the AutoRecover feature, the problem was resolved. Next, thinking that my installation (on a Lenovo T420
 with Win 7) was corrupt, I ran a Quick Repair of my Office 365 installation under "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel. Didn't resolve the problem. So I ran a full online repair, and that also didn't resolve the problem. For the record, my machine
 is fully protected by Norton Internet Security and Malwarebytes, and there's no indication of any viruses or malware. Everything else runs just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for my rant, take it or leave it. This problem, in my estimation, is a serious security flaw, and it should embarrass Microsoft. That said, given the paucity of complaints about it, I'm assuming it affects a limited number of Office users. But still,
 it should not be happening. I've been a Microsoft loyalist for years. I started using Word in 1990! There are many things about Microsoft's software that I like, but this kind of thing drives me crazy! If you work in a corporate environment (I don't), then
 you likely have a legion of IT geeks to fix problems like this. But what if you're an individual on&nbsp;your own? Is it any wonder that so many of Microsoft's retail customers have fled to competing products from companies like Apple and Google? If I continue
 to experience more problems like this, I'll be joining them when I&nbsp;cycle through my next computer upgrade.</p>

            Resolved this when I figured out how to add my Outlook.com account to my Windows Outlook 2013 app on my PC.&nbsp; The link you suggested may work as well, but&nbsp;because&nbsp;my Windows phone uses Outlook.com for its Calendar and Contacts, simply adding my Outlook.com
 account to Outlook 2013 app solves the problem.&nbsp; Contacts and Calendar are now syncing in both directions.&nbsp;

<h2>            Cells with scroll bars</h2>
                    Is it possible to create a cell with a lot of text to have a scroll bar rather than increasing the row/column?

<p>You're okay on this.&nbsp; Try typing text letters along the left side of the textbox, make them vertical.&nbsp; Letter/enter/letter/enter/letter/enter, etc.&nbsp; If you set the vertical scrollbar to true, when the letters on the left side exceed the textbox, the vertical
 scrollbar will appear.&nbsp; =EMBED("Forms.TextBox.1","") just shows what is been active.</p>
<p>In practice, as the user types in text, it will appear normal and when they exceed the limits of the textbox the scrollbar will appear.&nbsp; Also try setting Textalign to left and&nbsp;wordwrap to true.&nbsp; This should work just fine.</p>
