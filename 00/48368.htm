<h2>            L.A Noire DLC and The Bad Pursuit challange.</h2>
                    
<p>Was in GameStation getting LA Noire today. Got it on the other console. I did have a temptation feeling to get it on 360 for some reason. But I think what swade me was on the PS3 box it said The Naked City and The Badge Pursuit. Where on the 360 said noting
 about the naked city or the bad pursuit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The badge pursuit is like a roll of film in the box and the naked city is DLC. Just wondering if both of these came with the 360 version as well?</p>

<p>According to sales person in Gamestation there are two versions, one with code one without,the one with code is exempt from Gamestations 10 day guarantee because code is not covered ( got the silver stuff you scrap off ) so they have no way of telling if
 its been used.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally Changing attributes on all User folders, sub-folders and files to unhidden</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I am new to Windows 10 and was trying to find where my Recycle Bin and deleted files went under my main user in my new laptop. So using File Explorer, I went to the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">Windows "C:\Users" folder,&nbsp;</span>right-clicked
 either on that folder or on my relevant &lt;user&gt; sub-folder, and set all files to unhide - i.e. I applied the attribute to all folders and subfolders and files. (I even gave Administrator authorization to proceed!). This took quite some time and I then realized
 something was wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then discovered that what I should have done to view Hidden files was to change the Advanced viewing options to "s<span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">how hidden files, folders, and drives". I also subsequently discovered that my Recycle
 Bin was sitting on my desktop (i.e. like looking for sunglasses on one's head). Silly silly me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">I have since read in an online article that changing preset Hidden attributes and subsequently "</span><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">Accessing system files that the operating system's
 developers had hidden can cause system instability". I do not wish to end up doing that down the track. Hence the following questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">1) Are there any sensitive files under the User folders which if inadvertently accessed because they have been set to unhidden can affect the operation of the computer (NB: I did not change the attributes
 under the &nbsp;"Program files" or "Program Files (x86)" folders).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">Is there a way to reset the hidden attributes to what they originally were (i.e. defaults) for files and sub-folders under the "C:\Users" folders?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">3) If what I did was unwise or harmful, should I just create a new User from scratch and transfer all my data files there and remove my original user? It has taken me quite a while to set up programs
 etc in my user - so I am hoping there may be an easy way to restore the original "hidden" attributes settings for each file to what they were. But if not, I will start all over again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">Lastly, another (presumably more minor) thing, I accidentally deleted the "Documents" folder under my user in the Windows C:/User/&lt;user&gt; folder. I have since set Windows10 to give me a warning before
 deleting. This doesn't seem to be a big deal as I have my documents stored under OneDrive and those haven't disappeared (i.e. that seems to be a different documents folder under
</span>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\OneDrive<span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">). Anyway I created a new folder entitled "Windows" under my User in Windows C: and it is now there without it's special icon. Is this of relevance? The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">C:/User/&lt;user&gt;/Documents
 folder appears to be a File Folder and not a system folder. Or am I wrong on that?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(59, 68, 78, 1)">Any advice on the above - especially the first query re the hidden attributes - would be most appreciated!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each specific users account folder (i.e. C:\Users\"your account name") will/may contain some folder(s) and/or files that are unique and specific to that account only depending on what has been installed on the device while using that specific account, so
 therefore, a direct comparison between any two separate user accounts folders contents will not&nbsp;mirror one another exactly, and often,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;a lot of differences between them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be fairly easy to tell if you're seeing a hidden folder in file explorer in that a hidden folders folder icon will be semitransparent in appearance as compared to a non-hidden type folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check to see if your setting is working properly, while viewing in file explorer click on the view tab and then toggle the Hidden Items check box (checked, then&nbsp;unchecked) and compare the contents that are visible to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For illustration purposes I used the Public account folder&nbsp;as an example to show the difference in appearance of a hidden and a non-hidden folder (if you view your Public account do not make any changes to it&nbsp;as this&nbsp;is a system account for system use only).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c96e51b-f420-47d6-a300-93e7d9cac733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c96e51b-f420-47d6-a300-93e7d9cac733" /></a></p>

<p>There are no hidden files in this account folder but you get the idea, any hidden files that are present in a folder will also appear or disappear depending on the Hidden items checkbox setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more help or have any questions or comments&nbsp;just&nbsp;let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,</p>

<h2>            How to delete the orginal User&#47;profile from my pc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop PC that I am giving to a friend.&nbsp; However, there are currently three Users on the pc (Using Windows 10)</p>
<p>How do I go about deleting two, and changing the Username on one.</p>
<p>The other two Users were created because the original (Administrator User) got corrupted and the only way I could access was by creating an additional user name and using THAT new one as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will deleting the two I do not need affect anything that I should not lose too?</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help you can offer.</p>
<p>I will delete all personal information, such as Outlook Accounts, games, Documents, etc. too.</p>
<p>

<h2>            ntoskrnl.exe BSOD issues Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>Lately I've had many BSODs due to the ntoskrnl.exe driver file. So I opted to repair windows because I want to keep all my applications and files. However it's been 5 days now since I did this&nbsp;re-install, and the BSODs have come back with a&nbsp;vengeance!
 It's getting annoying and I'd like to fix the problem, but I don't know what to do. I also would prefer not to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;all my applications because I only have 60GB of&nbsp;bandwidth&nbsp;in a month, and I have many large applications.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for the help, let me know if I need to include anything else. Thanks!</div>

It is often difficult to diagnose from a single DMP file (you cant spot trends, or confirm the problem) and yours is no exception.<br />
<br />
The problem is that a critical windows file was terminated.&nbsp; That could be malware, OS corruption, or a bad driver.&nbsp; My gut feeling tells me it is your Symantec and since that is the easiest thing to check I would do two things.<br />
<br />
First remove and replace Symantec with MSE and I would run a system file check to verify the OS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<div><b>Symantec&nbsp; is a frequent cause of BSOD's.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I would remove and replace it with Microsoft Security Essentials AT LEAST TO TEST<br />

            So I un-installed Norton and installed MSE. So far so good, haven't had a BSOD yet. I've run SFC four times now and I get a reply that it didn't find any integrity violations, which is good, right?&nbsp;

            So my PC ran great for about 5 hours today but I just got another BSOD. However this time it didn't write up a minidump. It wrote that it was preparing for one but then it just restarted without creating a file. It was quite odd...
<div>Anyway, Thanks for the help so far</div>

<p>I was attempting to set up a user acount for some teens and changed security settings for the above partitions. I can no longer access the information stored in each partition. I receive&nbsp;the following message. "&nbsp;Can't open access control&nbsp;ediitor. Access
 is denied. "</p>
<p>Initially I clicked "My Computer" , right clicked the individual drive logos and then clicked "Properties" and then the "Security" tab. The information before is no longer there so I can't reset to the original settings. Didn't write down the information
 at the time but there were 2 columns. I believe one said "allow" and the other "deny" . Three or four accounts were listed above the allow/deny column.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time I'll leave things alone as all was working great. OS is Windows 7 Home Premium</p>

<h2>            SD card gives &#34;Media is write protected&#34; when attempting to delete images</h2>
                    
<p>I have several SD cards which I&nbsp;have used without problem until I installed Windows 7 (Pro). Now when I try to move pictures from the SD card, the picture is copied but the computer refuses to delete the file off the SD card. The same happens when I use
 other digital camera cards. The message is always "Media is write protected". I have tried the same cards in&nbsp;a different computer running&nbsp;Windows XP. In XP the SD card works fine and I can delete and rewrite to the card without a problem. I can also use a
 USB memory stick without a problem. Its just the photo memory cards I am having issues with. I have tried the suggestions published on<a href="http://www.t3chworks.com/index.php?p=2_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.t3chworks.com/index.php?p=2_1</a>&nbsp;and I have messed about with
 the write protection tab on the disk with no effect.</p>

<p>SD cards are reknown for this porblem. Often its a physical thing rather than software.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p>- moving the lock switch from lock to unlock 3 times leaving it in the unlock position for at least 30 seconds.</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>- putting a thin strip of tape over the lock switch (don't cover the metal contacts on the other side though)</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>- putting a thin strip of tape over the little notch on the opposite side of the card to thelock switch (don't cover the metal contacts on the other&nbsp; side&nbsp;though)</p>
<p>The reader may also be at fault as the write detector is not robust - its worse than the old floppy disks. Try you card in someone elses reader to rule this out. This was my problem and it cost only a few pounds to buy a USB thumb reader.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, 10586 - Error 0xc1900107</h2>
                    So today the big Fall update came out and I wanted to install it so after over 2 hours of my slow internet downloading everything I need and installing it I was given a message that I need to restart my PC to finish everything up. So I did and while restarting
 it put me into "Updating Windows" screen where at around 18% my PC restarted and gave me the message "Rolling back to your previous version of Windows..." after I got back into my Windows Update I was given a message "Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, version 1511,
 10586 - Error 0xc1900107". Anyway to fix this?

<h2>            Missing PDF Files... Once I create a PDF file they show up in a &#34;browse&#34; dialog box, but when I go to the specified folder location, they are not there. </h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 7 and have tried creating PDF documents with both the software that I purchased as well as the built in "Docu Driver" When I print to these "printers" to convert the file into a PDF file, I'm able to save the file
 in a specified location. However, when I go to that location to open the file, it isn't there. So I attempt to reprint the documents. BUT when I go to reprint the pdf'd document and the browse dialog box opens, it shows the previous file there. Again, when
 I go back to the location, it's not. How do I correct this? I use my pdf converters like water for my clients, so it's very essential to my day to day business needs. Thanks!</p>

<h3> duane lewis - london canada  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHKDSK PROBLEM-INSUFFICIENT DISK SPACE TO RECOVER LOST DATA-HELP PLEASE&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello people,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first use of the "Community", hoping you can help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used a Western Digital External Hard Drive (1TB) for storing important information from a number of laptops over the last few years. I add the data&nbsp;using original file structures (folder trees, files), usually from&nbsp;the highest appropriate folder,
 then&nbsp;after copying them from laptop to the WD HD, I delete them from my laptop for space and performance improvements. Current laptop is Sony Vaio, Intel I5 core, Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, I have stored literally thousands of family/travel/cruise pictures, MP3 music files, videos taken on a number of different cameras, etc. Let's just say the data represents a good portion for my last ten years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROBLEM OCCURED SEPTEMBER 29 2013 ... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was prompted by the "system" to consider running CHKDSK because there were (not exact quote) "some problems with the files or file directories or structures" that could possibly be fixed/improved. I had put it off previously because there were options
 to essential "Yes, do it now" or "No, do it later". I had time so clicked "do it now", then was presented with the choice of pre-checked box "Automatically Fix File System Errors" and the unchecked "Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors" which I decided
 to check since I'd be spending the wait time anyway. There was no indication or warning that this could be a potentially "data destroying" process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I watched the progress bar, knowing the HD had about 700-800 GB of data already stored. After a couple of hours, bar was only about 1/3 over, I looked and it suddenly jumped back to the left, beginning of bar and began doing some other stuff (not fully completed,
 I guess) and then the bar quickly jumped all the way over and I got a screen report about "Insufficient disk space for recovery of lost data", with some statistics about partition sizes, allocation sizes, etc etc. .... I don't think I have or can get a copy,
 but maybe I can. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I closed the screen, then did a "Windows Explorer" open on the HD (Letter H:). The first 8-10 folders appeared to be there (along with the subfolder trees and files of various types), then most of the balance of the entire drive root directory contained
 only "blank icons" for the high-level folder names with no data or subfolder trees present, let alone the data files. I discovered by "Tools", "Folder Options", "View", "Show Hidden" that CHKDSK had created a number of "FOUND" folders .... "&nbsp;H:\FOUND.000-.003\FILE0xxxx.CHK-FILE0zzzz.CHK"
 where each filename is a separate file which I assume had been lost or orphaned somehow and, if CHKDSK had completed fully and had sufficient space to recover, would have eventually been recovered and restructured within the appropriate file folders and folder
 trees. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, WHAT USED TO BE PERFECTLY GOOD PHOTOS, MP3, MPG FILES ETC ..... now are virtually unreadable .CHK files, with no visible, original filename or visible foldertree information. In an attempt at opening the .CHK files, I (regrettably) changed the "default
 program allocation" to "Windows Photo Viewer" in the Control Panel tool and was able to open and view some of the .CHK files as pictures (originally in .JPG format).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have unplugged the WD HD and left it alone at this point. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT ... WOULD LIKE TO FINISH THIS JOB WITHOUT LOSING MY DATA ..... I CAN WORK AT IT OVER TIME BUT QUICK, AUTOMATED SOLUTION WOULD BE APPRECIATED.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How can I change my Window 7 "default program to open" back to its original "Unspecified Program" setting from "Windows Photo Viewer"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If I purchase (let's say) a 3TB WD HD and copy my existing 1TB (screwed-up, partially converted and recovered data) exactly as is onto a virgin 3 TB drive, would I be able to successfully complete the original CHKDSK attempt (with the additional space
 on the 3 TB drive?&nbsp;&nbsp; Presumably, CHKDSK would examine the new drive (as it did on the original), find a whole bunch of data that it can read, recognize and recover, rebuild into it's original condition, with file errors corrected, directory/folder structures
 reclaimed/renamed and filenames back to original?&nbsp; OR AM I JUST BEING AN OPTIMIST?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ANY ADVICE, EXPERIENCE, SUGGESTION IS WELCOME. I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THIS DATA PERMANENTLY AND WOULD PREFER AN AUTOMATED RECOVERY PROCESS (WHO BETTER THAN WINDOWS CHKDSK?). I did some research and there appear to be some programs out there that can be used
 but they only work with the .CHK files and labels in their current state (whatever that is).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP ME, SOMEONE ..... I AM DESPERATE AND TRYING TO AVOID WEEKS/MONTHS OF RESTORATION, HUMAN EYEBALL OPENING OF ONE FILE AT A TIME FROM .CHK RECORDS ....</p>

Any failures even if it passed the second time are indicative of hard disk failure. I would back up any important data and start replacing the drive ASAP.<br />

            That looks more like it's trying to install C++ ( <i>'please wait... configures'</i> &amp; 'error... writing installation' ).<br />
It may be trying to use the <i>Page File</i> (Virtual Memory) while it installs. <br />
Have you disabled the Page File?<br />
<br />
Also - 8GB is not really much HDD space. Windows requires 15% free space for the defragmenter<br />
to run. I don't know if it requires that much space for anything else though.<br />

<h2>            How do you install a theme pack in Windows XP</h2>
                    <br />
I downloaded 5 theme packs from Microsoft's web site. It says they are for all windows operating systems from XP up to 7, but my system does not recognize these files.<br />
When i double click the icon it says windows dose not recognize this file, then it sends me to the Microsoft site where i downloaded them from.<br />
The directions say double click on the icon and follow the directions. it also says there is no support for themes.<br />
<br />
So how do i install these theme packs?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Missing Unicode Star after update to 2018 October</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've just updated to Windows 10 October 2018 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that one of my applications which uses the Unicode U+2606 White Star (‚òÜ) no longer displays the symbol. After some investigation, it appears that while applications like Edge, Chrome, Telegram, etc display the symbol, Win32/WinForm applications
 (such as Run) do not display the symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symbol is still present in Segoe UI Symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone able to reproduce this? Trying to check if it is an issue with my environment.</p>

</p><p>Will do, thanks. Just wanted to make sure it wasn't isolated to my environment before submitting. And I can't update my other devices now because I use an application that heavily relies on the Unicode set.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem here. After 1809 update, my foobar2000 (audio player) shows squares signs instead of musical notes (U+266A). When copied in foobar2000 conf window, it's replaced by a square sign (and a bunch of other characters behave the same, probably all
 symbols).</p>

<p>I had to clean reinstall windows 7, upgrade to 8, 10 then to find out they messed up on the 2018 fall release, and it's not me somehow messed up something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information I found is that, let say if you have a folder with the star symbol (which I uses with Japanese mostly), you see this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76595032-811b-45e4-abe5-16016a213f37?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76595032-811b-45e4-abe5-16016a213f37?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But, if you do a search, it shows up properly</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1414c0a1-8731-460d-b192-89eb77f5f36c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1414c0a1-8731-460d-b192-89eb77f5f36c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Btw, within browser it's fine, like this</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3757a37-b2c6-43cc-b5c5-1e9b99070f00?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3757a37-b2c6-43cc-b5c5-1e9b99070f00?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you can notice is that the font style seems to be different, by looking at the Japanese characters.</p>

<p>After trying for a few days (and wasted a whole of time), I had to do what others did in the above comments and had to clean install into 1803, starting all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this, I found out it's very, very, VERY difficult to block the update pushes from Microsoft (which wasted another few hours trying to find solution).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am super pissed at Microsoft right now because they have pushed out faulty software, and forces you to use their faulty software regardless of your intention.&nbsp; It's only a matter of time when their method affects major businesses.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a bug brought by the 1809 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have exactly the same problem in Lightroom 8.1. Before the upgrade I had a lot of collections containing the black star symbol, perfectly displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all of those collections names are replaced with those squares...</p>
<p>It seems that this upgrade is worst than the things it should fix !</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            File icons don&#39;t match program</h2>
                    <p>I recently had occasion to uninstall Google Chrome, using Revo Uninstaller, and run a bunch of cleaner type programs, to try to get rid of an issue I was facing with said browser (not malware related AFAIK).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards I reinstalled Chrome and set it as the default for all file types and protocols that &nbsp;it can open, using the Set Default Program item under Default Programs in the Control panel (because the Windows 10 Settings app's "Choose default applications"
 things doesn't appear to actually do anything most of the time). I noticed that this had associated the .PDF file type with Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use PDF-XChange viewer to read PDFs so I tried to change this following the same method. This worked correctly in that the files now open with the correct viewer, but the icons used for that file type is still marked as opening with Chrome! I notice that
 if I look at the .pdf. item under the Set Associations item also under Default Programs in the Control panel, that while the Current Default is listed as PDF-XChange Viewer, the description is still listed as Chrome HTML Document. Also, in Windows Explorer
 the Type details column lists Chrome HTML Document for PDF files. The correct icons do show in one single place that I have noticed, that being the open file dialog box (launched from any program, including Chrome!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously something that should be getting set here isn't. How can I fix this? I have tried restarting the PC to no effect.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image below shows a PDF on the desktop (to the left) that shows a preview thumbnail of the PDF but incorrectly shows it as opening with Chrome. It also shows a PDF file without preview in the Windows Explorer window that shows as a Chrome file type icon
 and Chrome HTML Document in the Type column. To the bottom there is the Set Associations panel showing that the default program has indeed been set to PDFX-Change Viewer, but that the Description and icon are still set to Chrome.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>NOTE: this does appear to be a windows problem rather than a Chrome problem as I just tried using the "Open with.." option to change the default to MS Edge, which worked correctly - everything changed over to Edge. But using the same method to chenge to
 the viewer resulted in the same as outlined above, but with Edge instead of Chrome.</p>

<h2>            How to create a new backup with &#34;Backup and Restore&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running withdows 10,&nbsp; with daily backup using&nbsp; "Windows 7 Backup and Restore".&nbsp; The backup includes: "All users", both hard drives and a system image., and each night at 2am it adds new files for that date. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been running for awhile and the external drive I'm using is filling up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to start a new backup on the same external drive (which will be much smaller initially) and then delete the old, very large, backup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I see no way to do this using the "Backup and Restore" program.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I could simply delete the old backup and then start again,&nbsp; but that would leave me defenseless until the new backup was generated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could copy the current backup to another drive,&nbsp; and then delete it on the current drive.&nbsp; But again, it is large, and I'd have to buy another drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You may delete the old backup, then start over again. However, this may not ensure the safety of your files. To guarantee that you're not going to lose any of your files, the best option is to have another drive to store the current backup.
<br />

 work properly (or at all) and when it fails to work there is no official solution.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 wifi won&#39;t connect after waking from sleep.</h2>
                    <p>HP Envy 15-3247NR</p>
<p>Recently upgraded to windows 8 pro from windows 7 and I found that with 8 I could not connect to any wireless network after the computer has been in sleep mode. I've tried everything. Updated drivers, bios, intel. Everything is as it should be, but no matter
 what, the wifi option stays grayed out whether airplane mode is on or off. I really want to fix this problem, please help.</p>

            Hi <br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting in Microsoft community<br />
<br />
As i read out complete question ,,You did not mentioned what step you have taken to fix the isuse<br />
Basically this issue happen due to setting in Wifi<br />
<br />
Go to device manager by right click on computer section,<br />
And go to Ethernet wifi driver properties from list of devices,<br />
after going to properties the last TAB will be power management ,Click on that and you will get two option like
<br />
<br />
""Allow this computer to turn off wifi to save power""<br />
<br />
Just uncheck it and try again<br />
<br />
And get back here<br />

<h2>            removable hard drive not activating - M4A89GTD PRO&#47;USB3 Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi - This is a little bit of a strange one for me, unusual for me to be unable to solve an issue like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using a drive tray to hotswap drives for years on Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS M4A89GTD PRO/USB3</p>
<p>AMD Phenom II X4</p>
<p>12GB ram</p>
<p>2 internal SATA</p>
<p>1 drive tray internal SATA (for hotswapping)</p>
<p>(all drive slots are AHCI in BIOS)</p>
<p>AMD 890GX/SB850 chipset</p>
<p>JMixron JMB361 PATA/SATA controller (required for hotswapping the eSATA)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 8.0 Pro (with free upgrade to 8.1 installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had Vista Ultimate (x64), upgraded to Win 8.1 with save documents option.</p>
<p>Was warned I might need to get a missing driver from ASUS, for the ATK temp sensors</p>
<p>Did that, used the Win7 x64 one, hotswapping worked fine.</p>
<p>no drive in tray, start Win 8.1 </p>
<p>After working for a while, put in drive Y, boots up, Explorer loads it in</p>
<p>Work, save stuff, remove drive Y, explorer removes it</p>
<p>drive Z in, explorer sees it, copy things over, work on databases, drive Z out</p>
drive Y back in, copy things over, do backups (Synctoy), drive out
<p>
</p><p>Lost the boot sector, "Missing Operating System"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled Vista, updated until I could get the Microsoft site to allow me to upgrade</p>
<p>Upgraded to 8.0, updated until finished - wiped drive, clean install</p>
<p>Upgraded to 8.1, installed AMD chipset drivers &amp; other basic hardware not installed by windows once first set of updates were through</p>
<p>(NIC, GRID+, AMD graphics &amp; chipset)</p>
<p>Updated until finished</p>
<p>carried on installing stuff</p>
<p>Now, after the clean install, this does not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using all three different AHCI drivers (Win native, AMD chipset, ASUS ones)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just put in the JMicron Win 7 x64 eSATA drivers, as I thought that might affect hotswapping the standard SATA, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a few of the recommended options, checking for hidden empty drives, turning off fast-start etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. drive left in tray at boot:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows sees it ok.</p>
<p>If I remove the drive, Windows thinks it is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Options tested:</p>
<p>1. If I put the drive in, everything carries on as normal.</p>
<p>2. If I don't put the drive in and try and access it via Win Explorer, it will go through some levels of directories and display the contents until it has to read a new one and then Win Explorer realises it's gone and disables it after 60 secs of trying&nbsp;
 -&nbsp; now it will not be seen if put back in (greyed out in device manager when "whos hidden")</p>
<p>3. If I put in drive Y, then take it out and put X back in, it carries on as if nothing had happened (I don't start explorer in-between)</p>
<p>4. I have not tried putting in drive Y and seeing if it thinks it is drive X - that would be too risky even for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. drive not in tray at boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put in drive, Windows does nothing.</p>
<p>Disk management has nothing</p>
<p>Although drive X is there in device manager (when "show hidden") it is still greyed out and details say it is missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is as if the BIOS is working AHCI mode fine, allowing the drive to be popped in and out, but Windows will only see it as being back in if it is there on boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bear in mind that this is a hard-wired drive-tray, on 0,0 which is a standard SATA that has worked fine in Vista Ult, Win7 x64 (same internals machine) and on the first install of 8.0 and 8.1</p>

            <p>Hi Ratan, and thx for the time taken to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No hardware has changed, and the drives always have their letters assigned correctly (and their correct names) when Windows sees them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Data2 (A:) (drivetray)</p>
<p>Bups1 (Z:)</p>
<p>Bups2 (S:)</p>
<p>System2 (X:) (drivetray)</p>
<p>Data Drive (T:) (internal)</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said previously, they are only offline if I boot without one of them in the drivetray. Putting them in the drive tray once Windows is started (without a drive in the tray at boot), does not make the disk appear, Windows thinks they are not present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Vista and Win7 (and I think in Win 8.1 previous build) the drives were shown in Disk management as offline. Now we have all these crazy shadow volumes - as you can see they are not there in disk management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pics are of my system booted without a drive in the tray, and with the WDC WD2500AAJS-00TA0 drive in the tray after boot. As you can see, device manager lists it as; "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I leave it in and reboot, it will be in Windows Explorer as "System2 (X:)"</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS is fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very concerned that the chipset driver you are suggesting I install is very old - 2010, whereas the one I have now is from 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The directory structure is different, as is the way it refers to itself as an ATI product and tries to create ATI directories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely though, the files inside the zip are new. Thanks for taking the time to do that, but I cannot proceed with that without knowing exactly why you would want me to try chipset drivers that were written just as WIn7 was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running 14.12 catalyst drivers (both chipset and graphics) - that one looks like it's from Feb 2010 - is this by any chance the one off the ASUS website that has not been updated since 2010?</p>

</p><p>I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>delete "UpperFilters" and "LowerFilters</strong>" registry value in the registry editor. To do this, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + R keys</strong>, type <strong>regedit</strong> in the run window and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Locate the following registry sub-key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Right click "<strong>UpperFilters</strong>", click <strong>delete </strong>
and then click <strong>yes.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Similarly, right click "<strong>LowerFilters</strong>", click <strong>delete
</strong>and then click <strong>yes</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Close registry editor and restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
