    <title>Can I REMOVE and then ADD back my outlook.com Exchange ActiveSync - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I REMOVE and then ADD back my outlook.com Exchange ActiveSync address without doing anything else&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My outlook.com address has a problem in my Outlook 2013. I've been working on my Outlook in another Question. So my solution to try&nbsp;to fix this issue is to Remove this address and then to add it as New and see if that fixes it. At File &gt; Account Settings
 &gt; Account Settings, you can see in this image that there isn't any CHANGE FOLDER icon like all of the other addresses have where they also list the folder that new messages are delivered to.&nbsp;You can see here that it says something different when I hilite that
 address and nothing is listed as to where new messages are saved. </p>
<p>But&nbsp;if I try to REMOVE the outlook.com Exchange ActiveSync address, I get this warning pop up saying: Careful, if you remove this account, its offline cached content will be deleted. Learn how to make a backup of the offline .ost file.</p>
<p>This account isn't my Default address. I do use a Windows 8.1 smartphone that seems to share this same outlook.com address.
</p>
<p>But I have this whole thing set up in my Outlook 2013 with a PST and not an OST. So does this matter at all? Can't I just do it?</p>
<p>I need to give this a try since as you can see in this image, this address in my Outlook 2013 is broken. It doesn't display any location down after Selected account delivers new messages to the following location. Nor does it even get any emails that I send
 to that address even though I do get them on my smartphone. </p>

<p><em><strong>If I click on Change and Next&nbsp;for that address, I see this but obviously it is broken since I'm not even getting any new emails in my Inbox that are sent to that address:</strong></em></p>

            <p>Palcouk, I seem to remember seeing it say Outlook Preview somewhere when I would log in with Internet Explorer in the recent past which I hardly ever do since I'm a big fan of Outlook. That's why I have it set up with my other email addresses. That's also
 why I insist on using a Windows smartphone and not some iPhone or Android 'piece'. But when I just looked on the main screen after logging in, I don't see it say Outlook Preview anywhere. I forget where it had said that. Here's a screenshot. I'm ready to do
 this but this cache thing has been worrying me. Can you take a quick look at this and tell me if I'm missing it or where it would be?</p>

            <p>Harsha, when you say "<span>Make sure to back up the data in Outlook that is not seen in the outlook.com web mail",
<strong>are you talking about just the email in the Inbox? </strong><br />
Since I also use a Windows 8.1 smartphone, I want everything the same everywhere. I don't really care too much about the emails that I put into custom folders when I'm on Outlook 2013 on my PC. That's my main storage area.
</span></p>
<p><span>But for sure I want my Contacts the same on both and I'd sure like my Appointments to be the same also.</span></p>
<p><span>I'd heard somewhere here recently that backing up your PST data file doesn't copy everything and that you should Copy it instead. This is confusing to me and worries me too. I don't understand that.
<strong>Could you give me any examples of what a backup might not save or was that person wrong in saying that?</strong></span></p>
<p>EDITED IN:</p>
<p>I went ahead and Removed that outlook.com address from my Outlook 2013 and then I added it back in with the Manual setup or additional server types and I picked the center one. It is somewhat tricky to figure out if the 1st or 2nd one was the right one to
 use but when I saw the 2nd one saying outlook.com, I knew that it was the right one.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=66c8fedb-a14a-48d0-a21e-d48bf1c540fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d66c8fedb-a14a-48d0-a21e-d48bf1c540fa" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still a little confused if things are OK as I have them. My Outlook stores everything in a PST that all of the other 6 addresses show below this box when I hilite them but this outlook.com address shows an OST instead. Should I be concerned? It doesn't
 have a button like all of the other 6 accounts have to Change Folder which is where they all now point to my PST. So, is this OK?</p>
<p>I don't really care about stuff in the Inbox. I have folders that I move any emails into that I want to save. So, I assume my custom folders are all safely stored in my PST along with my Contacts, Appointments and Tasks. Right?</p>

<p>Did you install the 64bit version? You can only export from live mail to the 32bit version of Office.

<h2>            move Office Suite to a new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Office Suite on my current laptop and looking to purchase a newer faster one. I bought the download version of Office and Office Depot installed it when they set up my new computer. I don't have the product key code or anything other than a receipt
 showing where I paid Office Depot for the download. Is it possible to transfer that to another laptop so I don't have to purchase it again? I use it regularly for my personal finances so Excel is a must for me. This will determine how much I can spend on a
 new laptop so I need to know in advance. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hi Rachel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transferring of Office suites depend on the product itself. When you say download version, is this Office 365 or the one time-payment Office 2016? And how did the store install? Did it come with a box or they just installed it directly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is directly downloaded from the Microsoft Store, you would need a Microsoft Account that will be associated with the Office suite. This will be your "product key" eliminating the need for the 25-character key that was commonly used in the past. If
 this is the case, you just need to uninstall Office then reinstall it to the new computer. Once installed, just log in within the app to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also applies to Office 365 Personal. However, if you have Office 365 Home, this allows you to install the same subscription up to 5 computers thus, eliminating the need to uninstall the suite from the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these don't work for you, and the installation asks for a regular 25-character key, it would be best to contact the store to get your product's product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need further help.</p>
<p>

            It was a one time payment with an install for one computer. I logged in and can see he product key and instell button. Office depot didnt give me a box or anything related so im glad that information is stored in here. Hopefully i csn just uninstsll and
 instal on the new one. Going to have my IT guy at work help pick one out becuase ive been very unhappy with the one i got from office depot and its barely a year old. Thanks for your help!&nbsp;

                    Hi, I have a Nokia Lumia 630 and wish to transfer several hundred SMS&nbsp;(so of which are extremely long in content)&nbsp;from my phone to my laptop, as the contents are required for a potential court case. Is there a simple way to transfer this - as I really
 wish to avoid manually typing them out and signing a sworn affidavit as to their authenticity!

            <p>There are a few apps in the app store that will allow you to do this. If you search for "Message backup" the ones compatible with your phone should be listed. In general when one of the applications is run they will copy your text messages to the memory
 card on your phone. You can connect your device to your computer and copy the file off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to do some editing of the file once it's copied, but that is still better than writing them all down manually.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi Irshad,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hiding the tables and queries is not the best way to do it. You should hide the Database Window or Navigation Pane (depending on which version you have). Check the Options dialog for the property to do so.</div>

    <title>How can I disable reminders for shared calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantmacmanus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I disable reminders for shared calendars</h2>
                    <p>We installed Outlook for 365 on a couple of Macs and on each machine we are welcomed with a growing set of dozens of reminders from&nbsp;the shared calendars that cannot be dismissed and keep going off. We cannot turn off reminders for the shared calendars anywhere
 in the new Outlook. This is not an issue on Outlook 2011 and is not an issue on any of the Windows machines running various versions of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

            It's good to share this information with your fellow users here in the forum, but if you want Microsoft to know about the problem, use the Smile button (upper right corner of the Outlook window), or Help &gt; Send Feedback. Microsoft provides these forums
 for us, but doesn't read the messages here. Feedback submitted using the feedback form goes to the product team.

<h3> whburling  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Change W10 default folder names &#40;ie &#34;Documents&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple computers on my LAN.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect to OneDrive, I like to quickly and easily see which computer the folder is on.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Documents" is too vague.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change a computer's Documents folder name so that the computer name is part of the folder name. Ie: Mist Documents</p>
<p>
</p><p>In File explorer there is no rename command.&nbsp; If I look at properties the folder name is grayed out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps if I "move" the files that are currently in Documents into a folder that I create called Mist Documents, and delete "Documents" I can achieve my objective.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I do the above, I wanted to make sure there was not a more direct method (as moving files to just change a file name is very indirect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a location in my Registry that holds the actual file name&nbsp; of the default folders?&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the files are on the same partition they will not be physically moved...</p>
<p>Just their address as to their location will change...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you could do as you suggest and Change Location to a new folder in the Properties of the Documents folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise that you don't then delete Documents... that could be a disaster in the future...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, in the Properties of the folder there will be a check box at the bottom of the window for "HIDDEN"... which will make this a Hidden Folder that should no longer appear on your Network..</p>

<h2>            FEEDBACK&#58;     Bing Audio&#47;Bing Music &#43; Bing Smart Search</h2>
                    <p>I want to suggest a feature that has been on Windows Phone for years, the ability to search music in Zune/Xbox Music by letting the device listen to surrounding music and finding it in the Zune Marketplace/Xbox Music store, I've already made a concept, one
 is integrating it directly into Windows' Bing Smart Search.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e392dac4-5bce-4458-a542-212f854b64ef" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this version you can simply open <em>Bing Smart Search</em>, and click on the Arrow and select music (which will be listed with Everywhere, Settings, Files, Web Images, and Web Videos), and it will search for the song in Xbox Music and allows the user
 to play it with the Xbox Music Radio (formerly SmartD.J.), another suggestion might be to include 3rd party software platforms if/when they're installed like Spotify, iTunes, Google Play Music, Pandora, Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image of the band is used to represent a song playing either on your P.C. or near your P.C. which Bing Audio/Bing Music will hear with your P.C.'s microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other suggestion is...</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab6fa3fc-e33b-4735-b7a2-f856317ad01f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>integrating Bing Audio/Bing Music directly into<em> Xbox Music </em>(and maybe also Xbox Video to search for music video's), and maybe also integrating this directly into Internet Explorer as an add-on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my reasons why it would be better suited in <strong>Bing Smart Search</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Integrating it in Bing Smart Search will boost the usability of the built-in Bing applications and search capabilities, and will make it more competitive compared the built-in search functionality on other platforms. Bing Smart Search for Windows and Bing
 Smart Search for Windows Phone should also resemble each other more, and will give a more seamless experience between both platforms. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my reasons why it would be better suited in <strong>Xbox Music</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If integrated with Xbox Music it could be more easily ported to the Xbox Music apps on Android and iO.S. where it could gain ground on the competition by offering&nbsp;a service that most others don't. Bing Audio/Bing Music in the Android and iO.S. apps of Xbox
 Music will also eliminate the need for other music recognition software. Another advantage that Xbox Music offers over Bing Smart Search is that updating Xbox Music can go directly from the Windows Store, Google Play, Apple App Store, and Windows Phone Store,
 while Bing Smart Search is updated via Windows and less frequently, thus allowing bug fixes and improvements to ship easier.</p>

    <title>E71 Frozen on Black Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yodabeesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            E71 Frozen on Black Screen</h2>
                    For some odd reason today out of nowhere, my e71 has frozen on a completely black screen. I can tell that the phone is on (the key pad is illuminated and the lcd is on... just black.)<br />
<br />
I tried turning it off with the red power button at the top. Doesn't respond.<br />
<br />
I took the battery out was able to shut the unit off. When I replaced the battery and turned the phone on, the black screen comes back.<br />
<br />
I tried to connect and run a sync to see what would happen, but the phone is not detected.<br />
<br />
I also plugged in the charger while the phone was off, but it just brought up the black screen.<br />
<br />
The keys are non-responsive to any commands (menus, speed dial, etc.)<br />
<br />
Any help or advice would be immensely appreciated!!!

            I'd get in touch with the flagship store in NY<br />
<a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/A4411005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokiausa.com/A4411005</a><br />
<br />
And ask them for a reputable service center address, if they know one that is.<br />
<br />
Or you could try and format it this way<br />
'Press and hold Green, * and 3 and keep them held whilst powering on and for a few seconds after, if kept pressed this formats without asking for Security Code confirmation'<br />
<br />
That might fix it but you will lose everything on the phone.

<p>I would try initally the hard reset (hold down 3 * and Green Call key and power up the handset)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can get the handset working then I would then reinstall the software using the Nokia Software Updater, both of these will erase the handset, so you will loose everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the handset is not responding at all then you should take it to the nearest Nokia Care point and have them take a look at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find care points from this thread:</p>
<p>/discussions/board/message?board.id=topfaq&amp;thread.id=3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine does not exhibit any of these problems.</p>

<p>I have the same problem...I can still make and recieve calls on mine too, I tried a hard reset and nothing changed, but hard resetting deleted all of my contacts so now I have no way&nbsp; of knowing who is calling lol. I would say time to talk to Nokia or time

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925 &#40;and probably other devices&#41; storage problem</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dear fellow Windows Phone users,</p>
<p>I am a Nokia Lumia 925 user for about 4 months now.</p>
<p>Whilst it was a great change for me, being an Android user till then, I was positively surprised with the power of Nokia's Lumia 925.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I experienced bugs now and then but nothing I couldn't fix or find a workaround, but alas the Windows Phone is a relatively new kid on the block.</p>
<p>Many bugs were fixed with the introduction of the WP8 update 3 and I am, as a user, really satisfied with the implemented improvements and frankly can't wait for the upcoming Windows Phone 8.1 update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting this all aside I have for the past 3 weeks witnessed a lingering problem that was quite unusual.</p>
<p>Namely the storage on my phone (16GB internal storage) was unusually low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The storage monitoring section of the options menu informed me that I had:</p>
<p>356.04 mb of free memory and ~8 GB of taken memory.</p>
<p>It made no sense to me, even considering that the OS was taking about 2.9 GB of storage, but even then that size was neatly listed and taken in to consideration in the 8 GB.</p>
<p>The storage breakdown showed that about 4 or 5 GB of storage were missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few days of use I came to this sight as I plugged my phone into the PC. The Windows Phone app provided me with an answer and located the missing memory...<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfb0779b-91d9-416c-9145-78d36218f9cf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can imagine my surprise when I first saw this screen... almost 5GB were in a so-called "other" category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 3 hours of searching for a possible solution I was left with no other choice but to hard reset the phone.</p>
<p>The lost storage space was once again available and I continued my use of the device normally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is a remainder to the Developers that the problem was not fixed in the Update 3 and that I as an user would expect this problem to be processed in the upcoming update 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for reading my post and thanks to the developers&nbsp;for continuously improving our Windows Phone experience,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kenan IbrahimagiÄ</p>

            <p>If you have email attachments or text messages with pictures, this is in other files.</p>
<p>App and game data is in other.</p>
<p>Emails are stored in other. Texts are stored in other.</p>
<p>Uploading pictures to onedrive increases other, pictures are cached.</p>
<p>Move pics and viceos to your PC instead of skydrive</p>
<p>Login to your SkyDrive using a browser and move the uploaded files from their current folder to any other folder.</p>
<p>Picture thumbnails in other, like camera roll</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a bug. The size of the file depends on how you use your phone.</p>

            <p>I understand that, but the fact that after I have reset my phone and got back all my messages and e-mails and still have a lot of space available does characterise the situation as not optimal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it isn't a bug per-say but I should have the ability to delete all these cached files and uncharacterised files. And concerning the photos I only took about 40.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't a single excuse to describe this as standard or functional.</p>

<h2>            HTC One M8 - Upgrade to Windows Mobile 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased the HTC One M8.&nbsp; Fabulous phone.&nbsp; However, I cannot update the phone to Windows 10?&nbsp; I am seeing in my research that MS has not released it to HTC?&nbsp; WOW!&nbsp; Is that some sort of Anti-trust?&nbsp; I am going to contact Amazon and file a formal complaint.&nbsp;
 Possibly returning the phone as well.&nbsp; I am an avid MS user, but very disappointed in MS.&nbsp; Does anyone have any info on this?&nbsp; Is MS going to roll this out to HTC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

            <p>Having just purchased the phone, the history of WP10 and the insider program is in the past.</p>
<p>With this program M8 users could install preview builds of WP10 and give feedback as to the experience. This is what MS used to determine which phones could reliably use the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see some of the user experiences of WP10 on the M8&nbsp;look here, 238 posts.

http://forums.windowscentral.com/htc-one-m8-windows/341350-10.htm</a></p>
<p>These are some of the reasons WP10 was not made available to all M8 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The M8 is not on the list of phones that can be updated to WP10 and this will probably not change.</p>
<p>The list of phones that can be updated has been available for several months.</p>

            <p>No, as that requires scripting which is blocked in Outlook for good reasons.</p>
<p>If you want to send an informational message to your users and they don't know how to open a specific location which contains a variable, you could create a special support web page&nbsp;which resolves it for the user and either display the link or redirect the
 user to it. In that case the security settings for the Internet browser and the underlying OS will apply.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I discover some of our computer, when I click the start menu, it doesn't show any action, only right click is allowed.</p>
<p>

<p>I do not know the ins and outs of the Enterprise version.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Have you thought of upgrading to 1709?</p>
<p>Are you activated?&nbsp; Do you handle the activation or does someone else in the organization handle it?</p>
