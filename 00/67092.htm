<h2>            Can&#39;t disable press-and-hold-right-click functionality in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I do not want to use press and hold, so I have unchecked the enable button in Pen and touch, But the function is still active.</p>
<p><br />
I have also gone into the group settings editor and disabled press and hold there, but STILL press and hold is functional but my right click barrel button is not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems despite having settings to disable press-and-hold, Windows 10 will not allow me to turn off this functionality.</p>
<p><br />
I have tried two other pens of the same model to rule out there being some malfunction on the pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
In an effort to block Windows' own pen/tablet drivers from interfering with my Wacom driver (which is up to date), I used the groups settings editor to disable windows ink, flicks, and every other tablet pc driver function native to windows that I could find.
 Still no change in behavior.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If anyone can help me I'd be quite grateful. I just want to turn off this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
P.S. See screenshots for proof of my taking steps to disable "press and hold for right-clicking"</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide you the accurate resolution in disabling press-and-hold-right-click functionality in Windows 10, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you able to use the press-and-hold functionality before?</li><li>Which build and version of Windows 10 are you using?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>I first noticed the issue after reading that Windows Tablet PC settings are responsible for the little circles that often interfere with normal function of Wacom tablets in visual arts softwares. I read that disabling press-and-hold can help correct some
 of the issues that pop up. But, even following instructions to disable it, I cannot seem to make it stop.<br />
<br />
I have never wanted to use press-and-hold functionality. I assume I was able to use it before but I have never tried to deliberately use it. It happens by accident and I would like that to stop.<br />
<br />
When looking at the 'about' section in settings it says:<br />
<br />
Windows specifcations:<br />
Edition: Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Version 1709<br />
Os Build 16299.192</p>

            For the record, this has been completely fruitless and unhelpful so far. I expected more from Microsoft's help staff than to pass the buck and leave it at that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is a Microsoft OS feature that I'm having issues with, not a feature of the pen device I'm using. For you to offer no attempt at a solution whatsoever on the Microsoft side is very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Also I had the latest drivers for my pen input devices installed and that was when I was noticing the issue with press-and-hold. I reverted my device drivers back to a previous version my co-worker has because they do not see this issue happening at their workstation
 with the same hardware. That didn't accomplish successfully disabling press and hold either. So, I've already attempted to resolve this on the device driver side of the equation.&nbsp;<br />

<p><del>Hello,</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>sadly I'm having the same issue here as described above on a fresh Windows 10 Pro installation.
<strong>Version 1803 (Build 17134.81)&nbsp;</strong></del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>To get rid of the Press &amp; Hold feature I already tried the following:&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>- Deactivated press &amp; hold via Pen &amp; Touch settings</del></p>
<p><del>- Disabling visual effects via&nbsp; Pen &amp; Touch settings</del></p>
<p><del>- Deactivated in registry (</del><em><del>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Wisp\Touch
<strong>TouchMode_hold = 0</strong></del>&nbsp;</em><del>)</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The issue still remains though.</del></p>
<p><del>Any update would be appreciated since I, like many others, use the tablet for work and the hold functionality is a real annoying and unneccesary hindrance.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE (SOLVED):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For those also having the issue, I found the solution for me in a conceptart forum.</p>
<p>Going trough the registry was the right approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to open the&nbsp;Registry-Editor:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press&nbsp;<strong>Winkey + R</strong></p>
<p>In the command line type&nbsp;<strong>regedit </strong>and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Wisp\Touch&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>There, change the following parameter from 1 to 3 by double clicking on it and entering the new value.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TouchMode_hold = 3&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to restart any running applications like Photoshop for them to apply the change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>- Michael<br />

<p>I just spent 20 minutes resetting my useless microsoft account password and setting up 2 factor authentication to say that you, Michael, are a bloody legend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked. It absolutely worked. Since I've "upgraded" to win10, my tablet has been doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, are you paying attention? This guy isn't even on your payroll, and he is fixing your stupid re-designs. Your two idiot reps are doing the idiot rep thing and telling people to update drives and blame the hardware. Honestly, f#ck you microsoft.
 You keep breaking **** by trying to re-invent **** that doesn't need your dipsh!t innovation. Screw you, really, get f#cked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael, thank you so much. I tried all the other fixes and nothing worked... leave it to this stupid company to require us to literally edit the fscking registry to fix their bullsh!t. Wisp? I don't want, don't need, and will never use Wisp... yet it highjacked
 my Wacom pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't some chinese drawing tablet from ebay.. this is fscking Wacom.. they pretty much invented this ****... and you, Microdickheads, you didn't even compatibility test for it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hate Apple.. but dealing with all your bullsh1t since I went to Win10 has me seriously reconsidering the "it just works" company.</p>

<h2>            Windows supplied apps&#47;search have stopped running&#47;intermittent start menu fail</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this is a problem that a lot of people have and, since it's pretty fundamental, I really wish MS would give us a real solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been very happy with Win 10 until this last couple of weeks. I had issues with the Search not working in the past, one fix was to kill the search app in Task Manager, then the task bar search would start again. At the moment I am running
<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>at frequent intervals, to get my Start Menu back. It gives no errors, but seems to kick start things sometimes. Today , finally too frustrated by calculator not working, I tried running the command</p>
<p><em>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</em></p>
<p>as per instructions in various places taken originally from an answer on here. I subsequently also checked the Read settings in the registry settings<em>,
</em>as per instructions on http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/fixing-windows-10-apps-wont-launch-or-hang-apps-splash-screen; but they were all OK. I ran the troubleshooter tool provided by yourselves, which said my issue was fixed, but its a tool for a similar
 but different issue, and it didn't fix it. I created a new user, and they work there. So it is definitely some sort of user settings issue, something that is getting wiped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now in the situation where the system - for my main MS user - does not understand/see any of its basic apps any more. If I look at the Lock Screen settings, all the icons are now X's<em>.
</em>If I click to select an app, this is what I see. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c70d2fc-42a0-4f3e-aa54-8f6b6db6d98e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c70d2fc-42a0-4f3e-aa54-8f6b6db6d98e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lot of things set against this user that would take me a long time to reset. This is my work machine. I really do not want to have to spend more hours on this, especially as it is more than likely going to happen again with any new user account
 I create. I want a fix. Can someone. Please. Help.</p>

<h2>            Task Manager Window Completely Blank</h2>
                    <p>For some unknown reason, my Task Manager window stopped working. Here is a picture of how it looks:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66543db2-5ba6-4e57-9017-8a5d00376ee3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried right clicking on the top left icon to "Restore", but the option is grayed-out. And here are the things i tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-System Restore.</p>
<p>-Uninstalled my Avast! Antivirus.</p>
<p>-Ran scans with Avast, Malwarebytes and Windows Defender.</p>
<p>-Disk Defragged.</p>
<p>-Checkdisk for errors.</p>
<p>-Left/right clicking on any part of the blank white space which supposed to be the Task Manager.</p>
<p>-Tried to open Task Manager via cmd and run prompts.</p>
<p>-Booted in Safe Mode, still the same.</p>
<p>-Boot time scan with Avast!</p>
<p>-Ccleaner registry clean-up</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is driving me crazy and i really don't want to re-install Windows as it is already around 10 days old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i do on these 10 days (to give you an idea which might have caused the issue):</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you have tried using different user account and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have tried most of the troubleshooting steps, I suggest you to try the below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>This issue seems to be occurred due to corrupted user profile, I suggest you to create new user account with different Microsoft account and check if it helps.</p>
<p>If you have already logged in with a Microsoft account, I suggest you to covert that Microsoft account into local account. Later login using newly created local account to create a different Microsoft account.</p>
<span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;To convert the account, you
 can do the following:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
 the right of the screen.</span></li><li>
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<strong><span>Sign out and Finish</span></strong>&nbsp;button.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Step 2:</strong></span><span><strong><span>Create
 new Microsoft account</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Refer:
</span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-my/windows-10/getstarted-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Sign in with a Microsoft account</span></span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong>Try to update the pending updates from both Microsoft and the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Kindly get back to us with an updated status of this issue for further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>I am really sorry but even after i followed these steps very carefully, i still have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, whenever i try sfc /scannow via cmd, it stops %50 and writes: </p>
<p>"windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation"<br />
</p>
<p>It is the same when i try it in the same in Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If SFC does not work, perform a DISM command itself:</p>
<p>DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /RESTOREHEALTH</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, I'm afraid that you've really tried&nbsp;most troubleshooting in getting this fixed. I suggest&nbsp;performing a Reset on your system and see if it works.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, it seems the only way is a system reset.. Thanks for the support. Is there any chance that this issue might be fixed with a future Windows 10 update? If so, i can live without Task Manager for a while.

            <p>Not sure actually, this is the first time I saw that kind of issue.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can use an alternative program like <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> as a replacement for Task Manager. Although, not really sure if it will actually work on Windows 10, but you can give it a shot..</p>

<p>Ive run into this issue in the past with a couple consoles Ive sent in. &nbsp;You can try calling the 1-800-4MY-XBOX number to see if they can help you out. &nbsp;More than likely, the console will be back in your hands before the website has been updated.</p>
<p>This has happened to me twice. &nbsp;Sitting at home wondering when I will see my box again and cant get any info on its status. &nbsp;next day, it was on my door step. &nbsp;If it has been gone for longer than 7-10 days, it will be arriving shortly. &nbsp;Just be patient.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1709 apps missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papiophidian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1709 apps missing</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I installed the fall update for windows 10.</p>
<p>I had high hopes for this but once I logged on, all of my synced data was lost. All of my desktop items were missing and next to all of my apps were missing including stock windows apps such as the windows store and calculator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to alleviate some of these issues, however. For the deleted stock apps, I just went to settings &gt; Apps &gt; advanced settings for individual apps and then reset their data. It made them pop back up on the start menu. Excluding a couple and most notably,
 Xbox and the Windows store. Which, I use both of those very frequently. I was able to get them open but I wasn't allowed to pin them to my task bar/ start menu. I also wasn't able to access the file location due to trusted installer status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wondered where my desktop items went so, I checked some file locations and saw that windows created a brand new account linked to my Microsoft account instead of using my old one that is also linked. So, I transferred over stuff which takes a considerable
 amount storage space and i'm reluctant to delete my old profile. to save space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Microsoft account themes and settings also didn't transfer over and I wouldn't be complaining about it if my PC's Windows version was registered. I have another PC which I use the old data from it to sync themes and such but it's not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to note is that I typed in cmd: net user</p>
<p>and it showed up with only one of my accounts (of 2. One being the one created and my old one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is if there is someway I can make all this work and go back to my old account or will I have to transfer everything and live with my new one and delete my old one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For version confirmation, my build is 1709, 16299.19<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>1. open windows store and apps by hitting (windows key+ R) then typing (wsreset) wait a few min. Then store will open. If you would like to open a app such as x-box just search it and press (launch)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. clean install windows (this will wipe all files and data)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. keep checking for windows updates</p>

<p>I work for an educational institute and our computers need to wipe user profiles after x days and we have found that it is when a user profile is wiped that on the next creation of their profile (next login) the apps are hit and miss, it could include missing
 the store, to edge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very frustrating considering this is vital for our computers to work properly in our environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you login for a fist time on any of our computers all is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only when the profile is deleted via group policy after x days

When I installed 1709 I too found that apps were missing, including the Store!&nbsp; So all steps to recover by uninstalling and using Store to reinstall were of no avail.</p>

That is, until I found a way to run the Store from the command line.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Hopefully, Microsoft will release either a windows update to just fix this or at least a new version of Store to at least fix that.</p>

<p>So I've got this problem&nbsp; (Lenovo laptop G505s) I tried the 'Powershell' workaround - screen just filled with error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So rolled back to previous version of Windows - &amp; thought I'd wait a week or so for MS to have proper fix in place. But in Windows 10 you can't now switch off auto updates - so it's downloaded this faulty version again - and now wants to restart.</p>

<p>This problem seems more wide spread then expected. each time I roll back and upgrade it's a different set of apps that go missing. the PowerShell fix does not address it and Premier support is clueless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can run store the app will launch from there, but that is by no means a real fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back and uninstalled every store app. then upgraded and re-installed doing that fixed all apps but the ones I could not uninstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any app that has an update also seems to fix the issue.&nbsp; If Microsoft would just force the store to re-install everything the issue would be fixed.</p>

<h2>            We can&#39;t find an audio device for your PC.</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10 I started having problems with my PC's audio. When I try to play an audio file on either Windows Media Player or Groove Music both&nbsp;respond with "We can't find an audio device for your PC", and when I try to adjust the volume
 of a web video&nbsp;by&nbsp;using the Volume Mixer the video's&nbsp;sound remains the same regardless of whether&nbsp;I have the volume set&nbsp;at 100 or muted. Also the internal mic I use for Cortana no longer hears me.&nbsp;Using the "Reset this PC" option under Update and Security
 is the only way I have been able to fix these problems and that&nbsp;only fixes it for a few hours.&nbsp;Is there a permanent fix for these problems?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I am having this exact same problem. I cannot figure out why it's happening or how to fix it. The driver I'm using is already the latest version, dated 7/29/2015. It's the Realtek High Definition Audio driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't accept that this is a problem with the my audio driver. Everything works fine when I stream music from the Groove web player using Chrome. This is clearly a problem with the Windows 10 Groove app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A recent update to Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 3 and Samsung Ultrabook caused the same issue. &nbsp;I applied the following registry tweak and it solved the issue (sorry, I don't remember where I found this, but credit to whoever shared it):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Got to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Audio]</li><li>Click on the DWORD DisableProtectedAudioDG<br />
</li><li>It should then already have a 0 in the Value Data field. If it doesn't, you can simply change the value to 0<br />

<h2>            Xbox App Crashing On Opening</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and just recently when I tried to open the Xbox app it crashed just after 1 second. I had opened the app without any problem before in Windows 10 in the past. I don't know why this problem came. And how can I fix it? &nbsp;

    <title>Windows 8.1, Samsung Galaxy S5 - USB error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlzm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1, Samsung Galaxy S5 - USB error</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 - SM-G900V, Android 6.0.1, Kernel 3.4.0.<br />
I have a computer running Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
Whenever I connect the phone to the computer with a USB cable, a Windows pop-up tells me "The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it."&nbsp; The error message is "(Device Descriptor Request Failed)" and is
 error code 43.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have tried that <strong>did not</strong> work:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have two different official Samsung USB cables I have tried to use.&nbsp; Both are in good working condition; I have verified they work fine on my iMacPro at work.&nbsp; All USB transfer options are available on that system.</li><li>I plugged the phone into every USB 2 port on the case front and the back (these are connected directly to the motherboard and not a USB hub) as well as all 4 of my USB ports on a PCI card.</li><li>I have deleted the driver and let Windows reinstall it.</li><li>I have downloaded and installed the latest driver from Samsung as well as some older drivers as suggested by a Samsung rep.</li><li>I have downloaded and installed the Samsung Kies app then tried to use it to install a new driver.</li><li>I downloaded and installed the Microsoft MTP kit.</li><li>I downloaded and installed Samsung Smart Switch and tried to use it to update the driver.</li><li>I rebooted the phone in safe mode and tried to connect to the computer.</li><li>I put the phone into developer mode and forced it
<br />
Since this is not a laptop, power options settings as suggested by several "how to fix" articles online do not apply.<br />
<br />
I looked back through my Windows update history and I see that an update called "Samsung Mobile MTP device" installed successfully on 2/17/2018.&nbsp; The phone itself reports a similar update on 2/18/18.<br />
<br />
I have successfully been connecting USB 2, USB 3, eSATA, Firewire 400 and Firewire 800 devices to this computer for years without issue.&nbsp; Only this phone has had any trouble.<br />
<br />
I contacted Samsung tech support via chat and was eventually told that Microsoft needed to flash my computer's OS.&nbsp; I realized after hearing that nonsense answer that I wasn't going to get any help that way.&nbsp; I'm hoping that, since Windows 8.1 and the S5 have
 both been around for at least 4 years, that this is a known issue with a fix?</li></ul>

            When I hook up my Samsung phone to the USB it shows Charging.&nbsp; It access and transfer to the computer I have to tap on the charging notice on the phone and it gives a menu of what you can do.&nbsp; This also makes the connection to the File Explorer in Windows
 10.<br />

            Thanks for your reply; I appreciate you taking the time to answer.<br />
<br />
When I connect my phone to my Windows 8.1 computer with a USB cable, the USB menu is not available on the phone; it doesn't show "charging" in the pulldown menu.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However, I have put the phone in developer mode.&nbsp; This allows access to the USB menu (charging, MTP, etc...) even if the phone isn't connected via USB to anything. From here, I can switch the phone from USB charging to MTP.&nbsp; However, it doesn't make a difference
 as the phone immediately switches back to USB charging the second it is connected and cannot be forced into any other USB mode.

<h2>            Question about a SLMGR.VBS parameter</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that by using <strong>slmgr.vbs /cpky</strong> command, the product key will be cleared from registry.</p>
<p>This will prevent license theft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested this on my retail key and it works.</p>
<p>However, I wish to know, does this work the same for OEM keys?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this command is used on an OEM activated system, will the key be lost and the activation invalidated?</p>
<p>Or will the system stay activated as before, and reactivate over OS reinstall, just like in the normal course of action?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            That's correct, although Builder's OEM are often given exceptions to move motherboards and are technically retail keys anyway.  But Factory OEM aren't going anywhere but the same motherboard.

            Not that I'm aware of, and the Activation Troubleshooter (that checks if the DL is linked to your MS Account - which is a good idea by signing in  - to help reactivate it, doesn't pop up in those Settings until it gets deactivated.

<h2>            LOCKED&#58; Xbox constantly overheating</h2>
                    
<p>Apparently, My xbox is overheating - despite it being in a well ventilated, chilled environment, ect. After about 5-10 minutes of it being on, it shuts off, and 2 lights show up, on the 1st and 3rd quarter. Upon restarting, it tells me the Xbox shut itself
 off due to heating issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first issue i have ever had with my xbox, and i would hope to get a resolution out of this. I believe its just dust, so would me taking the fan out (its beyond expired warranty...)and cleaning it out work? i already blew out a ton of dust using
 just my mouth, but i am not a expert in the ways of Xbox repair, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Im assuming you have a older xbox 360 console? (Not the slim)</p>
<p>If so. </p>
<p>You play it for 5 minutes and then it overheats. </p>
<p>Turn the console around so you can see the back. Turn it on and am a flashlight at the fan holes. You should see 2 fans spinning. If not, you need a repair.</p>
<p>If you are on the slim. Aim a flashlight at the top where the fan is. You should see 1 fan spinning
</p>
<p>If your fans are working then:</p>
<p>Your heatsinks are &nbsp;not working correctly. This cannot be fixed w/o opening the console witch would

<p>Repairing your console can sometimes require modifications which will get you banned if they catch it.
</p>
<p>But for example: if you make a case mod,( and you dont mess around with the board) They would not catch it because there is no sensor on the case itself.</p>
<p>DO NOT MODIFY THE CONSOLE IN ANY WAY BECAUSE:</p>
<p>1. It might get you console banned.</p>
<p>2.Its against CoC and ToU</p>
<p>3. It voids any warranty or paid for repair by Microsoft and Microsoft Wont touch it,</p>
<p>Also its against Fourm rules to talk about ANY mods or Self repairs so i recommend that we all stop talking about mods and self repairs before we start having problems</p>

            <p>good reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a case I am researching - our AV product registers with Windows Security Center / Action Center - and points to a binary file to be launched by WSC to notify the product to update definitions - based on the user selection in the Action Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This binary (EXE) is fully signed and trusted in the product - but Action Center pops up a dialog asking "Do you want to run this program?". This dialog includes a checkbox - do not show this message again - checking this sets Windows\Security Center\cval
 to 1.</p>

            Hi ProboticWarrior
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since this is Retail, hence it can be transferred. No need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi ProboticWarrior 
<br />
<br />Since that is a Retail licence, that is transferrable to another PC
<br />
<br />Make sure you have logged into your Microsoft Account online from that device, so that licence appears on your account, you can then transfer the licence . . .

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Update the BIOS, low level&nbsp;chipset
<br />
drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW<br />
to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name (see methods below).<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd
<br />
party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in
<br />
Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers
<br />
which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then
<br />
HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            SysInternals Process Explorer showing no loads and error opening</h2>
                    <p>Just as the title states, Process Explorer comes up with a lot of named have no 'path' shown, and says 'error on opening'. A few don't even show that message, the path is blank, and look to be Windows specific files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started happening recently, like in the past day or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 SP1 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to why?</p>
<p>If I open Task manager, I see some of the files paths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run SFC /Scannow with a 'no problems found' report at the end of the run.</p>

            <p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your computer is now running on Windows 7, you may uninstall that program. (Note: If your Windows 7 is now connected to the Internet, then that means the network driver is working).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to determine device drivers functionality:</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>&gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong>&gt; <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>&gt;
<strong>Device Manager.</strong></p>
<p>(If there isn't any yellow or red mark under <strong>Device Manager</strong>, that means all&nbsp; device drivers are working properly).</p>
<p>For more details, you may also contact the <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/contact-hp/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device manufacturer.</a></p>
<p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Lost Age of Empires II, disc 1 &#40;legal owner, purchased - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe adair  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Age of Empires II, disc 1 &#40;legal owner, purchased product&#41; -can&#39;t install after crash recovery</h2>
                    I would love to be able to contact MS, but without a product ID, you can't get into their support network!<br />
<br />
I purchased AOE III, still have the original packaging (with product key), but can't find Disc 1.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how I can get a new image of the disc? Is there anyone who knows how I can contact MS without a product ID?<br />
<br />
THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER!

<p>Hey Joe,<br />
<br />
You can download the setup file for installing Age of Empires 3 using the Microsoft Download Centre. Here is a link to download :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=F627E37B-A8E8-4537-9A88-3C19B670C92A&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=F627E37B-A8E8-4537-9A88-3C19B670C92A&amp;displaylang=en</a><br />
<br />
All though this is a train version you may upgrade it to the full version using the product key that you have on the packing of the CD.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps. Let me know if it worked.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
Irfan</p>
