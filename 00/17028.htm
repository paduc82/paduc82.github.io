<h2>            Internet Explorer keeps crashing ieframe .dll error</h2>
                    Well just a few weeks ago in our IT lab weve been installing some new testing software. But before we &nbsp;done all that internet explorer stopped working and kept giving us a error message of ieframe .dll error and will keep opening up tabs and closing them
 immediately. Till it over loads it self to stop working. We've tried reinstalling it, and doing a clean boot state to see if any other programs are clashing with it. But still no end it still doesnt work and we need to get it fixed. We havent updated the PC
 but any other kind of solutions dont work.

            <p><span>Hi Anthony,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods to troubleshoot the issue with Internet Explorer:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the link to reset Internet Explorer settings and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: Reset Internet Explorer to its
 default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can refer the link: </span></p>

<h2>            Keep getting &#39;we can&#39;t sync this item because the path is too long&#39; but ...</h2>
                    
<p>I have updated to the new universal OneDrive application, and am using a Business account primarily.</p>
<p>I have a folder that WAS sync'd to my OneDrive via the old OneDrive for Business app.</p>
<p>During the sync process with the new client, I have received an error: 'we can't sync this item because the path is too long'<br />
<br />
I deleted this folder from OneDrive online via the browser, and also permanently deleted the folder locally.
<br />
<br />
I still get this error every day, and it stops my OneDrive working until I respond, and then the who cycle repeats.</p>
<p>I don't want the folder; I don't care about the folder; I attempted to delete the folder from everywhere; OneDrive just persists with re-adding it to my local folder and then complaining it can't sync it.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In SharePoint Online, file name paths can have up to 256 characters, before you sync, please check all the file names. You may shorten the path by shortening file names or removing the file from a folder and putting it to the root
 library. You can find the Restrictions and limitations<b>&nbsp;</b><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3125202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">here</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you identify the folder with a long path and want to delete it, you may

 Right-click the OneDrive icon in the system tray -&gt; settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Unlink OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, to clarify your scenaro, I'd like to confirm the following:</p>
<p>1.Please confirm whether you are using the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client (OneDrive.exe) or the OneDrive for Business application(groove.exe) to sync your OneDrive for Business library. You may find the difference

<p>I followed the above advice, but still have the same issue.</p>
<p>I don't know where OneDrive is actually getting the folder from; I have deleted it from online, and searched my whole computer, permanently deleting any of the matched folders. Yet, when I sync again, there is the folder?</p>
<p>This is very frustrating. I just want to delete the damn folder and be done with it. I was hoping for a better experience with the new OneDrive client, but so far it has been worse.</p>

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clarify your scenario and investigate the issue, could you&nbsp;provide the following information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Please confirm whether you download the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client from
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/download/</span></a> and configure it by referring to

<p>2.Check if the issue would happen when you sync your OneDrive for Business library
<strong>on another PC</strong> via the <strong>OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client.</strong></p>
<p>3.After deleting the folder, check whether the folder would show up in your OneDrive for Business library or your personal OneDrive (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://onedrive.live.com</span></a>)
 when you start syncing. You may share the detailed steps about how you start syncing.</p>
<p>4.The OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client version and OS version. To check the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client version: Search for OneDrivesetup.exe on your PC.&gt;Right-click it, and choose Properties.&gt;In
 the Properties dialog box, choose the Details tab, and you‚Äôll see the Product version listed.</p>
<p>5.The screenshots of the error message and the synced folder on your PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To upload screenshots, you can click <b>Use rich formatting</b> and then click the icon of

<p>1. i am using that onedrive client</p>
<p>2. i do not currently have time to do that. i need to do my job.</p>
<p>3. yesterday, when i attempted the previous advice, i had deleted in from my onedrive (online) and had emptied the recycle bin. i had then also done a search for the folder name and permanently deleted it from everywhere i found it on my computer. i then
 also deleted my spw folder. i then reconfigured both onedrive and the linked onedrive for business account. this morning, i have the very same error, and the previously deleted folder both appears in my local onedrive for business folder and online in onedrive
 for business.<br />
<br />
for a folder which reports errors syncing, it does a damn good job of syncing itself everywhere when all i want to do is permanently delete it.<br />

<p>hi brad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to troubleshoot the issue, could you try the following steps and check the outcome?</p>
<p>1.from the screenshot you provided above, the file is in the chrome cache. you may clear the chrome cache: open the chrome&gt;ctrl+ shift+ delete&gt;clear browsing data.</p>
<p>2.to check if the issue is related to the previous onedrive for business cache, please run the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">easy fix tool</span></a> to clear onedrive for business cache.</p>
<p>note: this tool requires you to resync all data that you synced previously to onedrive for business.</p>
<p>3.delete the folder from the local and your onedrive for business library.&nbsp;create a new&nbsp;folder on the local to store&nbsp;the synced files and check the outcome. to do that:</p>
<p>a.right-click the onedrive icon(onedrive-organization name) in the system tray as shown below &gt; settings &gt; account &gt; unlink onedrive&gt;sign in again with your office 365 work or school account</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp; Brad,<br />
<br />
In order to clarify the issue, we'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.Currently, have you only try to sync your OneDrive for Business library via the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client, while do not use the old OneDrive for Business sync client? &nbsp;<br />
2.Does the issue remains after you stop syncing the libraries via "Unlink OneDrive"?<br />
3.Would you provide us with the URL address of the specific folder in your OneDrive for Business?<br />
<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message asking for the information. You can go to this link to access to the Private Message:

<p>Thank you for the response but you can close this thread as we have it taken care of.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I had to do was download the install file from MS and that took care of it.&nbsp; We didn't have to use the CD that came with the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; All is good now,&nbsp; thanks again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>TLS Information for Office 365&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            TLS Information for Office 365&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I received a request for information from one of our clients. It says they need some information. We're on Office 365, so I'm not 100% sure on where to obtain this, and was wondering if someone could shed some insight:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Domain list for TLS &gt; presumably the list of the domains we have associated with our 365 account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gateways &gt; ? not sure, outlook.office365.com?</p>
<p>TLS certificate DN &gt; Would this be the issuer? Which certificate would I use, the one for
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com?</a></p>
<p>CN = Microsoft IT SSL SHA2<br />
OU = Microsoft IT<br />
O = Microsoft Corporation<br />
L = Redmond<br />
S = Washington<br />
C = US</p>
<p>TLS certificate issuer CA: Please provide CA name and URL to CA public key download:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name: &gt; Baltimore CyberTrust Root?<br />
URL: &gt; not sure where I would find this URL, though I could get the public key</p>
<p><br />
I'm obviously rather confused, so if anyone can give me some input that would be great!</p>

<p>Hi Shiv960,<br />
<br />
After reading your post, I find the information requested by your client may be a bit too vague. Can you please help us confirm the original goal your client wants to achieve?<br />
<br />
Based on my understanding, your client might be trying to set up a secured mail flow process between his organization and yours. The required encryption protocol is TLS, and it is introduced in detail by this article:
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn751021(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up connectors for secure mail flow with a partner organization</a>.<br />
<br />
If my assumption is correct, then the answers you prepared are basically correct too. It‚Äôs just that the TLS certificate should be issued by a 3rd-party trusted CA, not Microsoft Office 365. Anyway, I‚Äôm looking forward to the updates from your client.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen<br />

<p>Hi Shiv960,</p>
<p>Commonly, ‚ÄúDN‚Äù should simply mean ‚Äúdomain name‚Äù. As to the ‚Äúgateway‚Äù, we don‚Äôt have such a term in Office 365 TLS encrypted mail flow. But I suppose it should be<strong> mail.protection.outlook.com</strong>.</p>

    <title>Outlook PST Backup tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook PST Backup tool</h2>
                    
<p>I have been making many changes on my pc to fix some problems. But I did have the Microsoft Personal Folders Backup Tool running for many months to place a backup of my PST file into My Docs so it could be backed up on an external drive. In fighting the
 many issues with my Outlook which involved creating another Personal Folder and having Outlook open both each time I started Outlook, I have lost the Backup item under File in Outlook. So I went to the Microsoft download site and downloaded it again. But if
 I look in File in my Outlook, there is not an item titled Backup or anything like that. I see Data File Management, Import &amp; Export, Archive etc but no Backup. I have shut down Outlook and re-opened it, thinking that would make it appear. It didn't. I have
 even restarted my pc and that didn't fix this issue.</p>
<p>I went back to the Microsoft site to download it again, and it wouldn't download and install since it said that it already finds the file on my pc and if I want to install it, I need to uninstall the old one first using Add/Remove.</p>
<p>I looked in Add/Remove and I see Microsoft Outlook Personal Folders Backup item saying Last Used On: today</p>
<p>So where is it and how do I use it?</p>

<h2>            &#91;W10 activation&#93; Any final answer to that situation please &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a lot of posts here, but I couldn't find any answer, anyone saying different things and all... Here it is :</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 computers, one running with W10 home&nbsp;TP since the beginning , and a laptop that had been running PRO&nbsp;TP (because planning to use it for work...) since build 10162. They both previously were on W7 home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a giant mess in my laptop like 4 or 5 days ago, I had to reinstall my OS. I was downloading the pro final on my other computer, but in the meantime the last realease I had was 10162, so I did reinstall with that one. It then updated to 240,
 and now my laptop won't activate my pro version... As my home TP never asked me for an activation but still activated, I assume the Pro version did the same, so it was supposed to work perfectly. It didn't. At all. And it's been 4 days now, I'm quite afraid
 it won't...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it because my w7 was a home edition ? My W10 home works perfectly fine, the only problem I have is with my PRO version... I quite don't see the point in having us testing the Pro version if, in the end, we only have access based on our previous
 windows version...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that a company like MS can have a better solution than "hey, sorry, maybe next time, now you can reinstall w7 then w10 home" ^^"</p>

<p>I guess my first comment would be to watch the advise you are given.&nbsp; From the info you provided, not sure one can actually give you perfect advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here may be the root of your problem.&nbsp; If you hold&nbsp; a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license, you qualify for the W10 free upgrade.&nbsp; You would appear to have a qualifying license.&nbsp; However, you only qualify for the same edition so you only qualify for the Home edition.&nbsp;
 In the early days, MS only offered Pro and Enterprise editions and Enterprise does not qualify at all and folks testing Pro do not qualify if they had a Home edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on where you stand and what o/s you have on the PC, this will guide your direction.&nbsp; If you have W7 home on the PC, just go to MS and download the W10 Home ISO and upgrade your W7 Home edition.&nbsp; You should not be asked for a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was an Insider with 2 Pro W8.1's.&nbsp; I had installed W10 right over W8.1 many months ago.&nbsp; I also had a few other W8.1 Pro not with Insiders.&nbsp; To save on band width, I just d/l'ed the W10 ISO and used the ISO file for the whole fleet.&nbsp; I had the qualifying
 prior license so just a smooth transition from prior o/s to W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, W10 is solid for me.</p>
<p>

<h2>            C3-01 &#38;quot&#59;UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVICE&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>I have bought the C3 01 about two weeks ago. Im with Tmobile, but I don't have a data plan. I use WLAN WiFi for internet connection.&nbsp;Last week I was able to connect to the OVI store (main page-menu- ovi store). I was able to&nbsp;download a couple of free applications,
 and after that I have tried to use the ovi store in the same way, but every time I press the OVI store icon, after a couple of second all I get is&nbsp; "UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVICE. TRY AGAIN LATER".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the web search all I get is "UNABLE TO CONNECT". But if I use OPERA MINI I can check my email and access all the other saved websites on the application. I have tried to save OVI store on opera mini but it says:'ovistore is currently not availablefor
 the opera mini browser".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anybody that can help me with this?</p>

<p><strong>Refining the customization experience for precision touchpad (PC)</strong><strong>:
</strong>Since <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/10/13/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14946-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
last week</a>, we‚Äôve continued working in this space, and have another set of improvements headed your way. To start with, we‚Äôve hooked up our keyboard shortcut picker, so now if you choose that option on the Advanced gestures page, you‚Äôll be presented a recorder
 so you can capture your favorite key combo - &nbsp;perhaps WIN + Alt + D or WIN + F to start with? Secondly, we‚Äôve added a Change audio and volume option to the set of basic swipe gestures you can pick from. Finally, we‚Äôve updated the reset button to now has a
 progress circle and display a check mark when it is finished. We‚Äôve also heard your feedback from the last flight, and fixed a few issues including that the reset button wasn‚Äôt clearing the settings listed on the advanced gestures page, that the 4-fingure
 gesture graphic was visible on devices that only supported 3-contact points, and that some of the advanced gestures options weren‚Äôt working as expected. If you have any more feedback for us, please let us know!</p>

<h3> tails876530  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 database is running queries continuously &#38; not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a database in Access that I have been working on the last 6 months, so am fairly familiar with the tool, but no professional superuser!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a little background first on what I was doing this morning before it crashed/slowed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I was running reports from query's and formatting the reports. The first report I ran was from a hidden query that I had unhide, but was still dimmed. Then I ran a second report, which was not from a hidden query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I noticed that I could not see the 2 reports I ran, even the one that was based on the query that was not hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following this I tried to search for them in the navigation pane but no luck, so I opened the navigation options and changed a few settings, which admittedly, I didn't fully understand, but was hopeful that I would notice the changes that would occur and
 if I wasn't happy with them then I could always reverse them by going back in again to navigation options and choosing the options I had before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately when I went back into the navigation options, the custom categories and groups I had created where no longer there. Next (maybe as a result of the navigation options I changed) my database started running queries continuoisly, and easking me
 to input parameter values!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried stopping the queries by pressing CTRL + Break, but no luck, and tried escaping the database. I also don't have any functionality over any of the ribbon etc, my mouse icon is not responding. When i tried to break the queries or escape, it tells
 me it is not responding and the blue circle starts running. Eventually it comes back but goes straight to running the queries!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what is causing the queries to run and how to stop them? Did changing the navigation options cause the queries to run??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tails</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            The only thing I can think of is that you have an autoexec macro the runs when you open the database and that macro is running the queries. All in all, it sounds like the database is hosed. I suggest you import everything into a new, blank database to
 see if that fixes it.

                    <p>My microsoft lumia 550 wont power up anymore after numerous attempts to get it charging, like most lumias my lumia supposed to turn its self on immediately i put the charging cable on it. It didn't do that. Ive watched so many trouble shooting tutorials
 on youtube to sort my problem out but it didnt,</p>
<p>So im stuck with a dead phone that wont work, even the hard and soft reset i did didnt power up my phone.</p>
<p>So i thougt the problem here must be the battery, i bought a replacement which had little battery life in it and i used it to try and do the soft and hard reset, the phone went dead and refuse to power up.</p>
<p>Whatsa wrong with my phone?</p>

            <p>OneNote 2016 free version cannot access locally stored notebooks (it still does have the backup mechanism to SAVE notebooks into .ONE / ONEPKG files but would not be able to restore or reopen them). So the free version would not let you open your existing
 2007 notebooks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office versions of OneNote 2013/2016 let you work with notebooks in the cloud (OneDrive, OneDrive Business), on SharePoint and
<strong>also locally stored files</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caution: The OneNote 2007 file format is not fully compatible with later versions. There is an option in OneNote 2010-2016 (Office versions) to convert those notebooks into the newer format though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would then decide to transfer your notebooks to OneDrive to access them from several devices and systems (of course you don't have to) the backup mechanism would still create copies on a local drive.</p>

            <p>Cliff, thank you for responding. Yes, I do have access- a license for 365 Office Pro Plus.&nbsp; My one drive is not able to sign I- received access denied due to web exception occurred while trying to get default library API business location. Returned unauthorized.
 Sometimes I am not able to even sign in using the office 365 account, I have to use my Hotmail account. I then search until I find the office account- which is always found but most times when trying&nbsp;to activate/ sign into office apps it is not recognized
 saying my office 365 does not exist. I did get a report this last time from support/ recovery saying I could do to possibly fix- 1) purchase another license or&nbsp;2) assign license to user. I have linked 3 of my other emails to this&nbsp;Pro Plus account, which it
 sees the accounts and had installed&nbsp;onto my Android phone. I have never gotten it fully usable and functioning properly. I also have&nbsp;a 64 bit computer but downloaded 32 bit office. I don't know if this has any a negative affect? I tried switching my sign in
 account to use office 365 at all times, but Microsoft Edge opens with Hotmail account. I cannot get it switched.

<p>Another screen shot. When I try to sign into one drive with office account it does not see that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two more pictures that I can send in personal message confirming my Office 365 Pro Plus account and one of the issues I have been having. I have to find the other screen shot.</p>
<p>Thank you again for responding, I have been spent hours in the past week trying to figure all of this out to no avail.&nbsp; Now, my computer seems as if it is running a bit slower than usual, which just started the past couple hours.

            <p>Thank you or responding. I do appreciate it! I do have a pro plus license.&nbsp; My school office 365 pro plus account is not being seen by Microsoft. It says it does not exist when I try to sign in from&nbsp;new screen. It is acknowledged when I find it through a
 different Microsoft account.&nbsp; I cannot sign into most office apps with this account. I have posted more information to the next reply as well. Here are some screen shots, minus the one of license which has information I do not think is allowed in public view.
 Thank you for your time and also promptness in replying. I had not known you responded until over an hour after you had. I am grateful for your advise.
</p>
<p>Behind this screen shows where it says I should be seeing online tiles.</p>

            Contact your school admin. If you hit on the install 2016 and only gives you onedrive for business to install, it means that office 365 pro plus is not enabled on your account..

            Thank you! I had gotten locked out of my school account. Called the school and &nbsp;on the hub as well. I see from my computer that I have Windows 10 education and office 365. On the hub said everything should be fine now, if not to call Microsoft. I don't
 know if my Hotmail email account can be linked to my onmicrosoft account- which is confusing me. I know I would get similar benefits using windows 10 n my hot mail account as my school/ 365 pro plus account. I was leery about installing any more software before
 knowing 100% that is what needed to b done. On the hub hadn't mentioned that. I have installed pro plus onto my PC, but I thought when I activated office with my school account that pro plus would be activated then? I still get the blue screen showing that
 I need to call "IT" because I should be seeing tiles for all apps on my school account. I need to go into my account, at software click install? Again? I had it installed onto my drive last week and it saved onto my computer, either

    <title>Excel 2016 &#40;VBA&#41; problems with cut-paste - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin-s_1985  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 &#40;VBA&#41; problems with cut-paste</h2>
                    Hi, I desperately need help with Excel 2016 (on Windows 2010). I am programming a tool in VBA with very complex Algorithms and 2 months ago it started to crash. I noticed that some basic functions stopped working. So, I installed 64 bit version of Excel
 and I started it all over again. I rewrote the code (also I optimized it very carefully).&nbsp; Now, I have very similar problem. Every time I enter the debug mode (no matter from which module) ‚Äûcut-paste‚Äú function stops working. I still can run my code but when
 I want to cut paste some cells in Excel sheet it crashes (excel). At the same time, all my code works just fine.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Excel auto-saves my document, and if I try to close Excel, and open it again, it crashes on cut-paste command.&nbsp;

            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />4. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p><span><span>Thank you very much for your reply.</span></span></p>
<p>I forgot to mention that once this happens cut-paste function in this tool (document) does not work on any other computer. Also Cut-paste function properly works in other workbook.
 I have already uninstall Excel and install it again and "broken version" still didn't work. I also try to start it in safe - mode and it didn't solve the problem.

            1. Did you do point no. 2? This should solve the issue.
<br />
<br />2. There is something in your VBA code which is disabling this.

<p>However, I done all that steps one by one and I didn't solve the problem. Excel tool is still crashing every time I tried to make cut - copy function (in broken version of tool). It's weird because copy paste function works just fine.&nbsp; Also it crashes before
 I click on paste button. I cut some cell, select other cell to paste it, click right mouse button and when I slide my mouse arrow on paste button Excel crashes (before I made a click). I would appreciate it if you can give me any more advice.<br />

            How should we help without knowing what you are doing with VBA?
<br />
<br />I bet your Excel works fine if your tool is not loaded, right?
<br />So whatever the reason, it's up to your code.

            Try following
<br />
<br />1. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky &amp; other Anti Viruses  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start the application. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.

<p>Thanks mate for you reply, i do not wary about my PC security while i use Avast Internet security. It even got a new feature as folder protection (shield) against rainsomeware. We did a big tests to see if Avast is good protection and believe it does. I
 have experience with many AV suits from different vendors.</p>
<p>Yes I can use something like Malwarebytes to scan my PC periodically. WD periodically feature is nice extra tool to have it scanning you pc from time to time, as no best AV security suits exist. All of them have their - and+ . So as i said WD periodically
 scanning your PC is a nice thing and you want it to be working with no bugs as it is part of windows 10</p>
<p>Yes i didn't have this problem until i have installed Creator update i mean windows 1703 version. After update i did a clean install. So the problem exist only with windows 10 1703 version. ( for me and as i see for others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My post is not about how to secure PC but i'm reporting about problem that something is not working as it should :)</p>
<p>Might be Microsoft is aware about it and next updates will fix it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The next major Win 10 update is still set for fall of 2017 as far as I know. &nbsp;If the update restores "Limited Periodic Scanning" capability to Windows Defender in your computer you might want to consider posting back in this thread...that information might

<p>
</p><p>My Outlook client is 16.7998.2105.&nbsp; and I created 30 rules to manage lots of emails in my inbox. However, I find these rules doesn't work one day. All emails are not into their subfolders. I didn't do anything. Please note: I didn't do anything, no update,
 no other rules. Just I am off duty and on duty next day, I find all emails are stuck Inbox. There are too many&nbsp;emails so that I cannot manage them conveniently. How can I make them work as before? To recreate them is not a good idea as it is a big work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

            <p>Hi GiegerG,<br />
<br />
Please go to File --&gt; Manage rules and alerts --&gt; click run rules now --&gt; Choose the rules you want --&gt;Choose Inbox since all mails are stuck in this folder --&gt; Run now<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8a582d9-45fb-4155-b18f-8d8e0b01529f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8a582d9-45fb-4155-b18f-8d8e0b01529f" /></a><br />
<br />
Please let me know if the rule works fine when the new mails arrived in&nbsp;the Inbox folder. If not, let's look into this issue. Please help answer a few queries below.</p>
<p>1. How did you set up your account in Outlook? Via Exchange or POP/IMAP.</p>
<p>2. Did you exit the Outlook client during the OOF period? There are client-side rules and server-side rules in Outlook. Client-side rules will work only when Outlook client is running.</p>
<p>3. Are you using Office 365 for Business account or Outlook.com account?</p>
<p>4. Try re-enabling one of the rules and see if the rules works in this way.</p>
<p>5. Share some detailed information about these rules such as the condition and action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,<br />
Alison<br />

    <title>A Theme Generator for Windows 6.5&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arielphf  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Theme Generator for Windows 6.5&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I think I've stepped into the twilight zone...</p>
<p>I've got an HTC Touch Pro 2 that I have been running their HTC Sense on, but it's such a resource hog and so glitchy that I finally just&nbsp;returned to the bare bones Windows 6.5 format on the phone.&nbsp; Now I'd like to see about customizing the 6.5 screens, but
 the link that EVERYONE shows on websites and forums as leading to Microsoft's own Theme Generator for WM6.5 -<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/theme-generator.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/theme-generator.mspx</a>&nbsp;-
 leads to some page that has no link for the theme generator at all.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; All I want to do is change the font color of my text to something that will work with my background picture - has this program that Microsoft apparently once offered exist NOWHERE
 on the internet now?&nbsp; It's like it fell into a black hole.&nbsp; Is there nothing else out there that will allow me to customize the screens on a WM6.5 device?&nbsp; I don't want Manilla or HTC Sense - I just want to be able to tweak the base screens a little bit.&nbsp;
 Isn't there anything out there that can do that simple thing?</p>
<p>A.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I actually did a search for you and found the link in microsoft and tested it. You generate basic themes from it and that's all like changing background color taskbar color and thats all and you are able to do this only with the mobile listed .</p>
<p>Here is the link: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/nl-be/downloads/theme-generator.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/nl-be/downloads/theme-generator.mspx</a>#</p>
<p>or else what you can use is 'UI Tweaker' which you can get from <a href="http://www.freewarepocketpc.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.freewarepocketpc.net</a>. I am actually using it with my HTC HD2 and it works great but I don't know the effects it will have on your touch pro 2. But as the&nbsp;HD 2 and the touch pro 2 are practically the same generations, I think it will work. Just
 backup everything on your mobile like contacts, messages and other things important to you before making any changes.</p>

<p>Hi Brent,</p>
<p>I know you can run the cmdlet of ‚ÄúGet-IRMConfiguration‚Äù. However, as far as I know, some permissions are required before running the ‚ÄúSet-IRMConfiguration‚Äù cmdlet. What specific permissions the user needs depends on the cmdlet the user runs. For more information,
 you can refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd979792%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set-IRMConfiguration</a>.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1.&nbsp;What is the detailed cmdlet you are running?<br />
2.&nbsp;Does the issue persist to any other admin of your organization?</p>
<p>Also, it would be better if you could upload a screenshot about the error of your PowerShell output for analysis. To upload a screenshot: Click ‚ÄúUse rich formatting‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúInsert Media‚Äù.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>No, there is no need to load another module. I did a test on my side with no issue. I suggest you change another administrator account and try again. Please don‚Äôt forget to&nbsp;add this user to Compliance Management
 and Organization Management admin role group.</p>

<p>Hi Brent,</p>
<p>Thanks for your screenshot.</p>
<p>It is not a correct behavior. To further narrow down the issue and identity whether it is related to role permissions, cloud you please create a new global admin account and add it to Compliance and Organization Management role group? After that, please
 try run the following PowerShell commands:</p>
<p>get-rolegroupmember "Organization Management"</p>
<p>get-rolegroupmember "Compliance Management"</p>
<p>When you make sure that the new admin account is one member of the role groups, please try the Set-IRMConfiguration again. If the issue persists, can you provide some screenshots about the get-rolegroupmember?</p>
<p>Your efforts are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Reagrds,<br />
Erick</p>

    <title>How do I remove my yahoo mail account from Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raysmkth  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove my yahoo mail account from Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I needed to email some spreadsheets from my tablet so I could open them on my laptop so I just added my yahoo mail account in outlook.&nbsp; Outlook did not import my Bulk mail folder so I have no junk filter and this account is getting bombarded with spam.&nbsp;
 I would like to remove the yahoo account from Outlook and add a different account for that mail application.&nbsp; I can find no instructions for doing so.&nbsp; I can readily remove another account not in Outlook but the only instructions I could find for removing
 the yahoo account included closing my Microsoft account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one but I can't find this question in the forum.</p>
