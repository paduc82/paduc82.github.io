            Unless you are wanted to use SQL, you don't need to have it installed. However, you may have some applications that use a SQL database, so only you can decide whether to uninstall it or not.

<h2>            How do I activate the equalizer in my Realtek soundcard&#63;</h2>
                    I have the RealTek High Definition Audio card that came with my machine, and when I found the equalizer, as soon as I select an equalizer, I don't get the "Apply" button, and the sound coming from the headphone jack (which I feed to either a good stereo
 or perhaps a Fender Twin) is weak, thin and tinny. How do I get the sound card to perform adequately?

            <p><span>Hi Lane,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve the issue with Realtek sound card, follow these methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>First, I would suggest you update the Realtek sound card drivers on the computer by downloading it from the manufacturer’s website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also refer to the link for updating the drivers:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download and install drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to follow these steps to change the equalizer and check if it helps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the Realtek sound card user interface. This will bring you to the screen where you can make detailed settings for the device, and can customize the equalizer.</span></li><li><span>Click on the "<strong>Sound Effects</strong>" tab. Right beside the equalizer you will see a box that you will have to highlight with your mouse. When highlighted, it will give you the option
 to "<strong>Change To Graphic EQ</strong>."</span></li><li><span>Click on that button to activate the Realtek Equalizer for the device.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above steps do not work, I would suggest you to contact the Realtek support for further support:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/contact/contactView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=1&amp;PFid=1&amp;Level=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.realtek.com.tw/contact/contactView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=1&amp;PFid=1&amp;Level=1</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the results. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question related to Windows and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Method 1 results: new driver kills sound as soon as the jack detects a plug in the headphone jack. Not really an improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 results: as stated above, once equalizer option gets selected, the "apply" button grays out, and clicking "OK" does not apply the new setting, and the sound remains thin (from googling around the net, it appears that everyone has issues with both
 Realtek cards and nonexistent support from Realtek.), and this continued after the combination of 1 and 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case anyone searching for answers to this (or similar) problem looks in on this, I chose to get a good sound from my machine with a $30 USB sound card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it would be better if the computer worked as sold, that wasn't to be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have taken this up with either Toshiba's or Realtek's site, neither appeared remotely close to helpful; and I had been looking at it as an issue of the OS having difficulty getting to the settings. &nbsp;Actually the problem appears to lie with crappily
 written drivers/crappy soundcard (Reatek's problem) that never should have been installed by the OEM (Toshiba's problem, and they'll hear about it as soon as I can navigable their system).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I thank you for your attempts at help, Rohit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like, in the words of Douglas Adams, the problem admits of no solution, and true answers involve alternate soundcards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            The apply button is greying out for me as well. I believe this to be an administrative user privilege issue. It really is frustrating I understand that it is what it is, but I don't have to like control of the operating system progressively being taken
 out of the hands of the customer. By the way if you would trust me enough to let me change my own settings on this soundcard a solution might be nice. Thanks Regretfully a customer for life.

            <p>Ok i have figured this out on my own follow the steps the guy posted above. When you click equalizer after you have checked it a menu on the bottom of the window allows you to adjust it; Rock, Pop etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the little box next to it ... with the dots in it allows you to manually configure your equalizer. You do not need the apply button for it to initiate. I was wrong about the user privileges, however I stand by my lack of user control statement. This could
 not have been hidden much better. Thank the Goddess I am learning command line functions that will help me have to use this GUI less.</p>

http://tweakers.net/downloads/25071/realtek-hd-audio-257.html<br />

            <p>This happens a lot for people wanting to plug in a Guitar and use the computer as an amp....it will not work unless you go to RadioShack and buy a Mini Amp and a Male to Male Line -Prices May Vary!&nbsp;&nbsp;Then plug it in to the line in jack.....use the plug ins
 on the Amp to plug in Guitar....the (line in) will be used plugging in the Mini Amp to the Computer With Male to Male end Line!&nbsp;for say like: if you have a music app that you want to lay tracks on and be able to hear the notes at the same time. This is the
 best way to do it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the Mini Amp and Male to Male Line; you will probably hear nothing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember to have both your Mic and the App Running&nbsp;to record the tracks in the App!!!</p>

            <p>It appears the Windows 10 Upgrade activated and blocked the 8.1 Product Key as it does until uninstalled.&nbsp; So you can if you'd like

 work from, since the success of the Upgrade so largely depends upon the underlying OS.&nbsp; If you want to do this, I will work through any issues with you.&nbsp; First thing after install&nbsp; to do is type Update in Start Search box, Check for Updates and expedite all
 through requested restarts, until no more are offered.&nbsp; Then right click Start button to Open Device Manager and import any drivers still missing or in error with a ! mark from the PC or device's Support Downloads webpage. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you instead only want to try to activate Windows 8.1&nbsp; - perhaps later to try Upgrade from a much cleaner install - then&nbsp;</p>
<p>the qualifying OS Product Key is blocked when used to Upgrade, but once you delete the old OS off the drive it should allow use of the key again.&nbsp; However there is no way MS will know this if it hasn't checked the WIndows 10 activation lately, so you may
 need to use a live agent during failed reactivation by phone. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try right clicking Start button, open Admin Command Prompt, type slui 4 in,&nbsp; select Country, then use the phone number given to trade ID numbers with the computer. If it asks how many copies of this OS are installed, be sure to answer only one which is how
 MS gets clearance to disregard any previous activation still lodged in Servers. &nbsp;&nbsp; If it still rejects the code then wait to speak with a telephone agent and explain you are retrieving the Windows 8.1 Product Key from a failed Windows 10 install you wish to
 relinquish.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>You can boot the Windows 10 installation media to install without inserting a Product Key.&nbsp; Just click the box to Skip or click Next.&nbsp; If neither of those work look closely for another link on the page to Skip this step.&nbsp;

            <p>If you have Windows 10 on the drive now, we can try to help you work out the issues if you will list them for us.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have WIndows 8.1 you will need to Activate it before it can be upgraded again.&nbsp; It should activate if it came preinstalled on the PC, from Product Key embedded in BIOS.&nbsp; Otherwise if you had a retail copy of WIndows 8.1 then you need to insert the
 Product Key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we can help you upgrade again to Windows 10 after optimizing 8.1 to cause less issues in 10, including choosing during Upgrade to Save Nothing which gives it the best chance to succeed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have your files backed up externally, and access to any programs (like Office)&nbsp; you use to reinstall them, including the program's&nbsp; Product Key if necessary?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been getting this message as an issue:&nbsp; Windows cannot find the disk or network location where your backups are being saved.&nbsp; Backup location cannot be found, error 0x81000006.&nbsp; I'm not particularly adept at fixing PC problems, and not sure how urgent
 this message is as it comes up with a white flag.&nbsp; Does anyone have a set of steps to correct this so that I don't have to worry I'll create a new set of problems?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also, wondering if WD SmartWare has anything to do with this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Need an app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paula-mffh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need an app</h2>
                    <p>When I try to open some things, such as parts 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;of the Windows 10 tutorial, a box pops up. It says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You'll need a new app to open this about"</p>
<p>Shows store logo&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look for an app in the store"</p>
<p>Checked box&nbsp;&nbsp; "Always use this app</p>
<p>Box saying "OK"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I check the logo line I can get to an almost blank blue page that has a small "store" to click and sends me to the Windows&nbsp;store, but I see nothing useful.</p>
<p>Same thing if I click "always use this app".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it hard to believe that Microsoft is telling me to get an app so that I can read their e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be very much appreciated.&nbsp; I have the rest of Windows 10 is working well&nbsp;and I'm having fun with it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience you have experienced. Help us with some information to assist you in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which file format you're trying to open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pop up you're referring indicates that you need to select the app for an extension. For example, if you need to open a image file, then you need to select Windows Picture Viewer. Most probably system will automatically maps the app according to the extension
 of the file. If not it will redirects you with some options like "Look for an app in the store"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query.</p>

<h2>            &#34;The boot Configuration Data for my PC is missing or contains errors&#34; VMware and Windows Server 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I recently downloaded a copy of Windows Server 2016 From TechNet. I've had Server 2016 on VMware many times but just reinstalled Windows and need to install it again. My problem is, after setting up all the info in VMware, and using the ISO in the
 CD Drive, I fire up the VM. I get to a screen saying click anything to boot from CD or DVD (which usually isn't there) and I click any key. Then it takes me to Windows Boot Manager and says "The boot Configuration Data for my PC is missing or contains errors."
 It asks me to Repair my computer (see first picture.) I tried hitting F12 while starting the VM and it takes me to Boot Manager (see 2nd picture). But all the options take me to the "press any key to boot from DVD" and then I get the error again.&nbsp; Please take
 a look at the pics and help me install Server 2016. I never had this problem before with VMware and the TechNet Trials of Windows Server 2016. I also noticed the download size of the ISO went down from around 6GB to 4.5GB. Not sure if that has anything to
 do with it. Please reply. Thanks</p>

    <title>How to reset Homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sneff1150  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reset Homegroup</h2>
                    <p>My&nbsp;PC was running Windows 8 and I did setup Home Group but&nbsp;didn't set it up on the other PC's on the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just reformatted and reinstalled Windows 8 however I am having trouble in setting up the Home Group again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click on PC Settings - Home Group the following info is shown on the right hand side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home Group</p>
<p>A home group is available</p>
<p>(my name) on (my computer) has created a home group. Join the home group to share files and devices with other people on the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is box asking for the home group password which I fill in with the original password (or any other password) and then click on 'Join'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually I receive a message in Red: Windows no longer detects a home group on this network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I close the PC Settings screen and reopen it I receive the same message again (without the Red message)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My network is working fine with all PC's and NAS visible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help would be appreciated&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Half-life Orange Box Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> olegkochetov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Half-life Orange Box Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>День добрый. Перейду сразу к делу.</p>
<p>Пару дней назад в Xbox live появился замечательный сборник "Half-life orange box".</p>
<p>В описании было указано, что игра поддерживает множество языков, в том числе и РУССКИЙ.</p>
<p>Но когда я приобрел ее через этот самый xbox live, игра оказалось на английском.</p>
<p>Почему так?</p>
<p>Или она действительно на английском и меня ввели в заблуждение указав в описании русский язык,</p>
<p>или нужно провести некоторые действия, чтобы она (игра) работала на русском языке?</p>
<p>Очень рассчитываю на вашу помощь или информацию.</p>
<p>Заранее спасибо.</p>

<p>Ещё возможно что ты ошибся в регионе. То есть например у тебя зареган аккаунт на США, а смотрел, на каких языках игра поддерживается через регион "Россия". Например CoD: Black Ops в русском лайве на русском языке, а в американском лайве на английском.</p>

<p>Аккаунт у меня зарегин на РФ и стоит язык русский. Прочитал, что игра вообще не бывает на xbox на русском, так что вот теперь думаю, или звонить в службу поддержку требовать возврат денег или играть на английском. Вобщем, спасибо.
</p>
<p>P.S. А вообще, меня очень разочаровало, что на мою просьбу откликнулись такие же геймеры как я. Где же администраторы((((((((((((((</p>

<p>Нет, это не возможно чтобы лайв тебе соврал с языками. Если там написано, значит так и должно быть.</p>
<p>Скорее всего ты где-то ошибся.</p>
<p>Попробуй почисти кеш консоли, и удали все сейвы с игрой (рекомендую их скопировать на флешку, потом удалять с консоли). И поиграть. Покапайся к настройках игры, вполне возможно что там настройка языка.</p>
<p>P.S Увы...если даже в игре не русские субтитры и нету русской озвучки, а просто например только меню на русском, то лайв всё равно будет писать что игры поддерживает русский. И денег тебе не вернут. В условиях написано.</p>
<p>Игра работает? Работает. Всё...деньги только могут вернуть только если игра по каким-то причинам не работает.</p>

<p>Я тебе могу множество примеров привести когда на диске игра на русском, а в русском Лайве на английском. Тоже ошибка в Лайве?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Информация о наличии локализации (или её отсутствии) для русского Лайва является очень важной. В такой информации нельзя допускать ошибок. Это моё мнение, не знаю уж, что там в головах "гениев" из MS.</p>

<p>С настройками я повозился тщательно. Так что скорее всего опечатка в лайве. Дозвонился в службу поддержки, заявку приняли, милая девушка сказала, что со мной свяжется непосредственный специалист и будет решать данную проблему. (а по поводу русского меню,
 в игре абсолютно все на английском). В общем если кому интересно через неделю напишу ответ, как мы эту проблему решили.)))</p>

    <title>Can I reset my reputation on live&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I reset my reputation on live&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am just curious about this. I have a rep of 5 starts, but 100% of the people I have played with choose to avoid me, for non obvious reasons, and I don't understand why. I never (usually) talk in game and I have a "Communications" rep of disruptive
 50% and the rest are 0%, and "Behavior" rep of unsporting which is 50%, the rest being 0% aswell. I'm quite confused upon what I have done wrong, and I don't get why I deserve this review, I have gotten some hate filled messages from people on Gears of War
 (The first one, where I decided, since I was bored, to go back and play some matches) with people saying that I suck and I need to "Get the *** off of xbox and this game". Again, why did I get this review? So, if anyone could help me about if I can reset it,
 or why I might have gotten these reviews, that would be wonderful, that you tremendously.</p>

<p>By the way, the only times I choose to talk is to just talk with me team mates, maybe create a friendly discussion, or to say "Good job guys", or if we loose "Nice try guys, we will get them next round". But I get these reviews before I even managed to get
 my mic, and also never do any non sportsmanship type things. Such as teebagging, saying that someones bad, making fun of people, cussing during games. Stuff in that sort.</p>

<p>hello there</p>
<p>haha, this problem happens to everyone now and then, its the internet i guess, so not everyone will be fair and loving. i guess that even though you havent done anything wrong people can still hate you</p>
<p>for example, me, i play alot of shooter online games and if im too good people will hate me or even kick me from their server</p>
<p>so even if i havent done anything wrong people will give me bad rep</p>

<h2>            Complaints about Windows 8 and the lack of a complaints department of sorts</h2>
                    As a computer user with lacking computer knowledge and a costumer who depends on the company providing good and stable products, I have been extremely disappointed by Microsoft and Windows 8.  I've never had any complaints about windows before and I've always had windows on my computers, but with windows 8 there's been so many problems and I've had enough!   Just a few days ago my computer says it needs to install some updates, nothing unusual and it does so fairly often, so I don't think much about it but simply re-start the computer so the updates can be installed. What a mistake! The computer says that a configuration of windows is needed and so it starts configurating.  After a little while it says that it was unable to configurate and is now trying to re-adapt the previous settings. This goes on for half an hour..and one hour...one and half and then I do what it says not to do, I restart the computer. And the same procedure follows. Again and again my computer is stuck, trying to conf

            You are partly to blame . When the updates fail and it says it is returning your computer back to where it was it says
<strong>not</strong> to turn it off. You did you need to just leave it until it is finished and then you will be back to your start page.; which is what happened while you were reading. All this may seem to be a pain in the neck (or else where) but it does
 return your computer to it's usable state.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

            <p>Well, yes, in a way I guess I can take <em>some</em> blame for that, &nbsp;though it shouldn't take hours upon hours for the computer to fix itself. At least I didn't think so and I think most people with the same knowledge of computers as me, would also think
 so. And when the <strong>company</strong> says that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
that specific problem</span> shouldn't take longer than 30 min... I mean I don't have 3 hours every time this problem occurs to let it fix itself, and I am, as I mentioned at the start of the post, not very good at the tech part of computers. My computer is
 a very basic computer, as I see it alot of computers are used majorly by non tech people or people with lacking computer skills, not meaning that they can't use one but simply can't fix it by themselves or understand everything on how one works, so it wouldn't
 be obvious to just sit and wait. Especially when hours go by and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
nothing</span> happens.<br />
<br />
Though I most ad that this problem has occurred again, and thankfully it hasn't taken hours for it to fix itself, but it is still extremely annoying that it keeps happening. And even though it hasn't taken hours, it has taken at least 20 min each time and adding
 up that this seems to happen every other time I use the computer, it does take a lot of time.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Maybe you or someone else could help tell me what the **** is wrong so I can stop it from happening?<br />
I haven't been able to find an answer for it anywhere so help would be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
I get that it has to do with windows and updates for/from windows but how do I know which ones and why can't it configurate them?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, I too am totally fed up with the lack of responsibility displayed by Microsoft year after year. &nbsp;Instead of attempting to fix all the hundreds of errors in their products that they admit exist, they simply don't care and get away with duping computer
 purchasers with new products that don't fix the old problems in product programs they have already been paid for and expect the computer buyers to forget the terrible products Microsoft pawns on the market constantly. &nbsp;Don't know either what is wrong with
 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that is charged with closing done fraudulent sellers like Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I'm done with that approach and I am looking for another operating system and responsible computer manufacturers who use operating systems that work. &nbsp;Anybody else care to join me in the search and support of products that work?</p>

            <p>I'm fortunate that I live near a Microsoft Store , as with Windows 8.1 it averages a trip to their techs every six weeks ! I have always had Windows and no problems , it just seems like 8.1 is the worst lemon of any sort that I have ever seen . If these
 were cars the governments would have issued a general recall . When I repair something It stays fixed , not 8.1 . It keeps doing things that I have not asked it to do , and their so-called " updates " are bandaids on a mortal wound . The Chrome app launcher
 . Oh goodie ! I started my computer this morning and when I wanted to go to an app to my frustration all the apps were gone but 12 , and I cannot access my apps ! WTF , Microsoft ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I do not know if I will buy another Windows product . Windows 10 better be really good .</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is what happens when programmers get carried away with their own ability to make things complex , to them it's simple . The rest of us want a system that is user-friendly , that doesn't change at will (Microsofts will !) and really is straightforward
 and consistent .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my sixty years of all the machines , electronics and technology &nbsp;that I have owned this is the most frustrating ! They obviously have never heard of " Keep It Simple , Stupid ! " Imagine owning a car like that . The headlights go out at night ,
 it changes radio stations all on its own , the engine dies and re-starts randomly , on and on . Well , if 8.1 was a car I'd take it to a crusher and never buy that make again . Oh yeah , I'm a mechanic .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So &nbsp;, one last chance . If I can last that long . Otherwise never again .&nbsp;</p>

            well I just had the worse experience ever with a company. Guess who......Microsoft. It started with my internet explorer stopped working &nbsp;I paid Microsoft to FIX my computer. I bought my first copy of Dos 1.0 in 1981 and have used every version of Dos
 and windows. after about 50 hours with them working on it and 20 hours on hold with them hanging up about 20 times I is resolved. It wont work at all. I lost all my programs and my operating system. In the last 2 days i have been on the line for 9.5 hours
 one day and 4.5 hours the day before. I called for a refund and after three hours of SERVICE they said in 3 to 5 days it should be refunded. Since my credit card was hijacked after i gave it to MICROSOFT i had to canceled the card. I tried to explain that
 to the service person but my Latin was just no good enough to get the message thru to her. I sure if we spoke the same language there would be no problem. It just sounded like lies for hours on end when they kept telling me they were proces

            It's a file you have to edit in notepad in the game directory. I would contact the manufacturer of the game as to what exact file. I personally haven't done it, but I saw that fix on&nbsp;another forums.

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </span>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Repair-WindowsImage -Online -CheckHealth<br />
<br />
Repair-WindowsImage -Online -ScanHealth<br />
<br />
Repair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

<h2>            Windows 10 to Windows 7</h2>
                    I bought a new desktop&nbsp;loaded with&nbsp;Windows 10 but I prefer Windows 7 with my old desktop . Can I uninstall Win 10 and install Win 7 instead with installation CD for Win 7? What could be the complications from such downgrading? (All new&nbsp; desktops, notebooks
 sold in Singapore run on Win 10 only.) Thanks for any advice

<h3> dnear1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Stylus Color 740 stopped working in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>When I first upgraded my desktop to Windows 7, my printer worked fine.&nbsp; I used it at least a few times, even printed through network sharing a couple times.&nbsp; Now, all of a sudden, I can't print anything, even a test page.&nbsp; I tried to remove and reinstall
 but it doesn't seem to help. Moving it to a different USB port also doesn't help.&nbsp; The built-in troubleshooting wizard can't fix the problem either. If I try to make it the default printer, it gives me an error 0x00000709.&nbsp; What else should I try to fix it?
 If I move my USB printer cable to my Dell Mini 10, I can print from it in Windows XP without any trouble.</p>

<p>Please try to add the printer manually:</p>
<div>Click 'Start' &gt; Click 'Devices and Printers'</div>
<div>Click 'Add a Printer'</div>
<div>Click 'Add a Local Printer'</div>
<div>Click 'Create a New Port' &gt; Scroll down to 'Standard TCP/IP Port' &gt; Click 'Next'</div>
<div>Type in the IP address of the Printer and select 'Next'</div>
<div><em>The printer should be found and use the USB driver that you have already installed, if the driver is not utilized you will need to add the driver.</em></div>
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

    <title>Xbox 360 S On But Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 S On But Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Recently my Xbox 360 slim has stopped working. It randomly started a couple of weeks ago. The console froze and when I turned it off it would not come back on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have started by pressing the power button on the console and by using the controller. The green light comes on in the middle, the fan comes on, but nothing comes up on the tv and the controller will not connect. I read where this is an AV issue connecting
 to the TV. I use the component hookups and tried to unplug them and reconnect making sure they were secure. Still will not turn completely on. I also used the HDMI cord from my satellite box to connect the Xbox and that doesn't work either.</p>

<p>Any thoughts or solutions? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You are doing the right steps to investigate this issue. &nbsp;Changing &amp; checking cables and trying a different TV are the lead fixers.</p>
<p>Next try resetting your console display settings, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Make sure that there’s no disc in the disc tray.</p>
<p>2. Turn off the console.</p>
<p>3. Turn on the console.</p>
<p>NOTE &nbsp;If you’re using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, make sure only one wireless controller is connected to the console and then turn off and restart the console by using the Guide button on that controller.</p>
<p>4. As the console starts, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger on the controller. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts. If you only have a wireless controller that is not working
 - try plugging it in with the recharge cable to make it a temporary wired controller.</p>
<p>NOTE for Xbox 360 E or Xbox 360 S console: </p>
<p>To reset display setting on these console models, you can also just turn off the console and then hold the power button on the front of the console down for about 10 seconds. (The lights will flash several times.)</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<p>Hello, &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just thought of something else!</p>
<p>Removing the hard drive is a good step to see if it works without it. &nbsp;Some pics are here :
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../add-remove-hard-drive</a></p>
<p>Alternatively I'd like to ask if you have anything plugged into the USB drives on the front or back of the console? &nbsp;Items such as USB sticks and external hard drives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If so:</p>
<p>1. Turn the console off</p>
<p>2. Remove any usb attachments</p>
<p>3. Turn console on and see if it is working without freezing.</p>
<p>4. You are welcome to attach each one again and test so as to isolate which attachment is the problem.</p>
<p>USB items can prevent the screen showing anything or freeze the console especially if they are starting to fail or have been corrupted in some way.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<h2>            Winows 10 update</h2>
                    Does anyone know the size (in GBytes) of the Windows 10 recent updates?. I think they were referred to as 1703 &amp; 1709.

            Starting with version 1709, only those parts of OS are downloaded which need to be updated. This is called UUP. For example the Windows 10 1709 setup would most probably cost 3 GB for 64 bit through Windows update.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I can sign in to my Microsoft Account on a local account for example maybe just sign in to the Store app itself rather than my whole computer? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, you will not be able to download anything from the Microsoft Store without using a Microsoft account. This has changed since the Anniversary Update. You can now use a local account and download any free apps in the Microsoft Store. However, there
 are still some apps that require a Microsoft account before you can purchase or download them. There are also restrictions when you're not using a Microsoft account such as losing out a number of features to maintain a list of previously owned apps across
 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a local user account or you can use your existing account then access Windows Store. If you're getting any issues, make sure you have the latest Windows update. To check for updates, go to this
