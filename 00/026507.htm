    <title>Lumia 640 XL LTE&#58; two reboots in 15 days with latest patches - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 640 XL LTE&#58; two reboots in 15 days with latest patches installed on WP 8.1 Update 2</h2>
                    <p>Hallo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a proud owner of a Lumia 640 XL LTE since two weeks. I've experienced two sudden reboots just in three different scenarios:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>taking out the phone from my pocket (i heard the motor vibration supposing to read a notification but I saw the Microsoft boot logo on the screen)</li><li>waking up the phone from the glance screen with a double tap to wake. Waked up, the start screen was freezed...just a few secs after the phone automatically rebooted itself</li><li>Apart from this two reboot issues I had one time a fault on luminosity sensor: screen was a bit too black under sunlight and the sensor does not detect this light increment. Turning off the phone myself and turning on again fixed this<br />
</li></ul>
<p>No more reboots at all at the moment. I want to be sure that I'm facing minor software issues and no hardware fault that needs a repair in a service center.</p>
<p>I suspect some kind of software bug due to Glance Screen app. Please be sure that I've updated all my apps as well as I've got the latest system updates (even the one that fixes reboot issue released a few month ago). Here they are my version numbers:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Lumia 640 XL LTE Country Variant IT</li><li>Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2</li><li>SO ver: 8.10.15148.160</li><li>Firmware ver: 02177.00000.15184.36002</li><li>Hardware rev: 3.4.0.0</li><li>Radio Software ver: 401c3.00009.0001</li><li>Soc: 8926</li></ul>
<p>I'm using a new Samung SD card class 10 32gb where I install apps by default (the ones that could be installed on external memory of course). I checked the file system of this new SD card using the official SD CARD tool on my PC: the sd has no corrupted
 file system and it's in a good state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SIM card operator is: Wind Italy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for your information, I used the same (dead) Lumia 920 account when I started my new 640 XL LTE for the first time to have the same apps, preferences and so on configured on this new phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i check some logs in the internal memory to see the issue of the sudden reboot to better understand if is it software based?</p>
<p />

            I did a soft reset a few days before the second reboot. Btw the spontaneous reboots I experienced are just like a soft reset (apart the fact they are unwanted).<br />

            <p>Hi Spulci,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intermittent issues are notoriously difficult to diagnose and resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 640's support <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/da-dk/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA144594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
one-key soft reset</a> so if the power button is held down by accident while in the pocket, the phone may reset. The one-key reset feature seems to work slightly different on different Lumia models, so please test it by holding down the power button while the
 screen is off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LTE is still work-in-progress and your operator may be doing major updates for the mobile network. That in itself may confuse the phone into a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you consult the mobile operator and request a new SIM card. They should provide a replacement for free when the spontaneous restart issue is explained. Just to rule out this variable, since SIM cards do wear out, or become defective or outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always with a new purchase, if there is any doubt regarding a possible defect, please consult the place of purchase, and make sure they note the complaint details in their computers. Such an early complaint makes a warranty claim a lot easier if needed later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no logs on the phone to help explain what is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- <br />

            <p>Hans,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks a lot for your reply. First of all let me share my negative astonishment about the fact that there's no log on the phone: even if searching a log could be considered an advanced "end user" action, I really hope that upon a crash like this every Lumia
 will send a log report to Microsoft servers on the next restart (a notification in that sense should be considered a best practice avoiding silent operations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, I've got more than one week without a restart. I double checked the one button reboot as you told me in your message but reboot time is too long to have unwanted restart, even taking out the phone from a pocket pressing the button accidentally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 4G: Yes, I agree with you that 4G is still a work in progress (especially my operator 4G network). That's why I've got phone fixed on 3G network to preserver battery time and having good coverage. I changed the SIM card 3 years ago, it was one of the
 first that camed out with 4G SIM sticker from my operator....could this cause random restart? Even on 3G. My previous Lumia 920 with this SIM had no restart at all. Again in a few weeks I suppose I will change operator so I will have a new SIM card to put
 inside my Lumia 640 XL LTE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last reboot was quite spontaneous: I camed back home and left my Lumia on the table...double tap the screen to look at the notifications....and left here untouched...after a few seconds I heard the vibrating motor and I saw the Microsoft logo on the screen...it
 restarted...asking me for my SIM card PIN. It's the second time the phone restarted itself in the same place (table on my living room). Some weeks ago it restarted outside on the bus a few seconds after I got out from my pocket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I don't want to send it to the service center just beacuse I suspect more a software defect and no hardware issue at all (even if the reboot may have caused by external components like the SIM card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep you informed.</p>
<p>

            <p>I also sometimes miss a log file on the phone, especially for ActiveSync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Phone 8.1 reports usage statistics through Settings &gt; Feedback when the option is enabled. I suppose it also reports app and phone crashes whenever possible, but even if it does, everybody is currently focused on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia 640 is first in line to receive Windows 10 Mobile when it is ready, which will then get further updates rolling out during the summer. It has an option to send error reports and other comments to Microsoft manually, along with the automated telemetry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your feedback.</p>

            Hi! I'm having the same problem. I sent my 640XL LTE twice for repair (official Microsoft repair / care center). The first time, the display was changed but the random reboots continued. The second time I sent the phone for repair, they returned it with
 a note saying "No Issue Found" so, nothing was made besides a "software update". Are you still facing the same problems? Thanks.

            <p>I tried a third chance sending the phone to B2X service center....they sent the phone back for the third time changing screws (yes just screws on the back) and stating "no issue found". I'm afraid but this is the worst service I ever met as a customer!!!</p>
<p>A previous B2X phone call assured me that I could have request a new phone just putting previous repair receipt with a letter inside the phone....but it was just a wrong information. My phone returned with the same problem!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft it's out of phone business...right but it has to provide right support to their previous customer. I'm loosing faith for the fact that MS is paying B2X a fortune for their customer service....I shipped three times the phone from Rome to Hungary
 lab using DHL...they also shipped it back to me with DHL. Add the cost to state that the phone has no issue and time to change screws....a refurbished Lumia would cost a lot less, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I'm now an owner of a Lumia 950XL......and right, this model has NO random reset or memory disruption like me previous 920. My 640 XL LTE is a faulty unit..........</p>
<p>
</p><p>And let me state clearly: NOKIA service level was far better than this "free shipment service around Europe".</p>

            <p>Hi Spulci,</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>Your described problem is&nbsp;exactly my problem. I'm sending my 640XL back for a third time with the previous receipts; Any way, I know nothing will happen. I had a 920 before and never had issues. My sister has a 640 and has no issues related to random reboots.
 I guess my unit, like yours, is a faulty one too.</p>
<p>I'll write here what happened in a few weeks.</p>

<h2>            outlook 2010 color codes for multiple accounts</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using 3 different accounts in my outlook 2010 (private, business, gmail). I placed all incoming emails in one folder via some rules.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that in a previous outlook version I was able to give incoming emails of every account a different color. So I had three incoming mail colors.</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to do this in outlook 2010?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am NOT searching cor color coding on subjects or specific email addresses, but strictly on an accounts basis.</div>

                    I am highlighting this again because this could be security risk.Through accident i noticed while on laptop on xbox live my sons personal name was appearing below gamertag. I then went and checked his xbox &nbsp;settings and changed all, no, name bio, no location
 but yet real name still appeared on xbox live on laptop. My gamertag was doing the same.The rest of my family xbox accounts were normal.The two accounts showing real names hotmail accounts added to my windows preview build on my lumia 635 phone.I also have

 kids names are been displayed on xbox live on pc. My &nbsp;fix for this was i changed mine and sons name on outlook to our gamertags and now our gamertags show up instead of real names.This is not xbox issue.Anyone who rea

                    In this build and the previous build Outlook 2016 (Office 365 Home) won't open or opens then freezes and closes then won't restart. Online repair in Office doesn't repair the problem and all other suggestions i could locate had no effect on the problem.

<p>Yes, I know about the release note about hanging on <em><strong>launch</strong></em>. I understand the importance of reading and understanding the release notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what is described here in this thread is not the same issue. The picture I attached is stated as being what happens after changing the selected folder three times. This is not a launch hanging BUT it is being prone to crashing in use after the program
 has launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important that we try to contribute by giving more details about a problem when the problem is demonstrably much more broad than the issue identified in the release notes.</p>

<p>What happens with my Outlook (Office version 1705) is that it will open to the emails but when anything is clicked on the program freezes. Windows then tries to restart the program but it doesn't restart. When it tries to restart I get a notice saying: C:\Users\(my
 user name)\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\(my email address).ost cannot be opened. On closing that box, I get this: Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. This problem started with Insider build
 16184. I have Norton antivirus as a security program.</p>

<p>It appears I got Outlook to work without freezing.&nbsp; I unchecked "Use Cahced Exchange Mode" in Mail Settings through the Control Panel.&nbsp; Let me know if this helped others.&nbsp; I know this is not an actual fix but a work around.&nbsp; At least this will allow you
 to use Outlook until the next Build.</p>

<p>The same thing is happening to me since the latest build.<br />
I have yet to access my email with Outlook 2016</p>
<p>When I open it I see it attempting to sync (send/receive) and each time it might download just one of the emails from the server and then it hangs and looks like pictured.<br />
<br />
It will often freeze as soon as I try to click on an email or it will freeze after a few seconds if I do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope they come up with a fix soon. I can not access my email or saved emails.</p>

    <title>numbering folders in outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alisons56  say:</h3>
<h2>            numbering folders in outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I like to keep to number list my folders 1. January, 2. February, 3. March etc.&nbsp; The problem is that when I get to 10. October, 11. November, they line up under January.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way round this in Outlook 2010?&nbsp; I've tried removing the full stop, putting in a dash, but it deosn't fix it.&nbsp; It's not an issue when I use the number set up for folders on our network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Insider Build 10240 &#40;TH1&#41; still not installed after 10 days - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harryreusken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insider Build 10240 &#40;TH1&#41; still not installed after 10 days - Is it the distribution process that fails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Altough there are already several posts on this subject I start a fresh one to find out how many other insider-collegues face the same problem, still&nbsp;TH1 (build 10240) NOT installed, so close to July 29?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The route I followed&nbsp;was ISO 10074 dutch with US as additional language, ISO 10130 dutch, skipped 10158, update 10162, update 10166 and now awaiting 10240 update&nbsp;for more than 10 days. Since july 15&nbsp;just a few minor updates were installed, mainly language
 pack and office related (not a single&nbsp;Defender Update however!). Numerous checks for updates all ended with "your PC is up to date". One time however, Windows Update search took very long and ended with error 0x800705b4. No idea why that was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed and tried all&nbsp;suggestions, "solutions", hints and more from the other posts on this subject to solve the problem. All to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;other PC (US english) that followed the same route, received Build 10240 automatically without a single problem. Since July 15 many additional updates are installed (mainly security and Defender related).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both PC's are on the fast track and download from other pc's local and on the network is ON. Both PC's logged on with an MSA account with admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm questioning Microsofts distribution algorithm, hence this post to find out how many insiders still&nbsp;haven't received&nbsp;TH1 (Build 10240) .</p>

<p>Hello Gert, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The prompt message is a gentle reminder to ensure the files that you check or edit is up-to-date. It's to avoid closing the files without an assurance that the changes you have made is unsaved. If you decide to turn off the prompt message in your browser,
 we recommend turning off your pop-up blocker. To know how, check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17479/windows-internet-explorer-11-change-security-privacy-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Kindly
 follow the workaround, under <strong>Pop-up Blocker</strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Ernie San,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but turning off the pop-up blocker does not solve the issue.</p>
<p>Please try to do it yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that when you drag and drop a file into the internet explorer this will not open.</p>
<p>I had to adjust some registry entries:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\AttachmentExecute\{0002DF01-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]<br />
"Word.Document.8"=hex(0):<br />
"Word.Document.12"=hex(0):<br />
"Word.DocumentMacroEnabled.12"=hex(0): </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Word.Document.8]<br />
"BrowserFlags"=dword:80000024</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Word.Document.12]<br />
"BrowserFlags"=dword:80000024</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Word.DocumentMacroEnabled.12]<br />
"BrowserFlags"=dword:80000024</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I also found is that it works fine on a 24"screen when the internet session is maximized.</p>
<p>When I drop the file into a minimized screen, and push back the message appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you guys will try to reproduce it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :-)</p>

    <title>Maximum amount of email migration batches that can be submitted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Maximum amount of email migration batches that can be submitted</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>As part of our Office 365 email migration strategy, we have decided to create a unique batch for each an every mailbox to be migrated. This allows us to use a home made fully automated migration framework while keeping easy the management of the migration
 process.</p>
<p>We however hit a limit of a maximum of 100 simultaneous batches that can be submitted. Once this amount of batches created, we need to wait until all of they are completed, delete the completed jobs and then we can submit the next batches. This is a bit
 annoying knowing we have a few thousands of mailboxes to move.</p>
<p>Is not there any way to increase the maximum total of batches that can be submitted? Even if all of them are not being processed simultaneously.</p>

<p>Thank you for your hints.</p>

<h2>            How do I reset auto complete for a particular web site&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running IE8, went to a web site that requiers a user id/password. I entered them and when IE8 asked me if I wanted to save the id/password I said no. I'd like to change this now and have IE8 save the id and password but cant figure out how to do it.
 I dont really want to delete all of my other/existing autocomplete info (I have autocomplete info for a number of other sites already saved).<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Karltl,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try these steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet explorer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on tools</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select Internet options</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on security tab and click on custom level tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Scroll till the end of the window and select “Prompt for user name and password”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Check the option and restart Internet explorer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can even try the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Navigate to Tools/Internet Options/Content/AutoComplete Settings, and check all the options listed in this location</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Next navigate to Tools/Internet Options/Security/Trusted Sites and add all the sites you go, that you trust of course, and require login/pass. This will help the
 AutoComplete section.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Once done with this step, head over to the Privacy Tab, click on the Advance button and tick "Override automatic cookie handling" and use "Prompt for both First
 Party &amp; Third Party Cookies.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For the next couple or few weeks, this will be a bit annoying as every time you go into a site, it will ask you whether or
 not you want to set/allow a cookie instead of just ____ you with it. After a while, you will no longer get ask since you always visit the same sites with the exception of the new sites you visit.

&gt; How can I tell autocomplete I've changed my mind about a particular site<br />
&gt; and would like it to save my id and password?<br />
<br />
<br />
The only easy case is when you have allowed AutoComplete to save the userid<br />
but not the password. Then you can delete the userid in the same way that<br />
you can delete any AutoComplete form item and you would then be prompted<br />
that you were deleting a userid/password pair (where the password was not<br />
saved and always prompted). Otherwise, you might be lucky and be able to<br />
reset that login by deleting the site's Cookies. I would use ProcMon in<br />
conjunction with PSPV to try to figure out any other workarounds.<br />
Typically I think you will see that there are hidden registry values and<br />
that the only control of them the user has is deleting all saved passwords.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<h2>            Why is Microsoft not listening to us customers and trying to force this bad minimal operating system on us&#63;  Give us a full operating system like windows 7</h2>
                    <p><span>In most business’s if a product does not sell they learn from that and make a complete product change to what the consumers want?</span></p>
<p><span>For those of us that do not want a cell phone or tablet operating system that is in my opinion only good for social media or watching YouTube and Netflix.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have a tablet and cannot stand to use it except for watching things on it.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have a tablet and cannot stand to use it except for watching things on it.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 does it all even watching DVD’s without having to add software, programs or apps, why is Microsoft not offering a system like that? That can do it all, made for desktop use and staying away from having to buy or use apps?</span></p>
<p><span>I think this is a bad trend of supplying a cheap operating system and then charging the consumers for apps to make it functional. Some apps are pay once for each computer but like Microsoft office I am afraid
<strong>they will all become a monthly fee to use</strong>. Add that up for one or multiple computers and your cheap operating system has become very expensive. (Office 365 at 9.99 per month or $99 per year, you could buy office home and student for $149 and
 you owned it forever. )</span></p>
<p><span>I have used XP, Vista, W7, W8, W8.1, and W10 preview so I have tried them so I am not just making a decision based on, I do not like change. It is based on ease of use (a full start menu where everything can be reached or found from there like W7),
 full functionality without adding programs software or apps, appearance – you have to admit the Glass look of Windows 7 blows away the boxy cartoony look of 8, 8.1, and 10.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I use all systems on desktop, laptop, or tablet as desktop.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I use all systems on desktop, laptop, or tablet as desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>One system for all has not and will not make everyone happy and will not work in all instances so stop forcing this on us and give us consumers the choices we are asking for and frankly that we need.</span></p>
<p><span>I would especially like to here from Microsoft to answer as to why they cannot or will not supply a good looking (Windows 7 glass), full&nbsp;operating system that can do it all&nbsp;and does not&nbsp;rely on apps. Desktop and Business users do not and cannot understand
 why you are pushing us away from your systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Very disappointed!</span></p>

</p><p>Heh - the converse is also true - should it be free then it will competitively be evaluated against other OS's. &nbsp;It's "fitness" to perform it's role will be based on it's ability to do what users demand in a way they find convenient and/or pleasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a fine and arguable distinction between customers and users.</p>
<p>Our definition will vary but our definition is moot - what matters more is the definition by Microsoft and the product managers of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I am not a fan of the look and feel of some of the OS currently. &nbsp;The minimal design of some of the apps and features feel like they have a poor UI design aesthetic. &nbsp;There are some parts that are good but there is a lot of room for improvement.
 &nbsp;The new Video Preview application looks and feels like it was developed by an CS Intern in a week. &nbsp;Music Preview is a little better and feels more polished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I understand why many OS's are taking a more unified approach with the UI across all platforms - I feel that they are missing the point. &nbsp;I don't think UI's on mobiles and desktops should have an identical look and feel - they should have a similar
 look and feel - they should have the same usability - but that is different from being identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we have now is a necessary step in the evolution of desktop OS's - and you see the same approach using used by Apple, MS, Canonical - they will realize their mistake at some point and take a more Google centric approach but not before Google take a
 large chunk of the market.</p>

<p>Any user is a customer and they want their operating system user share to increase, it does not increase as Windows 8 has shown while Windows 7 user's have gone up. Market share, user, customers, what ever term you want to use&nbsp;most of us want a Windows 7,
 aero and desktop style system without app's or&nbsp;a metro screen of any kind.</p>
<p>I hope 3rd party programs like start8 and window blinds have the 10 preview and they are working on making there products functional&nbsp;for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of all I hope Microsoft gives options so we do not have to use&nbsp;3rd party programs to make the system look, feel, and act how we want it to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I totally agree!!!! FREE win10 means that you are no longer a customer, but are now just a user. and that just the point, MS wants windows users by the danglers so they can push any agenda they deem fit<br />

            <p>The enterprise version is not free, and for paying customers of Windows 10 enterprise, it's not significantly different from the free version except for the addition of features like&nbsp;Windows To Go, DirectAccess, BranchCache, and AppLocker. &nbsp;This does not
 in any way address the serious UI problems with Windows 10, nor its overall experience as a Microsoft AppStore/Subscription/Clickbait front end.</p>

<h3> jessie_is_my_name  say:</h3>
<h2>            Convert Access 97 to Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>What's the best way to convert Access 97 to Access 2013. I know about the file extensions changing with Access 2007, and know I cannot convert directly. What is the easiest way to accomplish this? Access 2007 or 2010? Will&nbsp;2003 work? Please help, I have
 a lot of data I need to transfer over 800 customers and need to move it off a old computer running XP to a new computer running WIN8 (which will not let me install Office 97 - surprise - surprise.)

            I did a trial run on another computer (97 to 2003), it's giving me some error messages. First it said I needed to download Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 8 or later. I tried to download it but it said it was unavailable. Also it's telling me I have unsafe
 expressions. It will let me open the database and everything seems to be there but the error messages pop up every time I open the file. Any suggestions? Will all my reports transfer?

            <p>I wouldn't waste the time with the 2003 step. </p>
<p>(Still an MDB file that 2013 will refuse to open)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access 2007 (and apparently 2010 also?) will convert MDB files to ACCDB files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Rick Fisher's <strong><a href="http://www.rickworld.com/products.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and Replace utility</a></strong>&nbsp;to easily convert all "As Database" references to "As DAO.Database" (as well as&nbsp;"As Recordset" to "As DAO.Recordset")</p>

<p>
</p><p>Compile</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the app in Access 2013 (or Access 365).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have both 2007 and 2013 (365) versions installed on this PC, and can now open my converted Access97 files using either version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, there were some glitchy things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I had a main form with two cascading subforms.</p>
<p>The second subform's&nbsp;LinkMaster was based on a text-box on the main form that, in turn, got it's value from the current record in "subform one"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The value contained in the text-box was numeric, but Access 2013 assumed it to be textual ... causing an intermittent mis-match of data type(?) resulting in an empty "subform 2".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the "Format" property of the text-box and changed it to "General Number" and the problem appears to be corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My client currently has my app running in "test mode" (so to speak) where I have asked him to post in both the existing Access97 app on his existing WinXP machine, AND with the Access 2013 / Win7&nbsp; combination machine before "going live"&nbsp; in September.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far ... no calls.</p>

            <p>AFAIK, Sue ... You're out of luck, and will have to buy an "intermediate version of Access" in order to convert an MDB to ACCDB file format.</p>

            Buy, or hire a consultant with the necessary tools. It should only take an hour or two to do a basic conversion, after which you can clean up the code in the new version.

<h2>            Windows Defender window closes as immediately after opening.</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I saw the other thread...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation is about two weeks old - got my first SSD and did a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One update pending: Feature update to Windows 10, version 1803</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have run both SFC and DISM</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, high contrast is not on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only other anti-malware running is Malwarebytes, and I tried shutting that down but Defender still immediately quits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related services that I know to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Services: Was set to Manual. When I set it to Automatic and clicked Start I received the following reply:
<ul>
<li>The Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection Service service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs.</li><li>Upon clicking "OK" to save automatic startup the following notification appeared: "Access is denied."</li></ul>
</li><li>Windows Defender Antivirus Network Inspection Service: Running</li><li>Windows Defender Antivirus Service: Running</li><li>Windows Defender Firewall: Running</li><li>Windows Defender Security Center Service: Running</li></ul>
<p>That is about all I know at this point. I have fallen way behind on my technical abilities so please, if you have some next instructions for me, use the big letter/tiny words and pictures version!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you!!!</p>

<p><span>None of the Services need to be reconfigured; but it wouldn’t hurt to restart the Security Center Service, and then check the Security Center (Control Panel &gt; Security and Maintenance) to see if any issues were detected there. I’m still presuming that
 your issue is with the Windows Defender Security Center UI crashing (without stopping the service), and that this issue persists after installing the Version 1803 update – and of course that you’ve already tried launching the WDSC app with the notification-area
 icon; and with the Start menu; and with a taskbar shortcut.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can only speculate that the crashing might be the effect of a problem with video drivers, or of a bug included in the KB4093112 update. But you can always research/post the problem at the Feedback Hub, and see if there’s a more general issue with
 opening the WDSC app. If the issue wasn’t resolved by the Version 1803 update, then the chances for fixing it with a reset probably aren’t good – so you might want to just give things some time to settle in, and then eventually do a clean install of Version
 1803.</span></p>

<p><span>The biggest time slice in the Automatic Maintenance package is taken up by the Defender Quick Scan, and that can run pretty long on the first couple of passes after a version update, since the
 engine is preoccupied with rebuilding its cache of trusted files “on the fly”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Windows Defender Antivirus Service isn’t running consistently, then you probably should install a free third-party AV app – unless you have the paid version of Malwarebytes and you want
 to trust it for your AV protection. You can’t go without reliable real-time protection of some sort:</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>Version 12.0 is nothing but Outlook 2007 version that is installed on your computer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the information, based on the account type that you have configured in Outlook, the Recall this message option should work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets try removing and re-adding the account and check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still fails, create a new profile, configure the email account in new profile and check if the option works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link to know how to create new profile:</p>

<br />
does anybody know where can i find one?<br />
Microsoft US refer me to seek help from Microsoft Malaysia,<br />
Microsoft Malaysia ask me to get it from Nokia Malaysia,<br />
Nokia Malaysia said this product is not supported as it's not available in Malaysia.<br />
so here i am to seek help in Nokia US. pls help....</p>

<p>If you don't get the help you need from Nokia in the US, perhaps you could try going back to Nokia Malaysia and ask for the appropriate MSDS for the battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's likely the same model of&nbsp;battery&nbsp;will be used in phones available in Malaysia and the lithium

            Nokia Malaysia will not have that document as their resources are limited to those phone models released in Malaysia. You cannot even have that repaired in Malaysia even if you force to because they will not have parts for it.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if Nokia USA will be able to provide the document given that the phone was not supposed to be sold and used outside of the US.
