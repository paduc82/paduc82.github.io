                    <p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/xjbw5azbbiiax6u/Minidumps.zip?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has been crashing a lot everyday [BSOD] at least once an hour mostly with Kernel Security Check Failure, occasionally with APC Index Mismatch and others such as Driver Overan Stack Buffer [more not included]. Attached are minidump files of the
 most recent crashes in the last day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have already tried replacing the RAM, wiping the computer completely and updating drivers through device manager. Hopefully someone with keen eyes can help identify what is causing this/these issue/s. Crashing occurs when logging on after a crash, playing
 games, using Chrome or just on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Windows 10] from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! :)</p>

The issue could be due to some third party programs. I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot and Check if the issue persists.

            Thanks for reply to my post. Appreciate you're time and effort!&nbsp;It set me of on a helpfull and informative journey. Followed the directions as described in you're reply and ended up at a support session with MS(Microsoft) personell online. That did not
 either resolve the problem but got me closer to an acceptable answer in my mind. MS representative told me that Zune wasn't ready yet it seemed for Win10 as it couldn't be solved through our remote desktop session. So I have to keep an open eye for an update
 addressing the problem I was asked by MS. It's truly a pity this situation due to the drawback of me not getting my Lumia connected and synced properly to the PC for file transfers. c^^;)

    <title>Why discontunie skype classic&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why discontunie skype classic&#63;</h2>
                    There is a reason people downgraded back to classic. the new skype you can no longer see if you're contacts are online *how are you supposed to talk to people when noone knows who is online or not?)<br />
<br />
I get it that sometimes you need to enhance skype but to totally change what people love about skype is just a slap in the face of people who use skype. nothing wrong with adding new features but once you mess with the ease of use or the design to the point
 it is unuseable that is crossing the line

            Based on customer feedback, Microsoft is extending support for Skype 7 (Skype classic) for some time. <br /><br />You can provide feedback here:<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a><br /><br />You can see the post detailing this change here <a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade-to-the-latest-version-of-skype-for-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade...</a><br /><br />Since we are being discouraged to suggest downgrading to the classic version but after many advices you still are having troubles, then you can try installing Classic Skype here <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>sorry but no no and no&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)first if you want to rebuild Skype from the ground(and it's never gonna work since Skype was always rebuild a few times on the classic model ONLY and that's why it was a success story )do it as a beta and improve the versions till everything are going
 to be good enough for the mass users from design to features to stability and more and get a Skype feel to it&nbsp; if u want users&nbsp; to migrate to the new versions&nbsp; people actually need to&nbsp; like it in order to use the new version now it's simply not the case
</p>
<p>2)and sorry but no again engineering&nbsp; resources can't be limited in a company that worth billions (income in 2018&nbsp; up till now is 65 billion )not to mention that a thinking mind can develop new ideas and creations solutions so sorry you can do better than
 that !</p>

<p>2. Double clicking pictures gives 2 errors (which I can't even capture cause the first locks the screen and when pushing print screen the on drive pops up) after clicking okay on the first I get the error again (which is the attached photo), however when
 I say open with windows preview then it's fine.<br />

            <p>Good Day&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am using an administrator account, well I've had this laptop for the last 2 years... and this issue started with my move to windows 10 from 8 which if I recall happened on 26/05/2016<br />
<br />
I understand how safe mode works, but I will give it a try however won't be able to prove/disprove if winamp could start running .wma files again.. as said I have my home pc which doesn't have the above mentioned issue... the only change on my pc was the change
 from windows 8 - 10&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I will give the safe mode a try after work and let you know</p>

            I apologize for the delay<br />
<br />
I have attempted that as well, I went on there forums and apparently it's something people are experiencing even upgrading from 7-8.1&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Cause I tried the following which was suggested<br />
<br />
1. Default WMA files to play from winamp (which it was), still didn't work<br />
2. Enabling Admin functionality (can't remember entirely)<br />
3. The last was installing a windows 10 n or kn media file.. (which I have yet to try)<br />
<br />
But the rest didn't fix the issue, I am aware, that I am pointing more towards the winamp issue but it is a general issue for example double clicking an image even on skype will give me the error)

    <title>Windows Update and Fast Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertczanstke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update and Fast Startup</h2>
                    <p>My computer is incompatible the the fast startup option in windows. I don't know exactly what causes it, but if the option is enabled and the computer restarted, the sound card does not function at all, and the video and operating system lags for several
 seconds every time an action is performed. This is solved by turning off the option in power settings and restarting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem, however, is every so often, typically after an update, the fast startup option is turned back on without my knowledge or input. This is incredibly frustrating, as the feature is completely useless to me, and worse than that, negatively effects
 my computer. Beyond that, with my current hardware setup, starting up the computer takes less than 10 seconds even without this option enabled, rendering this feature pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm sure that this is not the only setting that windows is changing during updates. Looking now, it appears it is changing privacy options as well, which is just shady, and completely deplorable, but that is a subject for a separate discussion. But this
 all leads to my point: there is a reason I changed the settings the way I did, and having them reset after every update is immensely stupid, and that is putting it nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is this: How do I prevent Windows from re-enabling settings which I have disabled?</p>

<p>Every console comes with a free month for up to 3 gamertags. It's only available during the account creation process by choosing yes to Join Live and then choosing Upgrade Later when it gives you the gold options. If the trial is available, it automatically
 gives it to you.</p>

<p>the free trial is ONLY for new accounts not existing ones. &nbsp;if you create a new account and have a valid form of payment (cc or paypal) you will get the free trial just make sure you turn off the auto renewal before your month is up or they will charge that
 payment when the month runs out. &nbsp;you cannot set up the free trial without a payment on file or it will not work.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has wiped my computer</h2>
                    <p>Please please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came to my PC yesterday and ALL my programs have been removed. Everything I use daily -- and have purchased legitimately - has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even worse - I cannot reinstall from my original disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get rid of Windows 10. I cannot use Settings - Restore as this is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really find this appalling. To my mind this is downright theft. You have in effect stolen all my programmes. I am now unable to work. All my accounting software has gone - my adobe products - even my legitimate Microsoft products have gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do this to people you must surely have a fix? I need to go back to windows 8 -- are you supplying free copies to enable this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel completely scammed by Microsoft. Totally appalling.</p>

            <p>Hi, first of all welcome to the community.</p>
<p>I understand your frustration here, I'd have the same feeling if something like this happens</p>
<p>But can you answer a few questions which will help solve your issue-</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you recently install any new software that might have caused this? (Downloaded a file from an untrusted source)</li><li>Was this an effect of a recent update to your pc?</li><li>Was a hardware change done in recent memory?</li></ul>
<p>If you had a recent backup. You can try recovering your PC from it... If you have a recovery disk, try using it</p>
<p>Also, are all system apps gone?</p>
<p>Note - Apps purchased from the windows store can be redownloaded for free as they're saved under your ms account!</p>
<p>Keep me updated!</p>

            <p>HELLO</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you recently install any new software that might have caused this? (Downloaded a file from an untrusted source) NO - THIS HAPPENED AFTER WINDOWS DID AN UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><li>Was this an effect of a recent update to your pc? YES</li><li>Was a hardware change done in recent memory? NO
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that Windows 10 has done a recent upgrade which has caused this?</p>
</li><li>
<p>

<p>The software I have cannot seemingly be re-installed.... some is via download -- others are on disk.</p>

            <p>hi Sue,</p>
<p>If file explorer is working, transfer the software to an external drive and try reinstalling windows... You could also restore a restore point created before the update or restore a backup which possible won't cause deletion of important software. To go
 back to 8.1, you must do so within 30 days of updating to 10, so it might not be an option any longer</p>
<p>hope this helps sort it out. Great to help</p>

            <p>thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did think of these options -- however yes it is too late to go back to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other restore points - or factory settings - are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the original disks to re-install the OS. I have the software but the new OS will not let me install -- or indeed uninstall the old versions.</p>

 She did not scold me for not reading 10 pages of terms and conditions or not having backed up personal files since last summer.

</span><span><span><span>#Windows10</span></span></span><span> will eventually do a forced update on all PC
</span><span><span><span>#computers</span></span></span><span> but if you haven't updated to

<h2>            My disc tray won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t open, tried most tricks.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a first generation Xbox 360 arcade. About 2 years back, me being the retard I was when I was 12, I opened the Xbox completely. You can see the motherboard, the faceplate and the plastic behind that is removed. I can remove the disc try from the 360
 whenever I want (it's next to me now, it won't open), and the power button's exposed. I could post a pic if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well the problem is that the tray won't open. I got a disc unreadable error, so I took the game out, and closed it. I think I turned the Xbox off at that point, then turned it back on. Now the tray won't open at all. Also, the button you click to
 open the tray for the disc drive is gone for me too. Whenever I click Y to eject, it makes a sound as if it's trying to open, but can't. I tried the paperclip trick, but since I have much of the front of the Xbox removed, I can't really tell which hole to
 put it in (no pun intended). All and any help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Feedback for Windows Media Player 11 and 12&#40;windows 7&#41; - Video playing issue&#33;</h2>
                    Sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When playing videos through WMP the video size(resolution) does not fit the screen especially on LCD monitor. It is not so with KM Player or VLC Player. When we play video through KM Player there is an option called Video overscan, or video stretch, when
 we choose this option the video (frame) stretches to full screen. In VLC,&nbsp; in order to get the full screen (full size video) on LCD monitor we have to adjust "aspect ratio" to 16:9 for Wide screen monitor. In Windows Media Player (wmp 11 and wmp in windows
 7) even if you adjust , it does not fit the screen. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please improve this feature in the future version of wmp. I don't play videos in Windows Media player because of this issue.<br />
<br />

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>I also have this issue with Win 8 x64 and I am not sure when it began doing this. I have gone into explorer and selected the option to hide the system files but it always turns back on. In fact I click it and it toggles off then back on. I cannot get this
 to hide the files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now I also get the dektop.ini opening in notepad when I start windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you please tell me how I can prevent this?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like you to inform that Desktop.ini is a system file which deals with common folders such as Downloads, Documents, Pictures, and Music etc. When a change is made in these folders, Desktop.ini is updated. It's nothing to worry about, the file
 is same and it won't do any damage to your PC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to fix the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press windows key + E.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on view on the top of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Once you click on view, choose options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on change folder and search options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the View tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check 'Hide Protected Operating System Files'.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also remove Desktop.ini from the start up items:</span></p>

<p><b><span>Reference:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Clean Boot</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            VMware Fusion&#58; Upgrade to Windows 7 virtual machine using Windows 7 upgrade disc and having Windows XP full installation disc.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a current installation of Windows 7 that was upgraded from Windows XP on my MacBook Pro using a Windows 7 Professional upgrade disc and an existing Windows XP Professional&nbsp;virtual machine as proof of previous purchase of a full Windows installation
 disc. Recently, the Windows 7 virtual machine&nbsp;appears to have become corrupted and is slowing down my entire system. I would like to create a brand new Windows 7 virtual machine; however, having deleted the Windows XP virtual machine, I now have only the Windows
 7 Professional&nbsp;upgrade disc and my original Windows XP Professional&nbsp;full installation disc. Can I use these to create a new VMware Fusion Windows 7 virtual machine?</p>

<p>Hi RobertS209,</p>
<p>Yes, you can create a new VMware Fusion Windows 7 virtual machine by using the available discs.</p>
<p>Upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 does not save your settings or installed software. A fresh install of Windows 7 is created and old documents and programs are placed in c:\Windows.old. You cannot run the programs that are carried over; all applications
 must be reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I suggest that you follow the steps mentioned in the below link:</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading a VMware Fusion virtual machine from Windows XP to Windows 7:

<p>For any further suggestions I would suggest that you contact VMware on this issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro cannot connect to Internet.</h2>
                    <p>I have updated my Toshiba A300 laptop from Vista to Windows 7 Pro and also updated to Internet Explorer 11.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to connect the browser to the internet via any of the three options, (one at a time) wireless, lan and 4g wireless dongle, I have updated the system drivers and both are showing that they are working and the dongle is also showing connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked so many YouTube videos and so many forums that I am just about to give up!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even downloaded Firefox on my desktop and installed it on the laptop with the same response, and then deleted it&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one message that keeps appearing is "Local area connection doesn't have a valid IP configuration" I have tried to change the settings many times but still no internet connection via any/all of my network connections.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They show that I am connected but I cannot access the internet via IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure this is a Microsoft problem and am disappointed that there isn't a readily available solution on their website to fix the problem.</p>

            <p>It is rare that this kind of problem is caused by the operating system.&nbsp; It usually involves your router and/or modem.&nbsp; Try this procedure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>First, it is possible that your Internet Service is down. However, that is not likely the case. If you are using a broadband service — telephone line based (DSL) or cable — it is more likely the Internet server that you are connected to, has gotten confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>95% of the time, the solution is fairly simple. You have a modem that your phone line or cable is connected to and maybe a router too. In some cases the router is part of the modem. The router (if you have one) is connected by an Ethernet cable (it looks
 like a telephone wire but has bigger ends and thicker wire) to the modem. Then your computer is connected to the router using another Ethernet cable, or it could be wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are going&nbsp;to disconnect the <strong><em>power</em></strong> cables from both devices at the device end, but
<strong>before you do that, be warned</strong>. They both look the same and if when you reconnect, you put the wrong one in, you can destroy the device. So keep track of which one is which. Better yet, label them before you remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you have both a modem and a router:</em></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Disconnect the power cables from <strong>both</strong> the modem and the router.</li><li>Wait 30 seconds.</li><li>Connect the power to the modem.</li><li>Wait 30 seconds.</li><li>Connect the power to the router.</li><li>Wait about 2 minutes.</li></ol>
<p><em>If your router is part of your modem:</em></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Disconnect the power cables from the modem.</li><li>Wait 30 seconds.</li><li>Connect the power to the modem.</li><li>Wait about 2 minutes.</li></ol>
<p>That should restore the connection to your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; This sequence is crucial.&nbsp; Follow it exactly</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 7 ultimate updates - stuck on &#34;checking for updates&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately I've been experiencing a problem that never appeared before and would like to have your opinion about it.</p>
<p>I have a HP compaq laptop (quite old) that came with Win7 home OEM pre-installed. A year ago, I have upgraded to Win10 home.</p>
<p>Since I am not satisfied with Win10 on my laptop, I've decided to completely format my hard-disk and re-install Win7 on my own, using one of my previous licenses (not the OEM license).</p>
<p>Installation and activation were successful, but the Windows update agent is not working as expected. It's been stuck on "checking for updates" during the whole night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My troubleshooting attempts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Reset all Windows update components following the KB (although there was nothing to reset).</p>
<p>2. netsh winsock reset</p>
<p>3. Checked for SFC errors - sfc /scannow - no errors.</p>
<p>4. Used the Windows update readiness tool for Win7 x64.</p>
<p>5. Performed in-place upgrade just to make sure I've tried everything.</p>
<p>6. Connected the laptop to the router via Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>7. Tested the media on a VM - when attempting on a VM, the updates work fine, however I don't see a reason why my hardware would affect it at all.</p>
<p>8. Reset the WUAUSERV service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also mention that it used to work fine before. Even after those attempts, it is still stuck on "checking for updates" for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's quite a case, but I would really appreciate a professional answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hello Din,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model number of your HP Compaq laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also realize the inconvenience you are experiencing due to Windows update issue. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or due to errors in the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this fact that you performed in-place upgrade. However, some software conflicts may prevent Windows to check for updates. Errors in the hard drive may also cause this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot and check </strong>the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run check disk </strong>and see if it helps. Please follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Click Start, type <strong>cmd </strong>in start search box, right click <strong>
cmd </strong>in search results and click <strong>run as administrator.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In command prompt, type the following command and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check disk may take some time to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've already done that on my own but manually. </p>
<p>Those things don't seem to work and furthermore, I have to re-mention that the same OS (same media) is well-functioning on a VM, without me having to reconfigure and repair any component. The issue is occurring only on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to re-install all HP drivers for the same laptop.</p>
<p>What else can you recommend?</p>

            Does the Windows update service work on safe-mode with networking? If yes, I will try to do it from safe-mode and send you my report after the attempt.

</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update service does not run in safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would suggest you to <strong>disable any antivirus software and firewall
</strong>which may be active and then check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as
 soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that this was a clean installation from scratch (after disk zeroing) and no program has been installed so far except Google Chrome (issue occurred also before Google Chrome installation) - no security program, no antivirus, Windows defender
 service is disabled and firewall is in its default mode.</p>
<p>Again, the same default settings work fine on a VM but when installed on my HP laptop, the issue appears (I have tried to re-install the OS about 5 times and getting the same result).</p>
<p>In my opinion, the issue originates from OSI layers 1-3 but I can't point at the exact cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi Raheel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the Bluetooth is detected in<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device manager</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If it’s detected in device manager,</span><span>you may check if your computer is discoverable to Bluetooth
 devices, or set<span>Windows</span> to alert you when a new device tries to connect to your computer. To do this, you need to control how your computer pairs with (connects to) Bluetooth devices.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>To control how your computer pairs with Bluetooth devices</span>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Open Control Panel by clicking the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong><span> button, and then clicking&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Control
 Panel</span></strong><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Control Panel search box, type&nbsp;<strong><span>Bluetooth</span></strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Change
 Bluetooth settings</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp;<strong><span>Bluetooth Settings</span></strong> dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Options</span></strong>
 tab and do any of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth devices, select the check box for&nbsp;<strong><span>Allow Bluetooth devices to find this
 computer</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>When a Bluetooth enabled computer is in discovery mode, it broadcasts a wireless signal that allows it to be detected by other Bluetooth enabled computers or devices. This is sometimes
 called <span>pairing mode</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To allow Bluetooth devices to connect to your computer, select the check box for&nbsp;<strong><span>Allow Bluetooth devices to connect
 to this computer</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be notified when a Bluetooth device is trying to connect to your computer, select the check box for&nbsp;<strong><span>Alert me when
 a new Bluetooth device wants to connect</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about adding Bluetooth on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Add-a-Bluetooth-or-other-wireless-or-network-device-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Add-a-Bluetooth-or-other-wireless-or-network-device-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Bluetooth is not detected in device manager, you may have to contact Dell support to check with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Link to contact Dell support:</span><span><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dellcare/contact_technical_support?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dellcare/contact_technical_support?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen</a></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error code 0x8100001a usually occurs when Mediaid.bin file is damaged or missing. The Mediaid.bin file may be damaged or missing if the backup directory was suddenly moved to another location. To address this concern we suggest running the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker tool</a></strong>. It is a utility that allows users to scan for corruptions
 in Windows system and restore corrupted files. The link contains further information about how to run the System File Checker tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same issue persists, running the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool is recommended. This tool will automatically repair the components of your Windows operating system and records the corruptions to the log file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the DISM tool, follow these steps:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key+ X, and then click on Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Yes.</li><li>In the Command Prompt window, type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth, then hit Enter.
</li><li>Once the scan is finished, restart your computer. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: While running the DISM tool on your computer, if any bad sectors are found on the system, data loss might occur. We suggest that you backup your files before running DISM.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the results.</p>

<p>(1) You did a clean install of Windows 10?</p>
<p>(2) What version &amp; OS Build shows at "<strong>START, Settings, System, About</strong>"?</p>
<p>(3) Why do you want to replace it with the backup image?</p>
<p>(4) What version &amp; OS Build is the backup system image?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>One thing</strong>: If the versions of Windows are different, you need to boot to a recovery environment that matches the version of the backup image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(5) So - did you make a <strong>Repair Disc</strong> after making the backup image, or did you make a
<strong>Recovery USB </strong>drive when the OS matched the image that was made?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(6) Let's try to mount the backup image to copy individual files off it. Probably, you want to browse to "X:\Users\YourUserName". "X:" being whatever drive letter it got from the following. (Don't try to write to the drive or to run any program from it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Plug in the external drive, &amp; open the "WindowsImageBackup" folder in File Explorer,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; get to the Backup folder that holds the .vhdx's...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c21a5b1-ad79-4f5b-9857-e0d587febea9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c21a5b1-ad79-4f5b-9857-e0d587febea9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span>: If you've renamed "WindowsImageBackup" (as I did), you'll have to rename it back to restore the image. And that folder must be in the root folder of the external drive for restore to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(b) <strong>Double-click </strong>the <strong>largest </strong>of the <strong>
.vhdx </strong>files in the backup folder. This will be the C: partition that was backed up. (The other 2 are the recovery partition &amp; EFI.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If lucky, <strong>that's it </strong>- the backup image mounts &amp; a new File Explorer window opens to it. (The previous File Explorer window is still open, so WinKey+Arrow-right or left will put the windows side by side.) When done copying files, R-Clk the
 mounted image in File Explorer, &amp; select "Eject". Refresh the screen to see it is gone. (But I believe it might eject at shutdown anyway or certainly with a reboot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Otherwise</span></strong>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(c) <strong>Click OK </strong>to the error message, which will be one of these...</p>

</p><p>(d) R-Clk <strong>START</strong>, &amp; select <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You will see it <strong><em>has </em></strong>mounted - but didn't get a letter...</p>

<p>It <em>(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)</em> was the solution provided when I contacted MS Support for another issue. After an MS update, I noticed that my browsers were very slow, so I did a system restore
 to before the update. It resulted in a blue screen, which resulted in the new install. I was directed to this website where "</p>

<p>(1) What <strong>System Model </strong>does it say in <strong>MSInfo32 </strong>
(ask Cortana)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There will be a site for that computer with articles, drivers &amp; diagnostics. After the OS Build is lifted to 15063.674, compare drivers between the site &amp; Device Manager. If the site has a greater one, first try to update it in Device Manager (search
 automatically). If that fails to get it, then take it from the site. BIOS version can be seen in MSInfo32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(2) It's worth a try to make v.1703 work. You see 15063.0 at "<strong>START, Settings, System, About</strong>"...?...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Scroll to the bottom of that article, &amp; click <strong>Microsoft Update Catalog</strong>. Download the
</strong></span>that matches <strong>System Type</strong>. (64-bit is x64; 32-bit is x86.) Click the download to install it; afterwards, it may be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, "<strong>START, Settings, Update &amp; Security, Troubleshoot, Windows Update</strong>" hopefully gets Windows Update working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(3) What are your answers to (4) &amp; (5) in my prior post? Did you try (6)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the first you are seeing v.1703 - then the backup image must be of a different Windows version. Was it v.1607? Then, if you've got no Repair Disc or Recovery USB of that version, you must download v.1607 Installation Media. It will come with
 a recovery environment that might allow your backup image to be restored, if still necessary.</p>

<p>(1) If you never made a Windows backup image at "<strong>START, Settings, Update &amp; Security, Backup, Backup &amp; Restore (Window 7), Create a system image</strong>" - then how/why are you trying to restore one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(2)</p>
<p>(a) Was it File History that you did?</p>
<p>(b) Do you see the files it made?</p>
<p>(c) "<strong>START, Settings, Update &amp; Security, Backup, More options, Restore files from a current backup</strong>" is meant to restore the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've seen a thread about this saying it could be problematic restoring the files because Win 10 changes the user name. But we could look into it, if that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(3) SDUtil &amp;&nbsp;MediaID.bin only deal with getting Backup &amp; Restore to work, so far as I know. Do you see a&nbsp;MediaID file anywhere? (I do see one inside my WindowsImageBackup folder - but nowhere else.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(4) </p>
<p>(a) So - your clean install of Win 10, v.1703, <em>did </em>update to OS Build&nbsp;15063.674?</p>
<p>(b) But you did a System Restore (<strong>Control Panel, System, System Protection, System Restore</strong>) because your browsers were slow?</p>
<p>(c) Subsequently, it updated back to&nbsp;OS Build&nbsp;15063.674?</p>
<p>(d) Is it working well now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(5) I repeat:&nbsp; What <strong>System Model </strong>does it say in <strong>MSInfo32

<p><strong>***UPDATE***</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the efforts so far to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 0x8100001a error was received when trying to update the most recent backup, and maybe one or two others before that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when reading about manually extracting zipped files to restore the files, I noticed that the most recent backups had very few folders. So I went to the first backup (September 1) and saw about 1500 zipped folders and attempted to restore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was starting to restore so I thought all was well. However, the only folder restored was the AppData folder. Yet still I was able to go in and restore other folders. I did retrieve my Documents folder, and others, but only up to Sep 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that some subfolders were empty (images for example), but if I went and restored that subfolder, the images were restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point any attempt to restore beyond Sep 1 will get the 0x8100001a error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in trying to figure this one out.</p>

<p>So it sounds like what you did was File History. I have no experience with that. I have read your approach is right - when it won't restore - to go in &amp; take the files manually. I hope you get the most important ones.</p>

            Have hp pavillion, win 7 / amd athlonx2 64. After said update automaically installed on 5 jan, conputer froze, stop:oxooooooc5 code on screen. Resaearched this, ms said was due to known issue with this update and AMD processors!!!! Solution put forward
 by various other victims was to start in safe mode, and restore device to a point before 5 jan. Tried this numerous times with all restore points available, same result each time, restore failed message. Obviously with computer in this state, cannot unistall
 kb 4056894 which is reputed to be the problem - unless you can tell me how I can do this from safe mode? What are my options now to get this device working - spend money with a specialist? Onv=ce again, very annoyed that this is a known issue with this processor
 as stated on MS website, and an untested update has been infilted upon owners of these processors without consideration for consequences. as one commentator observed, the so called solution is far worse than the (perceived) problem! All suggestions seem to
 assume you can actually get into this computer to effect a solution. Is the only way to have an expensive re inatall of windows? - crazy<br />

<p>Windows always makes a Restore Point before installing Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide some links to your research about how the problem is&nbsp;<span>due to known issue with this update and AMD processors and the reputed problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us how you attempted to perform System Restore and what was the exact content of the restore failed message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your system boot into Safe Mode or does it not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can boot in Safe Mode are you not able to uninstall the update and what happens when you attempt to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a genuine bootable Windows 7 installation CD/DVD from which you could boot and run the System Restore from the System Recovery Options menu:</p>

<h2>            Is Windows Live Mail still useable&#63;</h2>
                    I just ran Windows Update. It's still showing Windows Live Essentials as an available download. Is the Windows Live Mail that is included as part of the Windows Live Essentials package useable, or did Outlook.com make it obsolete&nbsp;just like it did Hotmail?

Windows live mail is alive and well and offers several advantages over web based email.&nbsp; Personally I prefer it.<br />
