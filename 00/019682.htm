<h2>            Outlook for Mac error message&#58;  Rules could not be saved because there is an error in the rules.</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left">(Modifying the title to provide clarity)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p>I have edited multiple rules in Outlook for Mac and when trying to save the changes I get this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Rules could not be saved because there is an error in the rules. Edit the rules, and then try to save the rules again."</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15649a7a-24a2-492a-827d-62c637e69c01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15649a7a-24a2-492a-827d-62c637e69c01" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What? I mean WHAT???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I have edited the rules in your UI and clicked OK after each edit, how can there be an error?? Why did you not check for errors when I pressed the OK button? How is it even possible that your UI lets me create a rule with an error, it is not a programming
 language, it is a user interface!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, what an ignorant unhelpful error message is this? What is the error? In which rule it is? How do I fix it? The message could have equally read "F... YOU!", it would be equally unhelpful and rude!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only did I have to abandon all the changes I made, you have also ruined my day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HATE YOU TOO MICROSOFT!!!</p>

            A common cause of these rule errors is a bad email address in one of the rules (possibly a typo) or an invalid folder name (possibly deleted or renamed?). &nbsp;Please check the most recent rule(s) you created and edited to see if all parameters are currently
 valid. &nbsp;You can also narrow down the specific rule by selectively removing/re-adding individual rules. &nbsp;Unfortunately, all rules are sent to the server in one transaction, and Outlook currently does not have code to identify and display the specific rule that
 failed. We've logged that as a future improvement.

<p>This is really a problem solver!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With outlook log trace opened, I found there are multiple RuleOperationError when synchronizing with exchange server.<br />
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&lt;OperationIndex&gt;24&lt;/OperationIndex&gt;&lt;ValidationErrors&gt;&lt;Error&gt;&lt;FieldURI&gt;Condition:SentToAddresses&lt;/FieldURI&gt;&lt;ErrorCode&gt;InvalidAddress&lt;/ErrorCode&gt;&lt;ErrorMessage&gt;invalid email address&lt;/ErrorMessage&gt;&lt;FieldValue&gt;SMTP:&lt;/FieldValue&gt;&lt;/Error&gt;&lt;/ValidationErrors&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the OperationIndex tag should be started from 0, so 24 means the 25th rule in the rule box.</p>
<p>For me, there is a outdated mail-group in SendToAddress condition.</p>
<p>After removed these invalid rules, the whole rule set worked again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that microsoft(outlook) fix this issue with the accurate invalid rule tips, cause not everyone can understand these debug stuff!</p>

            Microsoft addressed the issue: as of now (and during the past few days) MS has resolved "fixed" the issue: Amazon employees say Amazon is resonsible for this hotmail/Outllook hacking "phishing" assault against MS employees and MS customers. Amazon employees
 thought they were going to get rich quick by stealing MS accounts--and to enable access to sales receipts, insurance policy information, bank account information--to enable the theft of hurricane victims' insurance payments and worse: to make charges for hurricane
 relief donations and/or orders for merchandise Amazon never intended to ship to victims. Amazon employees still think they have stolen hotmail/outlook passwords from the MS email account registrants (owners/holders): by the illegal solicitation of passwords
 or "phishing". They think so because they are brain damaged regards: criminally insane. Again--not just thinking something does not mean that thinking is correct, right or even feasible--MS will never (and did not) illegally "mi

<h2>            Using OneNote 2013, update content in 1 section, auto updates in another section</h2>
                    <p>I have 1 section (Section A) that displays an overview of information that is found on subsequent sections and contains a number of project notes.&nbsp; I have additional sections for each project, Section B is for Project 1, Section C is for Project 2, etc.).
 I want to link the content from Section A, project 1, to be updated in Section B.</p>
<p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Section A - project overview content:</span></p>
<table>

<p>
</p><p>How can I link the cells of the table in Section A to the duplicate cells of the table in Section B, so that when I update/modify the cell on Section A, it automatically updates the same cell in Section B? I am not using weblinks, or file, I want the changes

<h2>            Error 103 message signing in to facebook.</h2>
                    


Everytime I login to facebook, I get an error message that reads Error 103 (net::ERR_CONNECTION ABORTED) and a message with it that says that the site is temporarily down or has moved altogether. This happens ever single day on my laptop. but i can log in just fine from my iphone.  i have a lot of people that i can only contact through facebook. The error message typically has the google chrome logo on it, but i have never NEVER downloaded that. and i have sent several scathing messages to them and they have yet to satisfactorily answer my questions.  So may I ask, what the **** is going on? 



this is what i have been able to find out on my own, since giving google a piece of my mind isn't helping... 



this is what i was able to find out about the google chrome as it applies to my problems....i think.

One thing that many users are doing apparently is using Google's DNS for their DNS server address.&nbsp;&nbsp; What DNS address do you use?&nbsp;&nbsp; You could use&nbsp; nslookup&nbsp; or&nbsp; ipconfig /all&nbsp;&nbsp; to find out.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Another thing you could try is using the IE9 Developer Tools Network Capture tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp;might at least clear up whether your symptom was due to your DNS, although unfortunately it does not record IP addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tip: uncheck&nbsp; Tools, Clear Entries on Navigate&nbsp;
 so you don't lose any redirects in your traces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you for such a quick response. I appreciate that. Secondly, what's a DNS? I haven't a clue what that is. I'll try to figure out what i can on my end...i'll at least go ahead and try the clues you gave about figuring out which one i'm
 using...</p>

<tr>

<td>timeout (ms)</td>

</table>
<p>67.222.132.199 is a non-cached DNS Server<br />
</p>
<p>like the domain issue, um, no clue what that even means....i know i have google set as my home page, i don't know if that has anything to do with it or not...</p>

<p><br />
Do you know where you got that address?</p>
<p>&lt;nslookup&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; server 67.222.132.199<br />
Default Server:&nbsp; dns3.consumer.net<br />
Address:&nbsp; 67.222.132.199</p>
<p>&gt; www.google.com<br />
Server:&nbsp; dns3.consumer.net<br />
Address:&nbsp; 67.222.132.199</p>
<p>*** dns3.consumer.net can't find www.google.com: Query refused<br />
&lt;/nslookup&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That "Query refused" might be expected because I was doing it from my IP address but it gives the idea that if your IP address is not really associated with consumer.net&nbsp; either,&nbsp; then you might be seeing the same symptom and that would explain your problem
 with connectivity to&nbsp;the&nbsp; google&nbsp; host.</p>
<p>Try starting nslookup (e.g. in a cmd window, aka Command Prompt) and issue those two nslookup subcommands I gave:</p>
<p>server 67.222.132.199</p>
<p>www.google.com&nbsp;</p>

            <p>ok...that 67.222...dns address was used soley as an example that was given on that page that i found.....all i know for sure is what my<strong> IP</strong> address is...and that is:
<strong><u>24.123.188.12</u></strong></p>
<p>i don't know what help that will be....now as far as the website i found the pasted information...i'm pretty sure it was network-tools.com (but i'm not 100% sure about that...Now. i went to
<a href="http://www.dnswatch.nfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dnswatch.nfo</a> and found the following info....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>domain: 12.188.123.24. in-addr.arpa</p>
<p>type: PTR</p>
<p>TTL:86400</p>
<p>rowancountync.gov</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>typically i get online with my laptop at my public library and i am able to use their wi-fi access. but we do have internet at home so my IP address i'm pretty sure would show up as something different...i have no clue about computers so i don't know how
 much this will help...hopefully this will clear up something though...thanx</p>

<p><span>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway. RFCs 2131

 server. </span></p>

    <title>How to Display Arabic Text in Outlook Mobile&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Display Arabic Text in Outlook Mobile&#63;</h2>
                    I have a need to display Arabic text in Windows Mobile 6.1 within Outlook Mobile. I do not care to totally localize my windows in Arabic i.e. menus and total interface. I searched the internet and this forum but found no way to do it. Can a knowledgeable
 person on this form comment on what I understand so far on this topic ..<br />
<br />
1) Currently, Microsoft does not provide a native way to display arabic text at least in office mobile applications.<br />
2) If I want to totally localize my windows mobile 6.1 in arabic, I have to purchase a 3rd party Arabic localization support e.g. paragon, PocketArabizer, PenReader, InfoMobility.<br />
3) My seached showed that none of the above packages support WM 6.1. Is this still the case?<br />
4) If total localization is not my goal, can I simply purchase an Arabic font like this one (http://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/tahoma-family-arabic.aspx/298 ) and use it to JUST display arabic text in Outlook. If yes, is there a procedure I have to follow.<br />
4) If there is any other way to do this, please let me know. I found this procedure, but not sure if anyone else has tried it to confirm http://www.modaco.com/content/smartphone-software-applications/231901/enable-arabic-font-on-your-smartphone/<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<h2>            phi characters in Calibri font on Windows 7&#47;8</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Greek letter phi</a> with several fonts available in Windows 7 (using MS Office 2013 and LibreOffice 4.2). The following image shows appearance of three variants of the letter that exist in the
<a href="http://unicode-table.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Unicode character set</a> in several fonts:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caf33bee-b914-4164-8654-5365fd603c0a" /></p>
<p>You can see that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
glyphs</a> used for GREEK SMALL LETTER PHI and GREEK PHI SYMBOL in Calibri are swapped when compared to those characters in other fonts.<br />
<br />
I've found that Unicode Technical Report #25 explains this issue in section <strong>
2.3.1 Representative Glyphs for Greek Phi</strong>. In short, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Unicode</a> 3.0 the two glyphs were swapped. Unicode 3.0 was standardized as ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 in September 1999. As Calibri font was designed after that it seems that designers did not implement those glyphs correctly. (And Calibri is default font in Office
 2007 and newer.)<br />
<br />
I'd like to know does Calibri in Windows 8 also have this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If you want to check this issue I put the <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=E6AE3AF61153F2AC!119&amp;authkey=!AIOBYLtHepSl3Xg&amp;ithint=file%2c.docx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I've moved your inquiry to the Office 2013 | Windows 8 forum in order that it receive more focused attention. While the same Unicode Calibri character set will be used in all Windows programs from&nbsp;<em>Character Map</em>&nbsp;to
<em>Word 2013</em>, you should get a more experienced Windows 8/8.1 related response in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have either Windows 8 or 8.1 in front of me at the moment, but I'm guessing that the Calibri character error is there to stay. If a character was changed in a subsequent edition of the font file, any document generated under the new edition of the
 font file would display the wrong character when viewed on a computer with the old font file.</p>

            <p>Jay, the Greek alphabet is used officially in Greece. I guess this issue in Calibri font is quite serious for Greek Windows users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue also prevents using Calibri in scientific texts that contain those Greek characters. (Moreover, Calibri is not suitable for scientific and technical writings as it contains a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Homoglyph">homoglyph</a> – the lowercase letter L and the uppercase letter i (l and I) are practically indistinguishable.)</p>

    <title>Connecting to PC Suite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ballaterboy---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to PC Suite</h2>
                    had an issue with 3 mobile. Upgraded recently and wanted a nice simple phone. not important to this discussion but they advised me badly. Went from a 6288 to a 3120 Classic.<br />
<br />
Quite like it but they failed to tell me it came without a connection cable and a disc for nokia pc suite.<br />
<br />
So i have bought a CA-101 cable and downloaded nokia PC Suite.<br />
<br />
had PC Suite on before but to avoid problems i de-installed it and re-installed new version.<br />
<br />
Now whn i go to connect, the screen that says "select cable connection" is greyed out and i can't connect.<br />
<br />
i have WIN XP service pack 3 on<br />
<br />
Can anyone help please

            Since that is the first time you try to connect with that phone(3120). There are three possible cause in which you are going to eliminate. Two hardware related &amp; one software. The cable(CA-101), the phone cable interface(3120) &amp; windows xp(software problem).
 We need to ruled out first the hardware so we could concentrate on software.<br />
<br />
If you are sure the cable &amp; phone have no problem, just uninstall again pcsuite, then run the latest version of pcsuite cleaner. After which install the version specifically for that model(3120), the latest version is geared mostly on the latest model of Nokia.<br />

            tried to download the PC Suite Cleaner but it says the page is unavailable. Got 3.6 from another site but it says it is incompatible for my version???<br />
<br />
re-downloaded again the version for my 3120classic. Think it is 7.0.7.0. loaded that but same problem. Sure cable is ok as this all worked when i first got the phone.

<div>I understand that sudden changes do appear difficult to deal with sometimes. With regards to your concern.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/auto-upgrade-outlook-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Hotmail is now Outlook</b></a>&nbsp;(click to see the article) - outlook.com sign in page will now be similar to sign in page of live.com and hotmail.com. You cn navigate your profile setting in outlook.com easily by clicking on the account name in the webpage.<br />
<div><br />
<div>2. <i>Keep Me Signed In issue</i> - due to security features that are incorporated within the new outlook platform, this issue appears on a number of our customers. Please refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7ee3ab84-339f-4874-9f49-4b66a6017198">JMH3143.
 MS - MVP</a>'s comment for basic troubleshooting steps in the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. <i>Messenger</i> - if you are using the web access to log in to your account, you may use the new instant messaging feature of Outlook.com within your account. It has a smiley/speech balloon icon near your account name at the upper right part of the
 page. Messenger will eventually get replaced by Skype.</div>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Appointment Shading Differences - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Appointment Shading Differences</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone explain the shading (not color) differences in Outlook 2016?&nbsp; My calendar has what I would describe as light and dark shading on tentative appointments but I do not know what causes the differences.&nbsp; I understand and know how to use conditional
 formatting to have appointments appear in different <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
colors</span> but that is not what I am describing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be a new way of showing appointments that haven't been accepted yet versus one that are accepted as tentative (both versions have the diagonal lines in the LH margin.&nbsp; Can someone in the community confirm my speculation?</p>

<h2>            Quick Parts formatting</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saved my own text as part of the quick parts gallery; the first sentence was bold and the rest normal. When I insert the text by going through the insert tab&gt;quick parts it keeps the original formatting of first sentence bolded. But when I insert a building
 block drop down menu from the developer tab, it bolds the whole paragraph once inserted. I cant find any way to keep the original formatting when using this option!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know the fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I can replicate this. I cannot explain it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I put the gallery control in using a bounding box, it does not happen. If I put it in using start-end tags, it does happen. If I change it back to a bounding box, the bold for everything continues to happen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an unformatted entry in the General Category of the Quick Parts Gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, one other way to use your quick part is to type the first four (unique) letters of the name of the part and either press Enter in response to a tooltip or press the F3 key if there is no tooltip.</p>

            <p>Basith - Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I've continued to investigate and found I was wrong, the cookie wasn't being deleted, it seems like it wasn't being accessed so the settings I used weren't active.</p>
<p>I searched the folder with the cookies and found two cookies for Google.&nbsp; One, I think, holds my sign-in data and preference for using the iGoogle site.&nbsp; The other holds the Google Settings.&nbsp; I know this because I checked the dates on the cookie, then updated
 the Google Settings again and then checked the cookie dates again and one of them had changed to the current date.</p>
<p>I unchecked the "Preserve Favorites web data" button and deleted everything from the cache.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I found on the Google site instructions for enabling cookies, which is to use the advanced cookie setting in IE9 and accepting all 1st and 3rd party cookies.</p>
<p>Then I signed back into Google, changed the settings so a clicked result link will open in a new tab, selected iGoogle, selected it to also open a clicked result link in a new tab and so far it's worked correctly ever since.</p>
<p>I suspect this opens me up&nbsp;to even more tracking cookies than before, but Norton seems to do a fair job of deleting those on a regular basis.</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>1 --&nbsp;For the most part since I&nbsp;bought the Win7 PC last November 2010.&nbsp; IE8 and&nbsp;IE9.</p>
<p>2 -- Other than switching from McAfee (which came with the PC) to Comcast Xfinity's version of Norton 360, no.&nbsp; I try to avoid messing with the configuration files.</p>
<p>3 -- IE9 is my default browser.&nbsp; I have Google Chrome but I don't use it as often as IE9.&nbsp; I don't know if the same problem exists for Chrome as I've had in IE9.<br />

            Hi,<br />
In order to sync calendar, contacts e-mail and tasks, you need to purchase and install Outlook.&nbsp; Then you need to reinstall Windows Mobile Device Center which will configure itself for the version of Outlook that is installed.<br />
<br />
Then when you check your synchronization settings in Windows Mobile Device Center, you will have the option to sync calendar, contacts, tasks and e-mail.

<h2>            Outlook Calendar App rejecting calendar RSVP</h2>
                    <p>I've seen this behaviour recently on a large number of phones in my office network. When we receive Calendar entries and we hit the RSVP button, we choose any of the options (Accept, Tentative or Decline) and it briefly shows the icon choice on your name
 and then it disappears back to a state of waiting for choice. Checking on the outlook app on a computer shows that no choice has been made. This happens on both wifi and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this behaviour and have you been able to resolve it?</p>

<li>Repair the Project installation</li><li>Install SP1 for Project 2013 and the latest updates. Windows update will do this for you</li></ol>

            Thanks Rod for the response. I have installed MS Project professional 2013 on factory clean machine also. The issue still exists. The issue exists even after installing SP1 for Project 2013. I have not done windows update, but downloaded Project 2013 SP1
 and installed it. My machine is 64-bit. Does that cause any issue.

<h2>            Check mark box in Excel iphone app</h2>
                    Very disappointed with the Excel iPhone app! I have a spreadsheet with check mark boxes, but when I open it with the iPhone 6s app it will not allow me to check or uncheck the boxes. I was planning to transition my spreadsheet from apple's numbers program,
 but I guess I will have to switch back unless someone knows how to make this work?

Thanks for the reply, but ...<br />
<br />
I am new to the Community and accidentally clicked that this was an answer - IT IS NOT THE ANSWER<br />
My question is precise, and I ruled out all the leads in the link above.&nbsp; My question is still unanswered.&nbsp; Any other suggestions anyone?<br />
<br />
My original post was:<br />
<br />
PowerPoint 2011 for Mac Version 14.3.2 under OS X 10.8.3.&nbsp; No updates for PPT 2011 available.&nbsp; Previous posts do not address this exact issue.&nbsp; This is specific to an add-in file that seems to be expected or found by PowerPoint and apparently has a zero character-length
 filename.&nbsp; Note: I do have a MathType add-in but disabling (unchecking box) it does not solve this problem. Dialog box appears with PowerPoint Presentation Gallery.&nbsp; Simply clicking "OK" button alleviates the problem - i.e., it lets me proceed without further
 difficulty - but it is a nuisance.&nbsp; How do I eliminate the problem?&nbsp; Is there a hidden file somewhere that needs deleting?&nbsp; Is there a Permissions issue (I can't see one).&nbsp; Yes, I have run Disk Utility Repair Disk Permissions multiple times.&nbsp; Thanks anyone<br />

</blockquote>
Hi Jim<br />
<br />
Thanks, this fixed the problem.&nbsp; Several details are worth noting for other users encountering this issue.<br />
I needed to go to ~/Library/Preferences using Terminal (Users/~/Library folder was not visible in Finder, strange new behavior since Snow Leopard, but unix commands (ls and cd) from ~/ got me there without permissions changes or other hiccups).&nbsp; No need to
 be root or superuser.<br />
For safety, instead of removing the file, I renamed the suspect file using mv com.microsoft.Powerpoint.plist com.microsoft.Powerpoint.plist.inaccessible.<br />
On the next launch, PowerPoint created a new com.microsoft.Powerpoint.plist, without the problem.<br />
Note that there are other Microsoft preference files in this folder, e.g. com.microsoft.office.plist etc., and I didn't touch any of them.<br />

<h3> chris is getting angry  say:</h3>
<h2>            My emails in Outlook 2010 are arriving half an hour late.</h2>
                    I have changed the send/receive times to update sooner but even if the mail server has something in it, it is not sent to my outlook.&nbsp; I can't see them in outlook even by doing a manual send/receive.&nbsp; The problem has persisted on two different computers,
 two different versions of outlook, multiple virus software.&nbsp; My boss sitting in the next room receives emails within seconds but I have to wait up to an hour on occasions.&nbsp; Sending emails is no problem, there just seems to be something preventing my outlook
 from receiving mail from the mail server.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated, this situation has been very frustrating.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Have you tried opening Outlook in safe mode to see if the problem still occurs? Press CTRL+Outlook icon to open in safe mode. If everything works fine, disable any add-ins and add them back one at a time to see which one is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>MsMpEng.exe sometimes eating up CPU power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sanmartin  say:</h3>
<h2>            MsMpEng.exe sometimes eating up CPU power</h2>
                    At least on two occasions (I can't say what they had in common) I found nearly all programs turning unresponsive. A look at taskmanager showed 100 % CPU usage but no process eating up that much. With ProcessExplorer, I could see that MsMpEng.exe was the
 culprit (over 90 % CPU) but there was no scan running or anything like that. I killed the process, and all went back to normal.<br />
Any ideas what could have caused such strange behavior?

            When MSMPENG spikes the CPU, it usually due to a deadlock condition where it is in conflict with another process, program, or driver. It can be that another process is accessing a file or files in rapid succession and MSMPENG needs to intercept that file
 every time, hence the conflict.<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Prior Security Software?</p>
<p>Any security software still installed?</p>
<p><span>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.<br />
You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:<br />

            Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
what you say sounds logical. But really,&nbsp;it's not connected to any previously installed software, my only security software is MSE (+ Windows Firewall); as that's a new installation, there was
<strong>nothing</strong> AV-wise installed before. My suspicion is that some installation programs (games!!) turn off MSE temporarily, and that "deadlock condition" appears when MSE is reinitiating. Just an idea, though. I'll open a support case if the issue
 reappears. (Besides of this occurrence, I must say that I never saw such a low-impact and reliable application like MSE. Good work so far.)<br />
Regards.

            No installer should be shutting down MSE. The CPU spike is not due to a shut down or startup of MSMPENG, but the engive performing work or trying to.<br />

            I have been using MSE on a new PC since October 2009. It has been running absolutely fine until I updated 2 days ago. There was a Malicious Software update &amp; all went according to plan with the updates.<br />
<br />
However since the update my msmpeng.exe is hogging my resources. The only way I can use the computer is by ending the process, then all is fine. I read what has been said above &amp; understand that its because the engine is trying to do something but it has now
 been this way for 2 days &amp; isn't actually doing anything. There is no scan in progress, no scans were interrupted either.<br />
<br />
So if its not doing anything &amp; hasn't been for 24 hours (thats how long I left it initially!) why is it still suddenly hogging my resources? Could it be the update?<br />
<br />
My machine originally came with norton but I took that off straight away due to that being a resource hog &amp; I never actually installed it BUT still went through the whole painful Norton Uninstall process &amp; went through my registry too to make sure Norton had
 gone!<br />
<br />
Hope you can shed some light on this for me as I personally think you have finally got a worthy piece of security software with MSE.

            mremixer. It is hard to say what changed to cause the runaway msmpeng issue. Since you believe that it began with the security updates of last week, one approach would be to remove all of those updates to see if the problem goes away. If so, then add them
 back one at a time, to see if MSMPENG behaves after each installed patch.<br />
You may want to simply consider uninstalling and reinstalling MSE, which may be enough to resolve it if something broken with MSE.<br />
Finally, contacting MSE support is an option.<br />

            As far as I am concerned I am using MSE too on a new Windows 7 installation , Along with MSE I am using Outpost firewall pro as a firewall<br />
When i look at the task manager I see that the MsMpEng.exe process is using around 50 to 60 megs of ram and process msseces.exe is using between 25 to 30 megs<br />
As for the cpu along with outpost firewall pro I notice&nbsp; on my dual core cpus the first being between 23 to over 50 % of cpu's power the other one between 15 to 30 %<br />
Amount of ram taken from my 2 gigs of ram is (along with outpost firewall pro) about over 50 % which is a lot . MSE seems like a resource hog but could it be because of Outpost firewall pro ?

<br />
Outpost Firewall Pro isn't just a firewall, it also includes always on spyware and program monitoring, which are real-time functions similar to those found in MSE.&nbsp; This means that it's highly likely these two programs are interacting and though they may or
 may not directly conflict, are at least causing the excess cpu overhead by monitoring each others activity.<br />
<br />
This is why Microsoft recommends using the included&nbsp;Windows firewall, which simply operates as a firewall and not an active protection component, since MSE performs these network monitoring functions itself.&nbsp; However, if leak-tests are your only&nbsp;measure of
 security, you may be better off with Outpost and another simple dumb antivirus, since that's how it is designed to operate.&nbsp; I personally prefer an integrated security application that performs all the anti-malware functions in one application, since it doesn't
 have these questions of application overlap and/or 'holes' between programs designed with completely&nbsp;different criteria.<br />

<p>Hi Ariel1991_91,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to Charles’s suggestion to see whether you can save to the Online location as a workaround. If this doesn’t work, you can also try copying then renaming the documents on device. These are workarounds before the issue fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you try the suggestions below to see whether any of them can make the save dialog window coming back:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Please first ensure the Office is in the latest version. To do that, you can go to Help tab &gt; check for updates and update the Office to the latest 16.20 version.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Go to move the folder to the desktop:&nbsp;<strong>~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.word
</strong><span>to see whether there’s any difference. If the issue can be fixed by this step, you can remove the folder from the desktop. If the issue still can’t be fixed, you can move the folder back to the location.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the Word Insert tab &gt; my add-ins &gt; Office add-ins &gt; check if there’s any add-ins there, if so, click the collapse button next to the Add-in &gt; remove to remove all the add-ins there. This step can narrow
 down whether there’s any add-ins affecting that.</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>To check if the issue is related to third-party, please try rebooting your system in safe boot to see the result: restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The white Apple logo
 appears on your display. Release the shift key when you see the logo window. If your startup disk encrypted with FileVault, you might be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the Finder. Try saving documents in Mac
 safe boot to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If the issue persists after the 4 steps above, you may need to try uninstalling and reinstalling to see the result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>
