<p>
</p><p>Please MS, watch this and digest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The start menu is a disaster of cludge. All the important design language work that started with Windows Phone 7 has been abandoned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some great ideas with Windows 10, like being able to close Win32 programs with the pull down motion. Also like finally having all of the settings in one location. But these advances don't need to be at the expense of design language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just feeling incredibly defeated by the direction Windows seems to be going. There was so much promise.</p>

    <title>Unable to save edits to xlam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip mark hunt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to save edits to xlam</h2>
                    
<p>I have opened my xlsm spreadsheet and then&nbsp;proceeded via the View Code link to edit code in my loaded xlam, which I have previously written.</p>
<p>Though I can edit the code, I cannot then save it.</p>
<p>I get the message</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Excel cannot access the file 'C\Program Files (x86)\MyExcelAdd-Ins\94ED8D40'.&nbsp; There are several possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The file name or path does not exist. </li><li>The file is being used by another program. </li><li>The workbook you are trying to save has the same name as a currently open workbook.</li></ul>
<p>I have noticed that each time I tried, I got a different last 8 digit hex string, but the rest of the message was always the same.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have tried to edit the macro since transferring the workbook and add-in to Windows 7, from my previous XP machine.&nbsp; The&nbsp;transferred spreadsheet&nbsp;and add-in functionality has been working perfectly.&nbsp; It is just that now I have to make
 some edits to the macro, and it won't let me.</p>
<p>Maybe my approach to doing the edits is wrong.&nbsp; It happily saved the edits that were done in the module1 area of the spreadsheet itself.&nbsp; It just wouldn't accept the edits of the xlam.</p>
<p>I posted this when I was still on Excel 2007; this morning (Sun 1 Aug 2010) I upgraded to Office 2010 - the problem still applies.</p>
<p>Any ideas please.</p>

<p>The key steps of this solution were originally posted by Richard Schollar, Microsoft MVP - Excel on the MrExcel Message Board.</p>
<p>I have simply fleshed it out into a hopefully easy to follow step by step set of instructions.</p>
<p>The essence of the solution is to save the xlam as a as a regular xlsm file, modify it in that state, and then save it back as an xlam file.&nbsp; The experience is specific to a Windows 7, Excel 2010 environment.</p>
<p>I have also used some specific names, rather than more generic names, as I find that easier to read.</p>
<p>1. Within Windows Explorer in C drive create a directory named Workaround.</p>
<p>2. Take careful note of where your xlam file is currently located, in my case it was in C:\Program Files (x86)\MyExcelAdd-Ins.</p>
<p>3. Open up the spreadsheet where you are unable to save the edited xlam.</p>
<p>4. Open up the VBE (View Code).</p>
<p>5. When in the VBE, open up the Immediate Window (Ctrl+G) and type in (amending the italicised words to the filename of your xlam file, as necessary):</p>
<p>Workbooks("<em>MyXLAMfilename</em>.xlam").IsAddin = False</p>
<p>6. Press Enter.</p>
<p>7. Now type in, still within the VBE</p>
<p>Workbooks("<em>MyXLAMfilename</em>.xlam").SaveAs "C:\Workaround\<em>MyXLAMfilename</em>",xlWorkbookNormal</p>
<p>8. Press Enter.&nbsp; You may wish at this point to also do a Select All, copy and then paste the text of your xlam into a notepad file, just as a backup, in case you make a mistake along the way.</p>
<p>9. Close VBE.</p>
<p>10. Open the Add-In Manager from the Developer tab.</p>
<p>11. Untick the add-in that you are wanting to edit.</p>
<p>12. Save your Excel spreadsheet (you may at this stage find that parts of your spreadsheet are 'corrupted', don't worry it will all come good in the end.</p>
<p>13. Close Excel.</p>
<p>14. Open, using Excel, the workbook format version of your xlam, which you created in step 6 at C:\Workaround\<em>MyXLAMfilename</em>.xlsm</p>
<p>15. Open up the VBE (View Code).</p>
<p>16. Do what ever edits you need to do the code.</p>
<p>17. Close VBE.</p>
<p>18. Save as the file as an Excel Add-In.</p>
<p>19. Close Excel.</p>
<p>20. Here comes what I found to be the 'trick for new players' :-(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Save As of the file as an Excel Add-In will have placed it in -</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\{Your User Name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, like me, you don't want to edit your spreadsheet to look at a new location, this is what is then necessary.</p>
<p>21. Within Windows Explorer, go to the directory where you have your old xlam, in my case this was C:\Program Files (x86)\MyExcelAdd-Ins.</p>
<p>22. Delete the xlam file, as you now want to replace it with your new version.</p>
<p>23. Within Windows Explorer copy your updated xlam from C:\Users\{Your User Name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns to the directory where you want it to be, again, in my case this was C:\Program Files (x86)\MyExcelAdd-Ins.</p>
<p>24. Open your spreadsheet, if at this point you get errors about links, cancel updating and just get into the spreadsheet - the spreadsheet may appear 'corrupted' at this time.</p>
<p>25. Go in to Add-In Manager on the Developer Tab.</p>
<p>26. Put the tick back against your Add-In; if the Add-In is not showing in the list, then Browse to the directory where you have placed it and add it back in to the list of Add-Ins known to that spreadsheet.</p>
<p>27. Close the Add-In manager.</p>
<p>28. Press F9 to recalculate your spreadsheet using the new version of your Add-In.</p>
<p>That is what did it for me, at least with my own code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have though hit a snag with Laurent Longre's morefunc, which I call extensively.&nbsp; Unfortunately his code is password protected, and though it appears to load into the Functions area, Excel 2010 does not see the functions as valid. It seems they're there
 but not really, so to say.&nbsp; I am hoping to find an answer somewhere; if I don't my spreadsheet world is 'screwed'.</p>
<p>I know this is laborious, but it worked for me.</p>

            <p>This same problem occurred for me in Excel 2013/ Windows 8, but WORSE because Excel does not tell me it is not saving the .xlam file. &nbsp;There go all the changes I made to the .xlam file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in Excel 2013/Windows 7, Excel will save the .xlam file. &nbsp;Go figure.</p>

            <p>Hi Gordon</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never understood why my problem occurred.&nbsp; I have my main xlam working well under Windows 8.&nbsp; All I can say is that I learnt, from my experience, to always copy and paste, and then save, my xlam text, into a simple text file (Notepad), before committing
 it to the Excel save process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I empathise with you regarding losing a lot of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Philip</p>

            <p>It seems you cannot save the modified file because it is locked by Office itself from changes, since Excel is using the file. However, Office doesn't send any warning that he couldn't save it. I assume this because I had the same problem and I solved it
 as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disable your personal xlam file from the add-ins available (File\Options\Add-Ins\Go and uncheck your file). With this Office doesn't locks the file for edition.</p>
<p>2. Close Excel.</p>
<p>3. Open your xlam file. It will only open Excel (no worksheet), but you can access the VBA code in the regular way (Ctr+F11).</p>
<p>4. Modify your code and save.</p>
<p>5. Enable again your add-in file.</p>
<p>6. Close excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time you open an excel file your xlam must have your latest changes.</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#35;NAME&#63; Error - Windows to Mac Excel</h2>
                    <p>I have a complex spreadsheet in which I can view the cell contents in Excel for Windows (2010?) but when trying to view in Mac there are MANY #NAME? errors. It does appear there are many defined names on the workbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to "prep" the original file to be more compatible for Mac Excel in order to work on it on my mac? Perhaps even a way to print out a list of the name definitions while on the windows version and correct them on the mac version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Well, the most obvious explanation is that there is no built-in Excel function (Mac or Windows) by the name of
<strong>=YTDNET()</strong>. It must be a user-defined function which isn't available on your Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple addition formula, itself, should not throw an error [even though the first + is unnecessary], so my guess is that the content of one or both of the cells referred to is the source of the error. You should be able to track it down by using the
 program's Error Checking features [located on the <strong>Formulas</strong> tab,
<strong>Formula Auditing </strong>group].</p>

            <p>The main difference is that Office 2013 is a one-time purchase, while Office 365 uses a monthly or yearly subscription (i.e. you rent it from Microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the Home edition of Office 365 includes Outlook, Publisher and Access; those aren't included in the Home &amp; Student edition of Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The applications themselves are the same - Excel in Office 365 is the same as Excel in Office 2013.</p>

<p>hi suemcpherson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to create a notebook via onenote class notebook, we need to access the onedrive for business library once to set things up. and the new notebooks will store in the onedrive for business library. if not, a message will pop up to
 remind us to go to the onedrive for business to complete the setup. to do that:</p>
<p>1.log into the <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0ccd6ce1-ffb7-47b8-b6f6-ec145406f7d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0ccd6ce1-ffb7-47b8-b6f6-ec145406f7d4" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.after getting into the onedrive for business library, go back to the class notebook to create a new notebook. then, the notebooks will display in the class notebooks folder of the onedrive for business library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2e6beb38-3380-48b7-927a-65ffd4efd965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2e6beb38-3380-48b7-927a-65ffd4efd965" /></a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>if that's not your scenario, to clarify your situation, could you provide the following info?</p>
<p>1.as the screenshot didn't show up,&nbsp;please upload it again. to upload screenshots, you can click
<b>use rich formatting</b> and then click the icon of <b>insert/edit media</b>.</p>
<p>2.confirm whether you have accessed onedrive for business library once.</p>
<p>3.check if the issue happens to other users in your school.</p>
<p>4.did the issue happen before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I have a related issue. My OneNote2010 is registered on my desktop PC. But on my laptop is an expired OneNote2010 trial. As far as I know, the laptop syncs and I can view all my files. But I can't edit the files. It acts like read-only.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I simply want to ensure this is normal behavior. I own OneNote but am restricted because my bedroom computer is not registered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I assume the only way around this is to email documents to myself, and input them in onenote on my desktop PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, do you know of any free desktop alternatives to OneNote, hopefully which can sync between PC's? I know about GoogleDocs and Online OneNote, but would rather use a stable desktop client rather than the web.</div>

AFAIK this is normal behavior.<br />

I don't know of a free real alternative of Onenote.<br />

            Did you set your Gmail account as POP? I highly recommend you switch to IMAP.<br />
<br />
The new Outlook Identity will not know you have downloaded all the old messages and will download all messages left on the server again. Before you enter your POP account in Outlook, log into your account with your browser. Move all the older mail out of the
 Inbox. Outlook only downloads from the Inbox. Leave only those new messages you have not downloaded.<br />
<br />
Set Schedules for POP accounts to check every 10-15 minutes. If you set to every two minutes, Outlook will hardly have time to connect before the next schedule starts. Most ISPs request users use either 10 or 15 schedules. You can manually check Send &amp; Receive
 All when you are looking for an important messages.<br />
<br />
Because POP messages are vulnerable to loss when you have Identity issues, I recommend that everyone move to IMAP if possible. See this chart “<a href="http://www.officeformachelp.com/outlook/sync-faqs/#sync2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compare Sync options for POP, IMAP &amp; Exchange
 Accounts</a>”<br />

            I once tried switching to IMAP, and it was a disaster.&nbsp; Outlook couldn´t handle the 1,000´s of emails that I have accumulated over the years in my "All Mail" folder in Gmail.&nbsp; My test was with Outlook 2007.&nbsp; I don´t know if things have changed now.&nbsp; But,
 back then, I had to switch back to POP, and I had to download all over all the 1,000´s of emails into Outlook.&nbsp; It seems that when switching POP-IMAP, all old messages get tagged as unread or something.&nbsp; All-in-all a scary experience that I am afraid to repeat.<br />

    <title>Allocating Contract Amounts By Year Based On Start&#47;End Date - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Allocating Contract Amounts By Year Based On Start&#47;End Date</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Which formula could help allocate contract amounts by year using the start and end date of the specific contract. Example below:<br />
<br />
Headers:<br />
<br />
Column C = Start Date<br />
Column D = End Date<br />
Column E = Amount<br />
Column F = Number of Days (Column D - Column C)<br />
Column G = Amount Per Day (Column E / Column F)<br />
Column H = 2015 Year End<br />
Column I = 2016 Year End<br />
Column J = 2017 Year End<br />
.... (repeating pattern until):<br />
Column R = 2025 Year End<br />
<br />
Contracts:<br />
<br />
Cell C2 = April 18, 2015<br />
Cell D2 = April 17, 2025<br />
Cell E2 = $5,000<br />
<br />
Based on the information above, I would expect the formulas populated in H2 through to R2 to calculate the amount of the contract that was applicable to that year. 2015 and 2025 would be prorated (based on the number of days in those years) and the full years
 (2016-2024) would roughly equal amounts based on the number of days in the year (including leap years).<br />
<br />
Can anyone help with this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>may I suggest you insert one row above the data and place the year numbers into row 1. Then you can calculate the number of days that the contract applies to for each year like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(AND([@[Start Date]]&lt;DATE(H$1,12,31),[@[End Date]]&gt;DATE(H$1,1,1)),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IF([@[End Date]]&lt;=DATE(H$1,12,31),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [@[End Date]]-DATE(H$1,1,1),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IF(AND([@[Start Date]]&lt;DATE(H$1,1,1),[@[End Date]]&gt;DATE(H$1,12,31)),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 365,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DATE(H$1,12,31)-[@[Start Date]]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've indented the formula (using Alt-Enter and spaces in the formula bar, then increased the size of the formula bar), so you can see how the IF statements are nested. This formula will just calculate the number of days, so you can easily see if it is correct.
 You can then type in the multiplication with the daily amount at the end of&nbsp;the formula. The screenshot shows a data sample with a shorter contract in row 4.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the formula!&nbsp; I found a few issues with it though.&nbsp; Based on the above, it seems to compute the number of days in the year.&nbsp; I added in *[Amount Per Day] to the end of the formula and it seems to calculate the annual contract.&nbsp; However,
 if you sum up 2015-2025 to match to the contract amount, it does not add up.&nbsp; I think the reason it is off by a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your Column F, I compute 3,653 days and 1,096 days for each contract.&nbsp; My fault but I should have specified I the formula in Column F = End Date - Start Date + 1 (since it seemed to only be giving me 364 days per year without the +1).&nbsp; Could this be
 the reason why we have our variance?&nbsp; It doesn't seem to compute although the formula you gave is very close.&nbsp;</p>

            Actually I figured out the exact variance is that the first year and last year is off by exact one day each.&nbsp; If you add in one extra day to the formula for the first and second year, the sum of all the years will equal the contract.&nbsp; Could you propose
 a revised formula that would include an extra day for the first and last year?&nbsp; Thanks again for all your help!

            <p>just put a +1 into the formula where the first and last year is calculated, i.e. where the result is a calculation rather than the fixed 365</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=IF(AND([@[Start Date]]&lt;DATE(H$1,12,31),[@[End Date]]&gt;DATE(H$1,1,1)),</span><br />

<p>
</p><p>You see how you can use the N() function to put a comment into a cell. N() converts text to a number, but if the text cannot be converted to a number, it returns 0. Very useful for commenting long formulas.</p>

            Nice one Vijay. How would you address the issue that first and last year need an additional day for the total to match?

            I take it that there are no steps to perform before running the upgrade to guarantee avoiding the issue, as opposed to taking the above steps afterwards?

            <p>My upgrade failed and it reverted the upgrade. So I had to do it in build 15031 and restart the update. It is currently preparing, so I do not know if this helped.

            Not sure if the root problem is the same but the symptom is the same, system hangs while upgrading ( descriptive percentage and the spinning dots ), this has been happening long time ago, to avoid this problem, while the system is restarting after preparing
 the upgrade procedure don't let the system boot, when system goes to bios boot screen just power off and do a cold boot, doing this the upgrade occur without issues.<br />

            <p>Jason, do you know if this is related to the problems people have been having with every new build for months on Surface Pro 3s? The workaround has been to pull out the SD card (and possibly detach the keyboard) and the update will proceed. My SP3 was stuck
 at 87% just now until I pulled out the SD card for 5 sec then reinserted it as the % changed to 89%</p>
<p>

</p><p>It seems like it would be very difficult to know, as someone executing the commands beforehand and then not experiencing the issue doesn't prove anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I can't even recall the last time that I had to roll back a build, but I was impressed that it kicked in after the second hard reboot and only took about 5 minutes. Also, when going back to WU, the build didn't have to DL again, but it did have to
 go through that fairly lengthy pre-first reboot phase again as well as the full 30-minute install phase, as expected.</p>

<p>So this was a fresh install of windows 10, and then a fresh install of office 2010. Ran all the updates.&nbsp; I can't run in safe mode because the workbook relies on addins from Bloomberg as well as internal.&nbsp; but running the same sheet on windows 7, the calculation
 fly by just fine.&nbsp; using VBA to force a calculation for each worksheet also returns very quickly....s not sure where the issue is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be handy to have a tool that could tell which cells took the longest to calculate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a repair did not do anything to help the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We figured out that the way Excel is calculating a formula has changed for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have a VBA function called MYOFFSET which wraps the Excel OFFSET function in order to make it non volatile. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that if we have a formula like =D1*MYOFFSET(blah), if D1 changes, it actually calculates also the MYOFFSET function in VBA whereas it did not do that in windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if we actually separate the two components and move the offset to another cell like say E1 and then do a formula in F1 =D1*E1, it does not recalculate the MYOFFFSET VBA function. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something is off.&nbsp; Perhaps the office updates for 2010 on windows 10 do not include some adjustment that was made for windows 7 ?&nbsp;</p>

 teams files from appdata that don't get removed on the uninstall.&nbsp; I'm guessing it's looking at something in credential manager I didn't get rid of: one of the office credentials, or at a reg entry that is looking at old credentials.&nbsp; Does anyone have any

                    <p>Hi, What I would now like to be able to do is search column A with the values of column D and return the corresponding column B values into column E.&nbsp; Would normally use a vlookup.&nbsp; However column D has repeated values.&nbsp; I therefore please need a formula
 which recognises this and returns the first and then 2nd corresponding value (or more if needed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my example, the result would look like (vertically)</p>

<h3> sarae878  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting Old PPT into new Template</h2>
                    I go to New Slide &gt; Reuse Slides and find my old PPT, when I import the slide it looses my entire new slide template. I have to import each individual slide THEN hit layout and format. Before I could import and it would import as best it could into new
 template. Now it imports and deletes the existing template. Any help would be appreciated. I have no idea why it is deleting the new template.&nbsp;

            <p>The original thread discussed converting a PPT format to a newer template. Frankly, that would never work well, because the old PPT format lacked Themes and customizable slide layouts. It just doesn't save forward in a useful form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your corporate template was constructed well (most are not) and both it and the presentation are in .pptx format, then you should be seeing the correct colors, etc. Try going through the presentation and click on the
<strong>Home&gt;Slides&gt;Reset</strong> button for each one. That should update the slide formatting to the attached slide layout and correct the appearance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My successful experience is as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no issue when I convert PPT file from my own template to any other new template. Yet recently I did meet the same issue as raised when I converted my company ppt file from the old company ppt template to the new company ppt template. I now solved
 this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The root cause is that after you convert the ppt file from old company ppt template to the new template, you have to open your new ppt template master and you will find that there are some slides which are different from the new template master (including
 footer and header, dates, page numbers and esp. the background of old template does exist). What you need to do is that you delete all what you do not want from the old template (footer, headers, dates, page numbers which replace or cover your new template
 and then the most important step is you need to click the slide with background of&nbsp; your old template. In fact that background different from the new template is an image which covered your new template background. Removing that image can show the background
 of your new template. With these steps, you can see what you want in the new&nbsp; template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just solved the above issue yesterday.Hope this will be helpful to you all.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I would like to confirm what type of custom domain you want to add.<br />
If it is like www.contoso.com, the value for the txt record should be www instead of @.<br />
If you want to add a domain like contoso.com, the value of TXT should be @.</p>
<p>The part of your email address after the @ is your domain name. For example:<br />
1.If your email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, contoso.com is the domain name.<br />
2.If your email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, contoso.onmicrosoft.com is the domain name.<br />
3.If you have a website at www.contoso.com, contoso.com is the domain name.<br />

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>thanks for sharing the information in the private message.</p>
<p>based on the information, the domain you want to add in office 365 is <strong>
www.lsxxxxxxx.com</strong>. however, i have checked and found that the txt record you add in your dns host is like the image below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7da81812-7489-43d7-a78c-1870f6c5e908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7da81812-7489-43d7-a78c-1870f6c5e908" /></a></p>
<p>we can see that <strong>www</strong> is missing and there is just <strong>lsxxxxxx.com</strong>.</p>
<p>therefore, i suggest you remove the old txt record and add a new one in your dns host. please note the things below:<br />
1.add your host name or alias as <strong>www.lsxxxxxx.com</strong> in your dns host.<br />
2.the record type needs to be <strong>txt</strong>.<br />
3.the value is <strong>ms=msxxxxxxxx</strong><br />
4.ttl is <strong>3600</strong> or <strong>1 hour</strong>.</p>
<p>let us know if this works for you.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>hi john,</p>
<p>we can add the txt record with www. while there is a cname record with www.:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f702e622-d5a4-41dd-bdea-ea12603f0450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df702e622-d5a4-41dd-bdea-ea12603f0450" /></a></p>
<p>since you cannot add www. to the txt record without creating a conflict, we suggest:<br />
1. if you have tried to add the root domain, remove it from office 365 admin center. also remove the related dns records from your dns hosting provider to avoid possible conflicts.</p>
<p>2. if the issue persists, you can seek expert help from your dns hosting provider.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

    <title>Create SQL query in VBA using table names and fields from an Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertperkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create SQL query in VBA using table names and fields from an Access table</h2>
                    I have a table, call it tblSelFields, containing the following fields: TableName, SF1, SF2, SF3... SF20. Each record in tblSelFields contains table names and the field names of user-selected fields from those tables. For instance, the records may look
 like the following (TableName is the first field followed by the fieldname fields SF1-SF20. I'll show only a few fields here for brevity.
<div>tblPipeSpool, Sys, Line, Spool, Spec, Hours, ProgressPct</div>
<div>tblElecDevice, Room, Area, Tag, System, Hours, ProgressPct</div>
<div>tblFoundations, Area, Type, Depth, Volume, Hours, ProgressPct<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The purpose of the table is to allow users to identify tables in the database which represent disparate work types which must be progressed using the same form. Each table will likely contain different numbers of fields, but the fields the user selects
 and enters in tblSelFields represent those fields the user can use to filter to allow easier selection.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to do an SQL query in VBA which takes the values from the above table and produces the recordsource for the progressing form, based on which TableName the user selects in a combobox on the form. I don't want to produce unique forms for each of the
 separate records in the table as I will never know how many records (tables) it may eventually contain, anywhere from one to dozens give or take.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was thinking the code would work on the following lines:</div>
<div>strTbleName=Me.cboTableName</div>
<div>strSF1=dlookup("SF1","strTbleName",true)</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>strSF20=dlookup("SF20","strTbleName",true)</div>
<div>strRecSource="SELECT " &amp; strSF1 &amp; " " &amp; ... strSF20 &amp; " FROM " &amp; strTbleName</div>
<div>me.recordsource=strRecSource</div>
<div>me.requery</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem has been how to build the string using the values returned by the dlookups.</div>
                </div>

            <p>The field names returned by the SQL should be fixed, otherwise you'd not only have to change the record source of the form, but also the control source of all bound controls on the form.</p>

    <title>Copy Text From Image not working in Mac OS Mojave - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> first academy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy Text From Image not working in Mac OS Mojave</h2>
                    I have recently started using OneNote 2016 (or whatever it is called) on the Mac.
<br />
<br />
When right clicking (or Ctrl Clicking) on an image, I do not have the <em><strong>Copy Text From the Image
</strong></em>option available at all.<br />
<br />
The same is however present when I am working on the same document on Windows (10).<br />
<br />
Another twist to the tale is that, once the image has been OCRed in Windows, the option is appearing in Mac.<br />
<br />
I have tried this on two different Macs via two different Office accounts, on two different versions of operating systems (Sierra and Mojave). The problem persists in all cases.<br />
<br />
It is extremely frustrating to be working on crippled OneNote. <br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thank you!

</p><p>
</p><p><del>I have tested OneNote version 16.17 on Mac Mojave OS version 14.0 and can reproduce the issue. To better understand all the environments you have tested, could you please share with us all the affected Mac OS version ( Apple icon &gt; About This Mac) and

    <title>Apply Styles Pane Shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mbus_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apply Styles Pane Shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>Silly question, perhaps, but here goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am putting together a document, I find it convenient to use the CTRL + SHIFT + S shortcut in Word 2013 to quickly apply a style to some text. However, once I'm done applying the style, the "Apply Style" pane loses focus but doesn't close. This is
 obnoxious, because it covers part of the navigation pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can just click the "x" and close it, but I'm much faster if I can use a keyboard. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine. And I have found that selecting the box (by hitting ctrl+shift+s again) and then hitting escape does not close it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a good way I can close the pane using only the keyboard?<br />

            <p>Not silly at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the following macro in your normal template and attach it to a keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub CloseApplyStyles()<br />
'<br />
' CloseApplyStyles Macro<br />
'<br />
'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CommandBars("Apply Styles").Visible = False<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could just record a macro closing the dialog and assign it to a keyboard shortcut when your record it. The macro shown is one I recorded clicking on the "x." Otherwise, see

</p><p>I have recently added a colleague to an external network. Unfortunately he is now unable to join the network - he only gets a message in his browser saying "Your membership is pending. Please check you email inbox for you activation email." There is no email

            <p>Hi Sushil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some groups are indeed appearing on the left side of the home network, even though I have not joined them.&nbsp; When I click on these goups, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This group is private. Request to join to view its messages."</p>
<p>
</p><p>One the top right corner of the page, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pending"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I have no means of cancelling the join request to remove the pending groups from the left side of the home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Yammer enterprise network&nbsp; associated with office 365.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two groups listed on the left panel which are pending.</p>

</p><p>As far as I can tell, there are no private groups for which I can test this with
<span>2. Yammer standalone Enterprise.&nbsp; </span><span>As for 1. </span><span>Yammer free basic, I haven't tried that yet, unless I'm confusing it with 2.</span></p>

<p>If you are not a member of the group and still showing up in the list than I would request you kindly contact the group admin to cancel the request or accept it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or if you are a verified admin of the yammer home network than next to the pending state there be a setting gear box icon kindly click on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then select the add or remove members and search for your name after getting your profile there click on setting box and select remove from group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you can ask verified admin to follow the same above steps.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 &#47; SaveSetting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>   say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 &#47; SaveSetting</h2>
                    <p>I use SaveSetting/GetSetting to store some parameters for my Excel file. It worked fine in Excel 2011, and the parameters were stored in /Preferences/***.plist file.
</p>
<p>In Excel 2016 it doesn't work. Specifically, Excel saves and reads the settings, but I cannot locate them in the file. This is a problem, as I use an external application to write settings in the file, but Excel 2016 doesn't see them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know where Excel 2016 stores its settings for SaveSetting?</p>

    <title>PowerPoint Can&#39;t Get Updated Excel Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinphillips1  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint Can&#39;t Get Updated Excel Data</h2>
                    <p>I have a PowerPoint presentation and each slide has a linked table of data and a chart from Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I update this every week with new data, then open PowerPoint, click update and the new data goes into my slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week I started getting the file not available for update error for the table data. The charts still update fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are in the exact same spot they've been since I started doing this 10 months ago. No directory changes, no file name changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Hi Kevin,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Based on your description, I need to confirm if you try the following steps to link to Excel files:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Open PowerPoint&gt;select Insert.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click Object&gt;select Create from file&gt;navigate to the Excel file.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Check Link&gt;click OK.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If so, I suggest you relinked the Excel table to check if you can update the table successfully.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</span></span></span></p>
<p>1. The screenshot of error message if there is any error message when you select updating.<br />
2. The screenshot of link. (Click File&gt;select Edit Links to Files)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35554094-c67a-4471-b6c9-40adbb6df113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35554094-c67a-4471-b6c9-40adbb6df113" /></a></p>
<p>3. The detailed Office version. (Click file&gt;select Account)<br />
4. Check if all files have the issue.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></span></p>

<p>Sometimes keeping your working files on the desktop leads to these conflicts. The conflict arises as your desktop is a part of your system drive. The system drive is protected more than the other drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are manually transferring some files into the C drive, it asks you if you want to do it, or if you have the administrative privileges. When things are automatic, it may block those attempts at connection deeming them to be malicious programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple solution is to work in a different drive. A logical drive, any other drive than the system drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also open the program in administrative mode each time to make it have all the privileges and not get stuck at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These issues can happen randomly due to some automatic update to the windows file and its security features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Based on your description, I need to confirm if the Excel file stored on the location of link:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3af61899-2fe8-41b8-bc49-0a0f9aa0ce33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3af61899-2fe8-41b8-bc49-0a0f9aa0ce33" /></a></p>
<p>If not, I would like to explain that you can’t update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try relink the Excel file to check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>1. Delete the Excel table on PowerPoint.</p>
<p>2. Relink the Excel file again to check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing </p>

<p>Yes, the Excel file is located exactly where it is listed above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint knows exactly where it is, but for some reason can't update from it.</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you made any changes to Office or the operating system when the issue started happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also have a new update for the Current Channel, version 1711 (Build 8730.2127), please try to update to the latest version and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>
