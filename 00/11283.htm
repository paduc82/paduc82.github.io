<h2>            Is it possible to create a macro for photos&#63; If so, how do I go about doing the above steps in a macro&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Word 2010 Macros</em> </p>
<p>I am working on a 250 page Word document in Word 2010. I need to insert 200+ photos into this document. For each of these photos I need to do the following:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>place a fine line, black border around the photo.<br />
</li><li>insert a caption under the photo</li><li>tell the caption not to have a border around it<br />
</li><li>Center the text of the caption<br />
</li><li>group the photo &amp; caption together<br />
</li><li>tell the grouped photo/caption to have a "tight" text wrap<br />
</li><li>Anchor the photo to a specific location on the various pages of the document</li></ol>
I just thought it would be much easier if I could create a MACRO to do the above steps. This is the first time I've ever created a macro. When I ran the macro the photo I was working with went wild....the photo cropped itself in half and moved to the location
 of where I had created the macro on the first photo.<br />
<br />
QUESTION: Is it even possible to create a macro for photos? If so, how do I go about doing the above steps in a macro?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

            <p>I just tried the macro recorder. Seems like half the stuff, directly related to photo, can't be picked up by the macro recorder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could:</p>
<p>&nbsp;insert a picture (but only one explicit picture, could not make it generic ... &lt;sigh&gt;)</p>
<p>insert a caption</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't</p>
<p>define a border</p>
<p>caption didn't have a border by default</p>
<p>Centering didn't work on caption</p>
<p>Grouping didn't work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personlly I have 2 strategies for photos and captions. Usually I use a "soft return", &lt;SHF&gt;&lt;ENTER&gt; to keep the caption together with the photo on the page.&nbsp; If I want to get a little more fancy I use a 1 column, 2 row TABLE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can define most of the characteristics you want on a table, then save it as Autotext so you can quickly place a new table, ready for you to enter the picture and caption</p>

<p><b>Summary:
</b>One handy way to save your table formats is to define them as AutoText entries. Here's how to do it the easiest. (This tip works with MS Word 2007.)</p>

 Word position your tables for you</em></span></a></span>
<p><strong><span>Date</span></strong><span>: February 26th, 2008</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Author</span></strong><span>: Mary Ann Richardson
</span></p>
<p><span>You‚Äôve just created a table at the end of the first page of your Word document, but would like the table to appear in the middle of your page instead.
 Your first instinct might be to click and drag the table into position, but no matter how many times you move the mouse to adjust the table‚Äôs position it never seems quite right ‚Äî either the table is not exactly where you want it, or the text runs up against
 the table borders. If you try reformatting the text on the page, the table moves out of its central position.</span></p>
<p><span>Rather than use the mouse, just tell Word to position it for you. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the table.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the table and select Table Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Table tab, under Text Wrapping, click Around.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Positioning button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under Horizontal, click the drop-down arrow in the Position box and select Center.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the drop-down arrow in the Relative To box and select Page.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under Vertical, click the drop-down arrow in the Position box and select Center.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the drop-down arrow in the Relative To box and select Page.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under Distance From Surrounding Text, click the up arrow once in the Top text box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the up arrow once in the Bottom text box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If necessary, clear the Move With Text check box, then click OK twice.</span></p>
<p><span>Word positions the table exactly in the middle of the page; the table will remain in place even if you later make formatting changes.</span></p>

</p><p>I have a large film &amp; tv library with Microsoft and am presently unable to access it through XBox Live on my Xbox 360 console.&nbsp; I recently automatically renewed my Gold status and the charge had to be submitted twice but i'm not sure that has anything to
 do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise all apps/functions are working well to include my ability to access the library through the laptop app on a Microsoft OS computer.</p>

<p>I am also having this problem. </p>
<p>Also before I was getting the error and the videos would play, some of them were glitchy and wouldn't play back at the normal frame rate. It wasn't my internet. It would only do it to a few movies, like Toy Story 1, but it wouldn't happen with Moana or Frozen.
 Not sure if this problem is related or if it's just a bad copy on Microsoft servers? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

            Im having the same issue. It's been three days and i cant get into the Video app service at all.&nbsp; I just spent a while trying to chat with Xbox on the website and they had no idea what i was talking about. The lady I was chatting with was so incompetent
 that I almost cancelled my account because of her stupidity.&nbsp; I have tried deleting my profile, deleting and reloading the app, clearing my system cache, and restarting my console more times than i can count. Somebody please help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi - I have been a Xbox user/owner since the original gaming platform was released. I‚Äôve owned a Xbox 360 (two as my original 360 suffered from the infamous red ring of death issue) for nearly 14 years and have had a gold membership for just as long. My
 wife and I watch movies every weekend through our xbox 360 using microsoft movies &amp; TV. I think I am deserving of a status update relative to 80C90010 due to my long tenure as a microsoft/Xbox customer. Please provide a status update ASAP as well as an ETA
 on the resolvement of the issue. Also, please escalate my message as far up the chain as you can.&nbsp;

            I too am having the same problem with both of my XBox360s. I tried renting Glass when it became available. All I got was it locking up. I tried all of the steps. I looked at network settings and the weird thing was it that live service not available. I
 called tech support and went through all&nbsp;of their recommendations to no avail. I requested a refund and haven't heard diddly squat. Today I tried to rent&nbsp;Captain Marvel and the same thing happened. Luckily my son has a Xbox One. Guess what, it worked flawlessly.
 So that leads me to believe it is directly related to the XBox360.&nbsp;Does the&nbsp;it need an update for HDCP or the movies and tv app?

            <span>I'm having the same trouble. Was the issue resolved?&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I have xbox 360. I have tried calling only to get an auto response asking questions then a hang up. I tried Microsoft chat with no response and searching
 forum solutions aren't helping. All the other apps on xbox working. I have a gold membership. Microsoft xbox and I have a contract as long as I pay. You're breaking it. I'm pretty frustrated and running out of patience because it's almost impossible to speak
 to a live person to rectify the situation. I would be satisfied if I were told you're working on it. Thank you in advance.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue is caused due to drivers. Once the compatible drivers are available for Windows 10 Technical Preview these issues might get fixed. In this scenario, you have two options one is to
 wait till the final release of Windows 10 or else you may contact AMD support and Intel Support and check if there any drivers available for this or if anyone else has reported the same issue with the AMD graphics card and fixed the same.</span></p>
<p>

read up about the local Nokia careline, I called up to find status of<br />
my phone (whether it is legit or not).<br />
<br />
While the careline operator confirmed the legitimate status of my<br />
phone purchase (I bought mine from united mobiles), I was prompted to<br />
self-update my phone's software over the internet. Which I did.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, my phone's language reverted to a european set<br />
(french/italian/german) instead of the usual south-asian set<br />
(urdu/farsi/arabic). On top of that, my phone's keyboard started<br />
acting peculiarly, inputing the wrong characters when I pressed<br />
different keys. (the . key displayed a ? on screen and so forth).<br />
<br />
I called up the nokia careline and was directed to the nokia care<br />
centre in Lahore.<br />
<br />
On January 11, I deposited my cell at the careline office (to a very<br />
busy 'care' representative who jotted down what she thought the<br />
problem was) and I was asked to follow up after four days.<br />
<br />
I followed up after four days and was asked to follow up again after five days.<br />
<br />
Today, I received an SMS from some&nbsp; nokia careline rep who quoted my<br />
repair ticket LHR-33331 and informed me to pick it up.<br />
<br />
When I sent my guy to pick it up the phone it was returned UNREPAIRED<br />
with an indication that it's a common place issue with all updated E71 sets in Pakistan and MAY be repaired once a keyboard shipment reaches nokia pakistan in 30 days or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After exchanging 9 emails back and forth from nokia careline, what nobody has been able to explain to me is:<br />
1. Why&nbsp; must I suffer at the hand of a faulty software update?<br />
2. Why can't the customer care representative at the care centre<br />
listen to my problem in the first place?<br />
3. Why didn't anyone bother informing me at the first instance that<br />
there will be an unforseen delay?<br />
4. What was the nokia care centre doing with my phone for 11 days if<br />
they knew they didn't have the technology or the hardware to repair<br />
it?<br />
5. Does nokia treat all it's customers the same way or is this<br />
unprofessional behaviour specific to pakistan?<br />
<br />

<p>The updater will load the version of the software and languages that are specific to the handsets product code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there have been languages <em>added on</em> by a third party, or by tampering with the product code (which invalidates the warranty) so that it loads a region specific firmware and then returned it back to its original code,&nbsp;then this will be beyond the
 scope of the software update, and the original software languages will be loaded and the added on languages will not be included. It does tell you this on the last screen of Nokia Software Updater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a problem with your handset perhaps taking it up with where you purchased it from would help, it would seem some language pack modification had take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst you have gone to the trouble of checking that the phone is a geniune handset it could be one that has been imported from a different (european)&nbsp;country. You will need to check the product code of the handset, by looking at the label under the battery
 for&nbsp;code and the numbers by the side of it, if you google the code with the words Nokia E71 you will find your product code description on many sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The care centre should have installed the correct languages that you require, however this is not normally covered by warranty and you would normally have to pay for this and almost certainly if your handset is not designed for that region. (example it has
 been imported)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The keyboard will work incorrectly because it would seem that the keyboard map in the software is no different from the one physically installed in the phone, loading the correct languages again will rectify that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally this is a user-to-user forum, and as such the moderators will not respond, if you have a problem with Nokia you should use the Contact Us link at the top of this page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saying DO NOT UPDATE is hardly helpful, my handset works perfect with the correct languages for my region, what would be helpful to owners in your region would be to check the product code before updating.</p>

<p>Shunts :) thank you for replying to the post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really helpful (from a user-to-user perspective) but things (nokia distribution/brand-ownership/service-criteria) are a little different here in Pakistan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just posting here, so that someone (too enthusiastic for his/her own good) may read it BEFORE upgrading E series firmware specifically in Pakistan).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia, in Pakistan, while asking consumers to auto-update (via nokia careline IVR and the local website) fails to mention these kinds of displaced-set-anomalies (European region sets that are sold BY nokia here in Pakistan).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I've taken this particular issue up with Nokia Pakistan, I'd be happy if the potential disaster (device getting screwed up without warning and the dilly-dallying that happens because Nokia pakistan has outsourced it's care-line to a very cluless bunch
 of people) doesn't happen to other souls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            Well Dear Bro,<br />
I have faced the same problem with my Nokia E63 I have contacted Nokia care there help line and many more ways I could. But the end result was zero.<br />
Its true that the people working for Nokia in Pakistan are very incompetent and non cooperative. They even dont bother to hear the problem Nokia Phones. I find the simple solution by purchasing Samsung Corby.<br />

<h2>            can highlight colors be adjusted in Word 2003&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on converting a massive document from WordPerfect to Word.&nbsp; Certain sections are highlighted in pale yellow, pale green and pale blue.&nbsp; The highlight color selection in Word 2003 isn't comparable (the only light blue available is turquoise, which

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to adjust the 15 highlight colors?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately, my office is thinking of upgrading to MS Office 2013...are the options any different for highlighting with 2013?</p>

            There is no way to use any other colors for an actual highlight (and no, this is not different in Word 2013). But text background shading can look exactly like highlighting, and it offers the full range of colors. Greg Maxey offers a free add-in at
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/highlighter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/highlighter.html</a> that makes this as easy to use as the highlight tool.<br />

Worked great with the test files I provided so thanks!!<br />
<br />
Now I have moved it to the production data set and the Workbook is in Excel 2007 and has 295000 lines. When I try to modify the formula it gives me and error about the range being invalid.
<br />
<br />
I have saved the file in 2007 format (.xlsx) so I guess I am not understanding something.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Never mind, I updated the links and now it seems to be working.<br />

    <title>Use Active Sheet in Index Match formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nahuatl_c137  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Active Sheet in Index Match formula</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently working with the following Formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX(Packaging!$U:$U,MATCH($A$1&amp;INDEX($C:$C,MATCH("Component",$D:$D,0)),Packaging!$S:$S&amp;Packaging!$T:$T,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works after pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem starts when I try to copy and paste to another sheet. The formula then changes to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX(Packaging!$U:$U,MATCH('<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SHEET I COPIED FORMULA FROM</span>'!$A$1&amp;INDEX($C:$C,MATCH("Component",$D:$D,0)),Packaging!$S:$S&amp;Packaging!$T:$T,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried fixing this issue by inserting a formula which looks for the active sheet name:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX(Packaging!$U:$U,MATCH('RIGHT(CELL("filename"),LEN(CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("]",CELL("filename")))'!$A$1&amp;INDEX($C:$C,MATCH("Component",$D:$D,0)),Packaging!$S:$S&amp;Packaging!$T:$T,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, I replaced the name of the sheet I copied the formula from with this formula which retrieves the name of the worksheet:</p>
<p>RIGHT(CELL("filename"),LEN(CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("]",CELL("filename")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>MID(CELL("filename",H9),FIND("]",CELL("filename",H9))+1,SUM(LEN(CELL("filename",H9))-FIND("]",CELL("filename",H9)))) --- H9 is only a reference cell so the formula can work, nothing to do with what I'm trying to achieve. It works on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>None of these methods are working. How can I retrieve the name of the active worksheet using index and match array formula? I don't want to use VBA because if change something I'm afraid I won't be able to adjust the code since I don't know how to
 code in VBA that much.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried placing the "MID(CELL" from above in B22, then referencing it within the "INDEX(MATCH" formula. This is what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX(Packaging!$U:$U,MATCH('[B22]Aloe Vera Juice Cranberry'!$A$1&amp;INDEX($C:$C,MATCH("Component",$D:$D,0)),Packaging!$S:$S&amp;Packaging!$T:$T,0))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works, but once I press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER it asks me to "update values: B22" by popping up my documents and prompting me to press the Workbook I'm working with. It also does not help my problem of copying and pasting into another worksheet. Also,
 I'm using two criteria in the index match as you can see, and when either of these two variables changes, the formula does not update appropriately.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Where you have adapted your formula to grab the old sheet's workbook/worksheet name, you need to the INDIRECT() function to take the text result that the CELL() returns and use it as an address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So </p>
<p>CELL("filename"),LEN(CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("]",CELL("filename")))&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '!$A$1</p>
<p>Becomes</p>
<p>
</p><p>INDIRECT( "'" &amp; CELL("filename"),LEN(CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("]",CELL("filename"))) &amp; "'!$A$1")</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I think I got it all correct.&nbsp; You might put that as a formula in another cell, as:</p>
<p>="'" &amp; CELL("filename"),LEN(CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("]",CELL("filename"))) &amp; "'!$A$1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to see what it is all building up as an address for you, and if required, 'tweak' it until it gives what you need/expect.</p>

<p>
</p><p>my skype has updated and the instructions aren't what I'm seeing.</p>
<p>I'm using Win 7 on a desktop.</p>
<p>that's problem 1</p>
<p>problem 2 is I created a skype group.</p>
<p>as I recall I am an admin</p>
<p>I have 2 people who are joining the group, posting spam and leaving</p>
<p>I'm unable to kick them out because they leave</p>
<p>I'm also unable to do any /set options or otherwise set a ban list</p>
<p>problem 3</p>
<p>I'm not able to do any admin features now</p>
<p>
</p><p>the newer version (which I assume I have but can't locate) is not as user friendly or accommodating as previous version, so I realllllly don't like it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you address these issues</p>
<p>my email is a*******@********</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f0ec3bb9-09d2-4e55-841b-8f3bc5adb287" title="Mr Richard Phillips">
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, what is the exact version of Skype installed on your device? How are you removing the participants? Are you removing a participant using a chat command or removing a participant manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. <br />
Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Getting skype for desktop.</h2>
                    I really hate, and can't stand the new skype windows 10 app and would much prefer having the old application. However when my computer had to be reset I lost the original application and now I am unable to find a download for it. It seems like microsoft
 are forcing you to use their new much worse windows 10 app. Is there anyway to use the old application?

<h2>            Nokia 6500 slide &#47; connecting to computer</h2>
                    I have just tried to use my cable to connect my phone to my computer but the cable has three leads colour marked red, white and yellow and I am not sure where to plug them in as there are only&nbsp;2 sockets at the front and nothing seems to match the back
 of the computer. Can anyone help? thanks.

            The cable that you're trying to use, is the TV-Out cable and NOT the USB cable. Use it only for connecting your phone to a TV or a tuner card on a PC or similar devices. In order to connect your phone to your PC, you will need either a bluetooth connection
 (if you're using a not-so-old laptop, then it will have bluetooth facility) or a USB connection, that requires a compatible data cable. The sales pack would include the USB cable also.

<p>that has to be a classic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yep the included cable with the 6500 slide should be the CA-101 USB cable. simply plug it into one of the USB ports and select Mass Storage mode and it will come up as a Removable Disk in Windows Explorer (providing you have the microSD card inserted in
 the phone)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to load the Data Analysis Toolpak in Excel 365.&nbsp; It is listed in Options --&gt; Add-ins, under Inactive Application Add-ins. All the instructions I've found say there should be a tick-box to tick to select it, but I don't have a tick-box for any
 of the add-ins listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Dell PC is running Win 7 Pro 32 bit, if that's of any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t Cortana work on my phone&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 635, and as you may know Cortana is available. Ever since January, two weeks after I got my phone shes been broken. All she does is Bing searches. I fiddled around with the settings, and she still doesn't work. My cellular phone is
 set to British English, but also set to me living in America. Since I do use British English, and I do live in America. She won't work, does anyone know why? Thank thou for trying.

                    <p>I have been fighting with this messed up program all day and I need to find out what is going on for my job.
</p>
<p>But this program won't let me in, it kicked me out this morning when I tried to get messages to find out where I was needed and have not been able to get back in. So after fighting with it most of the day, I come home from work and try to talk to someone
 who can help me and get this messed up excuse of a run around that just goes in circles and will not allow me to talk to someone.

    <title>Unsubscribe from insider emails when I do not have an insider account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scienceofspock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unsubscribe from insider emails when I do not have an insider account</h2>
                    <p>I recently started receiving Windows Insider emails to one of my email addresses. The instructions, which DO NOT include an actual unsubscribe link (Which might be illegal), say that in order to unsubscribe, you actually have to leave the insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the real problem with this (and these types of emails without a direct way to unsubscribe): I AM NOT A PART OF THE WINDOWS INSIDER PROGRAM. I cannot log in to "remove myself" from the program because I am not a member of the program, yet I still get
 the emails. When I try to login using the email address that the emails come to, it flat out tells me that it can find no accounts with that email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. How in the hell did I end up getting these emails? (Seriously, I'm going to need to hear from Microsoft, how I receive emails from a program that I have never signed up for)</p>
<p>2. WHY IN HELL isn't there a regular unsubscribe link?!?</p>
<p>3. Most importantly, How do I stop this SPAM that I never signed up for in the first place?!?</p>

<p>Thanks for the link, EQ, but they were no help. I went there, and the agent wasn't able to help me. She put me through to "technical support", which I guess is a different department, and that guy couldn't help me, and also couldn't direct me to anyone who
 can help me. Who in the hell do I need to talk to in order to have my friggin' email address removed from a friggin' database? This is MICROSOFT. Arguably one of the largest and most respected tech companies on the planet and they can't remove my email address
 from a damn spam list. Wasted almost 3 HOURS of my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on who I can contact, other than my lawyer? Anyone have a friend of a friend in whatever unique department controls the insider newsletter emails?</p>

<p>I appreciate the attempt, but did you actually read my post? I am NOT a member of the insider program. The email address in question isn't associated with any Microsoft account at all, yet I still receive the emails. If I try to login or recover password
 using that email, it tells me there is no account with that email address in their system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how it's supposed to work, but it doesn't, and I think I did a good enough job spelling that out in my original message.</p>

            We would not have received your email from any other source than the Windows Insider registry database, so I'd ask if you have completed those steps first. If you went through these steps and still receive emails after the allotted time, then there is
 a glitch and we'd have to fix in another way.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Tyler,</p>
<p>You still don't seem to understand that I have been through that process and <strong>
IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE I AM NOT PART OF THE INSIDER PROGRAM.&nbsp;</strong><strong>I cannot login and when I try to recover the password for the email address I am receiving the emails at, it tells me there is no insider account associated with that email address.</strong>
 Is that clear enough for you? I explained that above, in great detail, and yet you still offer this as advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is all you are going to do, stop. It's not helpful. Leave it for other, more knowledgeable people.</p>
