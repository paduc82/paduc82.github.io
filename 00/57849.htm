<h2>            Keyboard won&#39;t let me type double letters, and other problems</h2>
                    <p>SYSTEM:<br />
Lenovo Edge 15 Laptop</p>
<p>Windows 10 (latest version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW THE KEYBOARD ACTS:</p>
<p>My keyboard won't let me type the same letter twice. It's as if the key "sticks" until I hit a different key. For instance, to type "letter", I had to hit the Delete button between the two t's. This also applies to arrow keys, backspace, etc.</p>
<p>The reason I think the keys are "sticking" is that when I try to play games, if I hit a key once it will act as if that key is being held down. Also when I hit Ctrl and then try to scroll on a webpage, the page will zoom in and out (as if Ctrl is being held
 down) until I hit another key. And a couple more issues like this.</p>
<p>If I hold a key down, after a moment it will start to repeat the letter. Afterwards when I hold that same letter down it will repetitively type that letter for the duration of the key press, without needing to be held down for a moment.</p>
<p>If I hold another key down while typing I'm able to type double letters, but this is an unrealistic fix.
</p>
<p>I don't believe it's a hardware issue, since it's happening to every single key. I haven't spilled anything on the keyboard or damaged it in any way. I don't have an external USB keyboard to test with, however, so it's not beyond possibility.</p>
<p>Sorry if the description is confusing, it's hard to capture without visuals.</p>
<p>Typing normally: This is what it loks like when I type normaly on this keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typing while holding down shift: I"M ABLE TO REPEAT LETTERS BUT THIS ISN"T A GOOD FIX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHEN THIS STARTED HAPPENING:<br />
My keyboard was working fine previously. I didn't use it for about two weeks since I was busy with a move. During that time I stored it (safely) in a backpack. When I opened it back up the keyboard issue had started. I have no idea what could have happened,
 since I wasn't using it. I've had this issue for about a week now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT I'VE TRIED:</p>
<p>I tried turning the laptop off and on again, of course. </p>
<p>Filter Keys is OFF, but I tried turning Filter Keys on and back off anyway. Sticky Keys and etc. are also OFF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the keyboard drivers, updating them, etc.</p>
<p>I tried resetting the default language, since this also resets the keyboard.</p>
<p>I tried fiddling with the Keyboard settings under Control Panel.</p>
<p>I tried running the Device troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I tried looking in the Registry editor for any strange values, but everything looked normal (so I didn't actually edit anything).</p>
<p>I tried resetting Windows 10 while keeping my files. No change, so I then tried resetting my computer and wiping all files just in case there was some stray Keyboard settings file or something. STILL no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked. I'm not sure what else to try, so before I go to a computer repair shop I'd like to consult the forums for any ideas/suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Issues connecting to phone hotspot</h2>
                    
<p>In my home, we have 3 Xbones, 2 360s, 3 cell phones, and 1 tablet. Everything will connect to my home internet. But I live in the boondocks and only have ATT, which gives me 1 mbps upload. When I moved in, and when the internet went out, I would use my phones
 hotspot as a stopgap while the internet got fixed. Well, I want to upload a lot of clips, but with that upload speed, even a 9 second clip takes some time, let alone anything more. Lately tho, my console will not connect to the hotspot. Every other device,
 including 2 xbones, connect just peachy, with over 13 mbps upload on my hotspot (gotta luv 4g).</p>
<p>When I try to connect to the hotspot with my console, however, it always give me the "DNS cant resolve xbox server names" type error. Always, months go by, still the same issue. I have no idea why this is only affecting my console. I used to game with my
 phones hotspot fantastically compared to my pathetic home internet. tech support has been very little help, with nearly no troubleshooting, and wanting me to pay over a hundred bucks to send it in, then wait a month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would prefer exploring alternatives to this. So I've come here. I simply can't afford to send this thing in, with xmas around the corner and missing work for medical reasons, I just don't have the spare cash to fix a supposed hardware issue. To boot, my
 warranty expired in march, back when this isn't was not present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>To reiterate, I gamed on this hotspot quite a bit before, with near to no issues. Battlefield 4, WOT, all great with no lag.</p>

<h2>            Console receives power, lights up...then shuts off...</h2>
                    The Xbox one lights up, shuts off and reboots a few times until it looses power completely. I can tell that the Xbox looses power because I have an external hard drive plugged into the console which has an led that constantly blinks as long as the drive
 is plugged in. Also, after loosing power completely, the power supply remains on but the light is orange. During the rebooting of the Xbox (Manually restarting itself), the power supply switches from white to orange as the console turns on and shuts down.
 I've never even made it to the green screen. It began two days ago, the console just didn't turn on. I tried to reset the power supply...gave it a rest, still didn't work. Today I felt lucky, plunged her in...and had false success. The Xbox turned on, but
 upon its start up I received a message about keeping the ventilation uncovered and keeping the Xbox in a cool ventilated area. I've never experienced this problem, nor do I had my Xbox in a non-ventilated area. After moving on, I thoug

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>x IL 3 G ii T z,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry you're having this issue with your console. This may just be an issue with the power supply malfunctioning, which is much cheaper to replace than the console itself. Do you have a friend or family member with a known good working power supply that
 you can test with? If not I would try the troubleshooting steps<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/console-wont-power-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> here</a>, and if it doesn't work then requesting a new power supply at the
<a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">service center here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to play games or videos properly due to 100&#37; disk usage</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: "audiobg.exe" - 100% disk usage causing games to skip, hesitate, and disconnect</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am running an HP laptop with windows 8.1. &nbsp; core i7 processor, 8GB memory, 1TB HD. &nbsp; &nbsp;....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I play games or watch video at some point the game starts to skip, chatter, hesitate, lag, and eventually drops out. &nbsp;I am an advanced user and technically trained. &nbsp;I have narrowed the problem to the "audiobg.exe" file. &nbsp;I have read posts and have
 tried some of the solutions including trying to turn off audio enhancements. &nbsp; the IDT audio driver that my system is using does not have the enhanced effects tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had this problem with Windows 7. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am considering doing a clean install on this system with Windows 7 but decided to come here as a last hope of finding a solution before the "nuclear option". &nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions? &nbsp;Thanks</p>

            Hi TingHong, these rogue vbs files popup n a regular basis, they are not required system files . . .
<br />
<br />The solution is to basically to put an exit script into it 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items
<br />
<br />Vavigate to: 
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\System32 
<br />
<br />Right click that file and choose Open With - Notepad
<br />
<br />Paste this text into that file, to replace the entire contents of that file
<br />
<br />Wscript.Quit 
<br />
<br />
<br />Save that file
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

</p><li>Use File Explorer to open the folder C:\Windows\System32.</li><li>Right-click the file Maintenance.vbs</li><li>Left-click "Edit"</li><li>Delete the contents of the file, all of it.</li><li>Save and close the file.</li></ol>

<h2>            USB flash drive stopped working and isnt being detected by any computer.</h2>
                    I have had this problem with two flash drives on two separate occasions. The most recent one is a ADATA UV128/8GB. From one day to the next my computer simply stopped detecting the flash drive. Is there anyway to solve this?

<p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue usually occurs due to a disabled USB port, damaged or corrupted USB device, incorrect settings, software conflicts, or faulty or out-of-date USB controller drivers. We suggest following the methods below, one after the other, and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Try a different USB port. There are scenarios wherein a USB port does not respond at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Connect your USB to a different computer. This will help us verify whether or not the issue is specific to the USB itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Run the Windows USB troubleshooter. This automatically diagnoses and repairs common USB issues. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17614/automatically-diagnose-and-fix-windows-usb-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to download the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong>: Change the Power Management settings for the USB controller.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">a. Open<strong> Device Manager</strong> (Win+X &gt; Device Manager)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">b. Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">c. <strong>Right-click </strong>each driver that's named "USB Root Hub", and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">d. Click on <strong>Power </strong><strong>Management</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">e. Uncheck <strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 5</strong>: Uninstall/Reinstall the Universal Serial Bus controllers drivers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">a. Open <strong>Device Manager</strong> (Win+X &gt; Device Manager)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">b. Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">c. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the first driver under the Universal Serial Bus controllers section, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">d. Repeat <strong>step c</strong> on all the drivers.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">e. <strong>Restart </strong>your PC. This will automatically reinstall a generic USB controller driver for your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 6</strong>: Disable fast startup. Disabling this will allow time for the PC to detect external devices.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">a. Open <strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong>, and click on
<strong>Power </strong><strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">b. On the left pane, click on <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">c. Click on <strong>Change settings that are currently available</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">d. Uncheck <strong>Turn on fast startup</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">e. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you encounter further issues, kindly let us know.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your birthday notification is still on and you have stopped receiving Skype Birthday notifications, it is possible that the birthdate of your contact has been removed
 or changed on their end. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, this can't be controlled on your end.
</span></p>

<p>Hey Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my knowledge, Skype no more exposes the setting of switching on/off the birthday notifications settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this birthday notification issue is not happening with any particular contact, but instead i am not receiving it for any of my contacts.</p>
<p>So this rules out the doubt of my contacts hiding or changing their birth date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are still missing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure something can be done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you can assist more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Vipul Bansal</p>

<p>Andrew,</p>

</p>
<p>You can either have a static image&nbsp;background (the set as photo tile background) or a slide show. If you want a slide show, see below.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>The change Drive letter and path and mount in empty NTFS folder kludge&nbsp;does not apply to Windows 8.1.</strong>
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, in order, this is what I think you should do. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Delete C:\SSD (this won't delete the photos on the card itself).</p>
<p>2. Restart</p>
<p>3. Restore default libraries <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-pictures/show-and-restore-broken-libraries-in-windows-81/ed57b9dd-49d8-4f41-b008-8dd51dcaf76b">

<p>4. Now Add the Photos subfolder to the Photo library - you should be able to do this without the kludge that was needed for 8.0 to mount the SD card in an empty NTFS folder.</p>
<p>5. Open the Photos App, then Settings, options, turn shuffle off if it is on</p>
<p>6. On the Start screen, Turn the Live Tile off for Photos</p>
<p>7. Restart</p>
<p>8. Do <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-pictures/change-photo-tile-live-images-in-windows-81/c2707fe5-ff63-409a-80f6-e71b3cf30ae7">

<p>9. Turn the Live Tile on for Photos</p>
<p>10. Open the Photos App and go to Settings, Options and turn shuffle on</p>
<p>11. Verify that your photos appear in the library.</p>
<p>12. Leave the Photos App running, just tap the Windows Key to go back to Start.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At some point, the Live Tile should populate with the 5 image slide show.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please post results.</p>

<h3> john knight 7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 6to4 &#35;2 Adapter </h2>
                    
<p>Card reader will not read memory card from camera also when camera connected via USB software tells me no camera connected. An older 256 mb memory stick will not work when connected to USB port, it appears in drive G for a split second then disappears. Both
 memory card&nbsp;and stick have worked fine up until recently.<br />
The only problem I can see is in Device Manager which shows a problem with the 6to4 adapter #2 when clicked on the following message appears<br />
"This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device (Code 31)"<br />
When I take the option to update drivers it tells me the most uptodate drivers are already installed.<br />
Can any one help me with this please.</p>

<p><span>Hi John Knight 7,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Run the Fixit available in the link below:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices</a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>
<strong>Uninstall and reinstall the drivers.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide
 confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Device Manager, locate the USB Audio head set and then double-click the device name.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Driver tab, and then click uninstall Driver and follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the link to manually re-install the drivers
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, go to the device manufacturer’s website and download the drivers manually.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Connect the device to a different USB port and test.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4:
</span></strong><span>Reinstall USB controllers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>First,
 please disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click "Start", type in Device Manager the Search bar and press "Enter". Click Continue if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the "Host Controller", click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong><span>Update the motherboard driver to the latest version from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong><span>Please check with the motherboard manufacturer before installing the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, please check with the device manufacturer for more help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Turn off display and sleep mode problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lollygags  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off display and sleep mode problem</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1 and my computer will not turn off the display or go into sleep mode according to the power settings.&nbsp; I currently have it set to turn off the display after 5 minutes and go to sleep after 30 minutes.&nbsp; I ran the Power
 Troubleshooter and it said it found an issue with the&nbsp;"Turn hard disk off after"&nbsp;selection and changed it to 20&nbsp;minutes but the displays still won't turn off and the computer doesn't go into sleep mode as scheduled.&nbsp; I am however able to put the pc into sleep
 mode manually from the start menu so it's not like sleep mode doesn't work it just doesn't happen automatically according to the power settings.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I didn't even think to check the video driver, silly me, so I downloaded and installed the most recent version from a few days ago but I'm still running into the same issue.&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestion though.

            <p>I have the same problem. Dell XPS 2720 AIO upgraded from Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp;It used to go into sleep as configured. The screen turned off after 15 minutes and the computer went into sleep after 30 minutes. Now it stay on all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the video driver and other things I can think of. Still no go. I tried enabling screen saver to Blank after 1 minute. It doesn't trigger either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the sleep button on keyboard does put it to sleep. I can also wake it up with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>POWERCFG /REQUESTS shows no requests that stop it from going to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find out what is stopping it from going into sleep? This is very disappointing to say the least.</p>

            <p>So I tried everything and finally unplugged my joysticks from USB and now it sleeps like it used to be. The joysticks don't have its own driver. I use only the Windows build-in one. You would think Microsoft knows its own driver.</p>

<h2>            Google calendar and Windows 8 calendar app</h2>
                    I use google calendar and made the mistake of updating the windows 8 calendar app and lost all the data. Are Microsoft and google even talking about a solution for this?

            Google has discontinued using the <i>Exchange Active Sync</i><i>&nbsp;</i>service that used to power this synchronization of Calendar (and email and contacts too).
<div><br />
<div>Google had also said they were going to block out CalDAV and CardDAV for syncing with other platforms, meaning only programs Google approved could use their calendar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fortunately, there is good news: &nbsp;Google changed their mind and they <i>
will</i>&nbsp;be brining CalDAV and CardDAV support to their systems. &nbsp;Microsoft has promised to add this to their apps as well. &nbsp;So in the near feature, hopefully later this summer with Windows 8.1 update, you can go back to using Calendar here in Windows 8.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated earlier I loaned my computer to a friend. Now it is extremely slow on start-up, and Internet Explorer either won't open pages, or if it does they lock up afterwords. I did have Avira installed but removed it, now have Advanced System Care, and
 Avast. After scans from them they tell me, no virus's found. I have even tried to re-load Windows Service Pack2 for Windows Vista Home, but it wouldn't do it due to it already being installed. Please help! I'm in desperate need of getting this issue resolved.</p>

<h2>            Advice for new players</h2>
                    
<p>There are a few threads floating around with various pieces of advice on deck editing, card usage and scenarios but i thought we could all contribute to a thread with pieces of advice for players either new to Magic 2012 or new to Magic completely.</p>
<p>Rules of the thread: </p>
<ul>
<li>Each post must contain 1 or more hints/tips (this can be on card ability usage, strategies, deck creation/editing or anything useful thats magic related)
</li><li>Disagreements over rules/cards must quote said rules/cards in order to resolve. Dont forget to add a hint/tip!
</li><li>No elitism. We all know we have some great magic players amongst us and we all know best but we encourage new players to join our community so lets help them settle in.
</li><li>No flaming. If the hint/tip is completely obvious to you it doesnt mean it is to everyone. Some people dont understand how some basic abilities resolve so someone posting about them may just help!
</li><li>Post an example where possible. If you're talking about an ability resolving then give an example of a scenario where that would work
</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to reuse some other hints and tips already given elsewhere and quote where necessary. It would be nice to have this information available to our Xbox community.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My Tips</span></p>
<p>First strike damage is dealt before normal combat damage. If you have a 1/1 creature with first strike and attack a 4/1 creature that doesnt have first strike you will destroy that creature before it deals any damage to your creature.</p>
<p>Double strike is in 2 parts. The first part acts as first strike damage, the second acts as normal combat damage. If you have a 4/4 with double strike and are blocked by a 2/2 you will destroy it before it does any damage to you. If you attack and are blocked
 by a 6/6 you will do 4 damage to it as first strike damage and then another 4 as normal combat damage at the same time it will damage you with 6 - both creatures would be destroyed.</p>
<p>Try keeping your card pool as low as possible (minimum is 60). Each deck has a few game changing cards you will need at some point. Your chances of drawing that card depend on how many there are in the deck and how big your deck is. You can increase your
 chances of drawing that card by having the maximum amount of it possible in your deck and reducing your deck to the minimum amount.</p>
<p>Advance tip for Magic 2012 - Illusion creatures are destroyed when targetted by a spell or ability (where stated on the card). You can target it with anything and it will be destroyed! If you lack normal removal spells why not target it with something else.
 Even a giant growth?! Using elves you can target it for a +1/+1 counter and kill it, with the equipment deck you can 'tap target creature' and kill it. Beware when using illusion creatures - dont try and add an enchantment or equipment to it as you will destroy
 your own creature!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please assist in helping new players by contributing to this thread. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp;With the Blue/Green deck:&nbsp;Using Elvish Piper to put big creatures directly into play is good. &nbsp;But if you have the mana,
 spells, not when they merely come into play. &nbsp;Moreover, because these abilities trigger automatically when cast, they are effectively uncounterable; for example, this means that you still get to destroy something with Ulamog even if he doesn't actually resolve.</p>
<p>(2) Don't be afraid to mulligan your opening hand. &nbsp;A hand full of big, game-ending spells is absolutely worthless if you don't have mana because you won't live long enough to actually cast them. &nbsp;Conversely, a hand full of mana is equally worthless if you
 can't do anything with it. &nbsp;When deciding whether to keep your opening hand, see if there's a line of play over the next few turns (including the likelihood that you'll draw sufficient lands by the turn that you need them).</p>
<p>(3) With the White deck: Save your Kor Outfitters until you can take advantage of their free-equipping ability. &nbsp;You essentially get free mana &nbsp;to equip a creature&nbsp;when you cast them, which is especially useful with expensive equip costs like Argentum Armor
 and Penon Blade. &nbsp;Don't just cast it because you want another generic 2/2.</p>
<p>(4) Just because you <i>can</i>&nbsp;cast something doesn't mean that you <i>should.</i>&nbsp; It's ok to hang on to cards for later in the match (especially removal) when you might need them more.</p>

<h2>            Disney&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Little Mermaid&#58; Undersea Treasures - Removal of achievements</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, wasn't sure about where to post this, hopefully this is the right section.</p>
<p>Is there any chance that the achievements list for Disney's Little Mermaid: Undersea Treasures will ever be updated to remove the unobtainable achievements? The achievements in question were set to be related to downloadable content that would be released
 at a later date, but then all future content was cancelled, leaving the bare-bones version of the game with very little content. This resulted in only 25 gamerscore of a possible 200 ever being available, with 3 achievements obtainable and 17 unobtainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the base version of the game (without DLC) was free, a number of people downloaded and played the game, only to get stuck with a set of locked achievements on their profiles that will NEVER be obtainable. It'd be different if it was paid content that
 was delisted, as that would have at least been available at some point in time. With this game, players were never given the chance to even play the DLC linked to said achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Short version</strong> - Is there any chance that the achievements list will be updated to remove the 17 achievements that have never been and will never be available?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it's a long shot, but a post here is better than nothing. These are the achievements in question:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Achievements/Xbox/1297292182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Achievements/Xbox/1297292182</a>&nbsp;(hopefully that
 link works, I just got it from the achievements section on my profile).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! Unfortunately, if HitPoint is unable to assist you, then there is nothing further that can be done on the support end. We were not the developer, only the publisher, so we are unable to remove those achievements. While we may own the rights to it, that only means that no one else can work on the game itself; that does not mean we have the ability to change anything.</p>
<p>While I understand the frustration with not having a complete game showing on your account (and believe me, I do), changes to games that are no longer on the marketplace isn't something that we do. However, this isn't where it ends. I highly suggest that this be turned into a <a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/510964-posting-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback site</a> post. Be sure to post it as something vague, not specific; you will want to make sure it's an overview of the situation (game delisted, need to get rid of broken achievements - as an example). This way the right people can get an eye on the situation and it may help spur us getting new processes.</p>
<p>I thank everyone for the information they were able to gather, as well as being patient with both HitPoint and us. If you need assistance with any other support issue, please post up a new thread detailing what you're running into and troubleshooting you've completed. This way our community can get you the individual support that works best on the forums. :)</p>

            <p>Hi bobfranksYX,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sorry to know that you are facing issue Windows games. In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What operating system is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m glad to provide you with these methods which will help you to troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>I would suggest you put your computer in a clean boot state and check if these games work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 3</b> from the KB article mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b>You disable the Solitaire, Mahjong and Chess game and re enable it and check if it helps, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Start</b> button, click
<b>Control Panel</b>, click <b>Programs</b>, and then click <b>
Turn Windows features on or off</b>.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>To turn off Solitaire, Mahjong and Chess, click on
<b>Games</b>. And <b>uncheck</b> each of these games and click on
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer to apply the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Network Connection Status Indicator &#40;NCSI&#41; Showing No - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenberns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Connection Status Indicator &#40;NCSI&#41; Showing No Internet, but Browsing Works Fine.</h2>
                    <p>22 of 65 PCs are showing No Internet in NCSI, but the Internet is working fine on all 65 PCs</p>
<p>We are experiencing authentication problems (with the 22 PCs) with Office 365 and clicking on the INCS icon removed the "No Internet" warning and the authentication issue goes away (for a while).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfa5f184-841c-4ca1-bce9-d3b975ddde68?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfa5f184-841c-4ca1-bce9-d3b975ddde68?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done considerable research on the operation of NCSI - The URLs are available [<code><span>www.msftncsi.com</span></code><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;],
 [</span><span><span style="color: rgba(102, 51, 102, 1)"><a href="http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt</a>],
 [</span></span><code><span>dns.msftncsi.com</span></code><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;],
 [</span><code><span>131.107.255.255</span></code><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">.]&nbsp;</span>and
 the DNS resolves correctly, however I have not been able to test the availability using WinHTTP. I suspect that's where the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, this is what I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update NIC driver.</li><li>Revert NIC driver.</li><li>Change Buffering in the NIC.</li><li>Confirmed that the Firewall and AV are not the cause.</li><li>Ran Network Troubleshooter - No problem found.</li><li>Confirmed that Network Location Service was running and tried setting to Delayed Start.</li><li>Confirmed that Network Lists Service was running.</li><li>Added [dns.msftncsi.com] to the HOSTS file.</li><li>Disabled "EnableActiveProbing" in the registry - (This gave mixed results)</li></ul>
<p>There seems to be quite a bit of chatter on the web about this problem but no one seems to have a fix. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br /> 
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />Do you would try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />First, try to reboot your modem and then see if that works. 
<br />If not  try the following steps:
<br />
<br />1. Run the Network troubleshooter followed by networking commands  
<br />2. Update the network adapter driver  
<br />3. Roll back the network adapter driver  
<br />4. Temporarily turn off firewalls  
<br />3. Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software  
<br />5. Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart  
<br />6. Use network reset to reinstall network devices
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections Troubleshooter  
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter  
<br /> 
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/</a>...  
<br /> 
<br />Following is the content of the Help which you should try  
<br /> 
<br />I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Best Refards,
<br />
<br />Diego R.

<p><span style="color: rgba(32, 56, 100, 1)">I am using a Fortigate 100D UTM with 65 PCs connected. 22 of them have this issue. All the PCs are on the same Network / Domain so I find
 it hard to believe that there is a problem with the Router / UTM Firewall as all PCs would be showing the same NCSI error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(32, 56, 100, 1)">As for your remaining suggestions; I've done all of these things, multiple times on several different PCs and all returned the same results
 - NCSI thinks there is No Internet but clicking on the icon resolves the issue, albeit temporarily (several hours). Windows Troubleshooter does not find anything wrong with the Network Connection or Internet Connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(32, 56, 100, 1)">If there were issues with the Firewall, NIC, or AV the "No Internet" issue would remain regardless. Clicking on the NCSI icon initiates a
 probe of the Internet via WinHTTP and the results of that probe satisfies NCSI requirements and the status is changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(32, 56, 100, 1)">Do you have any information or perhaps a script to test NCSI using WinHTTP?</span></p>

<br />I apologize for answering a little late but I was out of the office.
<br />
<br />I will check if I found some scripts to make the test, I will let you know a son is possible.

<p>Hello Sizzling,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Are you trying to redeem a code for Xbox live or purchase with credit/debit card. If you are trying to redeem a code go to subscriptions on the Xbox and make sure the gold doesn't say suspended. If it does you will not be
 able to get more gold until it is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Привет! Не думаю, что это связано с санкциями. Попробю ввести код в вэб сторе или приложении. Это еще может связано, что код для активации для другого региона. Ты где его приобретал?

            Contact your vendor, tell them that your code does not work in your region, and order a new one.

<p>Дело не в консоли. Только если код невернвй или соединения нет и тд. Попробуй активировать код на сайте
