<h2>            Verificationcode &#40;going nuts here&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all i recently did a reset on one of my accounts since ididnt remember password. Talked to support and they said it usually takes 3-4 days. And today i receive not one code but two. says im supposed to use them on https:/sms.live.com to complete verification.
 On my android phone says site is down, and when i try from this account using explorer on xbox only says wrong password??? this is very confusing what should i do here?</p>

<p>Hiya Pig,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the account troubles. Let's see if we can get it working. <br />
<br />
To verify the password is setup properly, lets go and ahead and <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reset your Microsoft account password </a>once more.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once that is completed, try logging in once more. <br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting an e-mail from someone called Jess in Microsoft support. Telling me to give him information on my Xbox.id and such. This has allready been done the account is already PROVEN MINE. July first monday, i talked to a guy named Robin, yes phonesupport
 i 4 days later on the 5:th july recieved as i Said EARLIER 2 verificationcode, that DIDNT work. Talked to another guy yesterday on textsupport and he was ALSO cool with that it was my account, and he was going to send me a new verificationcode, wich didnt
 arrive yet in my mail. this latest person called Jess did obviously NOT check out that i allready got 2 codes apparently not. And im pretty sure microsoft dont just send verificationcodes that they are not 100% sure is to the owner of this other account, wich
 is allready proven is ME. Cheeeeees i cant really say i really really want an xbox one for this x-mas, get my account back to me, all im asking. /Nick</p>

<h2>            E3 MW3 trailer just ridiculous.</h2>
                    
<p>The trailer at the E3 expo for MW3 was poorly researched and poorly executed. &nbsp; I know it's just a video game but obviously they just have no idea of what they are depicting and it sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>For starters I was stationed on a Spruance Class Destroyer (Anti-Submarine Warfare) USS JOHN HANCOCK DD-981 many years ago. &nbsp;The clip they showed at E3 showed seals swimming around an enemy sub up close whilst it is pinging sonar plus they are traversing
 in it's wake with no propellor wash effect. &nbsp; After the sonar ping had busted their eardrums, caused major head trauma and basically turned their insides to jelly the Propellor wash would take care of the rest. &nbsp; Perhaps the old IW guys would have spotted
 that major flaw. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know, I k now it's a stupid game and nobody is supposed to care but it just shows you how lazy they are and don't even bother paying attention to details like how sonar is extremely hazardous and deadly at that range. &nbsp;. &nbsp;I won't even go into the seal
 swimming up into the propellor wash as that just made me face palm.</p>

<p>Well if your going to make a game depicting "MODERN WARFARE" with 'NAVY SEALS 'etc. &nbsp;You might want to actually have, I don't know "CONSULTANTS." &nbsp;At least make some attempt at credibility at least in the Single Player. &nbsp;Not all of us are clueless idiots.

[/quote]A. you're 2. supposed D. douche 24. i was pointing out that its a video game. they dont have to get things on the mark or realistic just because. i understand what he was saying that it should hold some things true, but in the end, its not a real life
 scenario and therefore doesn't have to be anywhere close to realistic. as long as the story is finished and is tied together well, ill be happy. 1,346,013. its already been confirmed about my level of douche-baggery from the old forums, so thank you for thanking
 me about my level of already confirmed douche-baggery <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" />

            Hi  YashLoya
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

            Hi Yash
<br />
<br />Please provide a bit more detail:
<br />
<br />What method did you use to upgrade to 1903 and what data is lost, is that all or just some of your files?
<br />
<br />If you just used the Windows Update feature or the Update assistant, or did you use the Windows 10 ISO or clean install Windows 10 version 1903 ...
<br />
<br />
<br />In the meantime, if all your files are gone, you may be logged into a temporary user profile:
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

            I recommend you try rolling back to your previous version. If the option to perform a rollback is not available, you likely performed a clean install.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

</blockquote>
<p>That's not where you're supposed to store your personal files ... even though&nbsp;<em>everyone</em> does it, including me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're supposed to store our personal files in our personal folders, i.e.:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\your user account name\Documents</p>
<p>C:\Users\your user account name\Music</p>
<p>C:\Users\your user account name\Pictures</p>
<p>C:\Users\your user account name\Videos</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop is for&nbsp;<em>shortcuts</em> to these files. That's how Windows was designed to be used, which is why Microsoft is careful to not touch those folders during an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(BTW - You&nbsp; have a personal desktop folder, too. It's at</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\your user account name\Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you see on your desktop is actually a combination of four different folders, one of which is above.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, despite what Microsoft intends, everyone stores files on their desktop anyway. And the truth is, 99% of the time it makes no difference. The 1% of the time where it
<em>does</em> make a difference is when your computer is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, in order to update your computer, system files and folders have to be erased or replaced. If you store files in a system folder, they could get erased by an update. I would explain how I discovered this, but the memory is still painful.&nbsp; ðŸ˜¥</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where you files&nbsp;<em>might</em> be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the Recycle Bin - unlikely, but it doesn't hurt to check</li><li>inside the windows.old folder - if you have one</li><li>search for your files by name and you might find them - also unlikely, but doesn't hurt to check</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If neither of those provide results, you might have success with file recovery software, like
Recuva, which is trustworthy, popular and free.</p>

            Find your XP Mode virtual machine, start it and then shut it down&nbsp;- not hibernate it.<br />
<br />
Then go to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Virtual Machines and right click on the XP mode VM, select Settings and change the allocation.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There might be an issue with the display settings of your device after an update. We would like to know if have you tried placing your device on
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After placing your device on safe mode and the issue persists,&nbsp; we recommend checking the display settings and change it if necessary. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right-click on your desktop</strong> and select <strong>Display settings</strong> on the context menu.</li><li>Select <strong>Advance display settings.</strong></li><li>Be sure the resolution is set at the recommended level. If not, change it to that one.</li><li>Reboot your device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, it most probably caused by faulty Graphics driver. We suggest uninstalling it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</li><li>On the run box, type <em><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></em> and click<strong> OK</strong>.</li><li><strong>Expand </strong>Display adapters category and <strong>right-click</strong> on the video device.<br />
Select Uninstall.</li><li>There might be a Confirm Device Uninstall window pop up. Click the box next to<strong> Delete the driver software for this device</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Reboot your PC and Windows will automatically reinstall the driver. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If anything comes up, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime. </p>

<p>Sounds to me like a display adapter driver problem.&nbsp; This is a known issue currently, rather widespread for devices using AMD graphics cards.&nbsp; It resulted from MS providing less than perfect driver updates for AMD Radeon
 display adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Do you have an AMD display adapter?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Determine what brand name graphics card aka (display adapter, video card, graphics processing unit) you have on your device... by&nbsp;<span>right</span><span>&nbsp;</span>clicking the Start menu&gt;Device Manager&gt;Display Adapter&gt;Expand it&gt;Properties&gt;all
 right clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>AMD is your brand name display adapter, you should update the driver by going to the manufacture's website&nbsp;<a href="https://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;
 selecting "Autodetect" then download what autodetect finds for you.&nbsp; This is the easiest way to do it&nbsp;<span><strong>if</strong></span>&nbsp;you have an AMD display adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a AMD Radeon Display Adapter on your device, then this wouldn't apply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display resolution problems were corrected immediately after updating the Display Adapter Driver from the AMD website found above using AutoDetect.&nbsp; Sleep mode was again found in the shut down options&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wayne, I've tried your suggestions, but still no change. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 HD series which hasn't had a driver update for about 4 years. When I check the properties for the display, it says that "no drivers are installed or are not needed". My active display driver is a generic Microsoft basic
 display driver which does not have the 1920x1080 resolution setting and so far I am unable to get to the AMD driver. Auto detect says components are installed, but I cannot bypass the Microsoft basic adapter - what's next?</p>

<p>DB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are going to have to wait for MS to issue a fix for the driver update they issued.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 and other drivers, are no longer receiving updates from AMD.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The generic driver that MS provides will have to be adjusted for proper functionality for users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This all means we have to wait for a fix...no doubt coming soon now that Thanksgiving is over.</p>

            Hi  Areeb, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers. As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.

<div>It seems you have enabled a virtual drive (CD Drive G:\, to be precise). Try disabling it and check.</div>

<div>Also, did you check that only when you insert a suitable card in the card reader the card reader shows up in Computer? And that once the card is removed, the drive disappears from Computer?</div>

<h2>            No Force feedback</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>

<p>I have just purchased a Saitek R440 force feedback steering wheel. The wheel is on the hardware compatiblilty list and has drivers for windows 7 64bit available. The problem is that I have no force feedback on this wheel. After the initial install of the
 drivers, which happens okay, I get the option to test the wheel. When I press the buttons I get the message that 'windows shell common dll has stopped working.' I have tried this wheel on two XP installs and also a on friends 32bit windows 7 install and it
 works fully on them. I am currently awaiting a reply from madcatz, which seem to be the support arm of saitek, but after three days have not heard anything yet.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone here will be able to help me and thanks in advance if you can.</p>

    <title>RPC Server Unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cj_01  say:</h3>
<h2>            RPC Server Unavailable</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a server running Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition x64.&nbsp; I can logon to the system but it isn't functioning properly.&nbsp; For instance, can't see or change properties of services, can't see or change properties of user accounts,&nbsp; can't install
 any .msi since the service cant be started, don't see any network connections (the adapter is recognized in device manager), can't start RPC service, can't copy any file or folder and paste.&nbsp; Despite all those can'ts it appears all revolves around the RPC
 service.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in event viewer&nbsp;Application logs&nbsp;there are many instances of Event ID 1500 with Account NETWORK SERVICE that occurs maybe every 20 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here is some history on what has happened to cause this error.&nbsp; NTPassword Recovery&nbsp;was used to reset the built-in administrator account.&nbsp; After that a blue screen occurred it was 0x24 and system would reboot each time it got to the Windows splash screen.&nbsp;
 To resolve this, a chkdsk was done using the install CD.&nbsp; So now I can logon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have tried to resolve the issues I'm seeing due to the RPC service not starting and I can't start it.</p>
<p>I've checked in the registry that the NetworkService account is there for the RPCSS.</p>
<p>I've ran sfc /scannow but problems mentioned still occur.</p>
<p>I've tried installed UPHClean but failed and I can't start the Windows Installer service.</p>
<p>I've booted into safe mode but still experience problems initially mentioned.</p>
<p>I've disabled all third party services through msconfig and booted up but still experience problems mentioned.</p>
<p>I've renamed an administrator profile then logged on again to create a new profile but still experience problems mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be gladly appreciated as I have been trying many suggestions I've read on forums.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

    <title>Audio Not Working After Windows 8.1 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smilie4895  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Not Working After Windows 8.1 Update</h2>
                    Ever since I updated my computer to Windows 8.1 I have had an issue with the audio. I use Internet Explorer as my primary web browser. Every time I go online and try to watch a video or listen to music, there is no sound. I have checked the volume and
 it is not muted. I have also try to configure the computer's speakers for playback, but it just says "failed to play test tone." I tried to play a song on iTunes, but a window pops up that states "iTunes has detected a problem with your audio configuration.
 Audio/Video playback may not operate properly." On youtube, it says "error with the video, try later."
<br />
I went to Device Manager. Every sound device is updated and says it is running properly.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do not know what is wrong. I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13.&nbsp; Thanks

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Be careful downloading drivers from the device or other computer manufacturers. Make sure it's the exact driver you need for your computer, if you are in fact missing a driver that is.</p>
<p>If yours worked before and now doesn't this fix may do the trick. It did for me.</p>

</p><p>I ran the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, and it unfortunately didn't solve the screen ghosting issue. I also went the UEFI screen and it also had the issue. Even after restarting the computer after exiting the UEFI screen, the screen image retention was still
 present. It's very faint, but I could still take a picture of it.</p>

<p>Hi v1nsai,</p>
<p>Most of the hibernation/sleep issues are caused due to incompatible/corrupted display drivers.<br />
<br />
So, I suggest you to download and install the latest updated display drivers from the manufacturer's website and check.<br />
<br />
Once you find the updated driver, follow the installation instructions on the website. Most drivers are self-installingâ€”after you download them, you usually just double-click the file to begin the installation, and then the driver installs itself on your computer.<br />
<br />
Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open <strong>Device Manager</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start </strong>button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under
<strong>System,</strong> clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;In the list of <strong>hardware categories</strong>, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;Click the<strong> Driver</strong> tab, click<strong> Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Refer the following link for more information:<br />

<p>I've followed steps 1 to 4, but when I click on 'Family and other users', no user accounts are listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on 'Your Info', it shows my account as being Administrator. &nbsp;So why do I still get the message 'You need to provide administrator permission to copy this folder'?</p>

<h2>            Skype technical support is useless</h2>
                    <p>Skype doesn't work, it messed with my computer in too many ways for me to get into here, and when I tried to fix it I was just given the runaround by everyone (Microsoft help told me to contact Skype, there was no way I could do so, and when I told Microsoft
 help that they gave the same URL that didn't work over and over).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I'm getting Skype emails all the time that make me think I'm getting targeted/hacked/compromised in a (theoretically) nonexistent account. And I can't give feedback, because there's still no way that I can find to give feedback to Skype. I can't
 communicate with them, and the website is a joke page full of circular links and zero search functionality. Literally the only thing I can figure out to do is to post this, because I have absolutely no other recourse. And this took about thirty minutes of
 endlessly clicking through the #$%@$ website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you send me emails that appear to require a response if I have no way to respond? What fresh hell is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have so many complaints about this product and its related services and user interactions that really the only palpable summary would be this question: Dear Skype, How Could You?</p>

            The email said that my supposedly non-existent account had its email updated to my Mom's email address (which is similar to my own). I assume this happened because I signed into Skype once on her computer eight years ago and now it manifests as malware
 on her computer. She can't uninstall it, can't sign out, and it keeps putting itself back on activate-on-startup even though I've removed it several times from the startup list using msconfig.

            Hi 
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />There is a specific Skype version for windows 7. To solve this I would recommend:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all that before but I did it again exactly like you told me.</p>
<p>The problem still persists.</p>
<p>The only way skype keeps my settings is when I don't log out.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You're right but this affects my privacy.</p>
<p>Anyone on my computer would log in on Skype using my saved ID and doesn't need to know the password!</p>
<p>Skype wasn't like that before.</p>
<p>I hope they make it save the settings for the same computer regardless of anything so Skype won't show my ID on startup and won't log in that easy!</p>
<p>I don't understand the logic behind that!</p>

<p>Skype has always saved the settings after the first installation.</p>

            I just want to go on record requesting this also. I use Skype on a work computer and cannot&nbsp;stay logged in. Very frustrating to go through this each time I sign in. Previous versions allowed settings to remain even when signing out.

            Not seem offensive, but only take as a critical point. I also find it extremely ridiculous to save application preferences by just saving your password. This makes it impossible for people to have their privacy just because the skype wants to save the
 settings only if they accept to save the password. #ReturnOldSkype #ReturnCommands #FixSoundSharing

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Windows Store Apps. This may fix the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try uninstalling and reinstalling Feedback Hub:
<br />- Click Start, and type Add or Remove Programs.
<br />- Click the result and it will open the Settings app.
<br />- Find Feedback Hub in the list, click it and click Uninstall.
<br />- Click the below link to install Feedback Hub from the Windows Store:

<br />
<br />If the above doesn't work, you may need to try the below system troubleshooting steps:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:

    <title>Wireless Adapter Not Found - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wireless Adapter Not Found</h2>
                    <p>I have a PC I built (I'm a novice for sure) and recently had to go from wired internet connection to WiFi. I bought a TP-Link T8E AC1750 wireless adapter and installed it in the PCIe slot, but it is not recognized in device manager. I wanted to try to see
 that if I ran the driver install it would change things, but it is giving me the error that the wireless adapter is not found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I moved the adapter to another PCIe slot and am still having &nbsp;the same problem (I've moved it to 3 different PCIe slots now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The light comes on for the adapter when my computer powers up, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I overlooking for it to not be recognized by my PC?</p>

 thanks for the quick reply!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I just found a YouTube video of a guy with the same problem. He pointed out that in the BIOS the PCIe slot was being disabled.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I went in and toggled the PCIe to be on "auto".&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I rebooted my computer and the device was recognized and I was able to install the driver.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>So I'm responding via WiFi as we speak!&nbsp;</span></span></p>
