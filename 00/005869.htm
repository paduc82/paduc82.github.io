<h2>            My saved e-mail draft disappeared -- Can it be recovered&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I was working on a draft in Outlook for two hours and saved it repeatedly during that time.&nbsp; After saving it for a final time, I closed the draft by navigating to my Inbox, and I briefly created another draft, which I also saved.<br />
<br />
I then tried to upload some images to SkyDrive.&nbsp; When I came back to retrieve the first draft to attach the Skydrive images, it was gone!<br />
<br />
This was a matter of maybe 10-20 minutes. (The second draft was there but not the first one.)<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I absolutely did not overwrite the draft or delete it, and I had successfully saved it numerous times.&nbsp; It just vanished after navigating to SkyDrive. (Even if it had been accidentally deleted it would be in the deleted folder, but it wasn't.)<br />
<br />
Just to be sure it didn't end up in a different folder I checked all the following:<br />
<br />
My drafts, sent, and deleted folders.&nbsp; I tried the "recover" option in the deleted folder even though I did not double delete anything.&nbsp; Nothing was recovered.&nbsp; I also checked adjacent folders in case it was accidentally dragged to the wrong folder.<br />
<br />
I searched my entire Outlook for the e-mail using the subject, recipient, and keywords, all without success.<br />
<br />
I've tried looking in my history, and cannot find the draft.<br />
<br />
This draft just disappeared without any explanation.&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating because I spent two hours working on the draft and then another two hours looking for it and trying to recover it.<br />
<br />
Can you please explain why this happens?&nbsp; Is this a known issue in Outlook because I see that others have had this same problem?&nbsp; Is there a way to recover my draft?<br />
<br />
I saved the draft yesterday morning -- on 7/7/13 -- and since that time I have not closed Outlook and have not cleared my history, cache, or temporary internet files, since I thought the draft could be recoverable from there.<br />
<br />
I have never had this happen before, and it seems like a "hiccup" in the system.&nbsp; I hope the draft is recoverable, and if so, I would greatly appreciate if you can help me recover it.<br />
<br />
At the time I was using Mozilla Firefox 21.0, and the draft was an e-mail reply.&nbsp; If you need me to provide the account, subject and recipient in a private message, I can do that.<br />
<br />
I have also checked using I.E. but no luck.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />

            <br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be blunt, but do you guys even read our posts or do you just have automated answers that you provide without regard for the information that we provided?&nbsp; It has happened numerous times where I give as much detailed information in my first post
 as possible, including all steps that have already been tried, so as not to waste time going back and forth.<br />
<br />
However, I often get answers from the moderators that tell me to do something that I already stated that I did (or cannot do).&nbsp; I hope you understand that this is frustrating for us (this is a common complaint amongst users in these forums).<br />
<br />
Not only is doing a search an obvious first step, I clearly stated in my message above that I already searched my entire Outlook.&nbsp; Please see above:<br />
<i><b><br />
"I searched my entire Outlook for the e-mail using the subject, recipient, and keywords, all without success."</b></i><br />
<br />
Yet, your answer was to suggest searching when I already said that I exhausted my search capabilities:<br />
<br />
I searched all of Outlook using the Recipient.<br />
I searched all of Outlook using the Subject.<br />
I searched all of Outlook using various different keywords in the body of the message.<br />
<br />
All without luck.<br />
<br />
I also did not attempt to move the file in any way.&nbsp; The steps were:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>I was writing the draft and successfully saved it numerous times during writing.</li><li>I successfully saved it as a draft at the end of writing.</li><li>I navigated away from the message by going back to my Inbox.</li><li>I did NOT get a warning message advising that I was navigating away from the page and about to throw away the message. (I get this warning if the draft hasn't been saved, so lack of the warning further confirmed it was saved.)<br />
</li><li>At that point it should have been in my Drafts folder.&nbsp; And at the very least, ONE of the saved versions should have been there since I saved it numerous times.<br />
</li><li>After closing it for the final time, I did not reopen or move the message. I did not even go to the Drafts folder.<br />
</li><li>I opened a "new" blank draft from the inbox, edited it and successfully saved it. (Note that I did not accidentally overwrite the first draft with the second.&nbsp; This would be impossible since I completely closed the first draft, went to my Inbox and opened
 a new blank draft by clicking on the "New" button.&nbsp; It was blank when I opened it and began editing.)<br />
</li><li>I navigated to SkyDrive to upload files.</li><li>I navigated back to Drafts to retrieve the first message to attach the SkyDrive files, and it was not in the Drafts folder.</li><li>I searched for it everywhere and cannot find it.&nbsp; It simply disappeared.</li><li>It was not visibly in my Drafts folder, my Inbox, my Sent folder, my Delete folder, or any adjacent subfolders.</li><li>It did not turn up in an extensive "Search".</li><li>This happened in the morning.&nbsp; I tried to review "History" at the end of the day with no luck.</li><li>This has never happened before.<br />
</li></ul>
How could this have happened and is there any way to retrieve my message?<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying to help.<br />
<br />
I have read that others' messages have disappeared without a trace as well.&nbsp; I realize that this could possibly be user error in some cases.&nbsp; However, I assure you that is not the case all the time, and certainly not this time. I was very careful to save my
 message several times, and I did NOT accidentally delete or overwrite the message.&nbsp; There was no way for me to even have done that with the steps that I took, and it wasn't in the Delete folder anyway.<br />
<br />
I hope the message is retrievable.&nbsp; If not, MS techs need to look into this Outlook glitch because it's not acceptable to have our messages simply vanish after hours of work.&nbsp; I have now wasted 1/2 a day on writing and trying to recover this message.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            Hi kmckeon,<br />
<br />
<font>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Forum. I'm glad to assist you with your issue that you cannot recover a saved draft on your account even if you have tried ti restore it. Please be informed that if you have tried the advance search and restore
 deleted emails to find the saved draft but still cannot see it, it is possible that it has been purged by the system.&nbsp;Also if the emails from drafts folder already been sent it will be removed there and will be saved on the sent folder.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</font>

            <p>Hi, Vivien_M,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please explain how a draft -- which has been confirmed as saved&nbsp;-- disappears WITHOUT&nbsp;going to the Deleted folder and without being recoverable to&nbsp;that folder using&nbsp;the activated recovery feature?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way I can avoid the disappearance of drafts in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi kmckeon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned by my colleague, Vivien_M.,&nbsp;an&nbsp;email that is saved&nbsp;in the Draft folder&nbsp;will be moved to the sent folder after it has been sent. There is a possibility that the email disappeared from that folder because it was already sent to its recipient.
 In that case,&nbsp;the email will&nbsp;not be recovered through the self-recovery feature since it was not moved&nbsp;to the Deleted folder.&nbsp;However, if the saved email has no recipient, it should stay in the Draft folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, we would like to verify if the issue happened when saving the draft on the web-based Outlook.com or via mail client as
emails will not be recovered via recovery link if they were deleted from email clients like Windows Live Mail, Microsoft Office Outlook, etc.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your prompt reply, RoseKatrina_H,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that a draft that was never sent should stay in the Drafts folder.&nbsp; But this one just disappeared without ever being sent and without appearing&nbsp;in Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Junk, or Deleted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nor&nbsp;does it restore to Deleted even though&nbsp;I have enabled that feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does it return on an advanced&nbsp;search by intended recipient or keyword.&nbsp; Nor does it show up when I check ALL my folders manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the question:&nbsp; how does a draft just disappear without going to some other folder first?&nbsp; I see from the Community that this is a frequent problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for any info that can help avoid this again in the future.</p>

            <p>Hi, Vivien_M,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for the quick response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that somebody hacked into my account and did nothing but delete a single draft of a personal letter.&nbsp; But I doubt it.&nbsp; And I've changed my password in any case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm actually in IT, and it is natural&nbsp;to assume&nbsp;the odd&nbsp;problem is user error or "a virus".&nbsp; Until the large number of complaints indicates that&nbsp;dependable users on virus-free systems are also having trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, though, how would my anti-virus software on my local computer, for example,&nbsp;purge a draft from the outlook.com servers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks as always for your help.</p>

<br />The Style referenced by the field must exist in the document. When you Copy/Paste are you preserving the styles from the source?
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.

<h2>            Dlookup data type mismatch</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm getting an error message (Data type mismatch in cirteria expression).&nbsp; I can't figure out what's wrong.&nbsp; Any help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim varX As Variant<br />
varX = DLookup("[Station]", "Main", "[Project] = " &amp; Forms!EntryForm!Project)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both 'Station' and 'Project' are text fields.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The original point of this bit of code is to: Once you enter a Project # of a form, a check is made against the main database to see if that # has been used before.&nbsp; If yes, then a message appears notifying you of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            That's the strange thing... tried stepping through code and it didn't error! If you clear breakpoints and run normally though it does occur. Tried compact and repair but it still comes up with permission denied error even though it all runs ok and does
 what it is meant to...

<p>HP MFP M175nw<span>&nbsp; </span>HP CP2025n printers do now work with Office 2013 in Windows 7 and 8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The problem was first reported in Feb 2013, still not fixed in June 2013.</p>
<p>The workaround is to use a non-HP printer driver to print to the physical device (sorry, the person who posted this fix did not specify which driver they used). You lose some built in functionality, but at least you can use Office 2013 with your printer.</p>
<p><span>Here is one possible fix that worked for other HP models</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; </span>"After lots of testing I have found a setting that has fixed all my HP CP5520 and HP M4555 printers that were crashing when printing from Office 365's 2013 pro plus.
</p>
<p>It's the driver setting in Device settings -&gt; Installable options -&gt; Printer Status notification, this needs to be disabled." &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>***********</p>
<p>Another fix that worked for one person is to turn off Notifications: go into settings within notification center) and disable it. So far (printing a document twice) it appears to work.</p>
<p>*********</p>
<p>When I use the HP Printer Driver specific to my CM1312MFP printer is when I get the errors. I to have tried using a non-HP driver (virtual) and never had the lock up.&nbsp;</p>

 and the only solution that I have found is to close out of the program.&nbsp; If I restart my computer, I can then print one file before it locks up again.&nbsp; This only happens with my HP Laserjet Printers.&nbsp; I have a HP Officejet 8600 printer that does not&nbsp;have any
 problems printing in Office 2013 Excel, Word or Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of my Laserjet printers will print anything on Internet Explorer or non Office based programs without any issues.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest drivers for these printers and looked for any latest
 updates to Office 2013 and made sure that I had the most recent.</i></p>
<p>I installed the printer driver Vista version for my HP Laserjet 1522 and that fixed the problem with the Spooling / Cache issue with Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy and HP via phone could not come up with this answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>

 even non-office apps like Adobe PDF) the job gets stuck spooling, never progresses or prints. I can only print again if I reboot my computer, and then only once if I print from an Office 2013 app.
<br />
<br />
I have confirmed this is an Office 2013 bug because I have Office 2010 still installed so the very same document will print on the same printer fine and I can print after that just fine. So once I try to print from any Office 2013 app, the print spooler hangs.</span></i></p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>After the problem occurred again even though I disabled Windows Defender, I have now confirmed it is the Printer driver (HP MFP printer). I determined this by setting up a "virtual" printer and was able to print to it consistently &nbsp; with no problem. Interestingly,
 that printer was one from the Windows 7 normal selections and probably older than the printer I am trying to print to. Unfortunately HP has not updated my printer's driver since 2009 and I doubt they will at this point. I still don't know what has changed
 in Office 2013 vs. 2010 that would cause a working printer driver to have this problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The only thing I can see to do is go to people and open a chat there.&nbsp; However, this doesn't allow you to see more than one chat at a time.&nbsp; It also doesn't allow you to keep it up front while perusing your emails either so that you can see if there was
 a response made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our chat box has been replaced with a undo button.&nbsp; What for?&nbsp; That isn't useful to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly wish they would go back to the old messenger box.&nbsp; You know.....where you didn't even have to sign into your email.&nbsp; That was quite handy.&nbsp; I liked that there was a little ping so you knew you had a message as well.</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;foxy girl and hamzamalik_807,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice to know that you have noticed some changes on the Outlook.com chat interface. There have been a few changes on the web messenger on Outlook.com, which you will find the messaging module on the left side pane under your folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Notes: </strong></span><span>There is&nbsp; no way to remove the Messaging Module from the left-hand nav.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, when "<strong>View all</strong>" is selected, it opens up&nbsp;Messaging from the right side of the Outlook.com landing page. You can then click the "chat icon/button" which is just beside the "Undo" button</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Tip: If you wish to chat 3 person at a time, you can access Outlook.com's other pages such as calendar.live.com, people.live.com, onedrive.live.com then open the messaging module and locate the contact in which you'd like to chat with. Then do the
 same on the other pages.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other questions regarding Outlook.com, please do not hesitate to use this forum so we, as well as the community, can help you resolve the issue for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hello. It is just not easy to use Windows Mail (Vista email client) with mobile devices. Only Outlook is supported by WMDC. You will need to buy this third party software:<br />
<a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/allproductsa-z/xtndconnectpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sybase.com/products/allproductsa-z/xtndconnectpc</a><br />
<br />
So, you might as well buy Outlook. If you absolutely must have a free solution, you can sync contacts and calendar over the internet with Google Mobile or use the new MyPhone service offered by Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            STUMPED&#33; How do I link a &#34;pop up&#34; subform record to a main form record&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Here's my situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main form is a datasheet with&nbsp; field&nbsp;"NAME" and &nbsp;"STATUS"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The STATUS field&nbsp;points to a&nbsp;combo box list. The combo box list has value "ENROLLED and "NOT ENROLLED".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user selects "NOT ENROLLED" from the combo box, the AfterUpdate event opens a subform "ADDRESS" .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subform "ADDRESS"&nbsp; shows&nbsp; the 2 columns, named QUESTION and ANSWER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RECNO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QUESTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANSWER</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STREET&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (user enters street info)</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CITY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (user enters city)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to LINK the address data to the USER NAME in my main form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: If the user selects the value "ENROLLED" for the status field in the main form, I have set up a DIFFERENT subform</p>
<p>to pop up with different data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So regardless of which subform pops up (based upon the user selected STATUS value), I want to link the pop up form DATA to the specific</p>
<p>main form record.</p>
<p>I'm STUMPED!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

            If I understand correctly I think what you want to do is not open the second form
 key of the first form's table?&nbsp; It seems to be the only candidate for this, and your previous reply suggested this was the case.&nbsp; If so then the code in the AfterUpdate event procedure of your combo box would be like this:<br />
<br />
Select Case Me.YourComboBox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "ENROLLED"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "YourSecondForm", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataMode:=acFormAdd, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowMode:=acDialog, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenArgs:=(Me.ID1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case " NOT ENROLLED"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' code to open another form goes here<br />
End Select<br />
<br />
In the Open event procedures of the second form you can set the DefaultValue property of its LineNo control to the TD1 value which was passed to the form, like so:<br />
<br />
If Not IsNull(Me.OpenArgs) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.LineNo.DefaultValue = """" &amp; Me.OpenArgs &amp; """"<br />
End If<br />
<br />
There must be a control bound to the LineNo field in the second form, but if you don't want it to show it in the form set its Visible property to False (No).&nbsp; Note that the DefaultValue property is always a string expression regardless of the data type of the
 field to which the control is bound, so should be wrapped in literal quotes characters as above.<br />

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Mea culpa!&nbsp; I missed a colon:<br />
<br />
Select Case Me.YourComboBox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "ENROLLED"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "YourSecondForm", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WhereCondition:= "LineNo = " &amp; (Me.ID1), _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowMode:=acDialog, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenArgs:=(Me.ID1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case " NOT ENROLLED"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' code to open another form goes here<br />
End Select<br />
<br />
You'll need to change YourComboBox and YourSecondForm to the control's and form's real names of course, and remember to wrap it in square brackets if the name includes spaces or other special characters, e.g. [Your Combo Box].<br />

    <title>if text overflows can it go to the next vertical cell same column, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fnoots  say:</h3>
<h2>            if text overflows can it go to the next vertical cell same column, without merging or adjusting the row heights &#38; column widths.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I would like to know if it is possible to write text into a cell,&nbsp;and if it overflows the word will go into the next vertical cell in the same column.</p>
<p>I have different size columns&nbsp; and a large spreadsheet which i have designed to fit on my page when i print it. I don't care how much it goes down vertically,&nbsp;as long as i keep&nbsp;the column widths horizontally and the same row height. I have been entering
 data or copy and pasting from other cells but need to go in manually and fix my text in the individual columns, as some are larger than others and the text over flows but if i merge, it will just make the cell row height increase. I just want it to cut off
 and go to the next line in the same column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know how to merge the text into a cell now, but because i didn't do this from the beginning it will look stupid to do it&nbsp;now, and I'm half way through this project and it will take to long to start over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I want to do, is go to the next cell in the&nbsp;same column&nbsp;when the word dosen't fit, but not adjust the cell row height.</p>
<p>Is this possible in excel 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards </p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Onedrive for Business installed on my computer but whenever I try to start it nothing is happening. Onedrive.exe does not appear in the Task Manager and also no icon appears in the notification area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onedrive version: 17.3.6998.0830</p>
<p>O365 version: 16.0.8201.2200</p>
<p>Windows version: Windows 7 Professional (Version 6.1 (Build 7601: Service Pack 1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched through several forums and tried several solutions like Onedrive.exe /reset, clear Onedrive cache, rerun OneDriveSetup.exe but nothing seems to help. I have also removed Onedrive from Programs and Features and installed again but nothing
 seems to be solving my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope somebody can help.</p>

                    <div>
<p>Unsure what to do anymore</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 1st Feb 2015 both my outlook accounts were hacked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the hacker is blackmailing me and wants $500 in order for me to get my accounts back. I have attempted recovery many times &amp; all rejected by robots claiming the information is not full, Have also tried *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to no avail. &nbsp;ALL the information
 I have provided outlook with is correct. I dont really send emails but managed to provide the last 3 addresses of emails I have sent. The hacker has enabled 2 step security so whenever I try manual recovery it tells me "&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Because y</strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><strong>ou've
 turned on two-step verification for your account, we ignore these requests but wanted to let you know.</strong>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have also opened 5 support tickets, last one told me to contact *** Email address is removed for privacy *** yet &nbsp;gain and then they try and direct you somewhere else. Its ridiculous.</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>Outlook dont care and they have asked me to create a new account and forget about this one. This hacker has all my personal details and data protection has been broken and they dont care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me ask you something, is it SO HARD to check and look back that my password and details were changed on 1st Feb 2015, from a NON UK IP address which is where my account was created and activity on my account has always been in the UK...and not
 just that...the hacker has even changed my alternative email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my account back and have documents proving my identity. Please do not ask me to fill another recovery attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

            <p>Hello &amp; welcome,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hackers are opportunists.</p>
<p>If they find a weakness in someone's security they will try to exploit it to see if it will be of benefit to them.</p>
<p>Bank Accounts, credit cards &amp; SS numbers etc are of great interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that as the password &amp; all security information has been changed, what
<strong>was</strong> your account is <strong>now</strong> the hackers to do with as they please.</p>

            Errata....&nbsp; I wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The YIELD function should take that into account.&nbsp; But I think it presumes that the maturity date is on the anniversary of a coupon payment.<br />
<br />
Consider the following details (please specify your own in a follow-up response):<br />
Settlement date: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nov 2, 2011<br />
Maturity data:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oct 5, 2021<br />
Annual rate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4%<br />
Price:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 872<br />
Redemption value:&nbsp; 1000<br />
<br />
=YIELD(DATE(2011,11,2), DATE(2021,10,5), 4%, 87.2, 100, 2, 0)<br />
<br />
results in about 5.7065%.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Just use YIELD.<br />
<br />
I wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I don't understand why that last term in the PRICE formula is a factor in the first place.
</blockquote>
<br />
It accounts for interest presumably accrued between the previous coupon period and the settlement date.&nbsp; This is the so-called "dirty price" model (<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/advancedbond/advancedbond2.asp#axzz1l66znhxh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click
 here</a>) [1].&nbsp; In other words, the bond is presumed to have been issued on or before 5 Oct 2011, a previous coupon anniversary date based on the maturity date.<br />
<br />
I wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Using IRR, I get about 5.6548%.</blockquote>
<br />
Of course, my IRR model is flawed because I do not have equally-spaced cash flows.&nbsp; The first cash flow is 2 Nov 2011, the second cash flow is 5 Apr 2012, and all subsequent cash flows are 6 months apart.<br />
<br />
When I use XIRR as I should have, accounting somewhat for the different models, I do get very close to the same result as YIELD.&nbsp; But that is really coincidence since XIRR and YIELD use different discounting models.<br />
<br />
I wrote:<br />
<blockquote>you could dispense with using YIELD and use IRR instead</blockquote>
<br />
Wrong!&nbsp; Arguably, we would use NPV and IRR instead of PRICE and YIELD when we want the "clean price" model.&nbsp; But only when the maturity date is an anniversary of the settlement date, and both align with coupon payment dates.&nbsp; However, in that case, PRICE and
 YIELD should produce the same results.<br />
<br />

            Hello. This isn't really a Mac forum but I think this may help:<br />
<a href="http://www.simplehelp.net/2008/08/29/how-to-sync-your-windows-mobile-device-with-your-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.simplehelp.net/2008/08/29/how-to-sync-your-windows-mobile-device-with-your-mac/</a><br />
<br />
Only thing I don't know is if OSX is different from Snow Leopard, which you may be using on the Macbook. I guess you will find out if it doesn't install. Step 24 shows how to transfer files. I guess you don't have to set up the contact/calendar sync.

<p>The macro (as written) would NOT distort the image and so only set the width to 6.17. If you need to set the height then there will be distortion if the images have different aspect ratios. If this is what you need adapt the code by inserting before the
 two lines that set the height and width and after with oshp</p>

<strong>.LockAspectRatio = False</strong><br />
.Height = 72 * 4.63<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few factors that could cause the colorless printing of your PowerPoint slides like a correction with the color settings from the Print preview, or a malfunctioning driver. We'd like to know more information so we could provide an accurate resolution.
 Kindly answer the following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you performed a test print?</li><li>Have you tried printing using other Office apps and still encounter the same issue when printing it with color?</li><li>Are you encountering this issue on a specific PowerPoint file? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

            <p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>

            <p>First, note that there is no such thing as a "Trojan virus." It's either a trojan *or* a virus. Trojans and viruses are two different kinds of malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So assuming you have a trojan, what trojan is it (what is its name?)? How do you know you have it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What anti-virus program do you run? And what other anti-malware software? Have you tried to remove it using these?</p>

<p>Hey there thanks again, there seems to be an Accelerometer / sensors but no apps or settings for it. I managed to install Python on it and run a couple of scripts and they run well with the input for the accelerometer. I will be writing a maze game soon
 with this. It would be nice if nokia included the settings or apps by default.:smileyindifferent:</p>

            Hi, i tried already multiple computers running Windows 10 multiple browsers<br />
<br />
But it seems more likely to me now it's not possible to request time off or vacation on Windows 10?<br />
<br />
Or should it possible?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to use the browser on Win10 to request time off. <span>
&nbsp;</span>If you can’t do that, do you get any error message?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anyone can help. Recently installed the Ceptah Bridge for Jira and MS project as I have recently been given a new desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seemed to have worked, however, I was not given the option to enter my license key.</p>

</p><p>Once I go into project and select the project settings and go to sync these I come up an error message (see below). I am not sure why and what this means?
