    <title>OOPS&#33; Typo in Microsoft Account Email Address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bubbabartz09  say:</h3>
<h2>            OOPS&#33;  Typo in Microsoft Account Email Address</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on my home PC a while back. &nbsp;I've been using local accounts on my PC ever since I upgraded, and that has worked fine for me. &nbsp;Yesterday, I looked into the idea of configuring the native parental controls on Windows 10. &nbsp;I was told
 that to do that I needed to log in using a Microsoft account, create accounts in my "family" for my kids, and then set those accounts up -- limits on screen time, web filtering, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering why I was having problems logging in with my Windows account. &nbsp;I kept getting an "incorrect password" error message. &nbsp;THEN, I noticed that when I'd upgraded to Windows 10 I'd inadvertently included an extra "n" in my email address. D'oh!
 &nbsp;My question now is: &nbsp;What do I do to fix that? &nbsp;I deleted the Microsoft account listed within "Manage Users" as it was incorrect - "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" instead of "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***". &nbsp;Is there a way to connect my actual Microsoft account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 to the Windows 10 installed on my PC so that myself and my kids can log in that way -- and take advantage of the parental controls -- rather than using the local accounts? &nbsp;Or am I stuck? &nbsp;Or do I need to do a complete re-install of Windows 10 to fix my boneheaded
 typo error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help!</p>

<p>Thank you Phillip Pio!!! I was&nbsp;<em>finally</em> able to get my friends issue on my friends phone resolved. Well partially... from the link, at the bottom of the page, I was a able to change the misspelled email she was signed in under. It said it may take
 up to 48 hours until fully synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will definitely update this comment if it ends up not fully fixing my issue; misspelled email listed for Microsoft Account/not able to download new apps due to sign in/verify issues.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 mail app not showing notification all the time.</h2>
                    <p>I have everything setup properly because sometimes I get the mail notification and other times I dont.</p>
<p>The mail app is set to run in the background</p>
<p>The mail app is setup to make a sound and display the banner</p>
<p>I tried running a couple of powershell commands as suggested by another MS post.</p>
<p>Created a new profile and the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine with Windows Live 2012 why cant you support it anymore.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'm waiting for important emails and it's annoying to to check every couple of minutes is the email has arrived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: It's ok. I reverted back to Windows 8.1 and I'm using another application for my emails.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t play mp4 files when i change playback device on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.garcia101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t play mp4 files when i change playback device on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom built desktop machine. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro x64 from Windows 8.1 Pro x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was working fine after upgrade and programs translated well also. This machine is a workstation for video and audio production. Specs are as follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MOBO</strong>: Asus x99 Deluxe /U.31 (latest bios 1801)</p>
<p><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel i7 5960x</p>
<p><strong>RAM</strong>: Corsrair Dominator Platinum DDR4 32Gb Kit (4x8Gb) 2400MHz (CMD32GX3M4A2400C10)</p>
<p><strong>HDD #1</strong>: Samsung 850 Pro 256Gb SSD (OS)</p>
<p><strong>HDD #2</strong>: Samsung 850 Evo 500Gb SSD (Storage)</p>
<p><strong>PSU</strong>: Corsair AX860i 80 Plus Platinum</p>
<p><strong>GPU</strong>: EVGA NVidia Titan X &nbsp;Superclocked 12Gb DDR5</p>
<p><strong>CPU Cooling</strong>: NZTX Kraken x61 AIO</p>
<p><strong>Case:</strong> Corsair 780t</p>
<p><strong>OS</strong>: WIndows 10 Pro x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Presonus AudioBox 22VSL audio interface connected, which I have set as default to process my system audio. I use Adobe Master Collection CS6 and the Presonus device is my default for it as well. Occasionally, to test sound translation from
 my work, I switch the playback device (under windows settings) to the motherboard's built-in sound device, which is hooked up to cheap 2.1 PC speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be able and switch back and forth from playback devices to test different speaker settings. MP4 files and online streaming video would play just fine back and forth between playback devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately, I find that I can mix and render my files (h.264 mp4 for example) and play them back with my Presonus device just fine. But if I switch the playback device to the built-in motherboard sound device (realtek HD) to test on the cheap speakers, then
 the same mp4 file will no longer play with any software player I use (windows media player for example). Oddly, while still under the motherboard built-in sound device, I can still playback online streaming media content (video and audio from YouTube, vimeo,
 msn.com, etc.). </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I switch right back to the Presonus device, the mp4 will play fine again with any player software. Online streaming works fine on either device. It's just the encoded files that seem to be the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem seems to be either driver or codec related. I have not tried to uninstall or repair install anything to avoid making my system unstable or worse, I work on it too much day to day to afford losing precious time risking it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

    <title>system shutdown during sleep, and taskbar missing after screen saver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apavl  say:</h3>
<h2>            system shutdown during sleep, and taskbar missing after screen saver </h2>
                    I'm having two specific issues with Windows 7: first, when the computer comes back from sleep, I find that the system has shut down. Starting Windows normally works fine - I don't need safe mode - but I've lost all my open programs, etc.<br />
<br />
Second, my screen saver appears to 'erase' my taskbar - when I bring my desktop back from the screen saver, the start button is present, but taskbar is missing. If I turn the screen saver back on and then remove it, the taskbar reappears. Any ideas about this

<p>Hi <strong>Apavl,</strong></p>
<p>You may try the steps below and check if the issue gets fixed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You need to disable hybrid sleep on your system and then check for the issue.</p>
<p>To <strong>"Disable Hybrid Sleep Mode"</strong> follow the steps given below.</p>
<p>Step one, open up the power options setting from the control panel and select the "Change plan settings" link below the selected power plan.</p>
<p>Once in the resulting dialog, choose "Change advanced power settings".&nbsp; Now you need to scroll through the miles and miles of options to find the "Sleep" node.&nbsp; Expand this, and then the "Allow hybrid sleep" node below it.&nbsp; You should see two options, "On
 battery" and "Plugged in".&nbsp; Set both of these to "Off".</p>
<p>Once this is done, click "OK" and you should be all set!&nbsp; From now on, whenever your laptop would normally go into "Sleep" - usually when the lid is closed or when inactive for a certain time - it will enter full sleep mode, rather than hybrid sleep.&nbsp; And
 when you go to awaken it from its slumbers, it should be fully responsive within a second or two of reactivation - as opposed to the 10-15 seconds after hybrid sleep.</p>
<p>If the issue still persists then i recommend you to update the graphic drivers and see if it makes any difference. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the Display adapter, and then double-click the device name.<br />
3.&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now try to follow the below provided link to Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly and check for the issue.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
You need to contact your computer manufacturer to get the latest drivers.</p>
<p><strong>If taskbar is missing after screen saver</strong> I would suggest you to
<strong>turn off auto-hide option</strong> and check.<br />
<br />
1. Open Taskbar and Start Menu Properties by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, and then clicking Taskbar and Start Menu.
<br />
2. On the Taskbar tab, under Taskbar appearance, clear the Auto-hide the taskbar check box, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
Check out the link which talks about the same.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-or-hide-the-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Show-or-hide-the-taskbar</a>
<br />
<br />
Also perform a <strong>System File Checker</strong> [SFC] scan on the computer<br />
Steps to perform SFC scan:<br />
1. Click the Start button<br />
2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories<br />
3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option<br />
4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option<br />
5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.<br />
6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter<br />
7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'<br />
8. Be patient because the scan may take some time<br />
9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue<br />
10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"<br />
11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.<br />
<br />
Check out the KB article which talks about SFC scan.<br />

            Hi Rayna,
<br />
<br />Well, it depends on the website you are streaming from, if it is from a mainstream streaming website, you will be fine . . .
<br />
<br />If you have either the built-in protection in Windows turned on or have some other 3rd party Security Software installed, you should be fine . . .

<p>These are marketing promotions designed entice people to purchase the console. You purchased the console. You're not the targeted audience. I cannot speak for Microsoft's intentions, but assuming they're a business, they're in the game to make money. (Ha....
 Game.... Haha... Money, I crack myself up).</p>
<p>In all honesty, you're complaining about not getting free perks and loot that you feel you're entitled to, when in all truth of the matter, you're not. You pay money for a service. You receive that service albeit sometimes with some problems, but you receive
 it nonetheless. You got what you had paid for, no point in being greedy and demanding more.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of marketing. &nbsp;Are you a noob? &nbsp;No matter what big purchase you make in life, there is always a chance that a week later it will be on sale, or be at a better sale price that you bought it at. &nbsp;This is just how life is. &nbsp;The best thing

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Please try the below steps to see if the clipboard issue persists:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:

<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:

<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>

<br />
<br />If the problem isn't happening in Safe Mode, that tells me it's a background task or service or third-party app causing the issue. Please let me know how you go and I'll advise from there. Thanks!

<p>Win 7 U-32</p>
<p><br />
Under 'Disk&nbsp;drives' in Device Manager,&nbsp;there are&nbsp;several drives. By selecting a drive and clicking on Properties, we see several Tabs (General, Policies, Volume, Driver, Details)<br />
<br />
These tabs show for all the drives in the system, with one exception.</p>
<p>The 'Policies' tab does not show up when I select&nbsp;one particular drive (Freecom Mobile Drive XXS USB Device). All other drives are fine.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get the Policies tab to show?</p>
<p>Also this particular drive doesn't show in the 'Devices and Printers' list, All other drives show correctly.</p>
<p>In Windows Explorer, this drive operates normally.</p>
<p>So .. Why wouldn't the 'Policies' tab show for a brand-new 500GB hard disk?</p>

<h2>            Help I barely move my fingers across the touchpad and it goes from 25&#37; to 150&#37; and back</h2>
                    <p>My new laptop came with windows 10. My p;d laptop kept changing my screen from 25% to 200 and back and forth no matter what i did. Fast forward to this new windows 10 laptop and it is worse on this one. I barely move my finger on the touchpad and it changes
 size. Help</p>
<p>It also opens up things while i am barely moving across the touchpad. I need it to chill a bit and not be so sensitive. Changing the delay doesn't help</p>

<h3> autumn20  say:</h3>
<h2>            I seem to have 2 user signin accounts</h2>
                    <p>When I started my computer, it said the password was wrong and I hadn't even entered a password yet, nor had I clicked on anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I noticed there looked like 2 of my names as options for signing in. One was my full name, the other was my email address. When I restarted my computer before this, there was only one sign in name. Why do I see 2 sign in names? Could it have to do with
 using Macrium Reflect which asked for a computer password? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I see a list of all users on this computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I sign in to my PC without having to use a password? How? </p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are not sure as to what are the user accounts you are referring to. Are any of those a Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>Is it an abrupt issue? Also, did you make any changes to Windows prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><li>At this point, if you are unable to access to Windows desktop, I suggest you to perform a System Restore.

<strong>Shift </strong>key down while you select <strong>Power </strong>&gt; <strong>

            <p>When I start the computer, the first thing I see is a picture of myself (which I had added) and the sign in screen. It's that screen that shows 2 user accounts. I assume they are Microsoft accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue isn't abrupt. Yes, I changed Windows settings prior to the issue. It's a brand new upgrade to WIN 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had disabled the settings in my account so that I would not need to sign in every time my computer starts. Maybe I had chosen the setting to use a "local account" (under Settings &gt; Accounts).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find more info about "local account"? I went to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows help</a> and searched, but get a screen that says I'm not able to sign in to see your help pages:
<em>"Something went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later."</em> Why do I need to sign in to get help??</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't answer my other questions: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Where can I see a list of all users on this computer?</p>
<p>2) Can I sign in to my PC without having to use a password? If so,</p>
<p>3) How?</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I click OK, I then see 2 account names (both are mine) listed in the lower left corner. If I click the one showing my my name and email address, I can enter my passport and sign in. Then Windows 10 starts.

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the&nbsp;delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it show the email address for both the accounts on the log in screen?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your reply misses the point - we DON'T WANT two accounts! We have Microsoft account and password, why does it use the other account and say the password is wrong before we even try it?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we delete this second account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All your replies lead us to ADDING accounts (eg Family members), not DELETING them!</p>

<h2>            Critical Error&#58; Start Menu not working.</h2>
                    <p>My start menu and Cortana stop working randomly. If it happens on startup I get an error, if it happens later on... Well then I get no warning. From a forum post that was closed, Jen a microsoft employee asked some questions. I figured I'd answer them all
 and see if it helps in the slightest.&nbsp;</p>

            Does "instead a file opens" mean that the "Save as" dialog box opens or does it mean something else?<br />
<br />
When do you get "Adobe 9&nbsp;says incompatible" -- and please provide the complete error message without paraphrasing.<br />
<br />
Do you have other pdf files saved on your computer (that you used to be able to open)?&nbsp; If so, what happens when you try to open and print them using Adobe Reader 9.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, when someone sends you a fax via EFAX, the fax gets converted to a pdf file and EFAX emails it to you.&nbsp; Is that correct?<br />
<br />
Have you tried saving the attachment to your Desktop (or other easily findable location) and then opening and printing the file?&nbsp; What happens?<br />
<br />
What email application are you using, including version?<br />
<br />
