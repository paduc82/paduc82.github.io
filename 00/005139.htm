<h2>            How to file a complaint on incompetent support desk</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know, how I can complain on the chat support desk. The person I was in touch with was very unhelpful, willing me to call the support number in the country, where I am currently located. Even though I explained well that I do not speak well
 the local language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I insisted, she provided suggestions, that were not helpful at all, saying that what I want (even though stated very clearly in the service conditions of MS Office 365 as possible) is not possible and that either i will have to purchase additional language
 pack or I have to accept to change my MS office interface language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some more hours of self-exploration I manage to fix the problem myself. However, I would like to complaint on this person since I believe, she had no clue on the problem and in addition just wanted to close quickly her task and not really help the
 client. One of the reasons for me to purchase the MS 365 Office licence was the provided support, whenever I am in the world. And I must say that I was deeply disappointed about this interaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would sincerely appreciate your advice on this issue, since I believe it is highly relevant to improve the quality of services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>M.</p>

            <p>Yes it is relevant to report bad customer service. In 5 years on this forum have not seen any mechanism for registering this sort of complaint that is effective. (Obviously reporting here has not helped ...)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the steady stream of similar complaints it is obvious that the MS Support managers are content with the level of customer service provided by their employees &lt;sigh&gt;.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry.</p>

<h2>            Window size on opening Word on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Word 2016 on a Macbook Air. When the app opens the pane is minimized, forcing me to drag the edge to resize it to full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I resize, save, close, and re-open it will retain the size of the pane, but having to resize every single new document is a nuisance. Is there a setting I can tweak?</p>

            <p>Hi Jac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this...</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all open Word documents and then quit Word and Outlook completely.</li><li>Open the Activity Monitor.app program, which is located in Applications/Utilities</li><li>Type "Microsoft" into the search box and verify that there aren't any running copies of Microsoft Word or Microsoft Outlook open. If there are, select the application so that it highlights and then use the X button to Force it to Quit.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7902def2-31f2-4f41-900a-71cde6b7cec0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7902def2-31f2-4f41-900a-71cde6b7cec0" /></a></li><li>Quit the Activity Monitor application and open Microsoft Word. A new blank document should be displayed.</li><li>Adjust the window of the new blank document to the size you want.</li><li>Save this blank document. It will probably have the name of Document1 and that is fine, you can delete it later.</li><li>Quit Word completely and reopen 
<p>Let us know if this works because if not that points to a problem in Word's preference profile and we'll probably have to help you reestablish them.</p>

            <p>Assuming that you do mean that you want to use <strong>Full Screen View</strong>, the fastest &amp; easiest solution is to use the built-in keyboard shortcut
<strong>Control+Command+F </strong>when you want to send a document window to or restore from Full Screen. There's also the Full Screen [rightmost] stoplight button at the left end of the title bar if you prefer to use a click method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OTOH, if you're looking to have new documents open at a specific custom window size &amp;/or position on screen you'll need to use code to do so. As many times as this has been covered over the years I would think most of the regulars here would know that a
 template solution won't work [e.g., <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac/how-do-i-get-word-2011-to-remember-its-window/8759643c-9727-443f-8d4a-ab9698bd3475">
How do I get Word 2011 to remember its window assignment? </a>]. Regardless of experience, though,
<em>testing</em> the proposed 'solution' also would have revealed that to be the case. A template will honor the Zoom percentage at which it was saved but cannot control those other parameters unless it has the necessary code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A number of macros have been published relevant to specific releases of the program. Unfortunately, VBA support has changed a bit with each release, so what works for one version won't work for another. I haven't seen a macro published for this purpose for
 Word 2016 and am not able to supply it.</p>

            Hi Steve3NJ
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Both of you should do following -
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete old Windows Store app shortcut in build 10158</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to insider preview build 10158 and noticed a shortcut on the start menu which shows
<em><strong>@{winstore_1.0.0.0_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewyms-resource--winstore-resources-TileDisplayName}</strong></em>.</p>
<p>That, I think, is the shortcut for the old version of windows store from either the previous build or windows 8.1 (circled in red)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caf6e8d9-b279-407a-9182-9c84c7218fa9" /></p>
<p>I tried looking in the app shortcuts folder and can only find the shortcut for the new one. Any ideas how to remove it?</p>
<p>Tried right clicking and everything I could think of</p>

<p>
</p><p>Instructions: </p>
<p>Boot into command prompt, copy AppData\Local\TileDataLayer\Database\vedatamodel.edb to c:\temp
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also take a extra backup copy of it, just in case something does go wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is locked you need to create another admin user and use it to perform the copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once copied, boot to windows and run the app. It should print one line if it locates the store entry and deletes it. If it prints nothing, or more than one line, then do not continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything went fine, boot back to command prompt and copy c:\temp\vedatamodel.edb back to AppData\Local\TIleDataLayer\Database</p>

<h2>            How to get rid of black bar at the bottom of games&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I am having Microsoft Lumia 535 and I noticed that there is a black bar at the bottom of the screen while playing games. It is in the place of Navigation bar and while playing games if I swipe from the bottom navigation bar hides but a black bar is seen
 still in the game. While in other apps it does not happen and occupies full screen. This black bar prevents the game from occupying the full screen and I can not enjoy my gaming experience. And now I upgraded to windows 10 OFFICIAL VERSION and all games like
 jet pack joy ride does not fit to screen and a portion of game's screen is hidden behind that black bar. Any help would be appreciated please

            <p>Hi Mizo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the phone a few times and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check for&nbsp;Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, then try to&nbsp;reset the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting your Windows phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and the phone will be restored to its factory settings.&nbsp;If you decide to reset your phone, you can back
 up apps, text messages, and more in the cloud beforehand. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

            Hi, thanks for answering my question. I did&nbsp; restart several times and nothing had changed plus I did reset my phone before I used it after I upgraded to windows 10 and nothing has changed. I keep checking for updates but nothing comes for me to update.
 Thanks.

<h2>            Word Mac 2011 English Suddenly Changed to Korean and Block Characters</h2>
                    I am reviewing a Word for Mac 2011 document in English. &nbsp;When typing a comment, the entire document suddenly changed to numbers, blocks, and Korean characters. &nbsp;I have opened a few other documents which appear to be unchanged. &nbsp;I have checked all language
 settings and font settings for the document I am reviewing but cannot get it back to English.

</p><p>Some badly-configured email systems see the .docx format as a "Zip" file (which it is...) and helpfully try to un-zip it. &nbsp;After that: it's cactus, Word can't read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell the student to email you a copy they have zipped, and see if that makes any difference. &nbsp;The email program will then mutilate the outer layer, not the document itself.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple notifications are not possible and would be annoying.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Having missed/ ignored the initial alert, you are alerted (how many times?) that there is this non acknowledged item (for each class if missed items ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If then another say call so potentially 2 missed alerts, how would you distinguish that the alert you requested is for the first and now 2nd missed call.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I HAD HOPED THAT THE ABOVE WAS CLEAR,</strong> audible setting (you want silence if that is the setting or ring regardless!) or not that is how ALL phones alert, some like Blackberry provide a flashing notification light, and that's it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is full of responses my phone did this</p>
<p>you had the explanation before the answer the answer is NO!</p>

<h2>            A Sneak Peak at Windows 10 Insider Build 10125</h2>
                    <p>I had a look at the build 10125 today it seems really nice feeling much more polished and stable (on a clean install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be some issues with the display adapter and start screen however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall it seems to be much more customizable in particular the Quick Access and the ability to relocate OneDrive making a SSD Boot Drive and HDD configuration much easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Theres also a hint of the differences between Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Home in this build. I'm guessing the domain login will not be available in the Home Edition effectively forcing Home users to use a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This build seems really nice (on a clean install) and I have wrote in quite a bit detail about the installation and changes I like and dislike here:</p>

            &nbsp;I had to look up that&nbsp;<em>Gordon Bennett </em>comment, it's not an expression you hear in the USA.&nbsp; I'm not predicting two builds, although we did have that happen a few weeks ago if I remember.&nbsp; Since the great majority of predictions about builds are
 wrong, I usually abstain from the practice, but Tuesdays at 10:00 PDT seem do seem to be a likely time.&nbsp; We'll see in about 36 minutes.&nbsp;

<p>Edge is slower for me; but, my biggest problem is with drop-down menus. I have to (mostly) use enter to select an item. Click does not work. Even here in the forum takes several clicks or even enter.&nbsp; Doing my Internet banking is slow and sometimes will
 not work, but like 3rd party AV's the banks software might not like the new Edge builds...?</p>

    <title>Outlook Macro to delete junk email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djw49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Macro to delete junk email</h2>
                    <p>HELP … !!&nbsp; I have recently been swamped with junk emails that have a common characteristic.&nbsp; In the body of the Email, there are 2 URLs (and usually only 2 URLs - nothing else), that are links to OW.LY or OW.LI.&nbsp; For example, something like … &lt;http://ow.ly/abcdefg&gt;
 and on the next line &lt;http://ow.ly/123456&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting 20 or 30 of these a day.&nbsp; I used to be a programmer, but an not familiar with Visual Basic, so am completely at sea when it comes to developing an Outlook Macro that would be able to identify Emails with the ow.ly (or ow.li) URL in the body
 of an Email and automatically delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something available out there that I could use as an example that I could build on to accomplish this?&nbsp; It is frustrating to have to deal with all this junk every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help...……………………..Dave</p>

<h3> anicholson29  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t activate</h2>
                    I have been using Outlook for ages. In the last 2 days though, my mail won't update in Outlook. On the bottom right corner it says "Read Only - Offline". So I try to activate the Outlook by going to the Outlook option - Activate. I go through the onscreen
 prompts to sign into my account and activate with my password - and it says all done, or finished! Green tick! But it makes no difference - the Outlook hasn't activated and my email won't update. I have tried many other things - taken my yahoo account off
 and back on again. I have even uninstalled all of microsoft office and then reinstalled. And I have checked, my subscription is all up to date and everything fine there. Please help, what can I do??

                    <p>With Office for Mac 2011 (OS X 10.9.4), whenever I use File &gt; Save As... the folder that opens is always Documents, never the one where the original file I opened was. I don't remember exactly when this started but it may have been when I upgraded to 10.9
 (from 10.8.5).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw this discussed in another thread but the only answer was to purchase and install Default Folder&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macexcel/office-2011-with-mavericks-remembering-last-folder/8d0122e7-6c7b-4b6f-a43c-8b1a80638e5d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macexcel/office-2011-with-mavericks-remembering-last-folder/8d0122e7-6c7b-4b6f-a43c-8b1a80638e5d</a>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your thoughtful reply--I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I saw your message though (somehow I wasn't notified), I thought I should see if the problem still existed when I booted from a Guest account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't, so after thinking it over a little, I decided to try resetting the PRAM, which worked.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, resetting the PRAM worked for a while--or, as you say, it could have been just restarting that did it--but eventually the problem came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finally found a workaround though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Word attempts to save the file in Documents, I navigate to a higher level, then click Cancel. When I try to save again, the proper folder (the one where the original file was) is selected.</p>

<h2>            Difficulty sending PDFs to Mac users from certain pc</h2>
                    I have a windows 10 system with outlook. When I send PDFs to mac users the recipients are unable to open them. I have no problem opening them on other PCs. I have even gone so far as to reinstall widows twice but it still. Meanwhile if I send the email
 to another computer and forward the email, without even looking at the PDF, the mac users are able to view them. Any thoughts would be helpful&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Legal-Animal,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About this problem, please try the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Send the PDF files by using <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> on your affected computer and check the result.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Since the Mac users can view the PDF from other account’s forwarding email, please let another directly send an email with PDF file to the Mac users and confirm whether they can open it.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Please try forwarding an email with PDF file to the Mac users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, please provide us with the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The detailed version of the Outlook for Mac and the Outlook for Windows client.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To check the Outlook for Mac client version, you can find it by navigating to the menu bar of Outlook for Mac -&gt; About Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To check the Outlook for Windows client version, you can find it by navigating to File -&gt; Office Account -&gt; Office Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Regarding ‘the recipients are unable to open them,’ could you provide a screenshot about this behavior for us?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you and the Mac users all Office 365 for business users?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Barry</span></p>

<p>There are two ways you could do this.<br />
<br />
1. Resequence your data source so that record 1 and 2 are swapped, 3 and 4 are swapped, and so on How you could do that depends on the data source (is it Excel? A Word document? Or what?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Change the table direction. This may be easy, if you already use a language with a right-to-left script, but if not, it is more difficult. See below...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a label merge, Word creates a table that typically has one cell for each label.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click, and click Table Properties...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Near the bottom of the Table tab in the dialog, if there is an option call "Table direction", select Right-to-left. If there is not, please see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, lay out your fields etc. in the top right-hand cell, then use Update Labels to copy your layout to the other cells. There should be a { NEXT } (&lt;&lt;Next record&gt;&gt;) field at the top of each label cell except the cell at the top right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot check now, but that right-to-left option may not appear unless you have enabled an Editing Language in Word that uses a right-to-left script (Arabic/Hebrew/Persian/Urdu etc.) . Be aware that adding such a language adds quite a few options to your
 menu/ribbon, and may have other effects on your documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add an Editing Language in Word 2007 I would</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. close Word</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. try to save a backup copy of my normal.dotm template, because Office may replace your existing one. Its location may vary from system to system, but mine is in</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</p>
<p>
</p><p>where &lt;username&gt; is my Windows user name. So if it is pjj, the file would be in</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\pjj\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;c. in Windows, find the Microsoft Office 2007 Language Settings program (the option is not built into Word in the 2007 version) and start it. How to do that will also vary depending on your version of Windows, but in my case in the WIndows Start menu I
 found it in All Programs-&gt;Microsoft Office-&gt;Microsoft Office Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;d. Add a suitable RTL Editing Language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not see any suitable languages, you may have to enable such a language in Windows Control Panel or Setting (again, depending on your version of Windows). But that is another story.</p>
<p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As far as I'm concerned, I can manage the tiles right after a factory reset but when I want to go back to management tiles later, it does not work anymore and I get the same message.
 Band and app are of the latest update. I can sync my data with no problem. I'm in France and ask is settled in French</span></p>
