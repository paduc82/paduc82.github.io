<h2>            Drag &#38; Drop &#39;Paste Into&#39; Function Similar to InDesign</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm developing a powerpoint template for our company and I'd like to create picture frames that other employees can drag images into.&nbsp; Currently, the only similar capability I've found is where someone can 'right click' and pick an image from a file to insert.&nbsp;
 This takes too long for our employees, so they just end up dragging pictures into the powerpoint slide and placing them ontop of the template.&nbsp; Formatting doesn't get preserved and the slides end up looking messy.&nbsp; I know Adobe InDesign allows users to drag
 images into a frame (or select&nbsp; them, copy, then 'paste into' a frame).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any similar capability in Microsoft powerpoint?&nbsp; Are there add-ons that allow this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colin</p>

            You might show them the Change Picture method (right click an image) or maybe copy the image, right click an empty content placeholder &gt; Paste<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t Install Office 2011 for Mac - Yosemite</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing a problem, and I can't handle with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a Mac user to certain activities, so I need at least to have a decent Office suite on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 subscription, and at Mavericks I have no problem, i upgade to Yosemite, and the software still working without problems, but show me an critual update avaiable to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose to download but when I try to install nothing change, I mean, usually need to inset the admin password do allow software to be installed, so in this case the text box to insert the main password don't show up. I can't install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I search at the Microsoft Support and read an article to show how to remove office 2011 completely from my Mac OS X, after that restar the computer and try to install office (last version downloaded from the Office 365 page) again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, I can't install it! The install package don't ask me for the system password, and the install still waiting for nothing, so I wait 3 hours and nothing changes, the process don't block, but it won't install the software until I enter
 the admin password, but the usual text box <span>
<span>not appear so I can't do anything.</span></span></p>
<span>not appear so I can't do anything.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem isn't the sign in or authentication. The problem is the installer that basically don't work properly. Normally I need to write my account password to allow any software to install on Mac OS, but Office 2011 Mac, don't ask me for my admin password,
 so they stay indefinitely waiting for something that I can't see. </p>

<h2>            OneNote for iPad Suggestions and Ideas</h2>
                    We all know that there are several flaws with the OneNote app for iPad. We all know it's missing quite a few things that would make it much better if it had them. And many people can think of at least one way to improve the app. Whatever your ideas for
 or feature suggestions may be, post them here! Who knows? Maybe someone from Microsoft will see this and put our suggestions here into the app itself!
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>NOTE: THIS ONLY APPLIES TO THE ONENOTE APP FOR THE IPAD.</b></div>
<div>You can find the same discussion for the iPhone and iPod Touch version of the app here:

<div>And remember: As long as you think your idea is a good idea, then it is a good idea. Only when no one in the world thinks it's a good idea is it a bad idea.</div>

            <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble being able to type anywhere on the screen while zoomed out (at thirty percent view--this can be done by pinching two fingers together on the screen). &nbsp;Is there some coding that will better recognise where someone taps on the screen? &nbsp;(On
 second try, restarting the app and/or the iPad seems to have fixed this for me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a suggestion to enhance the iPad OneNote app. &nbsp;It would be awesome to be able to create section groups via mobile, instead of going to the desktop or laptop versions to do the same. &nbsp;Even if it were an IAP feature, I'm sure many people would love
 to have this. &nbsp;Perhaps a free-standing plus icon would be an appropriate indicator to form a section group? &nbsp;I don't know coding myself, but I know that it would most likely take a lot of effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to thank the Microsoft teams for their hard work in designing, planning, and coding everything, and making their products user-friendly. &nbsp;And to the people who use Microsoft products, on their behalf, thank you for the patience, questions, and
 suggestions.</p>

            <p>G'day to the MS OneNote Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly - great product !!! I was using Evernote and then discovered that MS made OneNote sync across mobile devices and as far as I'm concerned, it beats Evernote hands down...especially integration with Outlook!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some suggestions to improve OneNote on iPad and Windows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ability to collapse sub-pages on iPad like you can on Windows.</p>
<p>2. Ability to color in rows/columns for tables in OneNote.</p>
<p>3. Ability to give better border formatting in tables in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've realised that if you change the name of a Notebook on your Windows OneNote, it doesn't update the iPad Notebook name - just a minor issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, a great tool and I look forward to further improvements moving forward!</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently to use OneNote with Office 365 you must 1st sign in with a Micorost account ( aka consumer account )&nbsp;. For the&nbsp;enterprise users this can be confusing and cumbersome and also adds to the leval of support needed by IT staff.&nbsp; Much like the confusion
 between Skydrive and Skydrive Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time OneNote for iPads seem to be consumer market driven and not enterprise ready.&nbsp; I find this to be concerning as MS announced Office 365 supoprt for iPads on March 27th. Currently on the Office 365 portal , a
 list of iPad apps includes Word Excel , Powerpoint OneNote and Lync.&nbsp; Of these , OneNote is the only app that does not recognize authentication via the offiec 365 corporate account.&nbsp; Future versions need to address this.

<p>
</p><p>Now that precision styli are on the market, adding support for this needs to be done ASAP!&nbsp; Taking notes by hand is much faster than typing, especially on the iPad.</p>

            The ability draw in the app is a must. I'm a college student and I've tried just about every app within my price range for good note taking apps and productivity apps. I just acquired Office 365 through my school, was totally hyped to use OneNote across
 my laptop and iPad - only to find that I can't draw on the iPad. Drawing on the iPad is one of the biggest features of any productivity/note taking app in the App Store. Microsoft,
<em>please</em> add the ability to draw to your next iPad version of OneNote.<br />

            <p>It would be a great improvement if the "equations" were enabled for the ipad app.</p>
<p>Or at least make the equations which are made on a computer viewable on the IPad. I think the equation feature is one of the best thing about the program on PC. It is a shame that I can't get access to the equations &nbsp;I have written on my computer.</p>

<h2>            Change Cursor Direction with Ergonomic Keyboard &#38; Mac</h2>
                    I'm using an Ergonomic 7000 keyboard with my Mac. (OSX Version10.7)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to insert Hebrew text, written in Word, into my Wordpress Hebrew website. I cannot figure out how to change the direction of the cursor. It stays on the left side and nothing I do gets it to move to the right for Right to Left writing.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help??????<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            IF this related to Office2011 for Mac. MS for whatever their divine reason doesn't support Right to Left (RTL). That's Office Mac Not The Mac. The Mac has always supported RTL since OSX.
<br />
<br />
If you&nbsp; need RTL&nbsp; you need Mellel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or NeoOffice all support RTL.

            Apparently Phillip didn't make it clear... RTL is <i>not</i> supported in <b>
Mac Office</b> -- never has been. The Mac OS, itself, <i>does</i> support RTL, but the Office software does not.<br />
<br />
How you go about invoking RTL depends on the keyboard driver (if there is one), the program &amp; [more importantly] the Operating System you're using the keyboard with. Invoking the input method on a Mac may be different than that used on a Windows PC, but if
 the keyboard works with one it should work with the other.<br />

<h2>            MS Project 2010 - Calibri font problem</h2>
                    <p>I have been working on a MS Project 2010 for several weeks. Yesterday I tried to generate a summary report with a timeline. I generated the same report last week with no problems. This week, there was no text on the timeline barrs. Eventually I figured out
 that if I changed the font from Calibri to Arial, the text appeared. As near as I can tell, the Calibri font was scaled so small as to be invisible (selected font size was 10). Similarly, in the Gantt chart, if the text was set to Calibri, the bar labels for
 task name did not show up. When the font was changed to Arial, the bar labels were visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resolved problem, sort of, but I still don't know why the problem occurred.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else run into something like this?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>jwain,</p>
<p>First of all, do you have SP2 installed? If not, install it. It is also a good idea to install the June 2013 cumulative update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it worked last week but doesn't this week and you did not install any new software, utilities, etc., there there is a good chance the file is corrupt. Do you have a problem with the Calibri font on a new file? If a new file works fine, then I suggest
 you save your file as XML and then re-open in Project. That usually clears corruption, but not always. Note, you will lose any cutom formatting using this process.</p>

The first thing that happens when an account is closed or deactivated is the data is immediately purged.&nbsp; There is no way to get it back.<br />
<br />
You may be able to create a new account using the same email address but the data is gone.<br />

<h2>            VLOOKUP function not working after recent update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent update I have tried using the VLOOKUP function and it isn't working correctly. I have a table consisting of two columns (time and temperature) and I want to find the time at a given set of intervals (say ever 10 seconds), although when trying
 to use VLOOKUP I only get a single solution for all the time intervals. I have used VLOOKUP a lot prior to the update and it has always worked fine, up until now. I am wondering if anyone else is having this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>

            After searching this error online, it seems it sometimes relates to language settings used and the recommendation is to Reset to Windows defaults. The use of . (period) as the decimal indicator rather than , (comma) is also mentioned. These reports have
 more to do with opening photo files, but maybe it gives a clue that the error may have something to do with language or Locale settings.

</p><p>I am sick of your updates downgrading my phone, why don't we just call them what they really are downdates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only a couple of reasons I stuck with the windows phone over an android or apple in the first place.&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; It reads texts over bluetooth.&nbsp; Which also does not seem to be working properly after the "update".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Radio - also disappeared in an "update".&nbsp;
 Nokia phone on Windows 8.1 was a great phone, Microsoft phone on Windows 10, not so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Date this will be fixed or just roll back the update.&nbsp; Also can we go back to choosing if we download the update.&nbsp; They are never any good always taking things away.&nbsp; I also don't always have access to wi-fi to do the update and you can tell when one is
 sitting there because it chews your battery until you download it even when you don't want to.&nbsp;

            Thanks for not answering the question. A roll back should take no time at all.&nbsp; I was quite happy before the update but you make it so that we have to do them and then loose functions on our phone.&nbsp; How do we download a pdf from a webpage.&nbsp; Do you have
 a work around for that? &nbsp;

            Are you kidding!!!!&nbsp; Why the hell would I use the Windows Device Recovery tool.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the apps it's your bloody update that is the problem.&nbsp; The whole issue is "the latest version of Windows"&nbsp; FFS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would I remove everything
 off the phone except for the thing that is the problem.&nbsp; Now if I could roll the phone back to how it was when I bought it and only do one update that fixed the battery usage then I would be set.&nbsp; &nbsp;I give up off to get an Android.&nbsp; Can I get some kind of refund
 on this phone???&nbsp; Considering there is nothing wrong with it except for your bloody software.

            I repeat.&nbsp; Can I get a refund on my phone?&nbsp; There is a suggestion going around that you have not paid to keep the PDF reader going as you don't want to support the phones anymore.&nbsp; Therefore as my relatively new phone is now useless.&nbsp;&nbsp; What refund are
 you offering customers that no longer have what they paid good money for?

    <title>Installed fonts does not display in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m5ngoose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed fonts does not display in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created text documents (.docx) in Word 2016 on a Mac. When I open them in Word 2016 on Windows, however, the font they're in is not displayed. When I hit Select All and then change the font to, e.g., Times New Roman, the main text is shown, but the footnotes
 are still gone (i.e., when the cursor hovers over a footnote marking, the related content is empty).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The font (IFAO-Grec Unicode; in .ttf; from 2012) is properly installed. It shows up in the fontbook of Windows and Word and I am even able to type NEW text in a newly created document in this very font!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A walkaround to the problem is saving the file in .rtf. When Word opens this file, the text is properly shown in the aforementioned font, but this is not a feasible solution, since due to my working schedule I have to regularly shift from Mac to Windows
 notebooks and therefore work with files from the Cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's odd is that there was no such problem when opening "Mac Word" files on my old Windows notebook (which possibly had an older Word version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know a possible solution? </p>

            Have you tried with other fonts? 
<br />
<br />Hopefully someone else will come up with a better suggestion.
<br />
<br />But, since there is a simple workaround, it sounds to me like there is a minor file format issue that MS should fix.  Please submit this as a "Feedback" through both Word Mac and Word Windows (so both teams see it).  Don't hold your breath waiting for a fix.

<h2>            Archving a Kiosk account</h2>
                    
<p>I need to archive an Office 365 Kiosk (K1) account. I know that Outlook can be attached via POP or IMAP but this only gains access to the Inbox and I need to get an archive of all folders including Sent Email and Deleted Email.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get an archive of the entire Kiosk account email?</p>

<p>Hi SmlBizAdmin,</p>
<p>To get an archive of the entire Kiosk account email, you need to purchase In-Place Archive as an add-on through Exchange Online Archiving.<br />
For more information, please refer to:<br />

<p>As it turned out, a complete copy of the emails from that account had already been obtained so no further action was needed. I think the customer would have preferred to temporarily replace the K1 license with a E1 or E3 just to connect Outlook and do an
 archival that way rather than purchasing a service for a one time use.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer change automatically the page I typed.</h2>
                    <p>Why when I type some address, and&nbsp;hit Enter, the browser change my address adding a letter and doesn't let me go to the address I typed, and I can't open&nbsp;the page I want. It's like the address&nbsp;typed is refreshed and send me a different page. Example: I type
<a href="http://www.msn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.msn.com</a> and is changed to <a href="http://m.msn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://m.msn.com</a> . It doesn't happen with this specific address, but is just an example.</p>
<p>If I do this on another computer like my Laptop Windows Vista, IE9 or another don't do the same, and I'm able to open&nbsp;the address I typed.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            microsoft security essentials crashed during first scan - now it wont&#39; start and I can&#39;t uninstall or reinstall it</h2>
                    I recently reinstalled Windows Ultimate on Windows 7 64 bit. &nbsp;I wiped everything and did a clean reinstall. &nbsp;I had dell tech support help with reinstalling the drivers. &nbsp;I downloaded and installed Microsoft Security Essentials. &nbsp;It installed OK and I ran
 a scan on just the system files. &nbsp;While it was scanning, the program crashed. &nbsp;Now when I try and open MSE, I get the message:&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft Security Client</div>
<div>An Error has occurred int he program during initialization. If this problem continues, please contact your system administrator.</div>
<div>Error Code: 0x80070002.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I restored to a previous point. &nbsp;The program does not appear in Add / Remove programs. &nbsp;I tried following the instructions for a manual uninstall found here:</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I stopped the services and everything. &nbsp;But none of the registry keys it mentioned were in there to delete. &nbsp;I tried to just install a new version, but when I tried to do that, Windows gave a BSOD. &nbsp;It didn't give much information. &nbsp;I think it was 0x000000....
 with all zeros but not sure. &nbsp; I have tried searching for what to do but everything I have tried has not worked and the error keeps popping up whenever I try and start MSE.</div>

Hi John - there was no other software installed, only the operating system and the drivers. &nbsp;When you say "Hopefully you will not have to do another reinstall" do you mean the entire OS again?

Stephen - I followed the steps in the article, renamed the folder and checked for updates, and still no luck resolving the error. &nbsp;There was no indication of a bad download either, and MSE was conducting a scan of files when something happened and it crashed.
 &nbsp;Are there any options to remove what was installed if it was a partial download/install and try and reinstall? &nbsp;

            <p>So Windows Update is working fine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens when you try to open or run MSE now?</p>
<p>What happens when you try to remove it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a complete removal of MSE, see this link which contains a variety of removal methods for a balky uninstall. The batch file method is pretty successful according to reports.</p>

Have you thought you might be infected?<br />
It wouldn't hurt if you try using an <u>uninfected</u> PC to download the latest and current version (v3.7.6.201) of
<b><a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HitmanPro.Kickstart</a></b> to create a HMPK USB Flash Drive, which you'll then use to clean up the potentially-infected PC. Follow ALL the instructions as provided in this
<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>HMPK's User Manual</b></a>, which includes two videos on how to (a) download the program to an
<u>uninfected</u> computer where you will create the <u>HMPK specific USB Flash Drive</u>, and (b) then using it on the
<u>infected</u> computer. <br />
The original manual available there in PDF format also includes images of the whole process.<br />
Please do post back and let us know how it turns out. <br />

    <title>icon sets conditional formatting showing down arrow for &#34;nearly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greendriver lv  say:</h3>
<h2>            icon sets conditional formatting showing down arrow for &#34;nearly zero&#34; values</h2>
                    <p>I have a field calculating the difference between two adjacent columns with percentage values in them &nbsp;(=P4-Q4).&nbsp; I then want to use icon sets for this calculated cell as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* if greater than&nbsp;or equal to&nbsp;.02 (as a number) green up</p>
<p>* if between 0 and .02, yellow horizontal</p>
<p>* if less than 0, then red down arrow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my variance comes out to 0, however, it's throwing in the red down arrow instead of the sideways horizontal.&nbsp;It's because the 0 value is only "zero" to a certain number of decimal points.&nbsp; It's "nearly" zero.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I set this up so that anything that is "zero" to 2 decimals goes horizontal rather than up or down?</p>

    <title>Cell formatting issue in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jozaza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cell formatting issue in Excel</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>I'm having problems with cell formats.&nbsp; The easiest thing for me to do is have someone replicate the problem... here is is:</p>
<p>In a new worksheet in Excel 2003 or 2007<br />
&nbsp;- Type a "Y" in cell A1 (without the quotes)<br />
&nbsp;- Type a "Y in cell B1 (without the quotes)<br />
&nbsp;- Format both cells A1 and B1 as "TEXT" using Format Cell; Number; Text<br />
<br />
Now go into cell B1, make it equal to cell A1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does the cell show the formula "=A1" and a Y ?</p>
<p>Eventually I want to add a custom format to both cells that allign them on the right with space the width of a parentheses separating the value from the celll edge, i.e., @_)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This format really doesn't matter to my question I think.&nbsp; It's the format of
 @ that seems to mix things up</p>

            Excel does exactly what you've told it to do. If you format a cell as Text, everything you enter into the cell is stored exactly as entered. So =A1 is interpreted as text, not as a formula.

<p>so then how would you format a cell that has a formula in, it references a cell that has text, the cell should be right aligned, and it has a _) at the end of the format so the value seen isn't next to the right of the cell?</p>
<p>@_) doesn't work,</p>
<p>#_) doesn't work.</p>
<p>0_) doesn't work.</p>
<p>Another error I'm getting is This.</p>
<p>Cell A1 type a Y in it.&nbsp; Format it as Test<br />
Make B1 = A1<br />
Notice the format of cell B1 is now text<br />
If you&nbsp;edit cell B1 now you have my same issue.&nbsp; Cell B1 now reads as a formula.&nbsp; If if you change the format back to General you see a formula in B1.<br />
<br />
WHat now?</p>

<p>HansV&nbsp;&nbsp; do you get the same issues as me?&nbsp;&nbsp; Your suggestion doesn't work for me if you edit cell B1.</p>
<p>In a new worksheet in Excel 2003 or 2007<br />
&nbsp;- Type a "Y" in cell A1 (without the quotes)<br />
&nbsp;- Type a "Y" in cell B1 (without the quotes)<br />
Format both as @_)</p>
<p>Looks good. Not the issue.&nbsp; This issue is if you edit cell B1 (Press F2)&nbsp; Do you see a formula or do you see a Y?&nbsp; I want to see a Y even if I edit the formula in B1.&nbsp; How can you do this if you want to either type a "N" or write a formulat in cell B1?</p>

            HansV&nbsp; once you format cell B1... you can NEVER edit it.&nbsp; If it's a formula it will always show as such regarless of the format you give the cell.&nbsp; General-&gt;shows as =A1, Custom # -&gt;shows as =A1, nothing works&nbsp;<br />
Any suggestions?

            So if you want to edit B1, temporarily set its format to General, edit it, then set the format to @_) again. Is that so hard?

<p>Of course it is!</p>
<p>Not only for myself, but also imagine if we are distributing the Excel file for others to use.&nbsp; Imagine having to teach each user how to work around this behavior.</p>

<p>The Custom format 0;;;@_) or 0;-0;0;@_) with Right horizontal format seems to work.&nbsp; We can still enter the formula =A1, and it is interpreted as a formula, not text.</p>
<p>I can understand why simply the Custom format @_) does not work.&nbsp; Note that the Text format is simply the Custom format @.&nbsp; So @_) effectively says:&nbsp; Text format indented from the right the width of one parenthesis.&nbsp; If a cell is formatted as Text, all data
 entry thereafter will be interpreted as text.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Custom format 0;;;@_) and 0;-0;0;@_) specify the formats for positive, negative, zero and text values.&nbsp; That implies that numeric data entry will be treated as numbers and formulas as formulas before they are treated as text.</p>
<p>PS....&nbsp; The x;x;x;@_) format is very fickle.&nbsp; While the two forms above work just fine, General;-General;General;@_) does not.&nbsp; Go figure!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft deleted my msn.com.au account without my knowledge or authority</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using a msn.com.au account for over 20 years. It has been constantly accessed (on my old PC via Outlook Express), and I have been sending and receiving emails via the address almost every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around the 28th of August this year, I wasn't able to access my email account. I have since been in touch with a both the billing and technical support departments of both Microsoft and Telstra but have not been able to recover the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only news I have found out from Microsoft is that the account no longer exists. I am the only person that can access the account, and I definitely did not delete it (I wouldn't even know how!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for some reason, someone in a Microsoft department somewhere must have deleted the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have raised a case with Microsoft, and they haven't been of much assistance. Ideally, I would like the msn.com.au email address recovered and any data it contains restored from backup. I know that this isn't much of a chance, so I would just like the same
 email address reinstated so I can use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some record of me owning the address as I had it for so many years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had their msn.com.au account deleted without their knowledge? If so, were you able to recover it and how were you able to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to provide the Microsoft case number and full msn.com.au email address to any Microsoft staff members that read this and would like to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the email address for my business and it has really affected me that this could happen without my knowledge. I would be happy to pay to maintain the account if that is what is needed. (I was never asked to pay for the account while it still existed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me someone!</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>No, but I can advise you to create a support case which will put you in touch with a Microsoft Account Support Representative which I believe the "Recover Account" form should do as well.&nbsp; They are the personnel that have the ability to look into the account
 to determine what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise anyone to never allow a third-party source to do your talking for you.&nbsp; It's your computer/account and you should discuss it with Support and no one else.&nbsp; It is a secure matter and information relating to the account is between you and Microsoft
 Support.&nbsp; As you can see, the computer technician would be a "conflict of interest" when it comes to safeguarding your account details.</p>

    <title>Pinch Zoom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billcovert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pinch Zoom</h2>
                    <p>I really love OneNote for the iPad Pro and the development team has done a great job responding to issues. &nbsp;One issue yet that I have is the pinch zoom engaging when I use the Apple Pencil when I'm nearing the bottom of the iPad screen in my writing. &nbsp;This
 mostly occurs with the draw touch turned off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A suggestion for a feature would be to have the capability to set a default zoom and to have a switch to turn off the pinch zoom feature (similar to the draw touch feature). &nbsp;This would be especially useful when using OneNote as a journal/notebook. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

    <title>Contacts deleted problem when sync with Windows Mobile Center. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whygateswantmyname  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts deleted problem when sync with Windows Mobile Center.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually use Active Sync 4.1 and then 4.5 on Windows XP&nbsp;for all my contacts,...&nbsp; After my 2 yrs old&nbsp;laptop hardisk crashed and ended up with a bad hardisk, I bought a new laptop with Vista. To my shock after installing disk for Samsung i780 mobile 6.1 pro,
 it turned out to be Windows Mobile Center. It was very difficult user-friendly and not much things to set. The worse is: after sync, it deleted all my contact lists in my phone. My MS Outlook 2007 and Windows Mail have no informations at all o these contacts.
 I have noticed that Active Sync 4.5 is better than Windows Mobile Center on user-friendly, ease of use, explanations&nbsp;and user controls. After checking on internet, Vista&nbsp;installs Windows Mobile Center&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;Active Sync which will not be able to start
 in Vista. Active Sync is only for XP and below. Now I know why the same disk installed in Vista becomes Windows Mobile Center and not Active Syncas in my XP OS. Now I regretted on Vista OS&nbsp;laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know where and how to retrieve these contacts? Are these contacts saved in another files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise, thanks.</p>

<p>Greetings whygateswantmyname!&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that items deleted during sync can be found in the deleted items folder in Outlook on the Host PC.&nbsp; Hopefully you have not cleared (deleted) the Deleted Items folder on exit.&nbsp; If you have, the only other way I know to regain your
 info is to send your device in to be professional checked for deleted items...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remembered on XP's Outlook 2003, I can locate them in the deleted items. That time, I placed back everything and Active Sync (either version 4.1/4.5)&nbsp;replaced all contacts back to my phone.</p>
<p>But in Vista's Outlook, there is nothing in my deleted folder. I have checked everywhere but to no avail.</p>
<p>I have noticed that Mobile Center doesnt communicate with my Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you mean professional? Is it the Samsung mobile service center?</p>
<p>I have sent in my damaged laptop for file retrieval but they were unable to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please anyone advise, thanks.</p>

<p>Hey <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/WindowsMobile/User/Profile.aspx?UserID=1297775&amp;SiteID=65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>whygateswantmyname</strong></a>, </p>
<p>I realise this is resurrecting an Old thread but I thought I'd add that i've just experienced the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My old Laptop Died and so i needed to get a new one and couldn't avoid getting VISTA.</p>
<p>Synced for the first time (after learning that i could no longer use Activesync) and in 2 seconds it had completed its Sync... in actual fact all it had accomplished was Deleting both my Contacts and my Calendar information. I Didn't even select
 for them to be Synced since i didn't have Outlook installed yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only consolation is that my phone (Palm Treo 750) Saves its Txt messages Separately with the numbers that sent them attached. So at least I can get back in touch with people i regularly Text. Unfortunately i've still lost important contacts
 that I don't (e.g. My landlord)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So unless your phone does the same I can offer no other suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Windows staff have any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.</p>

                    <p>I've seen a few threads with this issue while trying to activate the Microsoft key code. &nbsp;"The authentication session has expired. Please sign-in again."</p>
<p>I've tried some of the few steps I've read, but it still hasn't worked. &nbsp;Which is the best way to do so?!?! Thank you!!</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />You can try this:
<br />
<br />If any of these apps are open please close them: Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote and Outlook
<br />Open your 'Keychain app' 
<br />Select your default keychain on the left side, this is usually the 'login' keychain.
<br />Now click on the lock icon on the top left side to ensure the lock is in the locked state.
<br />Now open any Office app, you should see a dialog asking for permissions to access the keychain. This dialog may appear multiple times so you will have to ensure to provide the correct password and click on Allow or Always Allow when prompted.
<br />After this, you may be asked to sign in again, if this happens please sign in.
<br />After doing all this I am expecting that Office should be able to save your credentials.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />
<br />Engr. Jamshed Muhammad

            This worked for me! I have been troubleshooting this issue for hours and came up with this article. Thank you!
