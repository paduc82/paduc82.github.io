    <title>Latest win 10 update killed my xonar phoebus sound card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aeon-horus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest win 10 update killed my xonar phoebus sound card software&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thanks for taking the time to help me out here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days ago on the 16th January 2016 my PC updated and required a reboot, so I dutifully did as I was asked, worrying as to whether everything would still be OK as in the past win 10 updates have pretty much messed with everything from display drivers to
 my antivirus not working :( hmmmph!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I waited for the update to install and yes to my dismay another problem, NO SOUND!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus&nbsp;Xonar Phoebus Rog sound card, so I headed off to their website to see if I could &nbsp;download some updated drivers, and yes their they were. Thankfully, I downloaded them and installed them, YeY! We have sound.
</p>
<p>My motherboard is MSI Z97 Gaming 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have&nbsp;Realtek Digital Output and AMD High Definition&nbsp;Audio Device (could these be interfering ? They didn't before)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT!!!</p>
<p>Neither the software (Sonic Studio Pro)&nbsp;that controls the card nor the Dolby Home Theatre works any more and also I cannot record using cool edit pro. All this worked prior to the updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, please, please can anyone help ?</p>
<p>I cant find updates for the Dolby software (which I am pretty sure is why Sonic Studio wont work) anywhere, their site simply instructs me to head on over to Asus site (which I did) to DL the latest drivers, which they have but with no Dolby nor Sonic Studio.
 The thing is this. </p>
<p>Without the software the sound card sounds&nbsp;rubbish lol </p>
<p>I need the software to control it, so I would have thought it was pretty integral and I cant believe that Asus didn't release it with the updated drivers. Hmmmph...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if anyone knows a work around or of any way to get it all working again all suggestions welcome :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aeon&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you Paul for your quick reply about sweeping my windows Live e-mail..I thought I was losing my mind as I thought for sure there is a sweep button. &nbsp;I do love it when i go to my MSN hotmail and sweep and I have swept that out 2 x's before and when
 i came back to windows Live mail, i still have all my mail but I've noticed that when i start the shift/delete process, after a while the auto delete starts and finishes the job. &nbsp;i know it sounds like that isnt a function for Windows live mail but, i KNOW
 im not losing my mind on this one. &nbsp;After I sent my message to Microsoft and went back to my 8000 and some e-mails,, (dont laugh or shake your head) &nbsp;( Yeah I saw that ) &nbsp;LOL &nbsp;I did see them all start to auto/delete. &nbsp;Thats the second time i used MSN "sweep"
 button and gone back to my mail and that happened. Would have been a tragedy if I need some it but, i just use it for person business so it wasnt a big deal. &nbsp;Ok then, paul nice of your to quick reply

<p>No, you cannot, Windows 7 Professional DVD is only meant to install Windows 7 Professional. If you don't want the specific capabilities of Windows 7 Professional, you don't have to do them and there is no overhead required to do so, it uses the same hardware
 requirements of Windows 7 Home Premium too. The only difference is, you have to do a custom clean install. If this is not an option for you, then you should return it for a refund and obtain the correct edition.</p>
<p>Refund:<br />
www.microsoft.com/mscorp/productrefund/refund.mspx</p>
<p>Upgrade paths:<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>

    <title>System repair disc - Win7 Home Premium vs. Professional&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dandanv  say:</h3>
<h2>            System repair disc - Win7 Home Premium vs. Professional&#63;</h2>
                    Is the system repair disc created with RECDISC the same on Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium as it is on Windows 7 64-bit Professional? &nbsp;If they are the same, then I can live with the error I'm getting. &nbsp;If they are different, please read below and advise
 how I should proceed. &nbsp;Thanks.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I bought an Alienware (Dell) Desktop computer, with Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium pre-installed. &nbsp;I was able to create a recovery disc at that time. &nbsp;After a while, I decided to use Windows Anytime Upgrade to upgrade to Windows 7 64-bit Professional. Later
 after that, I've upgraded to SP1. I have scheduled backups including system images, but it recently occurred to me that I may need to re-create a system recovery disc in case they are different.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It turns out that when I went to try to create the new disc, I get an error "System repair disc could not be created. The parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)" &nbsp;This error occurs whether I use a CD or DVD media, in either of the CD/DVD-RW drives that are
 installed on this computer. &nbsp;I can burn other CD/DVD's without problems. &nbsp;This error occurs whether I use the GUI linked in the Backup &amp; Restore control panel, or use RECDISC from an elevated command prompt.</div>
<div>I have reviewed the support forums, and found the following suggestions that don't resolve the situation:</div>
<div>- check that my Region &amp; Language setting for decimal is a dot (confirmed it is a dot. &nbsp;rebooted, still get same error.) &nbsp;</div>
<div>- boot from installation media then run RECDISC (don't have installation media from Windows Anytime Upgrade. It was download only.)</div>
</div>
<div>- reinstall all Dell software from OEM installation media. (that will give me back the recovery partition with Home Premium... &nbsp;again my initial question.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I appreciate your input.</div>
<div><br />

There is actually no need to post this question here. If you can boot your machine into Windows Repair Mode with your Repair CD then it obviously works. If you can't then it doesn't. There is nothing in between.<br />

<br />
<div>If you don't understand the implications of the question, you don't need to reply. &nbsp;Your reply about whether the CD works is not pertinent to the question asked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I can boot with the repair CD from the original installation - however that doesn't answer the question of whether it will restore the system image of the upgraded installation.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Can you say whether the repair disc from a Windows 7 Home Premium (no SP) installation will be able to restore a system image from a Windows 7 Professional SP1 installation? &nbsp;That is what I need to know. &nbsp;I have had experience on XP with original installation
 discs not working for repair once I had installed a service pack - hence why I was trying to create a new system repair disc once I installed SP1.</div>

<div>I have experienced the problem with "OS is newer" preventing repair when using original installation media on XP. &nbsp;There are a lot of posts on MS and tech sites backing up this experience once a SP has been installed. &nbsp;Here are several links that show
 that to be the case on both XP and 7.</div>

<p>when i try to download programs these error messages pop up saying there is a bad image. I cannot view any videos on my internet explorer and have no idea how to fix this as when I try to download and update flash player this comes up, along with real player.
 My malware has not found anything and I am not certain if this is a virus or a technical problem that I have caused. Any help would be great. Thanks. I use windows 7 on a 2010 Dell Inspiron.<br />

<h2>            My wireless printer isn&#39;t working, what do I do&#63;</h2>
                    I just got a new Brother printer and the wireless connection isn't working. There's two computers in the house. Mine isn't the main source with the router, that's my room mates. But I feed off of the connection. And my printer should do the same, seeing
 as it's wireless. I've done the set up a few times and it said it was connected. I also see the printer under Devices and Printers, but when try to print something it doesn't do anything.&nbsp;

            <p>One thing to watch for with printers and particularly with wireless is its address changing. Router DHCP servers do have a mechanism to limit this changing but it does happen. In some drivers there is a mechanism to try and detect this and still find the
 printer but not always. When this happens the printer will no longer connect to print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are normally two main solutions to this. One definitely&nbsp;involves being able to modify the router setup the other could be achieved without it at a pinch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that the printer driver is correctly configured and can talk to the printer then log into the router. In its menus there is normally an option to make the DHCP server always to issue the same address to the printer on the basis of its MAC address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively you can set the printer not to use DHCP but use manual addressing. That way it cannot change so the connection will not drop because of a change. Ideally you would modify the DHCP range on the router to exclude a section of addresses and then
 set the printer in this excluded range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have access to the router what you can see is the addresses being issued by the DHCP. It is not absolute but most start in the low range such as 2 upwards. This means that the likelihood of the top end ever being reached is remote. so if you
 use a high value such as 250 it is extremely rare for that to be used in a domestic situation so not cause a conflict.</p>

<p>Thank God I just found this forum. I was about to kick the **** out of my freakin Xbox. I just got it today and started setting it up about 2 hours ago. My mom wanted me to connect our Netflix account to the Xbox and I got all the way to the confirm payment
 part and the error message comes up. Me not having any idea how Xbox really works, I've been about to PULL OUT MY HAIR trying to see what I did wrong. The only thing I could find when I googled my error message was this thread. So now what? Do we just wait
 until the frikkin status is gone? How do you watch the page?</p>

<p>Be sure to check the Xbox Live status report at the top of the page at times. It appears that there is a problem with Live at the moment and I suggest waiting it out until it's fixed. "Users will experience issues when attempting to purchase content and
 Microsoft Points, creating new accounts, or attempting to manage existing accounts. Additionally, Users will be unable to sign into Xbox LIVE using the Games for Windows PC desktop client only." Here's where you can find more information:

<p>That version dates from November 2010. It has been updated several times since then, the latest build being 15.4.3555.0308 dating from March 2012. Version 2011 is only supported on Windows Vista, and barely then. If your operating system is later (Windows
 7, 8.1 or 10), you should consider upgrading to Windows Live Mail 2012. Be sure to have a backup copy of your default contacts list (the one you see when you're not signed in in Windows Live Mail), because the upgrade will probably remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been many reports recently of repeated downloads from a particular ISP's servers. The fault is at the server end in those cases, so there's nothing the user can do about it. Who is your ISP?</p>

<p>ISP is Talktalk </p>

<p>I'd guessed as much. Talktalk's POP3 implementation has taken a turn for the worse, and they seem to have no idea what's causing this problem for so many users.
<a href="https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/My-Email/bd-p/myemail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Their forums</a> are full of similar complaints. Until they locate the fault and cure it, there is apparently no solution other than to use IMAP instead. Sadly, that doesn't necessarily work
 much better, but at least you're free of the multiple downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, right-click on the POP3 account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. On the <em>General</em> tab, deselect <em>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing,</em> then click
<em>Apply</em> and <em>OK</em>.&nbsp;This will ensure that the account folders will remain intact with their contents during the transition.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Set up a new IMAP account</p>
<ol>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the <em>Add your email accounts</em> wizard.
</li><li>Enter your email address, password and display name for outgoing messages. </li><li>Select <em>Manually configure server settings </em>and click <em>Next</em>.</li><li>For the incoming server, select <em>IMAP</em> from the dropdown.<br />
For the incoming server address, enter&nbsp;<strong>mail.talktalk.net* </strong>and ensure that the the port number is
<strong>143</strong>.<br />
For <em>Authenticate using</em>, select <em>Clear text</em> from the dropdown.<br />
For <em>Log-on username</em>, enter the full email address.</li><li>For the outgoing mail server address, enter&nbsp;<strong>mail.talktalk.net* </strong>
and change the port to <strong>587</strong>.<strong><br />
</strong>Select <em>Requires authentication.</em></li><li>Click <em>Next </em>and <em>Finish.</em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">* <em>If your email address isn't @talktalk, you might have to use the appropriate server names given on
<a href="http://help2.talktalk.co.uk/email-settings-imap-pop3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a>. </em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program will try to connect and download the account folders and their contents. This may take some time if there are a lot of folders and/or messages, and it may stall. Be patient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your folders have downloaded and the messages in them, you can drag messages out of the POP3 account's folders and into those for the new account. In this way, you can retain your sent messages and drafts, for example. Check also for messages in the
 POP3 account's inbox that are no longer in the IMAP inbox and drag them across if you want to keep them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're sure that there are no messages left in the POP3 account's folders that you want to keep, you can right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Remove account</em>. Read and heed the warning you see: the account folders and all their contents will be permanently deleted when you proceed.</p>

<p>We have to see the entire error message <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
verbatim</span> to have any chance of being able to diagnose the problem. Please remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane), then compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself. Post&nbsp;the

<p>I recently uninstalled avast free antivirus. When I looked at windows defender firewall it stated it was under the control of avast and could not be activated.</p>
<p>I done a search on C: and found many avast files remaining.</p>
<p>I have used the avast removal tool and was unsuccessful. I tried to get some ifo off their website but all they say is use the removal tool.</p>
<p>Their is no avast app on my computer.</p>

<h2>            Complaint System is Useless</h2>
                    
<p>so tonight, I run into some "team killers" on my game.&nbsp; I was told "I tried to take "their" tank" to which i replied...it's not yours if I'm there first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>we exchange opinions and move along, but their is where the problem starts.</p>
<p>3 guys follow me and my friends for 3+ hours.&nbsp; not to one game, but to 6 different games, joining our team, team killing, grabbing vehicles from our team and delivering them to the vehicles to their buddy, who's on our team, that they won't kill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I call support, they say report them for communication??&nbsp; WTF?? Really?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this were a resturant, someone else would have paid for my dinner.&nbsp; If this was a store purchase, I'd get a refund or replacement, but with xbox, all I can do is report these guys for "communication"....................?&nbsp; this really leaves something
 to be desired, as not one of the "file-able complaints, even comes close to what took place here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You guys really need to re-think the report system, more over, you should do something about gamers who ruin xbl for others</p>

<p>It amazes me that people need to to take shots at people when ever they get the chance to do so.&nbsp; of course I know what the mute button is, however, why should ANYONE&nbsp; have to hide from people they just met in games, who may want to request friends, meet
 in a new party or play together?&nbsp; this is a social net work and your suggested option only tells me, the db's of the world rule x box and force decent folks to take such action.&nbsp; this methodology does not address the real issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>again, it had nothing to do with verbal abuse, I gave back what I was given, I can cuss like a sailor when too, when first attacked.&nbsp; it's being game stalked for hours, these guys we're pro's at it.&nbsp; again, to your dev's "allow team killing" shows me your
 as brain washed as the report system is.&nbsp; I don't think Dice and Ea would support game stalking where 3 players follow other players for hours, team kill them, revive them, team kill them, revive them, until they get booted after 5 kills, then re-join and
 start all over again.....thats not why tk-ing is is included in this game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the last time I contacted an XBL Pet, not one response or action was taken after another gamer drop trau and took a picture of his anus with his live cam.&nbsp; I kept the mail for 30 days and he was on for 30 days straight, no suspension, nothing.&nbsp; this
 whole scenario reminds of of ps3 being shocked they got hacked when they later admitted they didn't do all they could from a security pov.&nbsp; hiding from the trolls just enables them and it is shameful nothing will come of this. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I understand that and changing your online status, even temporarly via the Guide button, would have prevented them from stalking you. You are making the situation harder than it needs
 to be. If you believe Dice/EA will take action on them then by all means contact them about it. As far as XBL goes if the game allows them to team kill then there is nothing to enforce against. Since they were stalking you (harassment) you can
<strong>file a complaint</strong> against them for that but not for the tk'ing as that does not violate the XBL Terms of Service or Code of Conduct.</span></p>

 whole scenario reminds of of ps3 being shocked they got hacked when they later admitted they didn't do all they could from a security pov.&nbsp; hiding from the trolls just enables them and it is shameful nothing will come of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How did you contact the XBL PET? The only way to contact them when you encounter an offender on XBL is via the
<strong>File a Complaint </strong>tool on your console. Everyone seems to think policy enforcement on XBL is instant, that is not the case. Some offenses warrant a longer investigation that others. With 30 million Live subscribers it will take time to go through
 all the complaints filed each day as each complaint is reviewed by an actual person.</span></p>

<p>So I cancelled my credit card and you guys still charged my account $19.98 without warning. And now my account is suspended and I just spent $30 on a 3 month subscription that I can't redeem on my profile. I think its only fair that you remove the charge
 and unsuspend my account. I have been a loyal Microsoft customer for years. ***, I haven't even picked up a PS controller since Play Station 1 was out. Not once have a I filed a complaint or miss a payment. I think the least you could do is a waive a $20 charge
 that was unfairly added to my account. </p>

<br />
You do know you're told about auto renewal and how it works before signing up right or are you hoping feigning ignorance will get you out of this? Mores to the point how is the system supposed to know you cancelled the card if you didn't tell it?<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]And now my account is suspended and I just spent $30 on a 3 month subscription that I can't redeem on my profile.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Again you're told that you can't use pre paid cards to pay off outstanding debts<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]I think its only fair that you remove the charge and unsuspend my account.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Because you didn't read the agreement before agreeing to it? Er no that's not happening.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]I have been a loyal Microsoft customer for years. ***, I haven't even picked up a PS controller since Play Station 1 was out. [/quote]<br />
<br />
Is this one of those "do as I demand or I'll go over to the console that looks like a George Foreman grill" threats? Because it's a pretty poor one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]I think the least you could do is a waive a $20 charge that was unfairly added to my account.[/quote]<br />
<br />
You given every opportunity to educate yourself about how auto renewal works and you still chose blind ignorance. Next time read things before agreeing to them. &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I have exactly the same thing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal domain is being rejected by Outlook.com. &nbsp;I found some evidence that Microsoft made a change that they won't allow domains hosted on Azure. &nbsp;(My account was on Office 365 Business).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to rectify this, I closed my Office 365 Business Account and moved my domain over to Google Apps. &nbsp;( I was hoping this would be temporary)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet ... I still can't add this domain to outlook.com. &nbsp;I'd really like to use Outlook.com as my primary email. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a fix for this. &nbsp;This seems insane.</p>

    <title>Windows Detected A Hard Disk Problem Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Detected A Hard Disk Problem Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>I know there is a thread on this already but I think mine seem to be different from others. I ran a chkdsk check and a scannow check on my command and it both said nothing is wrong with my hard drive. However every so often, a pop up would show saying that
 "Windows Detected A Hard Disk Problem" and gives me an option to back up my files or to ignore the pop up. Since I don't have a spare USB on me I googled other ways to try to fix this error but will always fall to the last resort which is to "get Professional
 Help." Now I'm lost and confuse. Spent a few hours scanning my laptop for viruses, possible solutions to fix the error, scanned the C: drive but it tells me that there's no problem with that C: drive even though the warning tells me that that C: drive is messed
 up. Someone please help me out on this? Afraid to use my laptop now because it said that my computer could possible erase my stuff if the next warning shows up. The disk drive that is currently having issues right now is (OS Drive C:) HGST HTS54110A9E980.
 I am currently using an ASUS Q502LA-BBI with a 8GB ram and 64 bit OS. It's a 1TB hard drive with an Intel Core i5 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a crucial information but the other day while I was typing my computer automatically shut down on its own and then did it again when i turned it on right after. This only happened a few times throughout the 3 years since I had this
 laptop.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Most HDDs are built-in SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) which uses a technology known as predictive failure analysis to warn you a hard disk problem. The hard disk in your laptop right now is not yet failed, but will be sooner or
 later. Could be in a week, could be in one year. Who knows? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, it is better to take precautions just as the warning says: "Back up your files immediately to prevent information loss...". Once the hard disk fails, you can replace it with a new one and restore data. Learn more what "Windows detected a hard
 disk problem" mean:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.backup-utility.com/articles/windows-detected-hard-disk-problem-1203.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.backup-utility.com/articles/windows-detected-hard-disk-problem-1203.html</a><br />

            Hi SeleneN 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Try deleting from a command line.
<br />So go to search and type powershell then right click it and select run as administrator.
<br />Type the following command all on one line and hit enter.
<br />
<br />Remove-Item c:\users\youruserfolder\desktop\nameoffile.txt -force

            Hi,
<br />
<br />If the problem persists you could try removing the file using its 8.3 name via an Administrator Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />There is a video in the following link explaining:

    <title>Windows 10 update breaks everything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j._927  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update breaks everything</h2>
                    <p>The latest Windows 10 update seems to break everything. The laptop I use is an Acer Nitro 5, AN515-51-76YG, Windows build 1803. It has all the latest drivers/BIOS updates. It was running perfectly well before the latest Windows update. But as soon as I try
 and update there's a flurry of different problems. Each time I have to restore my laptop from a system image, which brings me right back to where I was before. But I can't keep doing this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly WHAT the problem is, but I can make a list of symptoms:<br />
<br />
-using Google Chrome OR Firefox, certain websites mysteriously do not to work, I get unhandled javascript exceptions (even after clearing cache/cookies), webpages just hang or do not display properly, yes I tried reinstalling Chrome and disabling all Chrome
 extensions<br />
-certain tabs/menus in the Windows 10 Settings app hang indefinitely<br />
-one really important app that I need, VMware Workstation, hangs indefinitely when I try to connect to a server<br />
-running the system file checker command, 'sfc /scannow', always detects (and claims) to fix system file integrity errors but actually fixes nothing and each time I run the command the output is the same<br />
-the first time I tried to update, before restoring from backup, there was a BSOD midway through the update<br />
-system restore fails, I have to instead restore from a system image I made with a 3rd party utility<br />
<br />
I tried to disable Windows updates in every way possible. I scoured forums for ways to do this, for example I tried to change the permissions on the updates download folder, so that not even the System account can write to it, but Windows 10 now has this WindowsUpdateMedic
 service that checks for problems with Windows updates and remediates them. In short, there basically IS NO WAY to definitively disable Windows updates. Windows 10 has safeguards against it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is why people curse and grind their teeth at Microsoft. At very minimum, users need to have control over how and when Windows updates are done.<br />
<br />

<p>This problem has been persistent for a few months and has prevented me from downloading any apps or games (free or not), redeeming codes and doing anything else on the marketplace.</p>
<p>What occurs is that when I press the button to use the marketplace (redeem code, buy etc.) the button flashes, no error message displays and then nothing happens.</p>
<p>This is quite limiting in my ability to use the console and prevents me from downloading the preview dashboard.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi there! </p>
<p>Sorry to hear of your issue.</p>
<p>Have you tried accessing the marketplace on <a href="http://store.xbox.com/?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://store.xbox.com/?</a> You may be able to purchase items from there, which will then download to your Xbox One console. This is the same for redeeming codes as well (<a href="http://xbox.com/redeemcode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/redeemcode/</a>).
</p>
<p>As for your console, a possible fix could be to do a power cycle. Please follow the steps below to do this:</p>
<p>1. When your console is turned on, please hold down the power button on the front of the console for 10 seconds, until the console turns off.
</p>
<p>2. Wait for 30 seconds and then disconnect the power cable. </p>
<p>3. Wait a further 30 seconds, then reconnect the power cable and turn the console back on.
</p>
<p>4. It may take a bit longer to reach the dashboard, but once complete, please try to access the Xbox Store again.
</p>
<p>Should this solution not work, I recommend deleting and re-downloading your profile. Instructions on how to do this can be found here:
</p>
<p>1. Here's how to delete your profile: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/security/remove-profile-from-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../remove-profile-from-console</a></p>
<p>2. Here's how to re-download your profile: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-xbox-one-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-xbox-one-console</a></p>
<p>I hope this helps your issue, and if you still have questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
</p>

<p>I can use the website marketplace to download and redeem things, however certain things cannot be accessed on the website stone (only on the console such as downloading the preview dashboard).</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice I will try it and reply the result.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that the above solutions have not helped to resolve the issue you are experiencing.
</p>
<p>The only other solution I have for you is to do a factory reset, which does erase all content on your console. For this reason, I recommend backing up all content and data before following any of the steps on this page:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/system/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../reset-console-to-factory-defaults</a>. </p>
<p>If that does not work, or you would prefer not to do a factory reset, then I would ask that you contact Xbox Support to assist you further. Please head to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>.
</p>
<p>I hope this is of more assistance. </p>

    <title>Control panel does not work, cannot turn on firewall and audio service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nabil176  say:</h3>
<h2>            Control panel does not work, cannot turn on firewall and audio service is not running</h2>
                    Recently i noticed audio was not working - 'The Audio Service is not running'. I tried starting it using services.msc, but it said 'the endpoint is a duplicate'. I tried to use control panel but it would not respond. Then i thought it was a virus, so using
 AVG Antivirus 2015, ran computer scan, but there were no viruses. The AVG firewall said ERROR, so i tried to turn it on, but did not work. Tried enabling firewall with Dell Support Assist, but it did not respond either. i also tried sfc /scannow and opening
 windows in safe mode. Any help or advice would be appreciated.

            <p>If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier time, called a restore point. This restores backups of your registry and system settings, but doesn‚Äôt touch any of your files. It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo
 the process or try another date if it doesn‚Äôt fix the problem on the first try. When you aren‚Äôt sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.&nbsp; This works best if you use it immediately after a problem shows up.&nbsp; Waiting
 more than a week or two means the good backups can be too outdated to use.</p>

<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore process, or try another date.</li></ol>

<p>System Restore can undo recent changes to the system, without affecting your personal files.</p>
<p>If you can‚Äôt login, or can‚Äôt use the Restore app, you can reach it from Safe Mode instead. However, restores performed in safe mode can‚Äôt be undone and I recommend against it if possible, because this strays from the ‚Äúeasy to undo‚Äù appeal of this simple
 option.</p>
