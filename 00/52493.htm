<h2>            System Repair Disc on USB Drive Incomplete</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a system repair drive using the Windows 10 built-in procedure.&nbsp; The repair drive thus made&nbsp;has all the options, but one:&nbsp;&nbsp;It has&nbsp;no Startup Settings options.&nbsp; I remade the drive three times, resulting in no change in this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the drive each time to see whether I could access Safe Mode via the system repair procedure.&nbsp; To access that mode, one has to have access to the&nbsp;drive's&nbsp;Startup Settings options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive has no such options.&nbsp; Here is what I do when I test the drive to try to get to the Startup Settings.&nbsp; After booting to the drive, and after selecting the US&nbsp;keyboard layout,&nbsp;I select:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Troubleshoot&nbsp;&gt; Advanced Options, and the screen displays the following options:</li><li>System Restore</li><li>System Image</li><li>Startup Repair</li><li>Command Prompt</li><li>UEFI Firmware Settings</li><li>Go back to previous build</li></ul>
<p>That's all.&nbsp; No Startup Settings options there.&nbsp; The system repair when accessed from within Windows 10 does include the Startup Settings options.&nbsp; They are only missing on my USB and DVD drives&nbsp;when making the system repair disc using the Windows 10 built-in
 procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running&nbsp;Windows 10 Home,&nbsp;64 bit.&nbsp; I boot to Windows via EUFI set in the BIOS/EUFI.&nbsp; My system is working properly.&nbsp; I only tested the repair disc (USB and DVD) to determine whether I could access Safe Mode in case I needed it in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why&nbsp;are the Startup Settings options missing from my repair drives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fritziey</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know about those bcedit commands.&nbsp; However, my question is why are the Startup Settings options missing from my repair drives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my PC set to boot directly to the desktop.&nbsp; No password required.&nbsp; I see nothing from a fast boot to the desktop, except a brief screen to allow pressing Del to enter EUFI/BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know why my repair drives contain no Startup Settings options.&nbsp; Those are supposed to be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know?</p>

<h2>            What Guest OS&#39;s are supported in Windows 7 Virtual PC</h2>
                    I have installed Ubuntu 9.10 in Virtual PC, but when I boot the VM, it finds the grub loader then when I select the operating system I get several segmentation errors.<br />
<br />
I suspect these errors are coming from the Linux kernel, hence the question

<p>I am able to repeat the same issue and it appears to be a problem with Cortana's programming code for voice recognition commands to perform music operations. As you may already know, Cortana is associated with the Groove Music app, regardless of which music
 application you choose as your default music player.&nbsp; This appears to be intentionally programmed by Microsoft perhaps to integrate the two programs.&nbsp; In any event, there is an alternative voice command you can say to Cortana that will recognize your music
 as long as you have added the location path in Groove Music so that the app can access your digital audio files.&nbsp; Once that's confirmed, you can say the command, "Hey Cortana...Play me any song" and Cortana will load Groove Music and begin to play your music.&nbsp;
 If you want to narrow the command a bit, you can also say, "Hey Cortana...Play some music from the 1980s genre" and Cortana will play music in your collection from the 1980s as log as your ID3 tags include date information.&nbsp; I recommend that you edit your
 music collection to update your ID3 tags to make sure all of the information is in the file to identify it for Cortana.&nbsp; I use tagscan which is the best ID3 tag editor that's been freely available for many years now, and is always kept up to date by the developer.&nbsp;
 Keep in mind also that you can make variations of my examples and Cortana may work with your variations.&nbsp; Finally, don't forget that Cortana uses AI to enhance your user experience, so be sure to let the voice assistant learn from your voice and it will eventually
 start recognizing words like "genre" which it may not know the first few times you say it.&nbsp; Cortana will learn any word as long as you repeat it enough.<br />

            Many thanks, Cortana responded immediately to the new command "Hey Cortana.....Play me any song" I will now investigate ID3 tags and tagscan.

            Make sure you have added the storage location where your music is saved by opening the Groove Music App and adding the path.&nbsp; Groove Music won't find your music unless you tell it where to search.<br />

<p>Very easy...just tap/click on the settings icon in Groove Music app -- icon looks like a gear shape and is located at bottom next to your account name. &nbsp;Then under the menu called "Music on this PC" you just tap/click on "Choose where we look for music"
 and select the location where you've saved your music files. &nbsp;That's it.</p>

<p>Finally I find a post that describes my problem!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the "Hey Cortana, Shuffle my music" command constantly and it has been working flawlessly with my massive collection.&nbsp; But then for no apparent reason I started getting the "I can't seem to find any music locally or in your collection"
 response.&nbsp; However when I try "Hey Cortana, play Walk This Way by Aerosmith", it's now playing on Groove.&nbsp; I have relocated my Music folder to another drive but it all checks out.&nbsp; Plus I have confirmed said folder's entry in my Music Library and it's path
 is identified in Groove.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I tried "Hey Cortana, Shuffle my Music" and she responded "Sorry, I can't play that on Groove"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything but can't get the voice or typed command to work unless I specify a song or an Artist.&nbsp; If I say "Hey Cortana, Play all my Aerosmith", then all my Aerosmith songs que up and start to play on Groove.&nbsp; I really would rather get the
 random shuffled playlist I used to get when it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I may have done to screw it all up?&nbsp; At this point with all the things I've tried to do to fix it I'm sure I've made a mess.&nbsp; I tried putting it all on OneDrive, then taking it all back, removing the folder from Library and Groove then putting
 it back, reinitializing complete PC Indexing, and resetting Groove, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grrrrrrr.......any help or idea would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8ad94641-8115-41c6-81ac-91332d4bf66e" title="Johngoodridge">
<p>
</p><p>Just for clarification, are you able to sign in already on your correct account? Can you please tell us on where you are seeing the spinning circle? Is it during sign in or is it your status icon that is spinning?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional information will help us isolate the issue. Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists.
<br />
Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Why does the site not show all my games&#47;achievements&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As the title says, this site does not show a good chunk of the games I have played and have achievements in. Why is this?</p>

<h2>            Installing Brothers MFC7460DN printer</h2>
                    <p>When I go to add a Brothers printer rather than showing specific models it shows what I assume is printer classes. No where can I find what class a Brothers MFC-7460DN belongs to. I would appreciate knowing where to find this info.</p>

            Does it do this only when it's in sleep mode, or does it also happen if it's completely shut down?

            Hi Ehtasham,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the query description, there are some issues with the Wi-Fi network on the computer as you have to restart the computer every time to connect to the network in the second attempt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would request you to answer some questions on this issue to help you in a better way:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Are the wireless network drivers on the computer up-to-date?<br />
2) What is the exact Model of HP 1000 series notebook?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to refer to check if there are any issues with the network adapter installed on
<div>the computer. You can run the network troubleshooter in context of this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>: If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. Run System File Checker (SFC) scan
 to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</b></p>

<p><span><span><b>M<span>ethod 2:</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Enable clean boot and then check to see if the issue persists<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Follow

<p><span><span><span><span><b>&nbsp;</b></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are
 causing the problem.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><br />
After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><b>Important:</b><span> - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup follow

            Thanks Ajay. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately the only file that the system file checker found using this was an ieakui.dll file, and not the MSVCP90.dll file.
<br />
<br />
I've not run into a problem with the ieakui.dll anyway so I'm loath to touch it. So whilst very informative, this didnt help.
<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? Anyone?<br />

            <p>Usually the SFC scannow will fix most issue with MSVCP90.dll missing from your computer.
<br />
<br />
Look at this&nbsp;<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbyerrormessage/a/msvcp90-dll-not-found-missing-error.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">3rd party site</a>: It has good troubleshooting tips for this missing file. I would not recommend a registry cleaner as it can remove important
 files from the registry. <br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having an issue and trying to deal with it a few times. This has been for at least 2 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This so called Service Host is using up a lof of CPU which makes my computer run hotter, louder, and even slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried sfc scannow, but takes a lot of time and I believe that it's only a temporary fix until restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another solution I've found is going into "troubleshooter" for Windows Update and it fixed the issue until next restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give some context there is now and then "Windows Modules Installer" popping up in the top 3 list of most CPU intensive tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any viruses installed. I've scanned thoroughly with Malware Bytes and have Avast running in the background at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the "clean boot" technique, it seemed to work (it wouldn't use my CPU anymore) but I don't know which services to keep disabled or so..</p>

            Hi Kenzo,<br />
<br />
One of the reasons why you're experiencing this issue is when there's an update running in the background. We suggest checking the computer's update history to see if there's an update being installed. To check, go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Update History.</strong><br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have further queries.

                    <p>I have two problems that are in lockstep, if I have one then I will have the other. The first is that Microsoft Edge browser gives the message "Hmm, we can't reach this page" even though the internet works fine on the other browsers.. At the same time Microsoft
 Outlook hangs on "loading profile". It will not start in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For quite a while every few weeks these two problems appear, always together. No matter what I &nbsp;tried they would stay around for a few days and then disappear together. When MS Edge worked, then I knew Outlook would work and vice versa. So I got used to
 not having Microsoft Edge and Outlook for a short period of time every few weeks. However about three days ago the two problems came, as usual together, and are not going away so I can not access Microsoft Edge or Outlook.<br />
</p>
<p>Some time ago when I first installed Windows 10 these problems appeared separately and I spent a lot of time on each of them trying to correct them but they would always come back. But now they always come together and now both stay failed! Any help you
 can give me with this would be very appreciated. Thank you<br />

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Any changes made on the computer prior to this problem?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Are you referring to Office Outlook installed on the computer or the Outlook.com website?

            <p>Thank you for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have had this computer for years. No particular changes made in the recent past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have Office Outlook installed on the computer, NOT outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10: &nbsp;Home version 1607, os build: 14393.693&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Office 2016</p>
<p>MS Outlook 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Outlook, followed all the regular suggested corrections, including some registry changes, Outlook in safe mode, erased Outlook identity and created new Outlook identity and redownloaded old emails, even reinstalled Office. Some of these changes seemed
 to work temporarily but problem of being stuck on "loading Profile" keeps recurring. Also tried all the fixes for Edge's "Hmm we can't reach this page" problem, which were suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first these two problems with Edge and Outlook happened separately. Now, 100% of the time they always occur together and are "fixed" together. They occur together every few weeks and in the past seem to just go away on their own, though currently they
 seem permanent, at least for the last few days.</p>

            Hi Robin_964 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />HP provides a tool for HP printers to troubleshoot - HP Print and Scan Doctor. Download it, launch it and follow the onscreen directions to locate problems and fix them
<br />
<br />Download Link - <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe</a>
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturerâ€™s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />
<br />4. Clear Spooler
<br />Type Services in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to Print Spooler &gt; Right-click and choose Stop for the Print Spooler service &gt; Go to C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. You can also type %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS into the address bar in Explorer if the C drive is not the default Windows partition &gt; Delete all the files in this folder &gt; Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Done all the passages and have been able to print just 1 time. Then it stopped working at all. Another printer works correctly. It seems a problem between HP and Windows. Print doctor can print internal tests and reports, but windows apps cannot<br />

<p><span>Hi Mahdi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Viruses, malware, and threats can affect the performance of your computer. It can also damage your files and make most of your programs not to work properly. Windows 10 has an anti-virus called
<strong>Windows Defender</strong>. This program is very essential for your computer since it has defensive measures that keep viruses and malware away from your PC by scanning and detecting it.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>In the meantime, we recommend performing a full system scan for your computer to see if there are viruses, malware, malicious programs or script that prevents your computer to work properly. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1:</span></strong><span> Perform a full system scan.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows + S </strong>to open <strong>Search Box</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Windows Defender</strong>, then click it.</span></li><li><span>In <strong>Home</strong> tab, select <strong>Full</strong> under <strong>
Scan options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Scan now </strong>to begin the thorough scanning of your computer.</span></li><li><span>Wait for the process to finish.</span></li><li><span>If there are any findings, send us the results through screenshot.</span></li><li><span>Before closing the application, make sure that <strong>Windows Defender</strong> is always turned on.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #2:</span></strong><span> Set a schedule on
<strong>Windows Defender</strong> to perform periodic scans. Visit this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026132/windows-schedule-a-scan-in-windows-defender-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Maybe. That is why it was called a malware. These kinds of threats bypass anything or make changes on your computer without your consent. This means even it is not allowed, they will enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back, we highly recommend performing a full system scan using
<strong>Windows Defender </strong>to eliminate threats, viruses, and malware on your computer.</p>
<p><br />
We always have regular virus definition updates to eliminate threats that were encountered by
<strong>Windows</strong> users.</p>

<p>Malware will commonly take advantage of administrative rights, it's a bit like leaving the key in your front door and going out.&nbsp; It's rare that software will need administrative rights to run, just install so you could look at using a restricted account
 for daily use and have a separate admin account for installations - indeed this approach is considered best practice in business IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively there are tools available in A/V products that can detect change and require a second check that this is valid something along these lines might be worth looking into if you can't lock down admin rights?</p>

<p><strong>Windows Defender </strong>doesn't remove fake root CA. Aren't applications need any specific signature to be allowed to add root CA? If yes, how this malware managed to do that?

<h2>            Transfer Game data from computer to HDD</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is as follows;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old xbox 360 arcade with a 60GB HDD. I wanted to transfer the data from that HDD onto my new xbox 360 slim with 350GB HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>By using the transfer cable, the system did not prompt me to transfer the data over. I then made the mistake to go into my system settings and formatt my 60GB HDD and deleted all the content on my HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my haste I found a program called FATXplorer which allowed me to restore all my saved Game data onto my laptop computer. It is now currently in a folder on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the process somehow the security sector for my 60GB HDD has been deleted and the HDD is no longer recognised by my xbox 360 arcade. It is still recognised by Xbox 360 slim, but only as an unformatted memory unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I formatt it, it is recognised as an external memory unit, however this in tern wipes the 60GB HDD, back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restore previous version of the 60GB HDD using FATXplorer and install a 60GB security sector .BIN file, the Hardrive is theoretically restored to its original version. Bt is still only recognised as unformatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made my peace that my 60GB HDD is most likely scrap at this point. However I still have all the important saved game data! Can someone please, please. Just tell me how I can get this data from my laptop onto my Xbox 360 Slim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not concerned about map packs etc. I just want the saved game data from my youth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever advice is helpful at this stage. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            Xbox data is not meant to be seen by a PC and transferred between the two. There is no legit way of moving it back to a hard drive so it can be seen by the Xbox.&nbsp;

<h2>            Google chrome will not finish downloading</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I have attempted several times to download google chrome. It will not go past the downloading phase. I have even left it downloading for 2 days. At one point I had chromium, however that is not what I wanted. I have installed and uninstalled several times.
 This past attempt I trouble shooted the start up file for google chrome and it gave me incompatible. I have windows 10. One of my online courses&nbsp;I am currently enrolled in requests that I use google chrome, so I would very much like to download it. I have
 read through several blogs and attempted several methods with the same "forever downloading" outcome.

<h2>            Imperial luck, is it worth it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm thinking about making an imperial character, just wondering if the Imperial luck racial trait is actually worth it? do you really get a lot more gold? I've looked on the elder scrolls wiki/uesp.net and did a google search and i can't seem any infomation
 about it :(. can anyone shed any light? thanks.</p>

<p>Gold comes in at a faster rate. Anywhere you find gold in bodies and loot, it can be double what it normally is.</p>
<p>It's a nice perk to have, but if you're choosing based on race perks, you have to decide if that works for you.</p>
<p>I may go that way with my next character, as the race perks don't really sell for me, except for the Khajiit.</p>

<p>I think being an imperial is great for 1st characters &amp; 1st time players as they are balanced in the 3 basic stats health magic &amp; stamina you can basically choose what you like playing as for example you can be an archer or a Mage &amp; then choose a new race
 character later after you've had a run around with an imperial for example if you like being an archer your next character could be a wood elf &nbsp;who are best at archery as for imperial luck I've noticed it is better for doubling the gold you find with my high
 elf character I've had to raid more places to get the gold I needed </p>

<p>I highly doubt it's worth it, but I personally choose what I want, regardless of the racial bonuses. A little more gold compared to 25% Magic Resistance? 50% Frost or Fire? If you're into actively using abilities, the Orc's Berserk?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I always play a Khajiit and their Claws and Nighteye is pretty pointless compared to those resistances, but you might as well just pick what you feel like playing : )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My best advice for the whole imperial luck thing would be to take ^^^ into consideration and one thing I'll add. Imperial Luck may be more useful in the beginning of the game when you need to build up some money for buying/building homes and for&nbsp;weapons,
 armor and stuff that you can't make since you haven't gotten your perks built up yet. But after you've gotten your character leveled up decently and have amassed some wealth, you'll probably&nbsp;have more money than you can spend and Imperial Luck won't be of
 much use at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is (for me) I wouldn't make it&nbsp;the deciding factor on whether I chose to be an Imperial or not.</p>

<p>It depends on how you want to play your game. &nbsp;If you're more of a explorer and looter after you beat the main campain than sure. But if you want to complete many more quests the game offers it will require a lot of combat. &nbsp;I always go with the Khajit because
 their hand to hand combat skills level up insanely. </p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. I read somewhere that if you go under network settings, &nbsp;you can choose to "go offline". While offline you can delete the current save, replay up to seq 3 and the achievement should unlock. Then delete that save and go back online.
 Apparently the cloud will then restore your original one. I would backup the save on a usb just incase before deleting anything. It's worth a shot.</p>

<p>it worked!</p>
<p>you have to </p>
<p>1 turn of internet connection or go offline</p>
<p>2 delete the file saved on the hard drive</p>
<p>3 play up to and finish all of sequence 3</p>
<p>4 shut down game and delete current save file from hard drive</p>
<p>(there should be no file saved at all now on drive)</p>
<p>5 reconnect to internet and launch game</p>
<p>achievement should be there as well as ur old file from the cloud</p>
<p>thats what i just did and after months i am finished this game</p>

<h2>            Updates have stopped my touchscreen, speakers and cameras working - Asus T200TA</h2>
                    <p>As the title states some updates installed today (06-Jan-2017)&nbsp;that have stopped&nbsp;the touch screen, speakers and cameras&nbsp;working on my Asus T200TA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am rather a novice at these things but have tried looking through previous posts and have followed quite a few of the suggested fixes but nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They all aren't showing up in the list of&nbsp;devices so I followed some instructions to show hidden devices. This allowed me to see&nbsp;them and I tried updating the drivers but it shows they are up to date. What it also shows is that as far as it is concerned
 there is now&nbsp;none of these devices connected. I have tried detaching and reattaching the screen to the keyboard but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do next, can anyone help me get them working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the above methods, although I don't want to uninstall the drivers as I don't know where I can get them from in order to reinstall them. Also I now&nbsp;don't&nbsp;see how&nbsp;it can be the drivers at fault, it happened after some updates installed
 and has also stopped the speakers and cameras&nbsp;working and they&nbsp;all show as not being installed. So basically everything that is part of the tablet/screen is now no longer working or showing as connected, it can't be a coincidence this happened straight after
 Windows installed updates. Now without the keyboard attached it is totally useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what do I do now?</p>

            <p>I used MS update and after my touchsceen stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the advice of deleting my touchsceen driver and when i restarted my Thinkpad it did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only solved the problem by "refreshing" my computer, which was a big hassle, as the updates didn't want to install at first and took hours of help by online assistance. Plus I had to reinstall my extra software and update that (even MS office had to be
 reloaded). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now 2 days later, another MS update has again killed my touchscreen, and I think MS windows sucks so bad I don't know what to do again. This is BS that I have to spend hours and hours just to have my computer work properly, its all MS fault! Do I get paid
 or any compensation for this BS? **** no. I have to suffer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS expects me to have to deal with their bad programming, like i'm on their payroll?<br />

            <p>Thanks again for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I don't have a copy of the driver(s) to be able to reinstall them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm echoing the reply above but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You still seem to be suggesting it is a problem with the drivers, I don't see how all of a sudden all of the drivers for everything on my tablet/screen have just stopped working and need to be reinstalled?! It was a windows update of some sort that caused
 this problem yet I'm having to spend my time fixing it. I'm obviously not the only person this has affected and whilst I appreciate your suggestions it isn't solving the problem. The system isn't recognising that the hardware is attached, a driver update of
 the hardware that the system does think is there isn't going to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole 'Microsoft experience' is showing me first hand why Apple are doing so well. I bought my laptop direct from the Microsoft online store thinking that was the safest way to avoid problems and make sure the included Windows 10 update worked as it
 should. Needless to say seeing as I've posted this in Windows 8.1 that never happened despite days and days&nbsp;of attempting the massive download over and over again to try to install it over and over again only for it to fail every time. I sought assistance
 from the 'online Microsoft team' and they also failed to&nbsp;update me to Windows 10. What they did succeed in doing was stopping my keyboard working which they eventually managed a dirty fix for by sticking a script on my desktop, nice.&nbsp;So I gave up and stuck
 with Windows 8 thinking at least it's likely to be less buggy, and now this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a total joke that Microsoft can screw something up with their own system updates that they then expect&nbsp;us&nbsp;to spend our time fixing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what next?!</p>

<p>So with no help from Microsoft I have finally found a solution to this problem, thanks to an obscure youtube video by Lowyat LCD titled 'Asus transformer T200 T200TA touch not working after update windows 10'</p>
<p>
</p><div>https://youtu.be/x9ZT7ON05aU</div>
<p>
</p><p>Took me just a bit longer than the 3:51 of the video to sort the problem that Microsoft updates caused but they could not fix with hours on the phone and even remotely taking control! No faith left in Microsoft products or services I think it will have to
 be Android or Apple from this point forward!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 upgrade from Windows 8 upgrade fails. Error&#58; 0x080070004</h2>
                    I went to the windows store and saw there was a windows update, so I clicked on it and didn't think one bit about backing up my computer first. So during the reboot part I guess my laptop died and once I plugged it in, it restored older version (Windows
 8) it logged me in to a temporary profile, ever since then I can't log into my local account or my Microsoft one. This is very vital to me considering I am a MLG (Major League Gamer) Please help as soon as possible I would like this problem resolved. All of
 my apps and everything is gone off of my homescreen, except for things that have been downloaded, when I bring up the charms to search, everything downloaded is still there, question is. How do I retrieve it? And get my old accounts back?
