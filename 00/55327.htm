<h2>            Windows 10 Pro deactivated itself after updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello. After updating windows to the latest version, my copy of Windows 10 Pro has deactivated itself.
</p>
<p>Before the update, this problem did not occur, and it was activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not "already used on another device" because this IS the device i used it on. This key was bought and did not come preinstalled.</p>

            <p>HI Bret</p>
<p>I am sorry its not working for you.</p>
<p>As luck would have it I have just rebuilt my laptop with a fresh w8.1pro install and installed the scanner. &nbsp;I cannot remember the exact details of how I installed the drivers. &nbsp;I think it was just a case of installing the drivers and I think I had the scanner
 plugged in and turned on when I did it from memory.</p>
<p>Here are some screen shots showing it installed and operational in Device manager, the driver file details as installed and the Details of the driver package I used.</p>
<p>I also got OneTouch 4.6 installed hoping I could scan to Evernote. Whilst OneTouch will scan to the defaults I havent got it scanning to Evernote yet.</p>
<p>Hope something here helps you.</p>

 tag

<h2>            &#91;LOCKED&#93; Open Petition to allow gamers to delete games WITH Gamerscore from their profile</h2>
                    
<p><span><i>I cant find my last forum post in this forum telling me it was removed for some reason without cause, well I am re-posting.</i><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attn: Microsoft and Xbox Live Community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am posting this as an open petition to grant gamers over xbox live the ability to delete games and gamerscore form their profile.<br />
Of all the forums I have searched through and all the inquiries about this issue all I was able to find was there is no way to do this and any previous exploit was quickly patched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't say much on the forums or complain too much, minus my rant on the Borderlands GOTY codes, btw good job Gearbox and 2K you listened and the community has never thanked you enough for listening, but I think this issue needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know Microsoft is able to do this, I haven't found anything software related yet that they have not been able to do when it comes to xbox live.</p>
<p>Now the question comes why would anyone want to delete gamerscore and why should Microsoft do so or even care?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well lets first go to why would anyone want to delete it,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>The first reason is embarrassment</b></span>, I cant name enough people whose kids (hopefully daughters) have planted games like Hanna Montana on their tags and with the practice of baiting achievements (another
 subject I will elaborate on later) an achievement popped for something as simple as pressing start and they are now stuck with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only see the moderators chucking of "Well this person should not have allowed their kids to touch their xbox" , or something like that. For those of you who don't have kids I will let you in on a secret, that is damn near impossible to do, try it when
 you decide to have kids and see how far it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>The second reason is inability to gain achievements due to absolutely ridiculous requirements.</b></span></p>
<p>I think there are a million examples of this but I will point out a few that range from launch to today:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (2006): Reach the top of the leaderboard aka World Champion<br />
I don't know if anyone is aware of this yet but there are loads of leaderboard cheats and boosters who see to it this game is impossible to complete among others before and after the community convinced Ubisoft to reset the leaderboard. This make it nearly
 impossible for those who play the game correctly and those with skill to gain this achievement. So far the usual response to this was "this game was created when the idea of achievements was new and mistakes were made", this will lead me on to another title
 that is not as old and a little more recent....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lost Planet 2 (2010): Number One on the leaderboard aka Committed Til the End<br />
Once again, impossible due to cheaters and boosters. Next usual response was "Please contact the developers to sort this issue out and to patch the game and remove cheaters." Well I have been pestering Capcom at least once a month on this issue and told them
 they would have a new customer in me if they sorted this out along with posts from hundreds of other users asking for the same thing only to realize they don't care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock (2007): Co-op career on expert: Living Legends<br />
This achievement requires two people on the same console at the same location to complete co-op on expert. Well gee do you know of anyone willing to spend all the time over at your house playing a plastic guitar well enough to complete expert let alone only
 for the benefit of one of the two gamers, I think not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NBA Live 07 (2006): 1000 people online<br />
Ok seriously, earning an achievement depends on wether or not other people are playing it! That is not an achievement or a test of skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>College Hoops 2k7 (2006): Congenial Award<br />
Ok this one requires a feedback rating of 85% or higher, ok really, really, REALLY! When I shotgun or chainsaw people on Gears people usually give me negative feedback in spite, not because I was up to any wrong doing. I don't play online to be popular, I play
 online to win, and people give negative feedback out of spite.<br />
I can already hear more chucking of “Well you should have done your research”, Hmmm, encouraging customers to do research before purchasing, great idea for us, bad for business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>The third reason is glitched achievements</b></span> that have never been obtainable and have not and are not likely to be patched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia (2007)<br />
Not only is this game ungodly horrible Microsoft should have never allowed a license to be granted for this piece of crap but that is another story for another day. There are two achievements that are unobtainable and people from all over the community have
 asked for this to be patched only to fall on deaf ears of those who can do anything and listening to forum moderators say they are looking into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fall into the embarrassment category on this, a friends kid decided to stick this on mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arcania: Gothic 4 (2010)<br />
The Master Chef and Geeks achievement have never been able to be obtained and the developers just do not care about thier customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Army of Two: The 40th Day (2010)<br />
The if the online achievements are awarded then the DLC achievements are unobtainable and affect and count against the gamers completion percentage. People have had to come up with ridiculous workarounds to be able to obtain the full gamerscore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>The fourth reason is online inactivity and server closures making achievements no longer possible.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can give examples for this too but lets just say all EA and 2K yearly sports games are culprits on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online versus achievements should never be allowed for it ruins the online experience. With EA and 2K and so on they decide to make online achievements and then close their servers making those who never know about it feel cheated when they realize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also denied an achievement due to EA’s servers not recognizing my gamertag when I was not able to upload a roster. The response was that if I ever changed it then I can never get the achievement. The worst part of this is that when this error was identified
 this same achievement came out again on later titles, talk about a lack of customer support here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only hear the chuckles of the developers saying “Well you should have bought it new, then you would worry have to worry about it”, I say this $60 for the same damn game every year is a rip-off and I am socked that people buy into it. Most people also
 don’t have the money to spend every year on top of the fact that a lot of sports games still have unobtainable achievements that they never cared to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that if you don't want to keep your servers running due to inactivity you should not make any online achievements, PERIOD! Microsoft should enforce this with any company that opts out of their offer to host.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can go on for days about bad achievements but I hope that I made the point on why people want to delete games off their record. I personally feel cheated when any of the above reasons happen and am unable to do anything about it. It puts a sour taste in
 my mouth and I wish to show it by removing myself from the statistics. I would also hate to lose sight on this lengthy rant too, on to the next issue, Why should Microsoft do this and why should they care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost Microsoft created the achievement system and all achievements are stored via Xbox Live, not on the developers servers. So yes, this is in Microsofts full control to grant the delete ability, if you think I am pointing fingers in the wrong
 direction here please correct me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, since there was enough trouble about the 0GS issue and that issue being resolved why not grant people the ability to delete gamerscore along with it. I hate to burst anyones bubble here but most games stick an achievement on your for something as
 stupid as pressing start, yes it is true, look at the Simpsons game for proof. I see something shady here, do you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shows that most developers bait people in knowing that this game will be stuck on their tag and use this practice out of ill will to try and keep people playing a crappy game, not the Simpsons, I am just pointing the issue out here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, this has been something that gamers over Xbox Live have wanted for sometime now. It’s a little hard to show since the website changes and all old posts archived but its there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft is able to do things like bring motion gaming to the Xbox via the Kinect, then granting gamers the ability to delete gamerscore should be no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years I have seen open requests from Microsoft to give feedback and how they can improve upon the community. Well heres an answer for you, Grant people the ability to delete gamerscore off their profile. This would be much appreciated and I’m sure there
 are thousands if not millions of gamers who would thank you for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you ask what is my motive behind this? Simple I want Monster Madness and Guitar Hero III off my gamertag, these games are horrible and it is embarrassing to even admit to playing. I also believe what frustrates me also frustrates thousands if not millions
 of other gamers out there. Like the old saying goes,”If you don’t have enough gum for the rest of the class don’t bring it!”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not perfect, I have made many mistakes when it comes to what games I have put in my Xbox, If I knew then what I know now things would be different. Man how many times I have heard that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a rant against Microsoft or anyone else I would just like to have the ability to delete gamerscore off my profile and have everyone else in the community able to do so too. This would make my experience over Xbox Live much better, and please
 nothing foolish here, just deletion, not anything saying I deleted it or so on or so forth, just a complete deletion like it never happened and there is no record of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for listening, and please post your support here for I am sure you all would like to see this issue resolved too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you can just use the words of the great Sone Cold Steve Austin and give me a HELL YEAH!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to change the default location of the document to be saved. It is the same way you save it on your desktop. There is no other way in Surface pro 3 to for saving the file. Here are the steps for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Select the item to print.</li><li>Select Microsoft XPS Document writer.</li><li>Now click on save as.</li><li>Click on Browse option to save the file at the location where you want to save it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you are facing any issue then check if there is some system file corruption or user profile corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run<strong> SFC scan
</strong>to check system health and see what it detects.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The <strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker</strong>) command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span>We can check &amp; repair missing and corrupted files by following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and open <strong>
Accessories</strong>.</li><li>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the Program list and then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: </li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>To check profile corruption try to create <strong>new user&nbsp;profile </strong>and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic

            Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; Since I wrote this issue I have updated to Windows 10, but still have the same problem.&nbsp; When I attempt to print to Microsoft XPS Document Writer there is not an option to
<strong>Save As</strong> anywhere in that dialog, which is the problem I have had all along.&nbsp; I attempted to navigate to the command prompt, but am unable to find it on Windows 10.

<h2>            XBOX&#58; Teredo is unable to qualify</h2>
                    <p>I am wanting to talk to my friends via the XBOX app on a Windows PC. However, when I join a party I am instantly disconnected and redirected to Network in Settings. Here it tells me my Teredo is unable to qualify and is restricting multiplayer features.
 I have looked around at tutorials and other posts but none of them have helped me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked in my device manager, under Network Adapters, nothing. And I have tried reinstalling it using device manager and 'Add Legacy Hardware' however it doesn't show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>

<p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The <strong>Teredo is unable to qualify</strong> error means that <span>your PC is unable to obtain a Teredo IP address.
</span><span>Failure to obtain a Teredo IP address can occur when there’s an issue with your Teredo adapter, when a device on your network is blocking the Teredo protocol or if there’s software installed on your PC that’s disabling Teredo functionality. Without
 a Teredo IP address, you’ll be unable to use party chat or do multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live.</span></p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the router we have installed does not support IPv6, which seems to be the problem. However I can connect to games and parties perfectly fine on my XBOX (Console), the problem i'm having is on the XBOX App on Windows 10. Am I wrong or doesn't
 XBOX (Console) use IPv6 to connect to parties anyway?</p>
<p>Or is there a way to use IPv4 on Windows 10 XBOX App?</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. To set a Static IP address and DNS settings on your PC, you are required to use
<strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4). </strong>It is okay if the router does not support IPv6. We would like to verify if you were able to perform the provided solutions on the links that we gave you above.

<h2>            Toshiba logo not showing and showing No Bootable Device error</h2>
                    I tried starting up my Toshiba laptop, and it did not show the Toshiba logo, followed with the "No bootable device -- please restart system" error. I can't go to my setup menu; tried already with F2 and F12, and it didn't work, still giving me that error.
 I don't have any RAM in my computer, so I can't reseat it. Tried removing batteries and whatnot already. I have the Toshiba recovery disk, and I want to use it if possible.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did not get the Toshiba Splash Screen Logo at Boot, your problems are normally to do with Hardware.</p>
<p>And if you do not have RAM in your machine, it won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>It freezes when i play it but it works but it takes ages to load, and when i play a match the teams are like mersey ride red for liverpool, looked up youtube and saw that you can patch it manually, is that aloud or is it classed as modding the game since
 they havent got licenses for the teams. only for manchester untied in the english league</p>

<p><em>That's your choice of course, but I wanted to warn you of the possible repercussions.<br />

In my experience any patches for a game are downloaded automatically when you go on LIVE with a game, not from the marketplace. So this would make me think this patch is not legitimate and it would be classed as modding.</em></p>

                    <p>Version Skype 12.1815.210.0</p>
<p>HP Envy x360 Convertible 15-bq1xx</p>
<p>Product ID 00325-95800-00000-AAOEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype starts up</p>
<p>I make a call and then a few minutes into the call I get a white screen and loud buzzing sound as the device crashes. I have to reset my device by either holding the power button down or pull the battery.</p>
<p>I have reached out to HP support and turned off all applications that have access to the camera as per their suggestion but still no luck.</p>
<p>PS its not just this laptop specifically as I had the same issue with a previous HP and exchanged it for the same model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Verify access to a directory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lrodgers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Verify access to a directory</h2>
                    <p>Since I downloaded Windows 10 every time I try to update a program I downloaded it tells me there was an Error and says "Verify that you have access to that directory". I tried to re-install the program by downloading it again and it tells me the same thing!
 I don't understand. I'm the only one who uses this computer and it's my personal one, I should have access to every part of it. I am set as the administrator in settings and I don't know what else to do. It says specifically "Error writing file to: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Proclaim\System\en-US\proclaimexe.mui.</p>
<p>I have tried following the path above, but I can't find the folder it is talking about because there is no "AppData" folder in "Owner". I'm so confused and don't know what else to try. Proclaim is the name of the program I am trying to update that worked
 fine before I got windows 10.</p>

            thank you! I wasn't able to unregister or re-register, an error would pop up with what you had given to type. But I was able to show the hidden files so I tried uninstalling the program - which worked and then I re-installed it from online and now I have
 the updated version of the program. Thank you!!!

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since you want to downgrade to Windows 7 to meet the business requirement, you may refer this article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en/licensing/sblicensing/pages/downgrade_rights.aspx#fbid=zlOxZGpp1k1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Understanding downgrade rights</strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Consumer versions of Windows 8 Pro that come preinstalled on PCs have downgrade rights to a previous version of Windows (example: Windows 7, Windows Vista).<span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If your copy came pre-installed on your system, you may downgrade your copy to Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If not you need purchase a copy of Windows 7 and install the same on your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>• Downgrade rights are only available for licenses obtained through OEM or Volume Licensing (VL) and not apply to Full version (FPP).</span></p>
<p><span>• OEM downgrade rights apply to Windows 8 Pro and allows for downgrades up to two prior version</span></p>
<p><span>• Software Assurance through VL (Volume licensing) provides the greatest flexibility, allowing for downgrades to all prior versions and editions besides Windows 7 Ultimate and Vista Ultimate editions.<span>
</span>Without Software Assurance coverage, VL has downgrade rights to prior versions of Windows with the exception of Enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span>• It is not possible for a Windows 8 copy with multi-language function to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Windows XP Pro as multi language function is exclusive to Windows 7 Enterprise edition and not available for Professional edition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

            <p>If you don't have Windows 8 Pro, there are no downgrade rights unless you buy the downgrade yourself, and even then it may not run through lack of support for an OLD operating system..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your issues are navigating around, you can do this.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use an alternative start menu.. </p>

<p>They make a huge difference to usability, trust me. I use one myself and would be back with Windows 7 were it not for Start8. Now, I have the best of both worlds. I can still get stuff done, and can have a play with the 'other' side now and again..

<p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

    <title>Single Skype ID Cannot Receive Messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> passrusher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Single Skype ID Cannot Receive Messages</h2>
                    <p>My young daughter has Skype that we allow her to use to contact us and our immediate family. It has worked great for several years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here lately, if we send a message to her, she will never receive the message. If she sends one to us, we get it but she doesn't get our reply. We can initiate and answer a call to/from her just fine. It is just messaging that isn't working.</p>
<p>This is on an Android device. I will try her Windows Device and see if the problem is there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But wondering if anyone else has encountered this.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just to further investigate, what is the version of Skype running on her Android device? Does she already tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. <br />
Thank you!<br />

            I understand that you use <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-fax-and-scan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Fax and Scan</a> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwelie.com%2fcss%2foutgoing-google.gif" /> , am I right?<br />
<br />
There is an option to Forward as E-mail, but it won't be working until you install Email program and set it as a default. You can install
<a href="http://download.live.com/wlmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Live Mail</a> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwelie.com%2fcss%2foutgoing-google.gif" /> , if you don't have it already. After that you need to set it as a default: press
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Default Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Set program access and computer defaults</strong> &gt; expand
<strong>Custom</strong> &gt; find <strong>Choose a default e-mail program</strong> &gt; select
<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Or you can use your webmail application as Lanista suggested.<br />

<h2>            Need to create separate themes with different images. Having trouble creating and editing separate themes.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>The theme creation option is odd to me. There is no specific option to create a theme but if you modify any theme that exists, a new theme is automatically created. This is a problem because
 any time I just want to edit a theme and then save it, I end up creating a new one. If I delete images in one theme, it deletes them from all other custom themes. If I add images to one theme, they get added to all other custom themes. It seems like this problem
 was created by someone thinking they were smarter than they actually were. It should be pretty simple: click "create a theme" &gt; name the first theme &gt; add images to theme &gt; save first theme &gt; click "create a theme" &gt; name the second theme &gt; add different images
 to second theme &gt; save second theme &gt; now you have two separate themes. Obviously it doesn't work this way. I just need explicit directions on how to do these things (or something close to these):</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Create two themes</span></p>
<p><span>2. Be able to delete or add images to either without affecting the other</span></p>
<p><span>3. Be able to edit a theme without a new theme being created as a result</span></p>

<span>Welcome to Windows 7 Forums</span><br />
<span>Creating a Theme File</span>
&nbsp;
<p><span>A .theme file enables you to change the appearance of certain desktop elements. You can create or modify a .theme file in two ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Modify personalization or display settings in Control Panel and save the settings as a .theme file. See your Windows Help for instructions.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Create a .theme file manually for a greater level of control over the details of your theme.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>To make your theme available to other users, you must supply your .theme file, as well as the background picture, screen saver, and icons files. You
 can do this with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773190(VS.85).aspx#theme_pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>theme pack</span></span></a>.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Personalization by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>. In the search
 box, type </span></span><span><span><strong>personalization</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 and then click </span></span><span><span><strong>Personalization</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the theme that you want to change to apply it to your desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do one or more of the following:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To change the background, click
<span><strong>Desktop Background</strong></span>, select the check box for the image that you want to use, and then click
<span><strong>Save changes</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To change the color of window borders, click
<span><strong>Window Color</strong></span>, click the color that you want to use, adjust the intensity, and then click
<span><strong>Save changes</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To change the sounds for the theme, click
<span><strong>Sounds</strong></span>, click an item in the <span>
<strong>Sound Schemes</strong></span> list, and then click <span>
<strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To add or change a screen saver, click
<span><strong>Screen Saver</strong></span>, click an item in the
<span><strong>Screen saver</strong></span> list, change any settings that you want to change, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>How to create a theme pack?
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Making a theme pack is basically a simple task when compared to theme, as you are not using any resource hacking programs and other utilities.
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Procedure: </span>
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>1. Right-click on Desktop, select Properties. Here you will see many default theme packs. In the same window, you will get all the options that are required to customize and create a theme pack
 in Windows 7. </span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>2. Now you need to customize all the items that you want to change in your new theme pack.
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>3. Select Desktop Background option and select multiple wallpapers if you like to have slideshow feature in your new theme pack (Refer “Create Slideshow” guide to know more about it).</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>4.Just input the wallpaper folder you want to use by hitting the browse button on the right and navigating to the folder. Also don’t forget to customize the slideshow time interval. To change
 this, click on “Change picture every” option at the bottom of the window</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>5. Finally, modify the color of the theme to suite the wallpaper of the theme pack. Just make sure that you select a color which looks good with all the wallpapers in the slideshow feature. To
 modify the color, Right-click on Desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Window Color and customize the color so that it matches with the wallpaper/s that you have included in this theme pack</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>How to install a theme pack:
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>* Open the location of the theme pack.
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>* Double-click on the .themepack file.
</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Note that you can see all the installed theme packs in the Customize window. So, you need not to browse for the theme pack file to use it again.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<p>The ads in the start menu are there because windows 10 is trying to be more user friendly by showing new apps and features for the software and MSN is Internet explorer's default homepage. Sometimes when installing new software so settings are reset to factory
 standard. I'm sorry that you find Windows 10 as an bad OS if your computer had a different OS you can revert back to the OS that came with the computer.</p>

            <p>Being a laptop I'm not sure what you can do. Although depending on your skill level you could still remove the DVD drive. There is usually a screw mount on the base, once removed the drive will slide out. Then you could try what john suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought. Power down and remove the power lead and battery. Wait a while and then reconnect and see if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason I can think of why downloading and installing WINRAR would affect the DVD drive.</p>

<p>Being a laptop I'm not sure what you can do. Although depending on your skill level you could still remove the DVD drive. There is usually a screw mount on the base, once removed the drive will slide out. Then you could try what john suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought. Power down and remove the power lead and battery. Wait a while and then reconnect and see if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason I can think of why downloading and installing WINRAR would affect the DVD drive.</p>

<p>no that didn't work either&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm planning to buy myself my own Xbox 360 this next summer. I have a dresser with my TV and DirecTV box on it. There is a little room for an xbox. Is it a good idea to put the xbox 360 on my dresser next to my TV?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As long as your console has enough room to breathe so to say then everything should be all good. You want to make sure you're putting your Xbox 360 and the power supply in an area that isn't cluttered or blocking any sort of hot air from leaving the console.<br />
<br />
Feel free to look through the initial setup guide for the Xbox 360 found <strong>
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/console-setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>, it might have some more useful information for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make sure it has enough room for the fan to vent,isn't on a place that it could fall from or you could trip over the cord and &nbsp;in a place where the kinect can sense you if you get that kind. if your cables run behind the dresser that should be ok..you really
 want to make sure it will not fall easily.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 user changes their AD domain password, and that breaks VPN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark russell fcsg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 user changes their AD domain password, and that breaks VPN settings</h2>
                    <p>A customer using the built-in VPN, configured to SSTP version, using Windows 10 is&nbsp; affected by a repeatable issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time the user changes their domain password, and like many organizations they are required to change their password frequently, the VPN settings for their SSTP connection to the corporate network is changed to use invalid settings.</p>
<p>I can't imagine why a user changing their domain password (while obviously logged on with that account) has their VPN connection changed, but since it is very repeatable and part of standard process to re-setup the VPN connection's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a user changes their domain password, if they examine their VPN connection's settings, the Security tab has a radio button (by definition, one of the two choices must be made) that shows NO selection being made on that screen.&nbsp; Normally, the user must
 select the "Allow these protocols" option as opposed to the "Use Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)" selection.&nbsp; This choice is required for their configuration to work, but it is "reset" to a screen showing that neither selection has been made -- an
 invalid selection for the user to make, but it is reset when they change their password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to know if this new feature, which appears to be part of Windows 10 version 1703 is fixed in version 1709 or a subsequent patch/update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
