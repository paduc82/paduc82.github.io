            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
In the future please ZIP or RAR the files all together so we can download them all at once.<br />

atikmpag.sys dated 9/8/2011 ATI video drivers. Check for updated drivers and it may<br />
be necessary to revert back to an older version. <br />

<strong>Have you checked with ATI Support and asked in their forums?</strong> Could be the video

card has a hardware issue or there are other hardware issues. The regularlity of the BSOD<br />
seems to indicate some sort of setting as a cause. Also check with Intel Support as there<br />

Check the Wake On settings in the BIOS as those might be triggering the event.<br />
<br />
Check the&nbsp;Settings in Control Panel - Power Options.<br />
<br />
Check with MyEventViewer to see if something is happening a second or so before the<br />
time of the BSOD (see troubleshooter above).<br />

Possibly something in the StartUp is causing the issue :<br />

<h2>            Cannot download GTA V, tried everything.</h2>
                    <p>I have owned GTA V on disc for 2-3 years. I have deleted and re-installed the game a lot for storage purposes and it always downloaded back fine. However a few months ago I deleted it for storage and then have had a problem in the last month with getting it back. When I attempt to download the disc it says ‘installation stopped’ always around 2GB into the download. I have tried everything, I have cleared local saved games, I’ve tried downloading it offline, deleting my account and even resetting my Xbox to factory settings and it still didn’t work. I went through all the troubleshooting to fix it which has worked with other games before but it hasn’t worked. I have also done all of this with my friends disc and it does the same with his so I know it isn’t my disc (both our discs are clean and in good condition). I can also still download other discs so I know it isn’t my Xbox. I’ve contacted Xbox support and when it didn’t work they said try contact Rockstar to help an

<h2>            Error message when trying to add WMV file stating that it is corrupt and needs to be deleted</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Problem with video files in Movie Maker</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows Movie Maker 2012 on a Windows 8 computer. I uploaded several .wmv files to the program and they played fine in the preview screen. After organizing the files and saving the project I then tried to upload additional .wmv video files to the
 project. These files showed up with an error code saying the files were corrupted and had to be deleted. So I deleted these files, but then when I went back to play the first files that were saved and had played previously it also told me those were corrupt
 and had to be deleted. Now whenever I upload a .wmv file it will start to play in the preview window and then stop and give me the message that it is a corrupt file that needs to be deleted. Please help me fix this problem. Thanks.</p>

            You have effectively limit the system to using so little memory it cant load windows.&nbsp; You need to boot either in safe mode0 or from the win 10 ISO and launch a commend prompt.&nbsp; Type msconfig into it and remove the check mark from max memory.&nbsp; If you also
 checked max CPU you are stuffed and will have to reinstall windows.

    <title>Why won&#39;t Windows Live Movie Maker import a .wmv file I just - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jthoward  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why won&#39;t Windows Live Movie Maker import a .wmv file I just created&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a .wmv file with Windows Live Movie Maker and tried to add that .wmv file into a different project.&nbsp; It displays the frame with an exclamation mark in the middle.&nbsp; When I click on it, it says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Do you want to remove "Intro.wmv" from the project?<br />
The file might be corrupted or in a format that Movie Maker doesn't recognize.<br />
This movie can't be saved or published until Intro.wmv is removed from the project.<br />
Error: 0x87260103"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried saving it with various display settings and&nbsp;sizes, yet it always says the same thing when I try to add it to a different project.&nbsp; I can add .mp4 files from my phone just fine.&nbsp; I thought it might be a Codec problem, but how can that be, if I'm
 using the EXACT SAME program that I just saved it with?</p>

            <p>Correction...&nbsp; I can add SOME .mp4 files, but not all that I used to.&nbsp; This sucks.&nbsp; I was using Win 7 and decided to upgrade to Win 8 less than a month ago.&nbsp; Before I "UPGRADED" I could play DVD's and view just about ANY media file&nbsp;with Windows Media Player...&nbsp;
 I could import ALL of my .mp4 and .wmv files in Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp; Now that "UPGRADED" I can no longer play DVD's, Media Player won't play several of my .mp4 files, and the NEW Live Movie Maker won't correctly import .wmv files that IT CREATES nor .mp4
 files that WILL play in Media Player.&nbsp; Feels more like a DOWNGRADE, if you ask me.&nbsp; What a headache!&nbsp; Maybe it's time for me to start learning how to use a Mac?</p>

            Hi&nbsp;JTHoward,
<div><br />
<div>We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This issue can be caused by corrupted codecs, or outdated video driver. To troubleshoot this, please follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p><strong><span>1. Ensure that you have the latest version for Windows Movie Maker</span></strong><span>. You can&nbsp;download the latest
 version </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files.</span><span>&nbsp; Audio
 and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try running the
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Fix It tool for codecs</span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Media info will be able to identify the codec required for your audio and video files, and will provide a link to the website for the required codec</span><span>.
 You can get it </span><a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><i><span>Note</span></i></strong><em><span>: If you can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported
 format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Movie Maker project.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3.&nbsp;Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date.</span></strong><span> Movie Maker makes extensive use of the
 video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with various software.
<br />
<br />
To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;<span>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>dxdiag</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the Start screen, then
 press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>key on the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;Click on the <strong><span>Display</span></strong> tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

    <title>Mail App - You&#39;ve Already Added This Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynejvm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail App - You&#39;ve Already Added This Account</h2>
                    <p>I set up my Mail App on Windows 8.1 with multiple emails. All were working flawlessly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, while upgrading an Active Sync server as part of the trouble shooting process, I deleted the account and when I went to re-install it I received the error message "You've Already Added This Account."
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While technically true, I also deleted that account. For some reason the Windows 8.1 Mail App will not allow me to add an account that had previously been deleted.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So how do I correct this problem? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Ok... I've uninstalled and re-installed. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once re-installed the App brings back every email account that I ever had - which solves my problem after a fashion.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, It sure would be nice to be able to add a deleted email account without having to reinstall the app.</p>

            <p>Looks like you MUST remove the account from all synced devices. Otherwise, the system will not let you restore the email account without uninstalling, reinstalling, then if you need to make changes removing the account from all synced devices followed by
 adding the account back in with the new settings.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Quite a bit of work to go through if you've made the mistake of only deleting the account from the computer.</p>

<p>Hi Hidayet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intermittent wireless connection that you experienced could be caused by devices running on the same frequency as your Windows 10 mobile hotspot which interfere with your wireless connection. Since we don't have any option to modify the wireless channel
 of your mobile hotspot, what you can try is to move your PC on a different location to isolate the problem. If you have other wireless device other than your phone, try connecting it to the same hotspot and see if you experience the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to let us know if you need further help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p><span><br />
Computer: Acer Aspire 6930G running Vista Home premium V6.0 SP2 32bit<br />
<br />
This issue appeared to occur after installing SP2 and TOM TOM One Software.<br />
There are no warning triangle messages in Device manager.<br />
All USBSTOR.INF drivers appear to be there in c:\Windows\INF.<br />
System info shows I/O OK for USB and IRQ's OK for USB.<br />
I have since system restored to before SP2 and the TOM TOM software; made no difference.</span></p>
<p><span>There are errors showing with WUDFRD.SYS PnP Problem code 00000000 (version 6.0.6001.18000) and HIDUSB.SYS same problem code and driver version.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Reinstalled SP2, made no difference.</span></strong><span><br />
I have tried deleting INFCACHE.1 numerous times with reboot.<br />
I have unplugged the machine from the mains and removed battery and rebooted.<br />
Completely uninstalled all USB items in Device manager and rebooted.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>I have flashed my Bios, no difference.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Downloaded and installed chipset drivers from ACER.</span></strong></p>

Why has my Laptop decided to be picky about what peripherals is wants to use ??? Please someone have the answer before I completely loose the will to live.

            Hi Rob,<br />
Thanks for your detailed support. I have tried all these solutions and have now set the computer back to factory default. The issue is still there. Acer will be getting there paper weight back!<br />
I shouldnt have to spend hours of my freetime fighting with something that should work out of the box, increasing my stress levels to the point of wanting to kill destroy something.............so it going back in the box. Thanks again but my suggestion to anyone
 with computer problems is if the first fix doesnt work and its still under warranty send it back!!

            This does not work because the Volume choice has a "shut off" symbol and you cannot change anything. The solution appears to be how to change the "shut off" symbol (Sorry, can't come up with the right name for "shut off" symbol!<br />

<h2>            Copying files from a folder using filenames from a text file</h2>
                    <p>I have a folder that contains approx. 17,000 images, I want to copy only those images, whose filenames are listed in a text file. The text file contains approx. 1000 file names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a command that I can use on cmd or power shell to automate this process? Otherwise I will have to manually go through all those 17,000 files and copy the ones that are listed in text file which seems impossible</p>

<p>path C:\Users\Jason\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\TrustedInstaller.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>it appeared in my startup folder less than an hour ago, and my antivirus flagged it. I've never seen this file show up in my startup before, and windows IS waiting to restart for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File version of the item in my startup begins with 8.x. File version in C:\Windows\Servicing is 10.x</p>
<p>
</p><p>File listed above also tried to start C:\VTRoot\HarddiskVolume7\Users\jason\AppData\Local\Temp\dllhost.exe which has only a file size, file type, and modified date (also today) but has no other information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I'm assuming this is not a legit file (which is why I have yet to restart for windows updates) but I need confirmation. Is this a legit windows 10 file?</p>

            the bitcoin miner was the file i removed above, since it didn't actually get to run, there is no mining. I'm guessing it was a drive by ad or something that got in, but couldn't get permission to do any real harm. Whatever it was, it appears to be totally
 gone. I've done several scans with various tools, including rootkit scanners, and other than the files in question, no threats were found.

    <title>Windows 10 Surface Book RDP&#58; Outlook Popup Windows are Empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;jeff2017&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Surface Book RDP&#58; Outlook Popup Windows are Empty</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book (128GB SSD; 8GB RAM; i5-6300 CPU) running Windows 10 1709. Regardless of what computer I use to run MSTSC.EXE to connect to the Surface Book, almost all pop-up windows do not display correctly. In specific, they display the outline
 of the window, but there is no information in the windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has occurred since day 1 with the Surface Book that I acquired in December 2016. It has persisted through several Windows 10 upgrades on both the Surface Book and the client machines that I use to connect to the Surface Book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is most obvious (and annoying) with Outlook 2016. In the picture below, hovering over the "Staff Meeting" calendar item should pop-up a windows with information regarding the meeting--time, location, etc. However, as you can see, the pop-up window's
 outline DOES display, but there is no content. Using Outlook on the Surface Book itself (i.e., not via RDP) works perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled and enabled bitmap caching on RDP, I have turned on and off transparency effects within Windows 10, and I have tried several other things....but nothing works. Can anyone help? Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks! The inversions do not help, and using magnifier would be worse than the symptoms :-)&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm not using HyperV and though I know Win10 has such capabilities on the client end, digesting and acting upon the URL you reference also looks to be painful

<p>My display (not just the Surface--all of my Windows 10 computers) also have an annoying quirk where most of the icons on the Start Menu will go blank periodically. Rebooting fixes this problem for awhile, but I just learned that killing and restarting EXPLORER.EXE
 *also* fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The kill/restart batch file I created (below) also fixes this invisible pop-up problem, so though I would like Microsoft to correct the bugs, I now at least have a workaround for both problems that I can live with.</p>

<h2>            Name of the TV program that will replace Windows Media Center</h2>
                    I heard there is not going to be Windows Media Center for Windows 10. What is the name of the program that will replace Windows Media Center? I love recording TV shows on the computer. Is it going to be the same as Windows Media Center or the features
 is going to be different? Can you guys explain to me in details how this new TV program is going to work?

            For Windows 10, there is no features to recording television shows on the computer. No one on the Forum does not know the name of the program. That is a mystery that we do not know the name of the program that will record TV shows just like Windows Media
 Center.

            Use a third party app like <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MediaPortal</a> or <a href="http://kodi.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Kodi</a> if you are only viewing/recording over-the-air channels. But if you want to watch CableCard copy-protected content (which, in my situation, is every channel. Thanks Time-Warner!)
 the only application that allows that is Windows Media Center. Perhaps something new will emerge like the
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1275320038/hdhomerun-dvr-the-dvr-re-imagined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SiliconDust HDHomeRun DVR</a> combined with <a href="https://plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Plex</a>. Of course, that only works with SiliconDust tuners and will require an annual subscription for guide content.
<p>
</p><p>The alternative is to roll back to your previous version.</p>

            <p>Actually, I have not make a decision whether I want to upgrade my computer or laptop to Windows 10. I read from various sources that Windows Media Center will not be part of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I have a question about MediaPortal and Kodi, if we download one of the programs, can we record television shows on our computer just like Windows Media Center?
<br />
MediPortal and Kodi are the substitute program for Windows Media Center if we decided to upgrade our PC computer to Windows 10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I cannot experiment this on the previous version since I have Windows Media Center. I do not know if any of the Microsoft Community customers who have already upgraded to Windows 10 did download one of the two Media programs and experimented it. I just want
 to hear their thoughts, opinions and feedback on one of the two Media programs. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Photo Viewer Strange behavior - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ezdmanx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photo Viewer Strange behavior</h2>
                    <p>When I search for images in explorer in windows 10 and it lists all the images in a search results folder and I then double click to view one of the images which opens in Windows Photo Viewer, and I start clicking the next (right-arrow) to scroll through
 the search results it only scrolls through the images within the clicked images folder, not all the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example taking the folder structure below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos&nbsp;Folder</p>
<p>____Pics 1&nbsp;Folder</p>
<p>________Image A.jpg</p>
<p>________Image B.jpg</p>
<p>________Image C.jpg</p>
<p>____Pics 2&nbsp;Folder</p>
<p>________Image D.jpg</p>
<p>________Image E.jpg</p>
<p>________Image F.jpg</p>
<p>____Pics 3&nbsp;Folder</p>
<p>________Image G.jpg</p>
<p>________Image H.jpg</p>

<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1 if I searched *.jpg in the "Photos Folder" and clicked on the result "Image D.jpg" I could then right arrow scroll through all of the images (D,E,F,G,H,A,B,C....) in Photo Viewer.<br />
</p>
<p>In Windows 10&nbsp;if I search *.jpg in the "Photos Folder" and click on the result "Image D.jpg" I can then right arrow scroll through just images D,E,H in Photo Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ordering by Date Modified, Name, etc in the Search Results makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I bring the old system back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Office 365 created new skype profile beside one I already have - how to close new account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have skype already for decade and after all that time I finally created my MS account. I purchased my office 365 and installed it.
</p>
<p>after installation I did more work on managing my MS account and linked my SKYPE account to MS account.
</p>
<p>When I checked how it works with login to sekype with MS account credential, there was opened new skype with new skype name like "live: first.second_1". There I have no profile entries I have with my old skype account and no skype contacts.</p>
<p>If I log in with my old skype name I get out my old skype with all contacts and skype name "first.second".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>within logging in with old skype name</p>
<p>- if I check "Manage account" In skype l got linked to my old skype account settings</p>
<p>- if I select on my skype profile / My account /- upper left "skype" /&nbsp; I get directed to new skype page where on upper left side I got my name, my old email and option "change password". If I enter in edit I get linked to my old skype profile/account. All
 ok.</p>
<p>- if I go to my MS account / Your Info / <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile?setlang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Go to your Skype profile, I am linked to my old skype account. </a></p>
<p>- if I go to my MS account/ Products (roll down menu on top),/ selecting software and services, /skype&nbsp; I get directed to new skype page where on upper left side I got my name, my email and option "change password". If enter in edit I get linked to my old
 skype profile/account. All ok.</p>
<p>- If I got to my MS account / services and suscriptions/get more info/ I am linked over back to my old skype account</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>with logging to skype with my MS account credentials - </p>
<p>- I got in to profile with new skype name live:first.second_1</p>
<p>- no contact are there </p>
<p>- if I check "Manage account" In skype&nbsp; l got linked to my new skype account settings</p>
<p>- if I select on my skype profile /- My account /- upper left "skype" /&nbsp; I get directed to new skype page where on upper left side I got my name, my MS account email and option "change password". If I enter in edit I get linked to my new skype profile/account
 with no data.</p>
<p>- if select in skype profile/ My account / "<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/account/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account settings" I got to screen where stated " MS account&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linked "
</a></p>
<p>- if I select&nbsp; in skype profile / My account/, and on top left "Skype" I get to same screen as defined&nbsp; in upper case where I got on left side of screen my name (same as above) , same email , option "change password". Same data as above. If I go to edit
 I get new profile with no data entered.</p>
<p>- if I go to my MS account / Your Info / <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile?setlang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Go to your Skype profile, I am linked to my new skype account. </a></p>
<p>- If I got to my MS account / services and suscriptions/get more info/ I am linked over back to my new skype account</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I am not linked to my skype, I always get link from my MS account to my new skype profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all I can only recognized that I have under my MS account, same email, same name created two skype accounts which differ depending what login I use. One was created automatically by office 365 and other one was linked by me to my MS account. From MS
 account it is shown the skype profile which depends on way how I login to skype account</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS there any option how to resolve this problem. I would like to use same credentials for all my ms products.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Product Key</h2>
                    Purchased windows 10 from Newegg and there is no product key in the packaging.&nbsp; I see the End item PN, the Carton #, and COA Barcodes.&nbsp; nothing that looks like a product key.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with Task view and Alt+Tab not working may have been caused by some conflict with software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to narrow down this concern, run your computer in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean boot.</a></strong> We also recommend that you go to
<strong>Setting &gt; System &gt; Multitasking</strong> and under<strong> Virtual Desktop</strong> click the drop down from
<strong>Pressing Alt+Tab&nbsp; shows windows that are open on</strong> and select <strong>
All desktops.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            Sorry for not giving complete information earlier, when we try with different user on the same computer every thing is fine but for one particular user who is assigned for the computer it is not working. When the same user try on other computer in the
 domain everything is fine. Have check the group polices and user setting every thing is fine.

            This issue is very mind boggling, i think it would be best to assign a different computer to that specific user, since his account is working perfectly on other computer or post it in Technet &nbsp;forum as they always say when it comes to complicated issues.<br />
<br />
Goodluck
