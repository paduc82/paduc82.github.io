<h2>            Connecting Office 365 to Outlook.com Account</h2>
                    <p>I want to connect my office 365 account to my outlook.com account, but even Microsoft Office 365 Support has not been able to assist as my outlook.com account continues to block the connection. I keep receiving an email that says that to protect my account
 (my outlook.com account) that it required an additional security challenge. It is my office 365 account that is trying to access the outlook.com account but the security challenge is blocking it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I configure my outlook.com account to accept a connection request from my office 365 account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The office 365 support person became so perplexed by the problem that he set up private accounts to replicate the situation. When he set up his private accounts the connection occurred immediately and seamlessly. He was astonished that the same thing did
 not occur for me. How do I make it happen?</p>

</p><p>Kindly reply: </p>
<p>1. When you login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a> through the web browser, do you see
<strong>Outlook.com</strong> or <strong>Outlook Mail </strong>on the upper left corner?
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Do you have two step verification enabled in your Outlook.com account? </p>
<p>3. What is the exact error message you receive when you try to connect your accounts?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further information would be helpful.</p>

            <p>I am logging into my Outlook.com account using: https://login.live.com/ . When logged in I see Outlook.com in the upper left hand corner.</p>
<p>Two step verification is NOT enabled on my Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to connected accounts in Office 365 and click on the + to add my Outlook.com account, I complete the email address and the password and the next screen that pops up says: A secured connection couldn't be established to this account. Not all providers
 offer secured connections. Click OK to try an unsecured connection. Click Skip to configure your account settings. It doesn't matter how one proceeds from this page the result is failure. Hitting either skip or OK brings up the same page that asks for a selection
 of either POP or IMAP. Configuring either does not work. Of course if things are working properly this page should not even appear. The appearance of this page in itself demonstrates that there is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Phone using Bluetooth Hands Free Profile</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to ask for your help. I'd like to connect my Nokia Lumia 620 running Windows Phone 8.10.14219.341&nbsp;to my PC running Windows 8.1 over Bluetooth using an Asus USB-BT400 Bluetooth adapter with driver version: 12.0.1.160 (chipset&nbsp;is Broadcom BCM920702)
 and&nbsp;I'd like to connect using the Hands-Free Profile (HFP). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this service while enabled for the Phone (Properties/Services/Hands-free Audio Gateway is checked)&nbsp;doesn't appear in the Bluetooth Device Control screen. The phone, by default&nbsp;is connected using A2DP, which works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some research I concluded that both the Phone and the Adapter supports HFP so I don't understand why&nbsp;HFP wouldn't appear as a connection option under Bluetooth Device Controls. I'm hoping the Community may be able to share some advice perhaps even
 offer a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Szilárd</p>

<h2>            Something went wrong, create an account for this PC</h2>
                    Hello, I have recently reset my PC after having Install Windows preview 10074. But now, my computer asks me sign in with a work or school account. Since I don't have this kind of account, I clicked on "Set up with a local account". Then, I enter a username,
 a password, and a password hint but when I click on "Next", I have that red written message "Something went wrong". What should I do? I cannot go further so I can't access any other settings.

    <title>OneNote App lagging during use, making it very difficult to scroll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sn23  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote App lagging during use, making it very difficult to scroll through my notes.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>I am a current medical student that relies heavily on using OneNote to keep up with my school notes, as well as typing on my school notes. I have been using OneNote 2016 to this point, which has been running very smoothly with no problems. I am now trying
 to switch to using the OneNote app, as it is much more user friendly for students who want to use a stylus pen to write notes. However, unlike OneNote 2016, the OneNote app lags while I am trying to scroll up and down through my notes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and re-installing the OneNote app with no success. I’ve also been on the phone with two separate Microsoft support technicians, who tried to help with no success. They directed me towards emailing One Drive support, but I cannot seem
 to find the specific email to get in touch with them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could please help me figure out why the OneNote App is not running smoothly for me I would greatly appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous support number was 1441811543.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This issue could occur if the OneNote application is out of date. If you're using Office apps for Android or iOS, we recommend going to the<strong>&nbsp;Store
</strong>to obtain the<strong> latest version </strong>of OneNote. Otherwise, if you're using Windows device, you can go to
<strong>Windows Store</strong> instead.<br />
<br />
However, if you need to get in touch with our OneDrive support team, you can use the OneDrive In-app support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's how:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
1. Sign in to OneDrive.com.&nbsp;<br />
2. Click <strong>?</strong> help icon located at the top, select <strong>Email OneDrive support.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
3. Submit your concern.&nbsp;<br />
4. Follow the prompts to request support.<br />
<br />
If you should contact us again regarding the same OneNote concern, we'd like to ask some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What device are you using for the OneNote app?</p>
<p>2. Did you encounter any error messages?</p>
<p>3. Do you have other Office apps like Word, Excel that is also affected by this issue?</p>
<p>4. Have you tried to log out and log in again on the OneNote app?<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you need further assistance with this concern. Alternatively, if you have other concerns, kindly post a new thread. We're happy to assist you again.</p>

<p>What information? On one sheet or on multiple sheets? Do you want to find the duplicated or changed values? Is the data structure the same or changed? Is the data re-sorted or in the same order? Do you have key values?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest response is Yes. Lot's of ways - I like the "delete duplicates" utility the best, which highlights differences by not deleting the records that have been changed.</p>

<h2>            Main Storage Memory issue on WM6.5</h2>
                    
<p>I have a samsung omnia 2 running WM6.5. I am not sure what I have in my main storage, but it says I have 186.84 MB, and I am using 160.98MB so I have 25.86 MB free. Is there anything I can do to help the memory problem?</p>
<p>Here are the items that are listed in my main storage.</p>
<p>Microsoft .Net CF 3.5, Microsoft Internet Sharing, Windows Live, Microsoft My Phone, Microsoft Bing, Microsoft Marketplace Bootstrap, Microsoft Windows (r)Marketplace&nbsp;for Mobile, Microsoft WM Update KB958639, Mobile TopSoft OpnMarket, Microsoft Facebook,
 Opera Software Opera Mobile 10, Blade0rz IMDb Mobile, pocketnow.com, Image Finder!</p>
<p>Am I able to safely remove/delete any of these, and if so, how would I go about doing that?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<blockquote>&nbsp;I do not have a storage card. I am not very phone savvy, but it seems that all of these programs are located on MyDevice.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Your device has a slot for a storage card that you can add.&nbsp; It will allow you to install programs onto the card thus preserving valuable memory on the device's built-in memory.&nbsp; Storage cards are inexpensive so consider getting one so you can get more functionality
 out of your device.</p>
<p>Once you get a card, I would remove programs (uninstall) that you have added then reinstall using the storage card (you will be given the option to choose where to install once you add the memory card).&nbsp;</p>

            Hello AnneAnneQX, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having difficulty sending emails in Microsoft Outlook as you are returned with this error
<code>The Function cannot be performed because the message has been changed</code>. I know how important it is for you to be able to send emails, fret not, I am here to help you to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />
I am a Directly.com expert for Outlook.com and I am sorry to inform you that you have posted this thread in the wrong forum. The correct forum is
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum">
<em><strong>Office</strong></em></a><strong><em>&gt; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook">
Outlook</a>.</em></strong> <br />
<br />
It is important for you to post your thread in the correct forum so that users equipped with the right expertise can better serve you.
<br />
<br />
In order for me to effectively troubleshoot this problem with you, I need additional information from you:
<br />
<br />
1. What is your Microsoft Outlook release? <br />
2. How long has this been an issue? <br />
3. Does it occur with other users? Email accounts? Profiles? <br />
4. Do you recall undertaking any change that might possibly result in this? <br />
5. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
Try opening Microsoft Outlook in safe mode. Does it work? <code>Start</code>+<code>R</code> and enter
<code>Outlook /safe</code> <br />
<br />
Also, head over to <em>File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; Uncheck "When a reply modifies a message, don't move the original"</em>
<br />
<br />
Hope it works! <br />
<br />
Best wishes, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

<h2>            &#42;&#42;&#42;RESOLVED&#42;&#42;&#42; Verizon &#40;US&#41; HTC One Users&#58;  Updating to Win10</h2>
                    <p>***Edit*** 2015/05/21 at 1:10pm PST</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has now been resolved.&nbsp; The correct upgrade path has been built and all affected users should be able to update as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter any additional issues, please start a new thread and we'll check into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week Verizon (US) launched a software update for HTC One devices on their network.&nbsp; As part of this launch, the recovery OS image that is loaded into the Windows Phone Recovery Tool has changed to match this new software release.&nbsp; This will create an
 situation where some Verizon HTC One device users will not be able to update to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The what and why:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>8.10.15116.125</span><span> </span>is the highest 8.1 OS version currently supported for upgrades to Win10.&nbsp; (We’re working on this already to make *<strong>all*
</strong>&nbsp;8.1builds available to update to Win10.)</li><li>WPRT software version for HTC One devices on Verizon (US) is now <span>8.10.15143.15</span></li><li>For any user who accepts the update from Verizon prior to updating to Win10, or flashes their device using the WPRT image that is now available, no update path to Win10 will exist until we finish making the necessary changes.</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p>The cause of this was simply a matter of timing between two separate work efforts.&nbsp; We are actively working to create the necessary update paths for all WP8.1 users (some 640 users are in this same situation, although for a different reason).&nbsp; This is an
 unfortunate situation to be in, but one we’re actively working to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always your feedback is appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Where did my Print to OneNote go&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have lost the option to save to/print to OneNote from other programs, or from the internet, whichever browser I use (IE, Chrome or Firefox).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is no longer a choice amongst printers, and no longer&nbsp;no longer a choice when trying to add a printer in Devices and Printers. It just is&nbsp;not an option.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling&nbsp;Office 2010&nbsp;and re-installed it. Didn't help. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Any other ideas? </em></p>

    <title>Track Changes always Flags Some Cross-reference Heading Text as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukechung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Track Changes always Flags Some Cross-reference Heading Text as Changes</h2>
                    <p>When I update my document using F9, track changes always flags some cross-reference of Heading Text as changes while others are not. I would understand if the page changed, but that's not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after accepting the change, when I press F9 over the cross-references, they are flagged as changes again. Yet, some references aren't flagged as changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what causes this and how to fix it? I see this across many Word documents.</p>

            <p>Some fields will be updated when repagination occurs, and, with tracked changes enabled, that means the fields may be flagged as changed.

</p><p>If you update a&nbsp;cross-reference field explicitly, for example by selecting it and pressing F9,&nbsp;I would expect it to be marked as a change.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reference. Unfortunately, it doesn't solve the problem. The procedure
 are refreshed, while others never do. There must be something different with the way the reference and/or heading is defined.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's independent of repagination because the change is indicated even if the pages aren't modified. Immediately accepting all changes, simply refreshing the reference flags it as a change. It makes the Track Changes feature very inefficient.</p>

<p>They say the mobile operator blocks the SMS, but they are stupid enough to not allow manual configuration, which will be cheaper and easier in case you don't get the SMS, which is the case of thousands of people.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access WiFi since I updated my Nokia 925 to WP 8.1</h2>
                    I downloaded the WP 8.1 update to my phone this morning at work and now cannot connect to my work WiFi. It keeps asking for password and I keep entering the correct password, but it says it's incorrect. Please note that I downloaded the WP 8.1 update on
 the same WiFi that I now cannot connect to. I have removed the network from my known network list, I have reset the router as well as my phone to no avail. Would someone here at Microsoft please address this bug and don't try to tell me something in my router
 is wrong, 3 other phones and 2 laptops are connected and working just like every other morning.

            <p>Hi MarkJestic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that after the update the WiFi connectivity on your phone does not work as predicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were in your shoes, I would try to connect it to another network, if the problem occures again,</p>
<p>it's possible that something went wrong during the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that situation my recommendation is to fully backup your device,</p>
<p>since your connectivity is not possible at the moment so online backup is out of question (you could possibly try throught Mobile Network), use the Windows Phone Apps for the purpose</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 : <br />
<a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/windows-phone/0e0fbaf6-fd99-4046-b494-9ce469ae3009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/windows-phone/0e0fbaf6-fd99-4046-b494-9ce469ae3009</a></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After making sure that all the content of the phone is safely store on your computer or Microsoft Account. Please reset the phone.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the reset process does not resolve the problem</p>
<p>You might need to use the Nokia Software Recovery Tools for the purpose:</p>

    <title>Message wasnt sent due to company policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanpiselli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message wasnt sent due to company policy</h2>
                    <p>I've set up skype for business within our organization. It works internally. However, I would like to be able to IM other skype for business users as well as skype users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a personal skype account that I'm using for testing purposes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone into skype for business admin center&gt;organization&gt;external communications: and set it for 'On except for blocked domains' and have blocked no domains. I also checked the box 'let people use skype for business to communicate with skype users outside
 of your organization'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went into the skype for business admin center&gt;users&gt;my username&gt;external communications: and made sure both boxes were checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps were performed 48+hrs ago, so I am well beyond the recommended 24hr waiting period suggested for changes to take full effect across all databases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for users, I get the my contacts and skype directory tabs; so it is allowing me to search all of skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, whenever I try to IM users who are not part of my organization, I get 'This message wasn't sent to USERNAME due to company policy.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried signing in/out. Deleting/reading external contacts. Restarting. We use office 365 spam filter and it is allowing communications for Skype. I do not know what else to look at.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great. Thanks!</p>

            Hi Ryanpiselli,<br />
<br />
If you get the message it couldn't be sent due to company policy, you need to check your firewall settings. See Office
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#bkmk_lyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
365 URLs and IP address ranges</a><br />
<br />
You may check whether the problem is your firewall is to go to a wifi location not behind your firewall such as a coffee shop/home network, and use Skype for Business to send a request to your Skype contact to chat.<br />
<br />
If you sent your Skype contact a request and they never received it, ask them to send you a request to chat. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here is the official article about test and troubleshoot this issue:<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-Skype-for-Business-users-add-Skype-contacts-08666236-1894-42ae-8846-e49232bbc460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Let Skype for Business

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In outlook 2013 there is the facility to move items (emails) from the inbox (or any folder your are in) to another folder by right clicking and selecting 'move'.</p>
<p>I am trying to determine if I can increased the list of folders that appears (currently 10). I assume it is the default list/number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to what appears to be a simple (hopefully) change in settings or somewhere else.</p>

</p><p>We'd like to know more about the issue. When you said that you were trying to increase the list of folders that appears on your Outlook 2013, are you trying to create a subfolder, a personal folder, or a public folder?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your question...neither. </p>
<p>I have a number of folders in my outlook 2013 (*.pst file...however you wish to express it).
</p>
<p>I would just like the list that appears after right clicking to be 15 or 20 or __ (more than 10).</p>

            You cannot increase the list of folders shown in the rt click&gt;move context menu - from recollection it shows the 10 most recently used in any move option<br />

<h3> roy.johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do 2 phones use the same Outlook calendar&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7, Outlook 2010 Professional, and have 2 Samsung Focus 7.5 Mango'ized, Window Phones.&nbsp; Currently Outlook syncs with my Windows Live, and Phone, and my AOL email account.&nbsp; I am the primary user of the calendar and my wife only looks at
 it to see if I am working or not. I'd like my Outlook &gt; Windows Live &nbsp;calendars to display on her phone.&nbsp; I have told Outlook and Windows that she is a "co-author" but, the calendar does not appear on her phone.&nbsp; Is this possible?

            <p>Not sure if this works, but it's easy to try. Just add your Live account as another account on your wife's phone. I'm pretty sure as a secondary account, you should be able to select just syncing calendar, and not mail and contacts. If that doesn't work,
 just delete the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yup, just tried it with&nbsp; my wife's account. It initially sets it up with everything syncing, but you can turn stuff off. It will take your stuff back off since things aren't really combined, just displayed together on the phone. So don't worry about contacts
 getting all mixed up. Her appointments now display on my calendar in a different color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that she will always be able to turn on contacts, e-mail, task sync, so if your relationship can't stand that....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other possible issue is that the Live calendar tile doesn't differentiate what calendar things come from, so whatever is next on the calendar is what shows. Don't see a way around that.</p>

</p><p><span>So far I have been able to duplicate what I'm trying to do but this one has thrown me a curve ball. So a bit of background. On a sheet called Calibration Master List has two main groups Switches and Transmitters.
 Transmitters take up columns A - G with a checkbox in H.&nbsp; Rows are 4 - 200. Switches take up Columns O - U with a checkbox in V.&nbsp;
</span>Rows are 4 - 200.&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;When the checkbox is check it copies the individual row to a sheet called calibration. The transmitters got to column A through G and same goes for the switches rows O - U.&nbsp; And
 then if I uncheck the box it deletes the row on the sheet calibration and moves up the remaining rows.</span></p>

            <p>I would delete all the checkboxes, and use the cells of column H and V as the checkbox replacements. Then, use event code: copy this, right-click the sheet tab of Calibration Master List, select "View Code" and paste the code into the window that appears.
 Then click on a single empty cell in column H or V to transfer the corresponding data - I have assumed that the values in A and O or unique key values. Clicking on a cell in H or V that currently has a check mark will remove the data from Calibration.</p>

</p><p>This is the Calibration Master List. Some&nbsp;have data some don't I select the ones that have data and copy them to the other sheet.</p>

<p><span>Hi Todd,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The answer is no, there are no official documents talking about the migration of the linked mailboxes to Office 365.

    <title>How do I make a local copy for Contacts that are synced from Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I make a local copy for Contacts that are synced from Live account&#63;</h2>
                    Once un-sync my Windows Live account or use a different Windows Live account, all the contacts that were previously loaded onto Mango OS disappeared. Is there a way to store these contacts on HTC WP7 "locally" so that the contacts do not disappear if there
 is change of Windows Live account?

            <p>There are apps that you can get from the marketplace that allow you to create contacts that are not synced any where, but these apps use their own file structure/database to store this data, so any contacts you enter into the apps will not show up in your
 people hub and would not be as integrated into all the other functions of the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's not an easy way to store contacts locally in a way that they will never be synced to any cloud based service such as Windows Live or Google Contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can sync your phone to more than one windows live account, so you could set up your phone to
 sync contacts to several different windows live accounts and set up the secondary windows live accounts to only sync manually.&nbsp; Then, after the first sync with this account the data that is associated with a secondary windows live account won't ever sync to&nbsp;windows
 live&nbsp;unless you consciously sync the account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why don't you want to keep the data on your phone in sync with your windows live account?</p>

            <p>There is no method of not tying contacts to an account. If you needed to swap Windows Live accounts, you can visit
<a href="https://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hotmail Contacts</a>, export your contacts, sign in with the other account, then import them.</p>

                    <p>I just bought a&nbsp; new ASUS computer. I'm having problems with three things: (1)my mouse's right-click option disappears after several sites are visited,&nbsp; (2) websites are reset without my asking, and (3) websites partly load than stop, requiring a refresh
 that sometimes doesn't work too well. The problem with the mouse does not go away when I use different mice.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues with your Windows 10 laptop. We suggest that you run the
<strong>System File Checker </strong>tool and the <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management
</strong>tool to scan and correct any issues. System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in the operating system. SFC checks for system file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a
 Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment image.<br />
<br />
Kindly follow the steps in this article posted by ZigZag3143 (MS-MVP) to perform SFC and DISM:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

<p>It's not likely that your problem is caused by the computer being defective. Was it having the described problems before you installed the preview build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What browser are you using when the described problem occur? Have you tried using any other browser? If so, with what results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any 3rd party security program installed?</p>

</p><p>One thing, however: the Reset the PC command hung at 41% completion for more than two hours before I finally turned it off, packed it up and sent it back. That may&nbsp; have been a symptom of the problem or another problem.</p>

            I advise against using any pre-release software like 16232 on a computer still in warranty.&nbsp; The manufacturer will require you to restore to factory condition before giving you warranty help because pre-release software is completely unsupported by both
 Microsoft and Asus.&nbsp; Restore your computer to factory condition and only use test boxes for pre-release copies of Windows.

<p>&nbsp;I haven't had the problem, but you're several builds behind, so I'd run Windows Update and get up to 16257 and see if that fixes things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Be sure to make backups because with pre-release software, you will run into bugs, some that could possibly make your system unbootable.</p>

</p><p>Please make sure to tick " Don't show this again" when you are in the login page. And then your choice will be stored in the cache and cookies of the browser and it will not prompt if this information is still saving in your browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have already ticked it and it keep prompting, I need gather more information to better understand your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Did you use incognito mode of your browser to sign in? If so, try to use the regular mode to check if the issue persists.</span></li><li><span>Please check if there is special security setting of your PC such as restore boot.</span></li><li><span>Do others in your organization also have the same issue?</span></li><li><span>Please change a environment to check such as changing a browser to login or use the PC at home.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Personal Macro Workbook macros not seen</h2>
                    <font color="#1a1a1a">I'm running Excel 2011 on Mavericks. I created a Personal Macro Workbook (PMW) by recording a macro and saving it. The PMW has that name (no extension) but its type is a "Microsoft Excel&nbsp;binary workbook". It is stored in the correct
 folder</font><font color="#1a1a1a">&nbsp;in Library. I imported a couple other macros in it. These macros work fine in the workbook in which they were created.&nbsp;</font><br />
<br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">When I create a new workbook, the following is true:&nbsp;</font><br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">1. The PMW is opened (I see the temp file</font><font color="#1a1a1a">&nbsp;in the folder).</font><br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">2. I can open and edit the PMW macros in the VBA</font><font color="#1a1a1a">&nbsp;editor.</font><br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">3. When I start to type the name of a macro (UDF) in the workbook its name shows up in the completion list.</font><br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">4. No macro from the PMW shows up in the macro list on the Developer Tab.</font><br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">5. When I calculate the UDF the cell displays "#NAME?".</font><br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">6. A breakpoint set in the UDF never gets executed, implying the code</font><font color="#1a1a1a">&nbsp;is not found.</font><br />
<br />
The macro in the PMW is in a module. (There are also two class modules.) The module's name is "DateFunctions". Since the macro in question is a function, it's not directly executable. If I put a test driver into its module, it executes fine. If I put the the
 driver in a module in a new workbook I get an error message: Compile error Sub or Function not defined. (The same thing happens with the classes: they are seen when the driver is in the PMW module, not when in a separate workbook.)&nbsp;
<div><font color="#1a1a1a"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#1a1a1a">As an aside, I copied the PMW to the XLSTART folder in a Parallels VM running Excel 2007</font><font color="#1a1a1a">. After renaming the workbook, it works fine, i.e., UDF provides the correct value when used in a new Windows</font><font color="#1a1a1a">&nbsp;workbook.</font><br />
<br />
<font color="#1a1a1a">Thanks.</font></div>

            Try saving the PMW as Excel Macro-Enabled format (.xlsm) and use that file as PMW and see whether that makes a difference.

            OK, I ran the experiment you requested, and others. It seems like in a given workbook macros are NOT seen in any other open workbooks, whether they are xlsb or xlsm, whether they are in the Excel folder or created in this session. When I say "seen" I mean
 in a macro. They are all visible in the Project directory.

<h2>            Office 365 without apps</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I hope you can help me.<br />
Okay so I have my master thesis to edit before printing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is: I do have Office 365 (for students, so it's free), but when I download it, I don't have access to word for instance, which is supposed to have been downloaded with it. I can install it, the problem is that it leads me to their site where
 you can get it but you have to pay. Am I the only one facing this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb83b896-e5c3-45d1-b2bb-6fe97e803c6d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb83b896-e5c3-45d1-b2bb-6fe97e803c6d?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Being a student doesn't automatically make you eligible for a free version. If your university offers a free subscription of Office, you can make use of it. Ask your university which credentials you should use for the installation.
