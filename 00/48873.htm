<h2>            Outlook Express 6.0 on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Good Evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the virtual pc software and XP mode software onto my windows 7 computer so I can run outlook Express within the "XP mode" environment. Problem is that Outlook Express wants to get installed at the location c:\program files\outlook express
 directory and I want to install it on my K'\drive. The GUI windows does not allow me to change it's path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps. I am doing this for my Father who was running XP and likes outlook express.</p>

<h2>            Remove calendars Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>does anybody know how to remove a calendar from the Windows 10 calendar app ? I don't use the outlook calendar at all but I have three calendars listed there under outlook as available which I don't want, as well as an old iCloud calendar which I no longer
 use..</p>
<p>
</p><p>am running Windows 10 home with a brand new install of office 13, syncing with my iPad and iPhone via iCloud&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers</p>

<p>I have already unchecked the unwanted calendars option in Calendar itself - so they don't display anything -&nbsp;but I would like to delete them if possible - sounds like that is impossible from what you say. The three&nbsp;unwanted Calendars are all under the Outlook
 section</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook I don't have any calendars enabled so I have no idea where they are coming from.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>two of them with the same name, which is really confusing (my fault, I know) and one shared with an ex-wife.&nbsp;</p>

            I had the same issue. I removed it from Outlook.com but it wouldn't delete from the Calendar app. Once I removed the old events associated with the calendar, it disappeared. Doesn't seem to be a simpler way, for now at least.

            Login to your account at Outlook.com or Hotmail.com.<br />
Open the calendar app.<br />
Select 'settings' icon.<br />
Select 'options'.<br />
Select (left click once) the calendar that you want to delete<br />
and the options for that calendar will open.<br />
Select 'delete' at the top of the page and then 'delete' on the drop down window.

            <p>Hello Nyima,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried fixing the phantom-calendar problem with the PowerShell-command</p>
<p>which uninstalled the Calendar-app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But after reinstallation from the Windows-Store, the app is back again - so there must be some kind of app-cache persisting, even after uninstallation of the app. Is there a way to get rid of that cache?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A fix for this problem would be much appreciated,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if you're still needing a resolution to this issue, but I had the same problem of needed to delete one of the calendars that were showing up in my Calendar app and here's the resolution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Close your Calendar App</p>
<p>2. Open a browser and log into your Outlook.com account, which will open your Outlook email in the browser window</p>
<p>3. Click on the 'Calendar' icon in the lower left-hand corner of the window</p>
<p>4. If the calendar you wish to remove is listed under 'Other Calendars', simply right-click on it and choose 'delete'</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I completed these steps, the unwanted calendar no longer showed up in the browser version or in the calendar app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Scott</p>

<h3> t.rigdon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backspace, Spacebar, and Enter</h2>
                    <p>So here is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)When I am typing anywhere - in browsers, on sticky notes, Microsoft word, even this post- if I press backspace it will delete one letter then take me to the beginning of the line I am typing on. For example, if I were to backspace on the very top line
 of this post -"So here is the problem:"- it will delete&nbsp; colon ":" and then put my cursor in front (to the left) of the "So".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)When I press enter, the page automatically scrolls down. When I pressed enter&nbsp; to start this new paragraph I was taken to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)When I press space it automatically takes me to the end of the line I am typing. For example, if I were to place the cursor between "So" and "here" in the first line I typed I would have an extra space between "So" and "here" and my cursor would be to
 the right of the colon at the end of the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Discovered while typing this. If I use the arrow keys to move my cursor within the sentence I'm typing, my cursor jumps to the line above if I use the left arrow and to the line below where I am typing if I use the right arrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on an HP ProBook laptop. It doesn't happen when I use the onscreen key board,&nbsp;I've adjusted all the "sticky key functions", and I'm not accidentally touching the touch pad.&nbsp;</p>
I've read several posts on different blogs, all with the same problem but none have offered a solution. Can this be fixed?&nbsp;

<h2>            Realtek Ethernet Cable keeps loosing connection</h2>
                    <p>I just installed a new hard drive and installed Windows 8.1 on it. My Ethernet connection on my Asus Motherboard was damaged in a storm recently along with my router and modem. The router and modem have been replaced. I did not want to buy a whole new Motherboard
 because the old one is still working so I read on line that you can use a USB Ethernet cable in place of it. I bought Realtek USB FE Family Controller and installed it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with it is that every 30 to 60 seconds it goes off for a few seconds then comes back on. It's not off long enough for Windows to tell me I've lost a connection but when I'm surfing the web when it goes off IE tells me I've lost the connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled the device and reinstalled it. I've checked for the latest drivers and I have them. I'm at my wits end to know what to do. I was thinking about reinstalling Windows 8.1 to see if that fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a suggestion it would be much appreciated.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like either that USB device has an issue or when your motherboard was damaged<br />
it also affect the USB ports. Try other ports and try using it with a powered USB Hub (could
<br />
be a power draw issue with that device). If the USB circuitry was damaged on the Mother-<br />
board then a new one might be required.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Code has already been redeemed</h2>
                    <p>So i was trying to redeem my free copy of Minecraft Windows 10 through mojang. I clicked the button, sent me to microsoft, I signed in with my account (my only account), and showed me the code. I forgot to copy the code like an idiot, clicked confirm and it just sent me back to the main microsoft page. I searched minecraft and clicked redeem code and realized I forgot to copy it. Clicked back to the page where the code was but now it says the code has already been redeemed when i havent. Went through purchase history and it's there but when i press install it just gives me the code that "ive already redeemed". Help, im just trying to download this game.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Streaming to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killmaster24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streaming to windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone been messing around with this yet? I was trying to get it working but haven't had much luck. From what I have read, you have to enable a setting under Settings &gt; Preferences on your actual xbox which I don't have. On windows 10 under the xbox
 app, It shows my console is connected. When I click on "Connected" it shows my xbox with three options "Test Streaming" "Disconnect" and "Turn Off". Also from what I have seen you should also have a stream button, which I don't have...Wondering if that would
 come if I had the option on my xbox to allow it. Anyways if I hit test streaming, I get a notification on my xbox saying streaming started, but on the PC i just get a loading icon and it says "Please wait while we run the test. Make sure you don't close the
 app or leave this page until it's done" However that message never actually goes away. I have left it up for about 30 min. which I assume is way more time than it should actually take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, anyone had any luck with this? I have also read some stuff on the Xbox One Preview Program....Do you have to be a member of that in order to actually get that option on your xbox to allow the streaming?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also sorry if this isn't the right forum section...I wasn't really sure where to post it, so i just decided here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help with the issue.</p>

<p>You need to be in the Xbox preview program. Works great on both of my XBOX ONE,s 1 hard wired and one using wireless through a crappy Rogers Cisco 802.11n Gateway. &nbsp;Even tho the Xbox on is in the same room and on the same TV as mine, having the ability to
 play Xbox one while your doing some stuff on PC is cool. &nbsp; Easy capture solouution who don't have a capture solution(I have an avermedia), just stream and record the stream or use twitch. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you are on the preview program and that you have the Xbox preview app installed on your Xbox one, also make sure your Xbox app on Windows 10 is updated, by going into the store and search "Xbox" and install the newest version if needed, as it doesn't
 always update.</p>

<p>Either the Xbox app on Windows 10 doesn't detect the Xbox One or when they do see each other, and I'm told everything is working correctly, all I get is a blank screen.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to get Streaming to work. I can connect to the Xbox One, and start streaming, but the Xbox's screen will only momentarily pop up, then closes and gives me an error. On the TV I see it say streaming has stopped.</p>
<p>Reading the FAQ help, it could be because I'm using WiFi. They suggest modifying my Wireless networks to assign different SSIDs to the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, which, frankly is not an acceptable solution. I'm not fragmenting my home network and adding
 confusion to the end users because of an Xbox issue for a "nice to have" feature.</p>
<p>Hopefully they'll fix it soon.</p>

<p>I've had no problems streaming except for the controller going out of range when I use the laptop in the far room.
</p>
<p>If I choose "Test Streaming" it fails to find the X Box and signs me out, though when selecting "Stream" it has no problems except for the above mentioned.</p>

<p>I had the same issue. &nbsp;My problem turned out to be the xbox app on windows 10. &nbsp;It needed to be updated. &nbsp;Go into the windows store and click on your icon in top right corner. &nbsp;You should then look for an update all button. &nbsp;Took a couple of tries and 1
 reboot, but finally got it working.</p>

<p>Three year old 13" MacBook Air (1.8 GHz Core i5, 4 GB, 128 GB SSD) with Windows 10 Home (not virtual). Streaming worked great. &nbsp;I played Dying Light for an hour tonight with no lag Or connection issues. &nbsp; Appreciate this functionality so I can play in different
 areas of the house.</p>
<p>The only bug I have encountered is that is my controller will not move up and down the main Dying Light menu if I move it down past "Continue". &nbsp;Seems to lock up a bit. &nbsp;I have to use the XBOX home button and start another game and then come back to Dying
 Light to "Continue" my game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The MacBook is wifi only while the XBOX One is on a Ethernet cable. The MacBook Air worked much better than my 2014 Dell Inspiron 15" 7000 laptop &nbsp;(Core i7 2.00 GHz, 8 GB ram and a 1 TB &nbsp;hard drive). &nbsp;The Dell disconnected from my XBOX gaming session after
 10 minutes (from the same location in my house). For some reason the MacBook on Windows just does gaming better. &nbsp; It streams the PC version of MineCraft for my son with no lag whereas the Dell lags &nbsp; &nbsp;MacBook also streams some Steam games better for me (e.g.,
 Styx: Master of Shadows if you are familiar with it).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I am trying to stream a game to my windows 10 but every time I do, the controller stops working, it says that it is not plugged in to the pc otherwise disconnects from my Xbox One, stopping the stream.</p>
<p>anyone know what's going on? I'd be extremely grateful!</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Edit- I found that the defunct Homegroup is still listed in Sharing. It has to be changed to Specific People--Everyone to share files. Not sure this will work for nearby sharing but it is a setting that needs to be changed. Also needing change is the User
 folder. Win 10 does not see the correct user folder to access. It comes up as Default User instead of the real named folder. Then it says the folder is empty. We need help.</p>

<p>Yes, no matter what I try it seems that <strong>Nearby sharing</strong> does not work. With both
<strong>Bluetooth</strong> and <strong>Nearby sharing</strong> turned "On" and<strong> Wi-Fi</strong> connected in three adjacent devices the "Share" feature cannot find the other devices. A fix would be nice sometime soon, please...</p>

<p>Hi mlg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where specifically did you see the Homegroup shown? Sorry, I'm not completely clear what you mean by it being listed in Sharing. Is that on a folder by folder basis? Also, concerning the user folder, do I have to share my entire user folder for this to work?
 If so, that seems like a bit of a security risk.</p>

<p>It not significant but it shows up with right click on a file or folder and choosing Give Access to. There really is no Homegroup and choosing it does nothing. Sharing shows contacts and searches for Nearby Devices. I thought it had something to do with
 Nearby Sharing not working, but turns out that my older computers don't have the option for that. Network sharing still works but must be setup again.&nbsp;</p>

            There was an update today. Maybe with some improvements. Nearby Sharing is probably not useful in a home setting, but it would be fun to try it.

            Thanks. Problem was old hardware. I also found that Homegroup sharing when selecting Give Access To by right clicking on a folder still works to share folders even though there is no homegroup.&nbsp; Very handy since Network &amp; Sharing Center doesn't have the
 specific folders to share list anymore. But still odd that Homegroup is mentioned at all.&nbsp;

    <title>Battery level indicator not accurate when two controllers are on. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wreade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery level indicator not accurate when two controllers are on.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything I have read states that I should be able to press the Xbox button on a controller and look to the lower right to see the battery level for that specific controller. When I do that with two controllers on (in this case, one with brand new batteries
 and one with old batteries that are about to die), both controllers indicate full batteries. When I turn off the controller with the new batteries, then press the Xbox button on the other controller, the indicator shows that the batteries are about to die.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this inquiry. I understand you're having an issue with the battery level indicator for two separate Xbox One Wireless controllers. So I tested it out here on our end with two controllers one I knew had
 low battery level and one with brand new batteries. What we were able to figure out was that the controller that's battery indicator level is being displayed is in fact the controller that is assigned as Player 1. When you switch from the low battery controller
 to being the active Player 1 profile signed in it will then show the dying controllers indicator. It is a good point and I would recommend submitting the feedback through
<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Ideas</a>. Find an appropriate Idea Drive that is "Accepting Ideas" and submit your suggestion on resolving the issue there. Hope this helps!</p>

            Thanks for the reply! I will try that the next time I have low batteries. As far as this being an idea, I don't think this is an idea so much as pointing out that the Xbox instructions are wrong, or at least they are lacking the key piece of information
 you provided. :-)

            Hello Rich, <br />
<br />
Have you contacted the device manufacturer (Hitachi) regarding this? We suggest confirming with them to get complete and more established resolution to this issue.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other concerns. <br />

<p>It's not a Hitachi issue, the issue is that the Microsoft adapter is fixed at outputting 1920x1080p, regardless what you plug it into.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought brand new 1280x800 native NEC projectors and no matter what resolution you set the laptop to, the dongle scales it to 1080 and shoves it out the hdmi.</p>

            Hi Arnel.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function correctly: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hey All&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp;Qualcomm Atheros AR9002WB-1NG Wireless Network Adapter installed into my Qosmio F750 Laptop. Once upgrading to Windows 8.1 from 8.0 my wireless network adapter no longer worked. I've read all the discussions and nothing helped. The following steps
 got mine working without having to install new drivers or anything like that.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps and you away:</p>
<p>1 - Open up windows explorer</p>
<p>2 - Right click on 'This PC' and click on Properties</p>
<p>3 - Click on 'Device Manager'</p>
<p>4 - Expand network adapters so that you can see the driver name. It had a yellow triangle underneath it for me.</p>
<p>5 - Right click on the driver and select 'update driver software'</p>
<p>6 - Select 'Browse my computer for driver software'</p>
<p>7 - Select 'let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer'</p>
<p>8 - Mine comes up with two drivers, they are both called the same but one has (Microsoft) at the end the other had (Qualcomm Atheros Communic.......)</p>
<p>9 - Select the one that ends in (Microsoft) and click next.</p>
<p>10 - Crack a beer and enjoy glorious wifi again</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me and hopefully it'll work for you too!</p>

            <p>This did not work. &nbsp;To clarify the issue, Windows Update appears to be working but Windows Store is unable to update apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter for Background Intelligent Transfer Service found and fixed these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some security settings are missing or have been changed</li><li>Service registration is missing or corrupt</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This also did not have any impact on the Windows Store issue. &nbsp;I did notice that if I run the Windows Update troubleshooter (which continues to always "fix" the same two problems) and then run the BITS troubleshooter again, the same two BITS issues are back.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No issues were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rash happens at random and I have no idea what's causing it. Sometimes it happens twice in an hour, sometimes i go days without crashing. So wouldn't this test be likely inconclusive since not crashing can be attributed to "chance" since it is seemingly
 random?</p>

<h2>            Spectre&#47; meltdown patch ruined my PC&#33;</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I have a laptop that i use for work, its a&nbsp;Satellite m305 i3 64-bit windows 10 with 4GB of ram. I use it to transfer forensic cell phone downloads to a NAS box. Has physical analyzer,
 oxygen, secure view, phone detective, dart, etc .... &nbsp;It has around 25k of additional licensed software on it and</span><span>&nbsp;was working great.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While in the middle of a 5 day class on 1-31-17 right before lunch, I let it install a windows update, this update took more than 6 hours. Then all I got was a black screen, the hdd
 light continued to flicker so i let it for an addition 4 hours before I did a hard reset.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Powered it back up and did the same thing, several times. So I re-installed windows 10 with a flash drive. Now It takes around 18-20 mins to get to the sign-in screen, fan is stuck
 on high once I sign in, every program crashes (even the calculator), then it does random reboots between 2-10 mins. Ive tied to kill every process that i can. My disk usage and CPU are all high 90’s from system and other process I have to have. I can open
 the calculator ... once it opens , and sitting there for a while... it shows that process in the 90’s for the calculator, same with word or any other program that normally wouldn’t use any cpu while at idle. Then it just randomly shuts down&nbsp;</span><span>with
 no warning, starts back up and won’t let me sign in again for 18+ minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />Go to Settings&gt;System&gt;About to confirm.
<br />I am afraid, you might have to do a Reset as the system looks to be in a bad state:

            Here are several links about the problem and potential fixes for the specific symptoms
<br />
<br />2018 01 29- KB 4078130- UPDATE TO DISABLE MITIGATION AGAINST SPECTRE, VARIANT 2 – INTEL BUG
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4078130/update-to-disable-mitigation-against-spectre-variant-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/407813...</a> 
<br />
<br />Check Update History to confirm you have KB 4078130 installed. Rather than uninstalling KB4054892, which fixed other problems as well as creating the reboot problem (and others), MS has created KB4078130 to fix the problems/
<br />
<br />**********************************
<br />Optional Reading

<br />
<br />If you are interested, the “official” documentation for the above fix is in the links below.
<br />
<br />2018 01 29- “HIGHER THAN EXPECTED REBOOTS AND OTHER UNPREDICTABLE SYSTEM BEHAVIOR” - UPDATE TO DISABLE MITIGATION AGAINST SPECTRE, VARIANT 2 – FIX PROBLEM CREATED BY WIN UPDATE KB4056892

<br />
<br />In December very significant 3 bugs / defects in the “CPU” / computer chip made by Intel were announced.  In January some more bugs were announced. MS and Intel have released some updates to partially patch these problems.  But the patches were less than successful.  One of the side effects is unexpected reboots of the computer (sound familiar).
<br />
<br />So read the link above, and below, for more specific details about the problem and the update that may be able to partially fix the Intel inflicted problem.

    <title>Windows Performance Recorder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulxfox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Performance Recorder</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavilion dv6 laptop running Win 10, with AMD Turion Dual Core, 2.3 Ghz processor and 8gb memory, 64 bit OS. It being older it's never been blinding fast but lately it has become slooooow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using task manager I can see that during certain tasks the disk runs at a very high percentage and slows the pc to a crawl. When opening a picture or a Word doc the disk % goes up briefly to the low 90% range but then drops quickly back to less than 10%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when opening a browser (either Edge or Firefox) the disk goes up to 95-99% or even 100% and stays there for 30-40 seconds and sometimes minutes. If I turn off the wireless connection, the percentage often comes down but not always. Once I turn the
 wireless connection back on the percentage goes back up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a page loads the percentage drops back to 40-50% which still slows the pc but not to a standstill but if I open another tab or just navigate to a new web page/site the percentage goes up to high 90's again and often the browser becomes unresponsive
 for 10-15 seconds or longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across a community discussion suggesting using the Windows Performance Recorder. I downloaded the toolkit and recorded an ETL file using the recorder. I have saved it to Dropbox. I haven't used Dropbox much but the community discussion said to post
 a link to the file in this question. Here is what I hope is that link:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tnk0a0cgexj3nq/PAUL-LAPTOP.06-20-2016.12-19-45.etl?dl=0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>or this may be the link:&nbsp;&nbsp; https://www.dropbox.com/home?preview=PAUL-LAPTOP.06-20-2016.12-19-45.etl</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The first&nbsp;link is the correct one.<br />
<br />
The .etl file was not complete enough to help resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Check this link for Help with the Windows Performance Recorder (which is probably<br />
not required to resolve your issue).<br />

===================================================<br />
<br />
Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues with your model. There may be BIOS, chipset, or<br />
other updates available at HP.<br />

Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a

<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
Do all of these :<br />
<br />
If you had a 3rd&nbsp;party antivirus&nbsp;on the OS you upgraded OR if you&nbsp;have one<br />
now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender<br />
which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus.&nbsp;Despite&nbsp;all the hype&nbsp;out there<br />
Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are&nbsp;true superstars.<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
Right Click Start button - Control Panel - Troubleshooting - on right side click View all -
<br />
System Maintenance.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the<strong> major on-board and separate&nbsp;<br />
device&nbsp;</strong><strong>drivers</strong>.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update
<br />
those without&nbsp;Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            <p>HP shows no updates or drivers to download, also no BIOS update. Apparently this is such an old laptop there is no support, Bios date was June of 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the SFC and there were no errors/issues. I tried to run the 2 DISM processes but received an error message each time, error 87.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are no driver updates available from HP I have gone to Device Manager and have run through each driver and clicked on Update Driver under properties for each. They all said I have the latest driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Trend Micro Internet Security and have it installed on 3 computers in our house. I think I can do a full un-install and run Windows Defender then re-install TM after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the AMD site for drivers for the processor and display adapter, their auto find utility tool finds no drivers! Further reading says they do not offer support for Win 10. All updates for their products will be through Windows Updates which I
 receive automatically. Same for Broadcom for several drivers. Several other sites don't index their drivers in a way that I can find the right ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like these devices/drivers are just so old that they are going to be impossible to locate.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help so far.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Run DriverView as indicated above and check both HP and the actual device makers<br />
(such as Intel, AMD, RealTek, and many others).<br />
<br />
Sounds like there is a good chance the computer may not be fully Windows 10<br />
compliant - check with HP Support, documentation, and their forums.<br />
<br />

    <title>Update Issues With Windows 8.1 Pro OEM&#47;HELP&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle jennings  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Issues With Windows 8.1 Pro OEM&#47;HELP&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a brand new desktop for my mom to replace her older defective 1. The 1 I got for her is a Dell Inspiron 3647 &amp; it has Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit OEM on it. Installation of drivers &amp; some software went perfectly fine. The REAL pain-in-the-butt
 is trying to install updates! Before I started with updates this time, I opened cmd as admin, stopped wuauserv, bits, &amp; cryptsvc. I then pasted in the following commands that were supposed to make the update process "easier". (I was told by a Microsoft tech.)&nbsp;ren
 %windir%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old &amp;&nbsp;ren %windir%\System32\Catroot2 Catroot2.old After that was all done, I restarted cryptsvc, wuauserv, &amp; bits. After that, I obviously rebooted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then proceeded with updating. The 1st 13 updates went fine, but the update that I've been having problems with getting properly installed is: Security Update For Windows 8.1 For x64-based Systems (KB2961908) without KB2919355. I've tried all kinds of fixes:
 the troubleshooter built-in to Windows &amp; the 1 you can download WITH NO SUCCESS, I've also tried resetting my update components. (Also with no success.) I've even tried it AFTER reinstalling Windows, but I think it definitely has something to do with the fact
 that is an OEM version I'm using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few things you should know in case you're wondering: 1.) The pc/system is brand new &amp; has every single driver downloaded, installed &amp; updated properly. So it's NOT related to the drivers. 2.) This pc has practically NO hardware issues at all. (Obviously
 since it's brand new.) 3.) The pc itself is PERFECTLY clean; no corrupt system files, no infections such as malware, adware, spyware, viruses, etc. Not even any 3rd-party software except for Ccleaner which was downloaded from piriform.com. 4.) Before doing
 Windows Updates I change services slightly. (I change bits from Automatic Delayed Start to Automatic. I make sure Windows Update service is started. I change Windows Modules Installer by making it an Automatic startup type &amp; by starting the service to enable
 PROPER installation of Windows Updates as it DOES help. 5.) Technically, I DIDN'T post a question, but rather a problem description so ANYONE could help me better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs of this desktop are: Intel i3-4170 processor, 1TB Hard Drive, 4GB of ram. (If you need more details or information, feel free to drop me a line &amp; ask about it!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried SO many times regarding this update issue, but haven't had ANY success installing it. Quite literally, it gives me bad headaches trying to figure it out! I'm stumped! If anyone can provide me with a PERFECT solution to fix this issue, I'd be
 very grateful! :) Things I'm not willing to do that WOULDN'T fix the problem: system restore as that doesn't work, completely reinstalling windows which also doesn't help, registry backups. I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOMEONE HELP THIS DESPERATE EXPERT!! Got questions, ideas, suggestions, tips, etc? Hit me up with what you got &amp; I'll have to see if it helps or not! :)</p>
