    <title>Unable to sync outlook email on Windows Phone &#40;error 86000C0A&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crazyrhino87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to sync outlook email on Windows Phone &#40;error 86000C0A&#41; or Windows 8.1 Mail app &#40;&#34;not available&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago my Windows Phone 8 (Nokia Lumia 620) began popping up error 86000C0A every time I tried to check my email. I have @Outlook.com email, and it has been working perfectly well up until now. I can access my emails and everything via browser,
 but Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 Mail apps (on my PC and on my Asus tablet) refuse to sync, saying
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is unavailable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what's happening but I know that it's driving me crazy. I haven't made any significant changes to my account, except trying to change the password, hoping it would help. It didn't help. I have two-step verification activated but I had it active
 long before this error started showing up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Microsoft Account (including my @outlook.com email) is the only email I have set up on my phone. During error 86000C0A email sync is impossible but calendar and contacts sync just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling Microsoft Support in Croatia and they told me they don't provide help for that kind of issue. I Binged and Googled and Yahooed this error and the ONLY solution I found is changing something somewhere in Active Directory Users and Computers,
 ticking a box that say allow inheritable something... I have no access to that. I am in no domain, no enterprise or company, this is a private account and I'm just an end user. So please, no "solutions" like "go to Active Directory Users and Computers and
 allow inheritable permissions" because I CANNOT do that. I'm running plain old simple Windows 8.1 on my PC and on my tablet, no server versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone? Please, help.</p>

<p>What's even worse, these apps (Windows Phone, Mail app) do sync every now and then. For example, I've been out of town for 2 weeks and the Mail app on my PC says it last synced 17 days ago, even though there are fresh emails in there, from today. :S So it
 works... Sometimes. But I cannot send emails using Mail on my PC.</p>

            <p>Following a suggestion by someone somewhere to deactivate SMS and chat backup on the phone I did just that and the error is now gone. :) And even Mail apps on my Windows 8.1 devices began syncing normally. Try deactivating SMS backup and leave it be for
 a while (for me it didn't do trick immediately, but I was to **SG#FDG off by everything I set the phone aside and forgot about it, and when I checked it later everything was fine).</p>

<p>Did not work for me. Another thread recommended adding your mail address again as a separate non-linked box.&nbsp; This has worked - it seemes to use your provider's servers rather than hotmail</p>

            Yes, this was helpful. Both accounts synced correctly after a while. When I tried to activate SMS backup again, I got the same error after 3 days. It seems to me SMS backup should be permanently deactivated. SMS backup function is unusable. I hope Microsoft
 is going to correct it.

            First day after deactivating SMS backup email syncing was very intermittent and unstable but it stabilized after awhile and now it works. I won't be reactivating backup anytime soon, not until Microsoft fixes this mess. :S

            Well, I got another email sync error 85002012 as a complement to 86000C0A in my Windows Phone during email sync and Windows 8.1 Mail application didn't work correctly again. The solution is to disable Chat Backup in Windows Phone. After a while email sync
 works correctly again. Both backups - SMS &amp; Chat - have to be disabled in Windows Phone to Windows Live emails synchronized without sync errors?!

            <p>Currently the best cure is to disable SMS and Chat backup, as it seems. I can vouch for it being 95% effective, only sometimes Windows 8.1 Mail app starts acting again but for a short while only. And more and more people are contacting me lately with the
 same problem, it's amazing how this is spreading like a disease. :S</p>

            <p>It worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Soft reset the phone: press and hold Volume Down + Power button during 12 seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Open Internet Explorer (from phone) &gt; go to <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.live.com</a> &gt; sign in with the microsoft account we cannot sync on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Come back to the start screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Go to settings &gt; email and account &gt; press and hold the account &gt; tap on sync</p>
<p>or Go to settings &gt; email and account &gt; add an account &gt; microsoft account</p>

            <p>I had a similar issue 800c0008 error with outlook on windows phone 8.1 refusing to sync and OneDrive not working. I used the browser to access outlook or told me a problem had occurred but still allowed me t check mail. Then it told me that some conditions
 had changed (didn't let me read them) and I pressed the continue buttons expecting some t&amp;cs to appear. It just took M to my inbox. Since clicking continue, outlook mail syncs fine on the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can surmise is that outlook will not sync until it has told you that some t&amp;cs have changed and you have pressed the continue button.</p>

            That particular cover page (as well as the other elements in the 'set') is supplied with Word 2007 &amp; 2010 for Windows as a part of the Building Blocks. AFAIK it isn't available for download because it isn't a stand-alone template.<br />
<br />
If you can get your document to a system running one of those versions of Word you can insert building block elements there from the Quick Parts gallery.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile - Outlook - Your Account Settings Are Out Of Date</h2>
                    <p>I have set up a BTinternet email account on a Lumia 650 and nothing will sync across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both using the automatic settings and manually filling in the server settings from BT's website.
</p>
<p>I also tried using the Yahoo set up as BT use Yahoo for their email service. No matter what I try, it always tells me the "Account Settings Are Out Of Date"</p>
<p>I have removed and re-added the account, as well as having done a full reset of the phone and I am still encountering the same issue. I have updated app and the phone to the latest versions available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The username and password for the account are definitely correct as I have signed in on a computer using the same credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered similar issues and found a way to overcome this or have any suggestions as to what I could be missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Let's try to refresh your phone, we suggest that you perform a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft
 reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply regarding the result.</p>

            I've had exactly the same problem for weeks now. Password etc. are definitely correct (checked in webmail). Tried soft reset repeatedly, hard reset twice. Sent phone back to manufacturer - they've returned it, saying it's fixed, but it's just the same.
 AAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH. Did you sort it out?

<p>After hours, i did get it to work.</p>
<p>Manually set up up the inbox with the IMAP settings.</p>
<p>Mail.btinternet.com:903:1</p>
<p>Mail.btinternet.com:465:1</p>
<p>(You might want to double check those numbers at the end, i writing this from memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the thing that seemed to fix it is that we used an old password for the account. So even though the password and been successfully changed and worked on the computer, the phone wanted the old password. Once i put that in, it worked straight away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

            You can type three asterisks ( *** ) or three underscores ( ___ ) followed by a return and it will be converted to a horizontal line automatically. This will only work with HTML messages.

    <title>Hyperlinking to hidden slides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidvanwijk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyperlinking to hidden slides</h2>
                    <p>I've build a SlideDoc (combination slide deck + document) within PowerPoint. Within this deck there are many slides shown and many are hidden. The hidden slides are accessed by clicking on hyperlinks which are on the shown slides (for a deep drive on the
 topic). The problem is this: once you've accessed a hidden slide it will be part of the shown slides and not longer be hidden, that is until you leave presentation-mode. So the hidden slides are unhidden once accessed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I experience here is the following: If you have a index-slide with many hyperlinks to hidden slides you can go back and forth a few times but eventually all slides are unhidden and your deck becomes quite large and hard to transition between slides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be solved some how? I hope I made my problem clear. I understand that it is quite specific.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With Kind Regards,</p>

            <p>It isn't that straightforward the slides are not truly hidden if you link to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you link to a hidden slide PPT assumes that if you go <strong>back</strong> you want to see it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you jump<strong> before</strong> the hidden slide it will probably not show moving forward.</p>

<p>Hi SJ20035,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get the error message when you want to add this domain to Office 365 Portal? Based on my check with nslookup, it displays it's Non-existent domain. Could you check if there are some typos for it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, after you register the domain, have you set up name server for it. We need to host domain DNS&nbsp; records in some DNS hosting. For this part, you may consult the support from your domain provider.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

1. press the start button<br />
2. press the lock button<br />
3. press the lock button again to show the slider<br />
4. finally slide up (at the right side because the <em>LEFT SIDE*</em> of the screen won't respond at this point)<br />

 don't work for 1-5 seconds.<br />

I can unlock the "freeze" by scrolling on the home screen.<br />
</span></strong><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It is why I believe it to be a software bug instead of a touch screen sensor issue.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've chosen to show this example in the video because I could reproduce it easily. In this case the bug is trivial and not more than annoying.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But the "<em>LEFT SIDE*</em> issue" manifested itself &nbsp;on other occasions as well: like&nbsp;</span><strong>answering
 a phone call</strong><span><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span></span><strong>hanging up a phone call</strong><span><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span></span><strong>snoozing

 of the screen).</span></span><strong><span><span>AND THOSE AREN'T TRIVIAL ISSUES&nbsp;ANY MORE!</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&gt; Can anybody reproduce this issue on their own phone, or am I the only one?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">--&gt; Does this strike you as a software problem too?</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>PS: And I agree with a number of people on this thread:<br />
<strong>Please Microsoft, open a dedicated website</strong> for posting issues like this and what other people posted in this thread.<br />
A WP7 app would even be more fitting.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Typing&#47;Keyboard Not Working</h2>
                    I have Office 2016. When I type, nothing appears in Word or Excel. I can use any other program outside of Office, even in the search items within Word. When I'm in the document part, nothing works. I've re-installed and rebooted, confirmed my registration
 and software is up to date, but nothing seems to fix it.&nbsp;What am I doing wrong?&nbsp;

    <title>Draw with touch not working in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frpius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Draw with touch not working in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have typed up a letter in Word 2016 to which I would like to add a signature. &nbsp;I have a touchscreen laptop. &nbsp;I click on the "Draw with touch" button under the "Draw" tab on the ribbon. &nbsp;I attempt to sign the screen (with my finger, not a pen) and instead
 of drawing, the screen moves. &nbsp;I was able to get it to draw once, but it immediately moved the parts drawn to a different part of the document. &nbsp;When I open a new, blank document, it seems to work correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at File&gt;Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Pen and the setting to "Use pen to select and interact with content by default" &nbsp;is
<strong>not</strong> checked (although, since I'm not using a pen, it shouldn't make a difference). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

Hmmmm. &nbsp;I checked the link and my version of Word does not have a "Start Inking" button under the "Review" tab. &nbsp;Maybe I don't have the current version? &nbsp;Word says I have Microsoft Office 365, version 16.0.7070.2033. &nbsp;It is set to automatically download and
 install updates. &nbsp;Is this just an updating issue?

    <title>Can you combine multiple open Excel files into one Workbook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brunette7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you combine multiple open Excel files into one Workbook&#63;</h2>
                    I need to place multiple excel files into one workbook. Is there a way to do this easily without having to copy &amp; paste each one individually and placing them into one workbook (multiple tabs)? Depending on the week, I could be copying &amp; pasting over a
 100 individual files. Hoping (fingers crossed) there is an easy way to do this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

<h2>            Cannot edit or save a Word document to my One Drive on my Samsung S2 tablet</h2>
                    <p>My organization has an Office 365 account, and I have a business OneDrive account. On my tablet, I can access my files from my business OneDrive, but I cannot make any edits to my Word files, which are in "Read-only" mode. The heading at the top of the Word
 file is "This account does not allow editing on your device. For an account with full access, contact your organization about your Office 365 plan." I can, however access and edit my files on my home computer, so I believe there is a bug with OneDrive and
 allowing the use of tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any work-around for this issue?</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To edit your files normally on your phone and tablet, you need to use an account with related license to activate your Office clients.</p>
<p>Based on your info, your account doesn't has related license as below to activate your Office:</p>

<h2>            Facebook notifications not coming through Outlook</h2>
                    Outlook is only retrieving / receiving Facebook notifications haphazardly. I have my FB privacy settings set correctly to receive notifications. Some come through but many dont'. Follow-up comments on a thread are also pretty much ignored. I've added Facebook.com
 to my allowed sites. This wasn't happening with Hotmail.

<h2>            OneNote Windows 10 Custom Template Use</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a function in Windows 10 app version of OneNote to save an empty version of a Notebook and re-use as a template. I need to begin each client file notebook with 4x sets of labelled Section Group with several pages in each with Page headings
 and formatted details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please advise how to do this in Windows 10 verison. I have until the most recent Windows update been doing this in Office 16 version by re-using a blank, pre-formatted notebook saved as a .onepkg file. However, the recent update means that .onepkg
 file will not be opened by either OneNote Office or OneNote Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help urgently. I cannot find any tutorial or help info on this topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>@Microsoft Agent / Moderator: As usual, your answer has nothing to do with the question. Yes, you identified the term "template" and happily posted anything you could find containing that word. This is *not* about page templates in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@EchoHaronga:</p>
<p>Quite a good method you established there to recreate a notebook structure using ONEPKG files as a template. Unfortunately, only the "old" desktop versions of OneNote for Windows (OneNote 2010, 2013, 2016) are supporting ONEPKG files, but not the OneNote
 app for Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned "not be opened by either OneNote Office or OneNote Windows". I'm not sure which OneNote versions you are referring to, as OneNote 2016 (or earlier) will still allow to create new notebooks based on a ONEPKG file. Exception: If you downloaded
 and installed the free version of OneNote 2016 and did not add it to an existing Office (2016, 365, 2019), the support for local notebook files (including ONEPKG) would be blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from that, here is a method independent of ONEPKG files that could be worth a try (I did not test it, so it's theory):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assume, your "template notebook" is regularly&nbsp;stored on OneDrive or OneDrive for business (not as a ONEPKG file, just a regular notebook structure). You could use your web browser and login to OneDrive (or OneDrive for Business), locate the link file
 to that notebook (the one that looks like it would be a notebook file with the correct name; in fact it's just a small link file pointing to the hidden folder and file structure of the notebook, but that does not matter here) and simply copy it. After that,
 rename that copy to get a new notebook file with the same structure and content as the original one. The copying of that mentioned link file alone should create a new complete notebook file structure in the background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that works, you just have to make sure somehow, that nobody ever changes/edits your "master notebook".</p>

<p>@SWischer - many thanks for the support and the idea, I am keen to try any theory! Since the updates are prone to strike at any moment and disrupt default app settings which were a pain to reset manually not to mention the reinstall of ON 2016, it would
 be so nice to have a solution that doesn’t rely on an app that’s being phased out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>@EchoHaronga - As stated below your template file will need to be moved into OneNote into SharePoint or OneDrive (personal or business) and then you will have to "save a copy" before starting work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@ALL - FYI PAGE TEMPLATES ARE SUPPORTED IF ALREADY SETUP</p>
<p>
</p><p>While loosely related I wanted to share that, I recently got a new Surface and found the disappointment that everyone did in OneNote not being part of the 2019 Office package.&nbsp; However once I was in there I discovered that all of our existing page templates
 that were setup in OneNote files stored in both OneDrive and our Team SharePoint storage ALL support the official Template just like in OneNote Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not finding anywhere to edit the template other than using Office 2016, but it clearly loads the template when I open a new page in the interface if that is of consolation to anyone searching for "OneNote page template"</p>

<p>Yes, I have just discovered the same thing. My templates are lost in stand alone Onenote.</p>
<p>The work around for now is to simply copy a page with similar format and headings etc. - but not ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be another retrograde release to Onenote.</p>

<p>I understand that you are receiving spam emails in your account. Let me help you with that.</p>

<p>I suggest that you configure your junk email filters to Exclusive and add all your contacts to Safe sender's list so that the only emails you will receive is from your contacts. Please follow the steps below on how to do it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Configure Junk email filter to Exclusive</strong></p>

<p>3. Under "Preventing junk email", select <strong>Filters and reporting</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Under "Choose a junk email filter", select <strong>Exclusive.</strong></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Save.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Save contacts in Safe sender's list</strong>.</p>
<p>1. In Outlook.com Option page, under "Preventing junk email" select <strong>Safe and blocked senders</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under "<span>Safe and blocked senders</span>", click <strong>Safe senders</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Type your contacts in the bar under "Sender or domain to mark as safe:" and then click
<strong>Add to list &gt;&gt;.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also suggest that you&nbsp;report the sender of the abusive emails to our Abuse team. Please read the article below on how to do it:</p>

<p>I need to change my Skype ID, but can't find how to.</p>
<p>Having spent a bit of time, it seems to me that it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Please let me know if that is the case ... if not... please let me know how to change it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not managing to change it, I decided to close/delete the account, and open a new one where I can then choose an ID i want; but again it seemed to me that the system was attempting to close my entire Microsoft account ... not just Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed some light and help me, please?<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Kamran
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. My sincere apologies. It is not possible to change Skype ID / Skype Name. This is one of the heavily demanded features and under consideration by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />However, you can change your Display Name.
<br />
<br />Login to your account
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />
<br />Click on Edit Profile &gt; Edit Profile to enable in Edit mode &gt; You can change your Display Name here
<br />
<br />B. Since Skype account is attached to your Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed if you close your Skype account which means all your Microsoft services will be impacted. Hence, it is not recommended to close a Skype account.
<br />
<br />However process to close Skype account is below (if you need)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>How do I add a phone-only contact&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add a phone-only contact&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For many years, we have been signed up for the expensive world phone subscription so that we could use Skype to communicate with European relatives. For the most part these are old people who don't have Skype accounts. We just call their landlines. Today
 we had to add a new phone-only contact and found that there is no longer a way of doing that. The Search Contacts function only looks for Skype accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used the workaround that has been suggested online of using &nbsp;the dialpad to dial the number. This worked, and now the number is in our Recently Called list. But we would like to make her into a real Skype contact that we can refer to again if she ages
 out of the Recently Called list with inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just a bug that will one day be fixed, or does it mean that Skype-to-phone calling is being phased out?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Word document, click on

<p>You can Ctrl+z or click the undo icon in the quick link menu. Or don't save the changes when you close the file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe...Go to the start menu and&nbsp; "run" <em><strong>%temp%</strong>&nbsp; </em><br />
Find&nbsp;a recent&nbsp;file with the pub prefix, change the .tmp extension to .pub, try opening the file. It might have the deleted page.</p>
