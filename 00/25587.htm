<p><span>Hi Becki,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue just occurred when the browser set to Chrome, you could upgrade the Chrome to the latest version and check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, actually there is a dedicated team to troubleshoot the Outlook for Mac client issue, please go to the in-app support:<strong>
 Help</strong> menu &gt;<strong> Contact Support.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Your understanding is highly appreciated!</span></p>

<p>I agree with Baron: It looks like a Chrome issue.</p>
<p>From what I know, Outlook simply parses the link to the System which then sends it to the default web browser. If it’s working in Safari, something seems to be off in the version of Chrome you have.</p>
<p>Do you ever have the issue clicking links from other apps?</p>

<p>Two solutions have been offered from other users that fix this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the Chrome cache</li><li>Update Chrome</li></ul>
<p>It seems to occur when sites change from http protocol to https</p>

            <p>TO: Ramesh Kumar</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I'll try to be deliberate and logical about my own response to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The most recent change has been updating to IE 11 and Comcast changing their home page.</p>
<p>2. I am getting no error message.&nbsp; I click on Favorites in toolbar or the gold star, the click add to favorites and nothing happens beyond that point.</p>
<p>3. I've checked the favorites folder every time to make sure the requested add didn't just appear some place else.&nbsp; And, yes, the favorites already there still work just fine.&nbsp; It's just the adding of new that doesn't work.&nbsp; The little screen asking where
 to put the new favorite never appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1</p>
<p>I haven't tried this yet.&nbsp; Is it from Microsoft?&nbsp; And safe to use?&nbsp; I'm a very long time end user, but don't like to mess around in places I'm unsure of (I started using computers in 1984).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2</p>
<p>I don't see any add-on that's new, unusual, unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3</p>
<p>I keep casches, browsing history&nbsp;and temp files cleared regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure of myself in trying to respond to your message.&nbsp; I hope this gets through to you properly.</p>

            <p>TO: Ramesh Kumar,</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your time, effort and information.&nbsp; I've done the Fix IE Issues and Reset IE Settings options, both with negative results regarding my&nbsp;Add to&nbsp;Favorites.&nbsp; I've tried turning off Pop-Up Blocker, also, but still no change in Add to&nbsp;Favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the years have progressed with all our technology, I've often expressed the thought that we are probably fortunate when our computers work as well as they do because of all the unimaginable intricacies and possibilities that could go wrong, what with
 so many different applications, programs, etc. being involved.&nbsp; Looks like I've just hit one of those roadblocks, doesn't it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IP is Comcast and they have recently changed their home page.&nbsp; Early on it was filled with constantly running videos that seemed to clog my computer, but now they seem to have changed that to where the videos run only after being selected.&nbsp; However, for
 quite some time (before this home page change)&nbsp;their videos don't run when I select them&nbsp;and they haven't&nbsp;been able to supply a remedy for that.&nbsp; Then, yesterday, my Kaspersky anti-virus began alerting that Comcast phishing&nbsp;attempts were being captured.&nbsp; I
 think my life might be better without Comcast, but I'm not aware of favorable alternatives where I live.&nbsp; I'm not sure that this has anything to do with the Add Favorites feature, but thought it might give you a hint at something helpful.&nbsp;

            <p>Reply to Microsoft query as to whether my problem is fixed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short answer is NO, it has not.&nbsp; I've tried all the suggestions with negative results and still can't use ADD FAVORITES.&nbsp; Seems to be beyond techs, so, of course, it's beyond me - the lowly end-user.&nbsp; I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to.&nbsp;
 As you can see, I didn't even receive a reply to my last response.&nbsp; What puzzles me is how technology seems to progress at such a rapid rate, with corresponding $$ increases beyond comprehension, but with each so-called improvement, there are lapses left in
 the dust and we end-users are just supposed to keep paying through the nose and forget about the errors, omissions and deletions of the past.&nbsp; Some of us don't have the $$ to keep paying out more and more and some of us like where we are and don't want the
 "new and improved."&nbsp; It's like a never-ending roller coaster ride and it's not so fun any more except for those who run the thing and collect the $$.&nbsp; Some of us just want to relax and enjoy the scenery.&nbsp; Is there a way for that to happen?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue with the latest SkyPE version downloaded just now off the Apple store (v 8.18.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A whole bunch of email addresses appear in contacts list under the "Echo/Sound Test" entry for which I have absolutely no idea who they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I block these users, their names/email addresses still appear. And there does not appear to be any way to remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I find this rather troubling - particularly for younger School age users who's schools ask them to use SkyPe for remote Language lessons.&nbsp; I would clearly not wish to have some unsavory person being listed as a contact for my Kids SkyPe installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Web version of SkyPe however, does not appear to have this issue, but the web version does not appear to be available upon my iPhone ... attempts to manually access the web url:&nbsp; web.skype.com&nbsp; result in a message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry, Skype for Web isn't available on this device yet."&nbsp;<br />
"Please try it on your desktop computer instead"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It may be prudent for Microsoft to withdraw the current iPhone version from the Apple store if it has a Privacy/Safety issue.</p>

    <title>Error 2110 cant set focus help - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error 2110 cant set focus help</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have a form and on this form I have a required combo boxs that needs to have a selection before entering data into my categories combo box so I put in the catagories (Got Focus)</p>
<p>If IsNull(cboDepartment) Or cboDepartment = "" Then<br />
<br />
&nbsp; cboDepartment.SetFocus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Selection must be entered in DEPARTMENT first", vbCritical, "Selection Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End If</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it works great BUT I added code in the forms unload event to verify that data is being entered in required combo boxes ant text boxes threw out the form using the tag and if so it sets focus to the control. the problem is it sets focus to that categories
 combo box first if its empty then I get the error 2110.</p>
<p>How can I fix this? The code below is my on unload event.</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)<br />
<br />
If CheckControls = True Then Cancel = True: Exit Sub<br />
<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Function CheckControls() As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim Msg As String<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enumerate through the Form's Controls and check those that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'contain something within the Tag property.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each Ctrl In Me.Controls<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If the control's Tag property contains something then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Ctrl.Tag = "*" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Since our other controls are Text Bxes or Combo Boxes, we can check<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'them for Null (nothin entered)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Nz(Ctrl, "") = "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Nope, no data so set up a message and get outta this loop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Msg = "You must provide data for the '" &amp; Ctrl.Controls(0).Caption<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next Ctrl<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If there is a Message then we obviously have issues.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Inform the User, cancel the update and or Form closure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Msg &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Msg = Msg &amp; vbCr &amp; vbCr &amp; "Would you like to fill in the above mentioned Field?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(Msg, vbExclamation + vbYesNo, "Insufficient Data Entry") = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CheckControls = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl.SetFocus<br />

<p>My usual approach is to avoid setting focus to any control when you are alerting the user about missing data. I find that users can easily find where to put in any missing data without any set focus being done for them.&nbsp; I often mark required controls with
 a different border color, a bold format for the control's label and an asterix in the control's label.</p>
<p>I always avoid using SetFocus unless it is absolutely necessary, due to&nbsp;the type of issues that you are having.</p>
<p>I would just change the code below by removing the line that says&nbsp; Ctrl.SetFocus</p>
<p>CheckControls = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl.SetFocus</p>

<p>Ok, I could do that but I would like to set focus to the control. Any other work arounds? I also had another problem with my code im using in the unload event.It always checks the form even if I never entered any information. What code could I add to it
 that would avoid checking the form if nothing is entered or its a new record with no info? Thanks</p>

<p>As you found, the form's Unload event is too late. The record has already been saved by this time.</p>
<p>Instead use the BeforeUpdate event of the Form (not controls.) This is the last event the fires before the record is saved. If you cancel this event, the bad data is not saved in the table.</p>
<p>Here's an example of checking for a blank control. The code is designed so you can duplicate the first If block to check other controls also:</p>
<p>Private Sub Form_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strMsg As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strControl As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNull(Me.SomeControl) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancel = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMsg = strMsg &amp; "SomeControl can't be blank." &amp; vbCrLf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strControl = "SomeControl"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Cancel Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMsg = strMsg &amp; "Oops:" &amp; strMsg &amp; "Correct, or press &lt;Esc&gt; to undo."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox strMsg, vbExclamation, "Invalid data"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If strControl &lt;&gt; vbNullString Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me(strControl).SetFocus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>

<p>Allen, I tried your code and when it sets focus to the cboCategories the error went away but when I click on the combo box there isnt any selection because I havent selected anything from the cboDepartment combo box yet. my cboCatigories is dependant on
 the cboDepartment combo box. is there anyway in my code thats in the unload event I can set focus to the cbodepartment combo box if the cboCatigories doesnt have a selection yet? For some reason the first thing it checks is the cboCatigories could I just fix
 that and have the first thing checked would be the department?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chad</p>

<p>You can modify the code so it performs IsNull() on the before the other, and sets focus to the desired one.</p>
<p>The main point is that Form_Unload is too late. The horse has already escaped the stable.</p>

            <p>Some random thoughts, which may or may not be relevant...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If hitting play again makes it work, that might be a race condition, where something else is still calculating. Test with:</p>
<p>DoEvents</p>
<p>added right before you export to pdf and see if that helps</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, I'd add a line between your current third and fourth lines:</p>
<p>debug.print A</p>
<p>So I could see if there was anything weird going on with the filepath (assuming the FC directory already exists, I wouldn't expect a problem, but better to check everything)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in the habit of specifying ranges a little differently, so I don't know if there are any issues there. Maybe also add:</p>
<p>Debug.print range("summary").address</p>
<p>so you can confirm that there is a current range selected. If the code blows up, check the immediate window to see if there was a valid range. Good practice is to remove all debug.print statements in your final version, but it is helpful for testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I tend not to use named ranges very often in VBA, my range descriptions often start with a sheet or similar reference, e.g. Sheet1.range(address), but again, that may not be necessary with named ranges, I don't know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it's a bug. But there's a workaround documented by Jon Peltier in his blog post&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://peltiertech.com/invert-if-negative-excel-2007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Invert if Negative in Excel 2007</a>
<p>Summary: don't use a solid fill color. Use a gradient fill color with gradient stops set to appear like solid fill. Example quote below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Quote:</p>
The Magical Gradient
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have to admit that I do not understand why this magical gradient works. If I did, I probably wouldn’t call it magical. Mr. Lapajne is either a genius or a madman, or perhaps he swiped the gradient from another genius or madman like I’ve swiped it from him.
 In any case, the gradient requires four stops, described below:</p>

            Hello Linda,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
I would like to gather additional information for better assistance.<br />
<br />
1) What type of email account are you working on? Is it POP3, IMAP or Exchange server email account?<br />
2) Do you find the red squiggly line under the misspelled word in the template that you're using for auto reply?<br />
<br />
There is no option to perform spell check for the auto reply content. <br />
<br />
You may create the automatic reply template by composing a new mail message e and check if it helps:<br />
<br />
a) Open new mail message window.<br />
b) Create the template and press <b>F7 </b>to perform spell check.<br />
c) Copy the content and go to <b>File </b>and select <b>Automatic Replies (Out of Office)</b>.
<br />
d) Select Send automatic replies, right click in the area to create automatic reply and paste the content and click
<b>OK</b>.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let me know if you need further help on this issue.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />

 Bing from my mobile device, which uses a google email, I was able to see.&nbsp; So I did a few more searches using Bing on my mobile device and when I went to Bing on my laptop I saw the history info there.&nbsp; Not sure how this is possible because it appears I am
 not logged in to my Microsoft account on my mobile device; when I go to MSN.com and go to my email account, it wants me to put in my log in credentials.&nbsp;

<p>

            If you close your Microsoft account, in addition to not being able to sign in to or access Skype, you'll no longer be able to sign in to other Microsoft consumer products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows.
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br /> 
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you don’t continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page. You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in to cancel the closure.

            <p>Hi frane3025,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. I'm pleased to assist you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to verify, by saying "the point size of my text is miniscule", are you pertaining to the font size of texts when you're composing emails? If yes, please refer to the steps below on how to change the default&nbsp;font size of the texts in your composed emails:</p>
<ol>
<li>From your<strong> Inbox</strong>, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> found on the upper right corner beside your name.
</li><li>Go to <strong>More mail settings</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Writing email</strong>, select <strong>Message font and signature</strong>.<br />
Under <strong>Message font</strong>, click the fifth button from the left side in the formatting toolbar and select your preferred font size.
</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Feel free to post back if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Region settings changed on its own</h2>
                    I logged on to the computer today and went to Bing search page to look for something but found almost everything written in Chinese, except for the word 'bing' and some other tabs were in English. When i checked into settings i found that the region had
 changed to People's Republic of China on its own, and no matter how much I tried it wouldn't change to any other region. I am utterly confused today. Is Bing celebrating The Lunar Year today or has my computer been attacked by a virus?? I don't live in China,
 the automatic date and time settings do show correct time and date as per my location, none of the other apps show otherwise either. Then why only for Bing settings? Please help!!

<h2>            Can&#39;t paste from Preview into Word&#63; Was able to a few weeks ago can&#39;t now. Help&#63;</h2>
                    I selected a portion of an internet search.&nbsp; It was saved as a screen shot.&nbsp; I opened the screen shot with Preview, selected it and tried to paste it into a Word document.&nbsp; The document was pasted as blank space.&nbsp; Then I tried to paste the document into
 Text Edit, which worked just fine.&nbsp; I tried to paste the document from Text Edit into Word.&nbsp; The document was pasted as blank space again.&nbsp; I had been able to do this type of pasting in the past, but now it seems that I can't.&nbsp; My Word program is fully updated
 and so is my Mac operating system.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to solve my problem?

<h2>            BUG&#58; Wrong grouping of TRUE&#47;FALSE values in a PivotTable with a Data Model</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered a Bug while working with (Power)Pivot in Excel 2013. You can replicate the issue with the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Create a simple source table with the following data:</p>
<p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>Important</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test 01</td>
<td>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Test 02</td>
<td>TRUE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test 03</td>
<td>FALSE</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>2) Create a PivotTable based on&nbsp;this source table with the option&nbsp;"Add this data to the Data Model" checked</p>
<p>3) Then use the "Important" column as ROWS and the "Name" column as VALUES. You'll get the following result: 1x (blank) and 2x FALSE</p>
<p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Row Labels</td>
<td>Count of Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>(blank)</span></td>
<td><span>1</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span><strong>FALSE</strong></span></td>
<td><span>1</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span><strong>FALSE</strong></span></td>
<td><span>1</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grand Total</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>When creating the PivotTable <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without</span> the option to add a data model, you'll get the correct result: 1x (blank), 1x FALSE and 1x TRUE</p>

<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Row Labels</td>
<td>Count of Title</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>(blank)</span></td>
<td><span>1</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>FALSE</span></td>
<td><span>1</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>TRUE</span></td>
<td><span>1</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Grand Total</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

            But why is it working without the Data Model option checked? I came across this issue while working with PowerPivot to analyse external SQL Data. I'll convert the boolean entries to text inside the SQL view, but it still would be nice if MS provides a
 fix for this Bug :-)

            Hi Tom,
<div><br />
<div>You're correct that Office 2008 <b>does</b>&nbsp;support PowerPC machines. While I'm not sure what caused your issue, I'm confident that a manual uninstall will resolve your issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The following link explains how to completely remove Office 2008 from your Mac:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to completely remove Office 2008 for Mac</a></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Follow all of the steps listed there, reboot your Mac and then reinstall Office 2008. After that, you should have no issues with applications crashing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if this helps!</div>

            The sound is most probably from the Theme you are currently using. Change the theme to the ones which came in the Fone like "Black", "Bronze", "Nokia" or "Palm". These themes do not have slide sound embedded in them. If you still want to use your current
 theme but without the slide sound, I suggest you download the "Carbide UI Theme Editor for Nokia site and edit your current theme using this program and remove the sound from the theme itself.

<h2>            Outlook 2011 - Cannot add certificates to contact</h2>
                    I have really run out of ideas here. &nbsp;All that I am trying to do is add certificates to contacts that I have in my address book. &nbsp;When I go to the "Details" tab in an email and try to "Add Encryption Certificate to Contacts" it never shows up on the contact.
 &nbsp;When I download the certificate manually then go to the contact hit the "+" button and try to add it, it seems like it is adding it but never shows up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far I have done a "rebuild" on the identity, created a new identity and tried every which way to add the certificates. &nbsp;They just will not add... &nbsp;If anyone could help me out with this issue I would very much appreciate it!</div>

<h2>            Help, I&#39;ve lost my identity and can&#39;t get up.</h2>
                    <p>Right now I cannot use the original microsoft account I used with Office Live. &nbsp;This is preventing me from conducting business as MSFT has my website and I can't get at it. &nbsp;If I try to sign in it Microsoft says I don't exist. &nbsp;If I try to create an account
 it says there already is one. &nbsp;Microsoft support gets one to product experts but no one seems to know about account and identity management. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result my account names and identities have multiplied. &nbsp;Does anyone have any idea how to manage this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t regain access to my hotmail account ever since I got a new computer.</h2>
                    I recently got a new computer and wanted to play an old online game I used to play. The email registered with that game is a hotmail account that I occasionally used. I went to log into that email and got an error message that read
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;"<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It looks like someone else might be using your account</span>

<div>
<p>To help you—and only you—get back into *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, we need to verify that it's yours."</p>
<p>I clicked next and got a page that said</p>
<p>"<span>How do you want to receive your security code?"</span></p>
<p>And it gave me the option of emailing a yahoo email account that has been deleted or saying I can't verify my account. Well I had to pick the option saying I can't verify my account because yahoo deleted my other email. So then
 it says</p>
<p>"<span>You can still get back into this account by filling out a questionnaire. We'll get back
 to you within 24 hours (typically a lot sooner). Go to:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://g.live.com/9uxp9cdp/cdp-en-us?mn=mr_t-im%40hotmail.com&amp;cxt=AC&amp;ru=https%3a%2f%2flogin.live.com%2flogin.srf%3flc%3d1033%26sf%3d1%26id%3d288908%26tw%3d18000%26fs%3d0%26ts%3d-5%26sec%3d%26mspp_shared%3d1%26seclog%3d0%26wa%3dwsignin1.0%26wp%3dLBI%26ru%3dhttp%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fMSAccount%2fSignIn%2fSignIn.aspx%253fRedirectionTo%253d%25252fcontactus%25252f%25253fws%25253dsupport%252526SegNo%25253d1%252526wa%25253dwsignin1.0%2525252cwsignin1.0%252526lc%25253d1033&amp;mkt=EN-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr</a>"</p>
<p>I have since filled out that questionnaire five different times (and since you can only fill it out twice a day I've been at this for a few days) providing what I feel is adequate information to get my account back but I keep
 receiving emails on my gmail account that say</p>
<p>"<b><span>Your security is important to us</span></b></p>
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Recently, we received several requests to gain access to&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your ownership using the information that was provided. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal information, and our careful account recovery
 process is intended to protect you from any possible malicious activity."</span></div>
<div><font color="#222222"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222">And so I contacted microsoft's live chat support where I talked to Paige whom I thought would listen to what I have to say and help me back into my email. Nope! I got the feeling Paige didn't
 read anything I had to say she just told me to post a question here and the Microsoft Experts will further assist me. And then she ended the session when I wasn't done talking.&nbsp;<br />
</font>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I'm a little irritated about this whole situation. I don't understand why I have to verify my account if I have the correct password. I don't understand why getting a new computer caused this whole problem. I never moved. My computer is sitting at the exact
 same spot my old one was. I don't understand why the information I filled out in the questionnaire wasn't sufficient. I don't even know if I can be helped at this point.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Using COUNTIF across multiple worksheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> payrollnorth canterbury sports  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using COUNTIF across multiple worksheets</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a workbook that includes several worksheets from which I need to extract certain answers onto a cumulative worksheet.&nbsp; To be less general, I have put accident reports in an Excel workbook, one sheet per accident.&nbsp; I need to know for example how many
 times a particular type of accident happened where staff were involved as one example. I am having difficulty getting Excel to pick-up the data on the additional sheets.&nbsp; I am currently using the following on the Report sheet to calculate:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM(COUNTIFS(Sheet6!B21,"First Aid",Sheet6!C18,"Staff/Employee"),COUNTIFS(Sheet7!B21,"First Aid",Sheet7!C18,"Staff/Employee"))</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am having to manually add the sheets as they are completed, rather than Excel picking up on them.&nbsp; Is there actually a way to do this? I am trying to save time going over the data and entering it into a report monthly for our Trustees manually
 by putting it all in Excel and let the program do the work, but it's not working.&nbsp; I've spent all day (6 hrs) researching ways to do it, but I'm getting no where.&nbsp;

</p><p>You can enter sheet names in cells B1 (Sheet2), B2 (Sheet3), B3 (Sheet4) and name this range TabList (B1:B3). You can update the named range TabList every time you add/include a worksheet by expanding the TabList - in cell B4 you enter Sheet5 and TabList
 is to be expanded to (B1:B4).</p>

<p>
</p><p>This should be a simple way to use COUNTIFS across multiple sheets. Please note that the named range should not have blank cells.</p>
