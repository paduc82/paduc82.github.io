            When did you last log into the account? If you don't log in at least once a year, the account is inactive and the only way to recover it is if you have the password - resetting the password wont work.  If you haven't accessed the account in 5 years it will be deleted. 
<br />
<br />If it has been less than 1 year since you last logged in, see

<br />ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.

<h2>            Form Controls Disappearing&#47;Reappearing Excel 2016 on Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hello- I manage a small company with about 30 instances of office 2016 running on Windows 10. I wish I could say everyone is on the same exact version of excel 2016 and the exact same version of windows 10. They're not. They're all pretty close, but not
 exact. But everyone is definitely on Office 2016 that has been updated within the last few months and same goes with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they are all having problems with Form Controls in Excel. Mostly problems with sliders in excel: The sliders are disappearing. They only come back if you click on the spot the disappeared. Everyone is having this happen and its happening on all workbooks.
 As a test, I tried to replicate the issue in Office 2013 and even Office 10. Everything works fine. I've tried turning hardware graphics accleration on and off in Office 2016 and the problem still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone seen this or have an idea of something I can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx!a</p>

            Hi William
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<h2>            6230i help</h2>
                    Lo all, I've got a 6230i and its recently developed a problem, if someone rings me I can hear them on the phone but they can't hear me, whereas if I ring someone I can hear them and they can hear me, it works perectly fine unless someone rings me then
 the other person can't hear me. Because this only happens when someone is ringing me, it leads me to believe it might not be a hardware fault and be software related? Has anyone had this problem and does anyone know the best way of going about to fix it? Thanks

            please read carefully before using factory settings.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem when i first bought my phone (6230i).<br />
I just put the phone back to factory settings and that little fault went away .<br />
Other causes of this problem can be a virus especially when you have been communicating with an infected phone or your memory card has been placed in an infected phone.<br />
<br />
To restore factory seetings go into settings on your menu and scroll until you find (Restore factory settings)you may be asked for a service code this by default is always 12345 but may have been changed if the phone was owned by someone else.<br />
<br />
Before doing this please remove your memory card and back up your phone memory which is seperate from the memory card .<br />
You must also have your phone fully charged and your charger plugged in before doing anything.<br />
<br />
The best way to back up is by using the Nokia Suite and either bluetooth or cable connection or if you have loads of patience go for the very slow way of using infra-red .<br />
<br />
Factory settings in general will also change the theme and ringtone back to a default you must also if you can backup your contacts or swap the sim for an unused one .<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />
<br />

Unsubstantiated "urban myth" - Java doesn't work that way.<br />
Files may get corrupted in use, but not due to virus!

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>This does not work for Office Word 2013. &nbsp;Although there seems to be abundant advice for older versions Word 2007 and Word 2010, there's nothing that I can find online that corresponds to Word 2013. &nbsp;Just spent nearly an hour on the phone with someone from
 Microsoft who had to leave the phone to consult manuals, personnel, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point the support person claimed that she was able to add an "Anonymous" author on the Info page and remove all other authors and TrackChange comment would be under the name "Anonyomous." I tried the same on my computer, but it didn't work. At that
 point, the rep said that I would have to purchase a premium support plan to get further help. Started talking about all of the software support, antivirus programs, etc. that I would get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained to her that I had just been on the phone with Dell earlier today to extend a hardware warranty and that they, too, wanted to sell me antivirus programs. I have used McAfee for nearly a decade and Norton the decade before that. &nbsp;I told her that
 I had all of the antivirus protection that I needed and that I did not have to pay money for information on how to use a feature that Microsoft knows is widely used because of all of the instructions that exist for it for 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that Microsoft is using its individual consumers to test out new software, because we are the ones mostly likely to purchase these new versions. &nbsp;Government, industry etc. have to spend much more money to upgrade their systems and probably do so
 sparingly. I word with universities, and many of them have just upgraded to Office 2010--in 2016!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained to the rep that I deeply resented being encouraged to purchase these new versions, where they make ridiculous and unwarranted changes to known and widely used functions and then try to extort money from customers. &nbsp;They're basically removing
 the functionality of our products and then charging us to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, if anyone knows how to do ANONYMOUS TRACK CHANGE COMMENTS IN WORD 2013, please do advise! &nbsp;Clearly, Microsoft is not going to do it unless they are paid $$$.</p>
<p>

    <title>Exchange e-mail address stamping policy for Exchange Hybrid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exchbin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exchange e-mail address stamping policy for Exchange Hybrid</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm planning a multi-ad/exchange forest to O365-single tenant migration for one of the organizations. The problem we find ourself running into quite often is that when an user account exists with the same UPN on two or more domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For eg., let's assume a user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** whose AD UPN is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. So apparently, his cloud identity gets another e-mail address which is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** which is cool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assume a different user in domain 2 whose e-mail address is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** whose ad UPN is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Naturally, Exchange decides to stamp this user too with the same additional SMTP address for routing (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 and this user no longer syncs via AD connect to Azure due to a pre-existing conflict with another user in Domain 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite stumped on how to handle this. I changed the default e-mail address stamping policy on on-premise Exchange servers to add domain1/domain2 to their UPN. (i.e., *** Email address is removed for privacy *** / *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).
 But the exchange won't stop dishing out an extra SMTP address to add an extra alias to whom it thinks does not have it in the right format. I'm not quite sure where. Any insights to solve this deadly problem without the needing to change the UPNs of about
 hundreds of thousands of users would really be useful.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Never mind. I figured it out myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amend the address policy on on-premise Exchange server to stamp an unique domain.mail.onmicrosoft.com address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So instead of 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, users can either get 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** or alias1.d1@domain,mail.onmicrosoft.com and the users in domain 2 would get
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. The cloud-on-premise e-mail flow works on this domain.mail.onmicrosoft.com e-mail address, so as long as the object has one and is synced to Azure AD, all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: There was no invisible force that adds the extra smtp address of domain.mail.onmicrosoft.com. Editing the on-premise address stamping policies was sufficient. Although cloud users get a separate domain.onmicrosoft.com which is unique irrespective.
 The ones I've seen are the residue of older address stamping policy.</p>

<p>Thank you Amylove,</p>
<p>I knew how to&nbsp;add my e-mail accounts into Outlook. </p>
<p>I was trying to create new&nbsp;Outlook files. Finally I found the process to do that:</p>
<p>- File </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Account Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Data Files</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Add</p>
<p>Then you can add a new Outlook data file and close the ones you do not need anymore.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to turn off the call sound on Mac version of Skype&#63;</h2>
                    Previously before the update you could mute all call sounds coming from Skype and now with the update on mac there's literally no option to do that anymore. You can disable chat notifications/ in app sounds but that doesn't mute a call from coming through.
 The text notification is alone enough for me the constant ringing just makes me annoyed

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option to mute all the incoming alerts in Skype. What you can do is to mute the sounds from your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when&nbsp;you set your status to <strong>do not disturb, </strong>you can still receive messages and calls but there is no incoming alert or sound. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>On my Nokia 5800, the galley opens up very slowly and sometimes freezes. When it does open my pictures and video's cant be seen. Howevere they can be seen in file manager so are definately on the phone. If i take my memory card out, some of my pictures return
 to the gallery and can be seen. Also a lot of applications I have downloaded such as London Tube map wont open and freeze. It also wont remove them from my phone and wont let me download and install them again.</p>

            It appears that there has been an accumulation of corrupted system files on your phone, and your card. You could try to save the card through a disk check, but for the phone it seems a phone reset is in order.

    <title>Find and replace ignores cell formating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> domulis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find and replace ignores cell formating</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, a quick question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bill of materials imported from solidworks with some mistakes</p>
<p>sometimes position numbers in different levels were imported in this format: 2,1 instead of 2.1, i.e. comma was used instead of dot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pre-selected the data as text before proceeding to avoid the conversions to date. It does indeed work well if i delete commas manually and change them with dots. But if i use CTRL+H (Find and replace) it converts data to dates... 2,1 -&gt; replace comma
 to dot -&gt; is getting a date 2014.02.01. Seriously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change it back to 'text' again, it is too late, the poor date becomes this 'text': 41671</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same happens if I i got to Find and Replace, and select Options, format, format, and select 'Text'. So it basically replaces data, applies default formatting/autocorrect and hen converts it to my formatting. Useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes in my system dot is a delimiter for date format as our dates are in this format: 2014.04.01 and I do not want to use anything else.</p>
<p>This was discussed before, there is a stupid workaround for it:</p>
<p>http://www.excelforum.com/excel-general/761526-prevent-changing-from-text-to-date-format-during-find-and-replace.html</p>
<p>Really? Any proper solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[rant]I just hate this.. I remember changing decimal character from dot to comma just to make W7 64bit backup component working.. But this messed thing up in windows task managers memory usage readings.. Can't MS release some patches to get those delimiters
 working as they are supposed to?[/endrant]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>
</p><p>Copy the whole column to windows notepad and replace comma to dot there.. Paste back to excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this works only for one column at a time. But it was good enough.</p>

<h2>            Why won&#39;t Windows Media Player rip my CDs anymore&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using the latest version of Windows Media Player on Windows 10. Until recently it ripped (and played) CDs without a problem. Now, whenever I click 'Rip CD', I get a message under the 'Rip status' saying 'Error' for every track and the CD ejects. I'm
 confident this isn't an issue with the discs themselves. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this problem, and, if so, found a way to fix it? Thanks

 may produce a result... but&nbsp;don't if this is a new machine and still under warranty!</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>VomiNeldi</strong>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a possibility that the 3D maps option became inactive due to conflicts with add-ins. Let’s perform some troubleshooting steps to isolate this concern.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Launch the Excel app in <strong>safe mode</strong>. This will temporarily disable all installed add-ins in Excel.
</span>See this <strong><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></span></strong> for the
 steps. As soon as it’s already in safe mode, try to check if you’ll see 3D map as active already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn't persist while on safe mode, you can use the instructions below to identify which add-in is causing it to happen:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Option</strong> &gt; <strong>
Add-ins</strong>, then click <strong>Go</strong> in the <strong>Manage: COM Add-ins</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Clear the checkbox if you'll see any add-ins, then disable them.</span></li><li><span>Close the Excel app and relaunch it after.</span></li><li><span>Check if you'll still get the same behavior.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, you can check for available <strong>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office updates</a></strong> and install it afterward. This will help fix the issue as well. Additionally, you may run an
<strong>Office repair</strong>. This is usually being performed if an app isn’t working accordingly as it should be. See this:
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair an Office application</a>.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</span></p>

            Cheers Drazen at least I am not on my own. Have tried the qashqai owners club too. Looks like our v expensive phones have hit a bit of a snag, maybe have to wait for a firmware upgrade. I think I'll email Nokia again

            I also have a Qashqai that gives the "no network" message with my 6120 classic. The bluetooth in the car works fine with a Blackberry 8800.

            Same problem occures in Qashqai with Nokia 6110 Navigator. Does anybody try a new firmware (3.58) for this phone? Maybe it works better?

            Please tell me if you or anybody else solved the problem! I have the same one, but for any reason it was ok yesterday for about 10 minutes - I was able to call and receive calls but after turning off the car there was the same problem as bevore - do you
 have any idea or do we have to change the phone?

            I've find a one way for N6110N. Perhaps it's suitable for N95. Set "Hide" for the checkphone option in BT menu. Then wait while a car testing BT-connection. On completion try to connect from the phone. Network pic have to be displayed on the screen of
 car stereo/navigation system. Repeat this every time you run a car.<br />

Nokia. Connecting people (but not a man with car).

            It works with Hidden Bluetooth mode also on N95. It seems that the crucial thing is to connect from the phone to car and not vicecersa. Thank you for the post modern!

<br />
<br />Hover over the link to see where it's actually pointing to or right-click on the link --&gt; Copy --&gt; paste it in any text editor (i.e. NotePad) 
<br />
<br />If it's not a legitimate Microsoft URL then it's a phishing scam. Unfortunately there's no way for anyone to provide a definitive answer since we don't know what the link is pointing to - really doesn't matter what the &lt;From&gt; email address is since that can be spoofed.

            Hi I’m Linnell I'm a fellow Community member here to help.
<br />It very well could be a  phishing scam designed to frighten people into clicking a link that doesn't go to Microsoft.
<br />Do not click on any links.
<br />Treat with great suspicion thanks for questioning it's validity.  
<br />Legitimate emails have a green lock in the address bar, &amp; when you mouse over any links they must clearly point to a Microsoft site
<br />Regards,
<br />Linnell

            Ok Hotmail is not available to many of the other browsers any more.&nbsp; They will shunt a request for www.hotmail.com to www.outlook.com so users need to go to Internet Explorer to access Hotmail.&nbsp; Going to guess this is a "feature" of their version of searching
 from the address bar itself.<br />

<p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p><span>“By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox.
 However, if your emails were over 270 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before rename, you can try to recover some of the deleted
 messages yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder), refer:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’.
 And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></p>

<p><span>Another reason why some users aren’t able to see old emails after rename

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can now&nbsp;recover lost or deleted&nbsp;emails from&nbsp;Hotmail Inbox&nbsp;page instead of contacting support. You can try restoring the emails by going to your deleted emails folder and selecting the option to recover deleted messages. Hotmail will try to recover
 as much as it can. We suggest you to follow the steps in the link below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>How do I recover deleted email messages?</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The issue usually happens when a user accessed and synchronized the account through a mail client&nbsp;such as Microsoft&nbsp;Outlook where the user&nbsp;might lose emails if&nbsp;they haven't chosen to leave a copy on the server. For more information regarding missing
 emails, please visit: </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Lastly, if you have not recovered any emails by following the steps on the link&nbsp;above,&nbsp;please provide us the email address that is affected by your issue on the Private Message I have created so we can further investigate your concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: Please sign-in to this website in order to see the Private Message tab where you can provide the email account.&nbsp;We also&nbsp;need you to reply back to this post if you already provided the information on the private data area. This will help facilitate
 our actions regarding your issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span></p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply. We are experiencing high volume of inquiries. By the way, let me help you with your issue in recovering your emails.</p>

<p>We regret to inform you that once you deleted a folder, you can retrieve it. However, you can try to retrieve the emails inside of that folder. Please
<span><font color="#000000">run the Auto Restore option feature in Hotmail to recover your lost emails, but

<h2>            SOLVED&#58; Windows 10 Mobile, Error Code 0x80246007 Lumia 535 &#38; 640Xl wont download updates</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated both Lumias from 8.1 to 10. <br />
I did a hard reset after the update and it all works fine, but when I try to download the next OS update (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>14393.1066</strong>) it downloads the update, but won't install it... After "preparing" the
 update it gives the error code&nbsp;</span>80246007 :'(<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
I did a soft reset and hard reset, still nothing....<br />
<br />
Can someone help <strong>please</strong>?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SOLVED: I used the recovery tool to revert it to 8.1, and did a hard reset after.</span>Then I downloaded Windows 10 Mobile via the Upgrade Advisor, after installing the update I alse did a hard reset.<br />
Then the next update downloaded without a problem :D&nbsp;<br />
For the best update experience hard reset after every major update (I think it's best not to use a backup)<br />
<br />
<br />
In short:<br />
<br />
8.1 - hard reset before downloading the upgrade advisor and Win 10 Mobile<br />
Download Win 10 1151 then hard reset<br />
Download Win 10 1607 then hard reset</p>
<p>Download Win 10 1708 then a final hard reset and you're all set :D<br />
<br />
It takes a lot of time but it works :D</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like there was an error while preparing the update for installation. We suggest that you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10769/windows-10-mobile-restart-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">restart your phone</a></strong> and try downloading the update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you may need to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset your phone</a></strong> to return it to the same state it was first turned on.
 This process will erase everything stored on your phone. Thus, make sure to create a backup before proceeding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome.</p>

            Hi, Timoteo<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply :)<br />
<br />
I did a soft reset several times and also a hard reset. the issue still persists.<br />
Any other solutions?<br />
<br />
I mean it occurred to me to roll it back to 8.1 an do a factory reset, update to 10 and another hard reset. This is called a master reset I read it on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/do-master-reset-windows-10-mobile-insider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 page on Windows Central</a>. That might void my warranty...<br />
But if that doesn't work, what do I do then?
