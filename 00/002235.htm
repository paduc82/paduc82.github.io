<p>If the C6-01 does not have NFC hardware, then a Belle upgrade will not be able to make non-existent hardware to appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as far as I know, the C6-01 does not have NFC hardware (like, e.g. the C7 does):</p>

    <title>Moving from Office 365 Personal to Home and having problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denisear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving from Office 365 Personal to Home and having problems</h2>
                    My partner and I had two separate Office 365 Personal licences but renewed his to Home when it expired. He sent me an invitation to share the licence in the approved way when mine was due for renewal but it was all less-than-obvious what to do. In the
 end I just accept repeated prompts to install the whole suite but I haven't found a way to update my account properly with the fact that I have access to a valid licence. Word kicks off about licence expired if I open an older file but it is ok so far if I
 launch the app first. Excel is simply insistent that my licence has expired and says there's none associated with my Microsoft account. I could put in my partner's signin details, but I thought the point of this was that you didn't need this information. So
 what did I do wrong?

            <p>Hi Dantley. Thanks for replying. I really hope you can help!</p>
<p>Here's what I see now on my Office login page, having accepted the invitation from my partner and apparently it all installed ok - still says my subscription has expired. I can't work out how to tell it/you that my Personal subscription has been replaced
 by the invitation to share my partner's Home licence.</p>
<p>

<p>I don't mind you having my account name or the name of the person who shared the Home licence by invitation, but it probably shouldn't be here for all to see, so I have cropped to remove that info.</p>

            <p>Hi Denise,<br />
<br />
We would like to suggest that you uninstall the Office 365 from your device and tell your husband to do the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deactivate-an-Office-365-install-767e3560-96ed-4b1c-806d-2fe01c529b1b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
deactivate an Office install</a> from his end. Remember that deactivating an install doesn’t remove someone from Office 365 Home subscription. Then ask him to send you another invitation so you can install the Office 365 again. Launch the application and see
 if you will still get the "Your subscription has expired" message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Before you uninstall the Office 365, make sure to back up all saved Office 365 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>When we looked, the invitation stated that I hadn't accepted it. I deinstalled the new Office 365 suite and reinstalled from the original invitation (not a new one). The suite all loaded ok but when I open the apps, it asks me to verify Office by logging
 in and then says my username isn't associated with the licence. So... (below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/769742d3-80b2-417d-aac5-a4ab3802dddf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/769742d3-80b2-417d-aac5-a4ab3802dddf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Gone back to the original invitation and it still says I haven't accepted it. </p>
<p>So I uninstalled again and tried with a new invitation but that still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the fact I don't now have Office installed at all, my MS/Office account is still starting from the base of being an Office Personal licence holder and won't recognise the Home installation as mine. Short of binning the whole account and starting
 again (and how do you do that when my Windows installation uses the same account?) I don't see anything here to change that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't lose any more time to trying to resolve this. I'm sure sharing a Home licence works fine for new installations but I have given up and renewed my Personal licence instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frankxs is correct in his first comment.&nbsp; Using file explorer, rename the pim.vol to PIMOLD.VOL then you can copy the backup version to the ROOT directory.&nbsp; After it is copied, soft reset your device and you will be good to go.</p>
<p>After the soft reset, if the backup of the old file was successful, you can then safely delete the copy you renamed to PIMOLD.</p>

<p>You are probably getting this messsage (access denied) for one of two reasons.</p>
<p>1) The xxxx.PIM file is currently in-use on your phone while you are trying to replace it, therefore you are getting "access denied" when trying to&nbsp;copy over it.&nbsp; For this you should be able to do a workaround by RENAMING the .PIM file on your phone (say,
 to xxxx.OLD&nbsp;BEFORE you copy the saved file (xxxx.PIM) over to your phone - then recycle your phone.&nbsp; You might have to power-cycle your phone after you do the renaming, and before you do the copy, to ensure&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;is not currently using your original xxxx.PIM
 file.&nbsp; Here is a reference post:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.everythingwm.com/forum/moto-q-9c/help-with-pim-file-please-21102-2.html#post181662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.everythingwm.com/forum/moto-q-9c/help-with-pim-file-please-21102-2.html#post181662</a></p>
<p>2) You are hitting up against the java security .PIM requirements that the programmer coded in.&nbsp; If this is the case there is probably nothing you can do.&nbsp; See article here:<a href="http://developers.sun.com/mobility/apis/pim/pim3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://developers.sun.com/mobility/apis/pim/pim3/</a></p>

    <title>I want to create an alias under my domain. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rado99m  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to create an alias under my domain.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm confused a little bit about creating mailbox aliases for my custom domain.</p>
<p><br />
1. I've moved my custom domain (e.g. mydomain.com) to outlook.com. I've also created few user accounts. MX records were modified and email is being successfully delivered to existing user accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I wanted to create alias for user account. For example, I want 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** also to receive messages addressed to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Quick search showed that for the custom domains I need to use wlalias tool (wlalias.com). I downloaded it and added
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** as an alias for
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. When I log in as
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** I can see
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** showing as an&nbsp;alias under Account Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. However, when I try to send email to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, it's bounced back with the following error<br />
The error that the other server returned was:<br />
&nbsp;550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any suggestions? How can I get aliases for my custom domain mailboxes.<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>Hi RM, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. If I understood your issue correctly, you are trying to set up an alias for an account using your domain. Let me help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that if you have registered your domain on Windows Live Admin center, using our domain as an alias is not possible. What you can only use is @hotmail.com, @live.com depending on what you will see on the dropdown since you have registered
 the domain under a Microsoft service and this is the possible reason why messages are bouncing back as unavailable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I misunderstand your concern, kindly post back so that we can help you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>As I said I was able to create some aliases for my custom domain using WLALIAS tool. These aliases show up in the Live account management. However, the mail delivery results are mixed:</p>
<p>1. I created alias (e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for *** Email address is removed for privacy *** ). Email sent to both addresses (user1 and user1alias)<strong> is delivered
</strong>to user1 mailbox.</p>
<p>2. I created aliases (e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** ). For these 2 users, email sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (or user3alias) is bounced back ('mailbox unavailable).</p>
<p>3. For yet another user (e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) I cannot create alias *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</p>
<p><em>WLALIAS complaints:</em></p>
<p><em>Creating alias...The call failed with outcome: SoapException<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mailbox aliases is pretty basic (and important) functionality I was using with Google Apps. I can't believe it's so difficult (if possible at all) to configure with Windows Live Domains.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>RM</p>

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Rado99M</font>,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for providing us useful information about this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that he have an option here in Microsoft on how to create an Alias for your account. You can follow the steps on the link below on how to do this:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/alias-rename-link-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Aliases and rename in Outlook.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, like what <font color="#0072c6">Marites Ma.</font> provided, the option to create an alias using your custom domain name&nbsp;is not yet available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you use a 3rd party tool that is not handled by Microsoft, Microsoft is not liable if you encounter any problem using it. I suggest that you contact Wlalias support team for further assistance regarding this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have other concern or question, don't hesitate to inform us and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Eugene,</p>
<p>Web UI in Outlook.com doesn't allow to create mailbox aliases from the same domain. Anyways, I got it working now:</p>
<p>1. For user2 and user3, simply removing and re-adding aliases (using WLALIAS tool) made it work.</p>
<p>2. For user4, the trick was to change the password on the primary account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). After that, I was able to add
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;(using WLALIAS, again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>RM</p>

            <p>Hi, I have just met the same problem. Fortunately this is a know issue for wlalias and workaround is quite easy. Make sure both accounts (your admin account and an account you are adding alias to) use the same password.</p>

<h2>            Word keeps crashing or freezing on Mac OS X</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I am a university student and this problem has been making it very difficult for me to do my work lately. I have Microsoft Word for Mac, Version 15.40 (171108). My Mac is OS X El Capitan, Version 10.11.6. A couple of weeks ago I began to experience
 a problem with frequent Word crashes/freezes. I will be working on a document and suddenly it will crash/freeze. Sometimes the document exits out on its own, and sometimes I have to either Right Click -&gt; Quit Word, or Force Quit. Every time this happens, I
 get the following error message.</p>
<p>I have performed all the Word updates and this problem persists. Your help is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Dear Virgil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your helpful feedback. What I did was install a new version of Microsoft Word for Mac (from an Office 365 package through my university) and the problem has not re-occurred so far, although I have not used Word very much over the last
 2 days. I will troubleshoot some more and reply again if I re-experience the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>Howard</p>

<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that they may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />It is not necessary to do this at all. As long as you have an internet connection, you will be able to use Skype with that same account.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps@

It happens only with WORD Notebook layout docs. &nbsp;All other regular WORD docs work just fine. If I convert Notebook to print layout, it still won't work. &nbsp;There must be something with the Notebook template.When I try to close and save, it won't accept what I
 name the Notebook doc nor will it save or even close it. &nbsp;I have to close out of WORD altogether.

            This did not solve my issue at all. Nothing is named incorrectly.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>OS -10.7.5 Lion on a 2011 Macbook Air</div>
<div><br />
<div>Most recent version of word 2011.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Whenever this student tries to save a file in notebook mode it would not save. You could click "save as," name the file, and it would "save." But when you navigate to where you saved it, there is no document, There are no documents under autosaves or temp
 files. If you close Word it asks if you want to save your changes, so clearly the save isn't actually happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything else works just fine. Saving documents in other views works fine. As long as the student avoids "notebook view" Word functions fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it a corrupted preference file or something? This is the only computer out of hundreds (all with the same image) that has this issue.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Following the recommendation to try the save while in a new OS user account will tell you the answer to your question. If the save works in a new user, but not in your regular account, that is a solid indication that there is a preference file that's corrupt.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the save fails in a new user, you know there's something else wrong, such as a corrupt file system, something wrong in Mac OS, intereference from another application, or a faulty install of Microsoft Office.</p>

            Same issue for me. I was enjoying using the Notebook Layout in meetings and workshops, and as a to do list for projects.<br />
<br />
When I came back to work in 2013 I couldn't save a document I had been happily editing-saving-editing-saving-etc previously. I also couldn't save a new file in the Notebook format. I ran update and accepted all updates. OS is up to date (Lion). So I'm now using
 standard Word docs and looking for an alternative note tacking application. No, I haven't tried any of the suggestions above yet.<br />

    <title>Outlook.com extremely slow in Edge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook.com extremely slow in Edge</h2>
                    <p>For months now, I've had problems with the Edge browser being extremely slow to load Outlook.com pages - typically 40 seconds per page. For instance, I can go to Mail (40 s wait), then Options (40 s wait), then back to Mail (40 s wait), then go over to People
 (40 s wait), and then Calendar (40 s wait). The pages behave fine once loaded, but it should NOT take a Microsoft browser app 40 seconds to load while using Microsoft's new flagship browser - that's totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT have this problem in other browsers (IE 11 or Chrome). I've tried a variety of fixes including increasing the cache size from 250 to 1024, clearing the cache and history, resetting the Host file, and using the troubleshooter,&nbsp;but all to no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this so I can use Edge with Outlook.com?</p>

            <p>Jesinta, did you actually read my original post? I specifically stated that Outlook.com works fine in both Internet Explorer and Chrome. Since you - like almost every other Microsoft Engineer I've encountered in these forums - can't be bothered to pay attention
 to what is said in a thread, I'm reporting you for abuse. And you're the FORUM MODERATOR, for crying out loud. This really undercuts my already dying opinion of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody kindly offer a suggestion that I HAVEN'T already tried?</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Your issue is browser specific certainly with slow performance on Microsoft Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize if you were dissatisfied with my answer however&nbsp;I asked you to use Outlook.com through Internet Explorer since you can access your email account well. I did read your original post thoroughly.&nbsp;When I mentioned&nbsp;"check if outlook.com works fine"
 it was only intended to verify if&nbsp;you are not facing any further&nbsp;issues on Outlook.com using Internet Explorer.
</p>

            <p>I have indeed reset my computer, and that fixed this problem, along with a host of other problems (e.g., Bluetooth not working, Sound not working, Sound icon disappearing from taskbar, long page loads on other sites, long startup, computer slow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else is having problems like this and would like to reset, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start --&gt; Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under "Reset this PC", click <strong>Get Started</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Keep my Files</strong>, and proceed from there.</li></ol>
<p>This will remove your Apps and Settings, but keep the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All personal files that are saved on your computer or OneDrive.</li><li>Windows Store apps like Groove Music and Maps (but not Office).</li><li>Certain settings (e.g., game setting files, browser settings).</li></ul>
<p>I can't remember for sure, but I think it took 1-2 hours to complete before I could start reinstalling.</p>

<p>I am only asking where I can purchase the internal battery.</p>

<p>My phone is 5 years old now and the question of manufacture's warrentee no longer applies.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an old Nokia E71 phone (bought in 2011) and it looks like the RTC battery is dead. I'm also interested on how to buy the G2200 spare part (in France) because it looks like I only can contact sellers and not a Care Service in France.</p>

    <title>Using SumofTotal in a Calculated field - Access Query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joannemorelock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using SumofTotal in a Calculated field - Access Query</h2>
                    <p>I end up with an enter parameter dialog box.&nbsp; If I click through without adding info, the query populates as it is designed to.&nbsp; I want to get rid of the dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; This is not a straightforward reference error.&nbsp; These dialog boxes are showing up when I run the query itself.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Calculated field refers to fields within the query itself. There are no extra spaces in the build function of the calculated field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Field1</p>
<p>Field2 (This is set up as a total with "Sum" selected in the Total Line, for Field2</p>
<p>Calculated Field: [Field1]-[SumofField2]</p>
<p>When I go to datasheet view, or hit "run", it creates an Enter Parameter dialog box asking for SumofField2, even though SumofField2 is right there, in that query.</p>
<p>If I click "OK", then the query calculates correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recreated this Calculated Field numerous times, and am confident that there are no misspellings, or extra spaces/blanks in build function.&nbsp; Because it is in the query itself, it is fairly easy to just click on the available expression category.</p>
<p>In my efforts I have tried creating a second query, where the first creates the SumOfField2, and the second does the calculation.&nbsp; That doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp; Is there something that I need to do in order to specify the SumofField2 better?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; I'd like to get rid of the dialog.</p>

            Can you provide the entire SQL view of your query? I expect you might be using the name of a alias in a secondary calculation. I try to avoid this by using the full expression rather than the alias. Perhaps in your case this would be:
<br />
<br />Calculated Field: [Field1]-Sum(Field2)

            That's about as I expected. Did you try my recommendation? Try not to use the alias of SumOfTotalBilled in another expression:
<br />
<br />SELECT tblContracts.[Client Name], tblContracts.[Total Approved Cost], 
<br />Sum(tblBillingContacts.TotalBilled) AS SumOfTotalBilled, 
<br />[Total Approved Cost]-Sum(tblBillingContacts.TotalBilled) AS Remaining

<br />GROUP BY tblContracts.[Client Name], tblContracts.[Total Approved Cost], 
<br />[Total Approved Cost]-Sum(tblBillingContacts.TotalBilled), tblContracts.[Contract ID];

            Your previous statement suggested the dialog box doesn't appear "the dialog box doesn't disappear" which was your original question "I'd like to get rid of the dialog."

                    <p>hello, i want to pay Microsoft Lumia 532 but i have problems in understanding it's spécifications.</p>
<p>what i want to know is:</p>
<p>does it has gps? i ask this because when i ask this question, i see "it has a-GPS". i don't know what&nbsp;this means. is it's gps like others phones (like Lumia 625)?</p>
<p>-can it be located when it's lost?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>also, i pay it because of its design: rectangle, presence of Windows key (even when it's not powered on), 1G ram.</p>
<p>if there is another nokia Lumia or Microsoft Lumia phone that has the same specification (that i described above), please give me it's number (number less than 625)</p>

<h2>            Help Please - Icons Keep Changing</h2>
                    Every time I open Internet Explorer the icons for my favorites have changed.&nbsp; All the links are fine, it's just the icon that keeps changing.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
How do I get back the proper icons and lock them in?

<p><span><span>Hey Big Lag,
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>This can normally be fixed by deleting the History and Temporary Internet files. You can do this by following these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (only one Internet Explorer window open)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Press
<strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>F</strong> on your keyboard</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Work Offline</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Safety</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Delete Browsing History…</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Uncheck the
<strong>Preserve Favorites website data</strong> box</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Check the
<strong>Temporary Internet files</strong> and <strong>History</strong> boxes</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Delete</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Wait for the process bars to finish
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Close
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Press
<strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>F </strong>on your keyboard</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Work Offline</strong> to disable it</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Now as you visit your Favorites websites they Favicon (the icon on the Favorites) will be downloaded again</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

<p>If you cannot re-download purchased apps it's usually because you've reached your re-download limit. I don't think it has anything to do with the Belle Refresh update.</p>

<h2>            WINWORD.EXE or EXCEL.EXE - Entry Point Not Found &#40;Re&#58; computer not opening Office 365 products&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me find a solution to get MS Word and Excel working again. I have an Office 365 subscription if that matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting this error when I try to open any Word or Excel documents. I've tried "Change" under Uninstall or change a program as well as running all Windows updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem started when tried to 'reset' my OneDrive to sync to my computer (files were not being uploaded automatically to the OneDrive despite being put in the "OneDrive" folder on my Desktop....and I may have interrupted the Libraries - Shortcut.download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The full error messages reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One MS Word error message:</p>
<p>The procedure entry point memset could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Program Files (x86)\MicrosoftOffice\Root\Office16\WINWORD.EXE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Four MS Excel error message per document open attempt:</p>
<p>1) The procedure entry point_CxxFrameHandler3 could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Program Files (x86)\MicrosoftOffice\Root\Office16\MSVCP140.dlll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The procedure entry point_std_type_info_compare could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Program Files (x86)\MicrosoftOffice\Root\Office16\EXCEL.EXE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp;The procedure entry point_std_type_info_compare could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\Program Files (x86)\MicrosoftOffice\Root\Office16\oart.dll.</p>

<p>
</p><p>4) C:\Users\*******\SkyDrive\Documents\*********\******* etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'd sincerely appreciate any support or suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;I hear you CK, but what motivation would they have for sending out a new build just for that?&nbsp; I have to believe there's more to it than that, but who knows.&nbsp; That's all the blog mentions other than some more stuff for Cortana (which I have very little

<h2>            Outlook Mail on Windows 10 Phone Lumia 650 &#39;your account settings are out of date&#39; message</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 phone from windows 8 I get constant messages 'your account settings are out of date'. I see from searching the internet this is a common problem but I can see no fix offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account works fine receiving and sending mail, but I keep getting the message and annoying alert noise all the time which I have to dismiss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short the settings are correct but there is a 'bug' somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside the Mail works fine on my Windows PC &amp; tablet.</p>

            usually the fix for this issue is done via an app or system update. make sure you get your device fully updated - which OS and mail app versions are you running?

            <p>Mike, instead of opening a new thread, one approach is to ‘Me Too’ an existing thread. Then, you are subscribed to any new workarounds. However, because this symptom is so wide spread, that error message is a symptom for several different causes. I am not
 aware of one case, in which an OS update or app update helped. Therefore, please, post more information about your E-mail account in question:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is just one account affected or several accounts?</li><li>Is that an Outlook.com alias (former Live, former Hotmail), or IMAP, or Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)?</li><li>If it is an IMAP account: Which E-mail provider do you use, in which country?</li><li>Does it get better, while Wi-Fi is disabled for a full working day?</li></ol>

            <p>Thanks for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important to note that my email does work fine, therefore the settings are correct, they are identical to my Windows 8 PC and windows 10 laptop and windows 10 tablet. It is just I get the error message when there is no error!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error message using Outlook on my PC or Windows 10&nbsp;Laptop, it is just the Mail 'App' on my windows 10 Tablet and Windows 10 phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail&nbsp;App on my Windows 8 PC is fine and it was fine on my previous Windows 8 phone and windows 8 tablet before I upgraded. it is only the mail app on Windows 10 that brings up the error message that no matter how many times you cancel it, it keeps coming
 back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only the one account because I only use it for one account, I am sure it would behave the same way with others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an IMAP account with authenticated smtp from NAMESCO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some issue with Windows 10 and the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a Website design and hosting business with many customers using mail. There is no problem with the mail on an iPhone, I am the only one using a windows phone to my knowledge. I otherwise endorse windows phone, at least I did while I was on Windows
 8.</p>

<p>I have this same issue with a MS exchange account. &nbsp;It lasts for a day or so then you need to re-enter the account password again. I'm not sure if this is causing my AD account to get locked because of too many authentication attempts from the Outlook phone
 app. I have removed the exchange account from the phone for now &nbsp;I will also try doing a hard reset and see if that makes any difference.</p>

            <p>Please ask Namesco which server software (and which version) they are using. Furthermore, ask them if something is showing up in their server logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not aware of any support channel, which is able to understand your issue. Therefore, you have to ask those who are easier to talk with. In Windows 10 Mobile » All apps » (Windows) Feedback exist, but you do not get any answers there. You could go for
 the latest Windows Insider – there you get a Feedback app which does give some kind of feedback – but I am not aware of Microsoft bothering about server issues. Go figure!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error message pops-up for many users, and several different causes are covered by that error message. In one cause, the server limits the amount of concurrent sessions and Windows 10 Mobile is so angry about that, it tells you with that error message.
 In that case, your E-mail provider lifts its limits or your go for POP3 instead (which terribly drains the battery with the current OS build). Alternatively, you go for Hosted Exchange (EAS) where you proxy that IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Techbuzzard, I have no idea for your case, except you double-check how you entered your Exchange details (with an @ or % or, …).</p>

            <p>This is not a server side problem, it is an app problem, it was fine with the Windows 8 mail app. It is also fine with the exact same settings in outlook which&nbsp;are on my PC and laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get the error message ''your account settings are out of date' I ignore it and cancel because they are not wrong or lost. Some people have suggested there is a link with internet time, but changing time settings does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a common problem, why does Microsoft not recognise or solve it. </p>

            I believe that the settings are correct since outlook does work on this account for a period of time. Just forced to re-enter my password.

<p>For some it was, because Outlook Mail of Windows 10 Mobile created much more sever connections. The problem with this error message is that it covers several different causes. Therefore, the questions above.</p>

<h2>            Formula&#58; percent based on drop down list and total cells entered</h2>
                    <p>I need to create a spreadsheet where data will be entered on an ongoing basis, and a running percentage will be calculated based on options in a drop down list. For example, we submit a proposal and document the client, date etc, and a column with a drop
 down menu to choose the results of the proposal (awarded, lost, in progress, cancelled). We want to know: of the total records entered, what percentage are "awarded", "lost" etc. Can someone advise?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>COUNTA() and COUNTIF() would come in very handy. You could also use a PivotTable, but I'll stick with explaining how to do it without a PivotTable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sheet1 (your table of proposals):</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TITLE</td>
<td>DATE</td>
<td>RESULT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proposal Y</td>
<td>2/1/2016</td>
<td>Lost</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proposal Z</td>
<td>3/1/2016</td>
<td>In Progress</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Proposal X1</td>
<td>4/1/2016</td>
<td>Cancelled</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You'll need the total number of proposals, which could be calculated using =COUNTA(A:A)-1 where the -1 is to subtract the first row which would be the column label.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To count the number of lost proposals, you could use =COUNTIF(C:C,"Lost")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then divide by the total to get the percentage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of a table showing the formulas for summarizing the results:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb184b29-931d-45bb-a9cd-65cb76c748a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb184b29-931d-45bb-a9cd-65cb76c748a4" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Note that "Other" will be a count of the proposals that DON'T have the results listed in A2:A5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These formulas assume that there will not be any proposals with a blank title (in column A:A), but if the result in column C is blank for a proposal, it would be counted as "Other."</p>

            <p>Publisher web pages are fixed width and left justified by default.&nbsp;If you want centered pages the only way we have found to do it over the years is to edit the code directly after you produce it. However you can simulate centered pages. Read the following
 article for a description of one way to do that.</p>
<p><span><span>Reference: Understanding background padding in a Publisher web (aka whitespace):<br />
</span><a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/dbartosik/archive/2006/01/07/80563.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://msmvps.com/blogs/dbartosik/archive/2006/01/07/80563.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p>As per the centering pages workaround, here is&nbsp;a set of directions if you choose to try it:</p>
<p>When you "Publish to the Web" direct the output (the index.htm file and the index_files folder if you are using the subfolder option) to a folder on your computer where you can find it. Each of your *.htm files requires adding a centering code after the
 existing&nbsp; &lt;/head&gt; code.<br />
<br />
Method 1: Manual method.<br />
<br />
Go to the folder on your computer where you directed your web files.<br />
<br />
Open each *.htm file in NotePad by right clicking the file &gt; open with &gt; NotePad. If you are using the subfolder option in Pub 2003 or 2007, your index.htm file is your home page, and your other *.htm files for your other pages are usually contained in a subfolder
 called "index_files".<br />
<br />
Find the &lt;/head&gt; code, and replace with:<br />
<br />
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="760"align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br />
<br />
If you are using a page width that is different than 760 pixels, change the width in the code string with the width of your web pages. Close NotePad and save the changes. If you are using inches for measurement, multiply the width in inches by 96 and use that
 number.<br />
<br />
After editing the code on each *.htm file, you can upload your files to your host.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Semi-automatic method.<br />
<br />
With this method you can find the &lt;/head&gt; code, and replace it with the revised code string in each *.htm file semi-automatically.<br />
<br />
Download and install the free "Replace In Files" program:<br />
<a href="http://www.emurasoft.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emurasoft.com/index.htm</a><br />
<br />
Open "Replace in Files". The four boxes in the "Replace in Files" program require the following information:<br />
<br />
Find: &lt;/head&gt;<br />
<br />
Replace with: &lt;/head&gt;&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" width="760"align="center"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;<br />
(Note: the code string may wrap in this message, but it is one line. Also change the width to the pixel width of your web pages. If you are using inches for measurement, multiply the width in inches by 96 and use that number.)<br />
<br />
File Types: *.htm<br />
<br />
In Folder: Use the ... button to browse to the folder where you directed your web files on your computer when you Publish to Web.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you are using a subfolder, check the box at the bottom "Replace in Subfolders".<br />
<br />
Click "Replace All", and you should get a "Finished" dialog that will confirm the replaced strings of code for each *.htm file/page in your web files.<br />
<br />
After editing the code you can upload your index.htm file and your index_files folder to your host.<br />
<br />
You will have to run Replace in Files each time you modify your Pub file and produce new web files. However, once the options in Replace in Files are filled out and the "Replace all" is selected, the entries are retained for the next time you use the program.
 Also once you get this process to work correctly it is an easy two click process in the future, so don't let it intimidate you.</p>
