    <title>Nokia and Logitech should team up for Bluetooth earpieces... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia and Logitech should team up for Bluetooth earpieces...</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that Nokia should get in touch with Logitech to license Logitech's Windproof technology for their Bluetooth earpieces.&nbsp; The Logitech Earpiece I had worked great in outdoor environments, it could be blowing 75mph and I could still have a normal conversation
 with the person on the other end without them hearing any wind noise.&nbsp; Mine got chewed up by my cat and the earpiece does not sit on my ear anymore.&nbsp; I would have bought another Logitech earpiece however Logitech now only has 1 model left and are difficult
 to find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Nokia has a wide range of Bluetooth earpieces, I would highly recommend the 2 technologies/products to coexist as it is a proven winner and would help Nokia come back vs the horrid looking, base-y sounding JawBone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I stop shapes drawn in Excel 2007 from disappearing behind text and cells&#63;</h2>
                    In an Excel 2007 spreadsheet, shapes that are drawn disappear behind text and cells once you select something else. I have tried bringing the shape to the front which doesn't solve the problem.

<br />As the NDR suggests, you should contact your internet service provider so they can take a look into this. Part of their network is on the block list ( probably IP ) and emails that you send are being rejected by some of your recipients

    <title>how to cancel appointments but keep a record&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rock hammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to cancel appointments but keep a record&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I regularly create appointments that: 1) invite other attendees; and 2) books meeting rooms (not sure how that's implemented but there is an auto response that confirms whether a room is available).</p>
<p>If I need to cancel such an appointment - when at least one person has accepted and/or a room has been booked - I'm forced to use the "cancel appointment" mechanisms in outlook in order to notify those other people/rooms. However the downside of this is
 that it wipes away the record of that cancelled meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there something in outlook that lets me cancel the meeting by sending the updates to people/rooms BUT keep the record on my own calendar?</p>
<p>I can imagine I could just un-invite the people &amp; rooms but that probably also wipes away who accepted and details like that?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

I fond this comment got me thinking heavy on the subject of terms and conditions and how it effects us.. I do have something more on topic at the end of all this but I still wanted to post the other stuff too in case their is anyone else who likes to think
 deeply about all kinds of things or this kinda stuff in particular. Anyways if your not interested in a long rant about this with a couple good points but that is largely all over the place maybe just skip my post.

Man that small comment gave me a lot to say and think because since my minds always going as it is so thank you lol. I think because of personal experience, studies on the matter, and what friend/family have said that I am one of the few who actually reads
 most those terms and conditions agreements that I encounter (unless I dont have time)&nbsp; Its often driven by curiosity and cause its somewhat entertaining to see just how fair/unfair, reasonable/unreasonable they are but Ill tell you that what I read in terms
 and agreements may effect how I view the business, its advertisements, and products in a different light, sometimes negatively, or positively if fair and reasonable in my opinion. What I feel from reading the terms&nbsp; is combined with everything else&nbsp; I think,
 feel, and know about a business and its products and advertisements.... like reviews, friends/family, opinions, personal experiences and so on.. If a product was bad for example, its support staff rude, its public face negative, and its terms of use, service,
 agreement or whatever unsatisfactory, well thats just one more reason I wont like that business. Likewise even companies with good track records for quality and service may have those qualities seen though a different lens if its terms seem to grant it some
 powers or lack of responsibility that dont jive with me...&nbsp; Anyways I give you in list format some general statements from me about those terms and conditions agreements. Mainly its what I think, feel, believe, suspect, dislike, about terms and conditions
 agreements, my opinions, thoughts, ideas, in additions to some what if's, hypothetical and so on.
<br />
<br />
1. Okay you know I think realistically many if not most companies realize that most people dont read the terms and conditions agreements. I think even the few polls on the matter may have conservative numbers because of how people even in an anonymous environment
 may lie about their practices on a questioner if its something they think would make them be viewed unfavorably. like if it says 60 percent blindly click accept then the number could be closer to 80 percent and thats after knocking off up to 10 percent to
 account for the other outlines who enjoy pranking polls, surveys, and studies or who want to appear as a bad boy/girl in their mind. Even if people know no one will know who they are sometimes people still project what they want to show..&nbsp; Now I dont remember
 what the numbers were in the studies I seen but I know it was high and realistically I dont know a single person other then me who reads those things and I only do cause well... I'm a nerd lol and I enjoy thinking about all kinds of subjects and analyzing
 things and the implications of things.. <br />
<br />
2. Sometimes I think Some of them are purposefully worded in such a long winded and overly complex way intentionally to be confusing like they just want to make sure everyone just clicks accept, and or that even if someone dose read it that they may not understand
 what they are agreeing to.. <br />
<br />
3. Considering the assumed high number of people who dont read the terms compared to those who do it would be interesting to see or think about what could happen if everyone from today on read every terms of use/service/agreement thing they came upon. Not everyone
 will understand all the language or some or most agreements but provided that at least half of those people also understood all of them fully including having awareness of some possible implications of those terms in different scenarios provided the businesses
 fully enforce all parts of their terms I think in such a case that many people would decline the agreements and the number could spread to equal most people due to flock mentality and other factors that could arise.&nbsp;&nbsp; You really dont always get a good deal
 in the terms and conditions and sometimes it seems unbelievable what they want you to agree with
<span style="color: rgba(0, 138, 23, 1)">( see point number for more</span>) so if everyone read them its hard for me not to believe that enough people would decline as a result to cause issues for quite a few business. Not everyone would of course&nbsp; some will have vested
 interest, political reasons, and or stakes involved&nbsp; and there will be people who will genuinely not see a problem with some, many, or all of the terms and agreements things they see. Regardless I think the end result&nbsp; will be a great number of people from
 the&nbsp; general public would decline the agreements and some counter cultures would also decline faster then anyone else.. Its all variable depending on the people so the reasons why they declined or accepted, and how many for each side will depend on many factors.
 Every company will have a different number of people declining agreement some will have few while others may have mostly declines and anything in between depending on the terms and other factors. Not everyone who declines would do so for the same reasons for
 some it could be simply pride, other it could be outrage, morals, principal, or just not liking the tone of the agreement and any combinations of multiple reasons and likewise some people will decline a few agreements while others will decline a lot of agreements
 and any possible combination of numbers for various reasons. Some business will have few decliners while other will be ruined. When you get a lot of people declining the terms of use and being locked out of product or service you may get a lot of return attempts
 which leads to more issues and boycotts of future products and so much could happen due to one thing leading to another....
<br />
<br />
4. When you decline a agreement you probibly wont get your money back&nbsp; and if its software it wont allow you to install or use it if you decline as a result people who read the agreements are still less likely to decline knowing that they wont be able to use
 the product&nbsp; nor get their money back.&nbsp; I personally have declined maybe 30 agreements my self but most of them were free to use products or services so it was not a big lose but I only declined maybe 2 things I paid for and I didn't not get a refund..&nbsp; I
 have accepted the vast majority of agreements in my life time of seeing 100s of them. Some of the ones I accepted&nbsp; had something unfair or something that was not right IMO but I didn't decline cause it was something I wanted and when your faced with something
 good that you want but has unfair or moral wrong terms it can be tempting to click accept anyways. For me&nbsp; knowing if I decline i will not be able to use the item nor return it or get a refund&nbsp; what would I get for being a martyr and going with out while most
 of those thousands of users clicked accept with out reading one word of the terms? Even if I was wanting to make a stand on the issue and told people about the unfair terms many would also feel helpless to make a difference and wouldn't even try and the legal
 system in some places is all about wording and semantics and not on common sense or what is right or wrong morally or fair so that also can be a barrier and make anyone who complains look like they have no case to complain also throw in rights of ownership
 vs licensing and all that good stuff and it gets so harry its not even funny but real talk it should be wrong to sell you something with misleading product descriptions, which have terns if use which you can only see after you opened the box and ran the software
 which if you disagree with said terms may not be able to return the product or get a refund.&nbsp; So anyways regardless of what I think I&nbsp; mostly click accept because it wont change anything anyways but if Point #3 came true its a different story and I would probibly
 decline all the ones that were unfair and keep in mind I'm talking about stuff that really seems morally unfair or wrong to me in the terms of use agreements of some products or services and not reasonable terms I just dont like due to wanting everything my
 way so dont think thats what Im getting at, I strongly believe as I said if most people read the terms of use of everything they would find quite a few that didn't sit right with them but it would be different if this was the norm and current practices of
 unfair terms would lesson out of&nbsp; for the most part because many would stop buying products from businesses known for unfair terms. thing is when people think they actually have power and they see others doing similar actions they are more likely to go along
 with it regardless of it being right or wrong and if its something they agree with morally or want to happen and they think it has an actually possibility of changing quickly with their input they are exceptionally more likely to act... I'm not a follower
 for the most part but in this case If I knew most&nbsp; so I may be more inclined to decline more that I think have unfair, unreasonable, or bad terms cause it may actually make a difference in that case. Yes people are more likely to do something if others are
 doing it regardless of how they agree but people are also more <br />
<br />
5. If you take a lager view of things and understand how one thing can lead to another you may see why I believe this next one but well I believe individually this point is not fully that the&nbsp; Blindly agreeing to terms and conditions is detrimental to society,
 the quality of our goods and services, the practices of business, legal system, and more. Yes some of the examples that could be made would seem very loosely connected or unrelated or a stretch but that dose not mean that it is the case and as sociology showed
 me everything really dose influence everything else either directly or indirectly but it has a effect unless you are completely cut off from the rest of the world.... So I in fact I find it hilariously sad that some current practices have kept up so long and
 some are getting worse with time arguably regardless of the constant evolution of the law and its in part to blindly agreeing to those agreements. Its another reason some business get away with what they do and by blindly agreeing over and over it just furthers
 along the cycle and makes them more likely to slip in things into the agreement which can exploit customers, allow business to do the bare minimum, and or keep changing the agreement over and over with or with out notice but labeling you as agreeing no matter
 what. We forget that business only gets away with what we the people have allowed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Many are just dry and outlining simple common sense facts but others it feels like they are trying to have you agree with practices that may not be very moral or clearly make you lose out if they decided they wanted you to... With all that said reading
 them also makes me look at the company, their products/services, its advertisements of those products/services and all that in a different light sometimes lol. Many terms and conditions are similarly worded in a generic layaway sounding way and drown on and
 on. Kinda like in a way where I imagine a lawyer speaking to his or her client about some agreement but the client says "whats the bottom line, what dose that mean" or tells them to hurry up but in this these cases we cant ask for clarification or whats the
 bottom line. "what dose that mean for me?" But I give credit to some companies who do that by telling you what the main point of the terms and services are saying but obviously a slippery slop could be crossed if someone did that but just wanted you to agree
 with the terms with out actually reading them after all the responsibility to read them are on us and no one else. "whats this say" "oh its just saying your not going to sue us" but it really says that they are making you pay the price you agreed on every
 month with automatic charges and you wont find out unless you look soon enough oh but there is a 200 dolor cancellation fee with 2 year contract you didn't know you were signing.. LOL now my examples here are extreme and not as likely but its just illustrating
 my point<br />
<br />
6. If you agree to something you but later say "well I didn't read it"&nbsp; when things go wrong many people or a judge can make you look and feel bad by saying "your telling me you agree to things with out knowing what it is?"<br />
<br />
7. Their are people who are on the side of changing how terms of use/service/agreements are being presented but like a lot of things its slow going. Some feel they way terms and agreements are or presented are taking advantage of people and some judges share
 such feelings but they can only operate with in the law. <br />
<br />
8. terms of use that you see may not be the full one and what you see is just the "short" version<br />
<br />
9. Its a good thing many products dont have terms and conditions of use still.. I cant think having to say I agree before eating a sandwich...
<br />
<br />
10. As usual most of what I say applies to software or online products but their are acceptation but anyways when using software and if it breaks your computer or causes a failure in your system or overheats your system until it fries after less then 10 uses
 of reasonable length well hopefully their terms dont say they are not liable for any damage of any kind&nbsp; to your self or anyone or to any of your property that happens as a direct result of using this product... chances are they have a clause about that...
 Jacked up? Id say so what if its a fate bug that sets most users comps on fire? what then? too bad.. Realistically if its bad enough it would be hard to see them getting away with it but still they can get away with a surprising amount of stuff with limited
 liability or what translates into no liability clauses.. Check out the horror stories if you really want to know.<br />
<br />
11. I believe everyone should read the terms and conditions in full&nbsp; at least once In a while.. Both for their own knolage and because I think if it was such it would change some practices about some arguably unfair or morally wrong terms but it likely wouldn't
 help to change the fact that they are still too long and often worded in confusing ways for the layman. Thats a whole other can of worms.<br />
<br />
12 The companies lawyers make the terms in a way that many people wont bother to read it. Some lock your ability to click next until your scroll though it but still it dose little to make sure everyone actually reads it.. You cant make anyone read it and actually&nbsp;
 make an informed agreement but you can make steps like that to make sure its more likely but serious I think rather then just forcing people to read a really long and overly worded document with complicated language they may not understand it would be better
 off if these were&nbsp; MUCH smaller and worded that most laypeople could understand whats being asked.. Then once you have a short agreement that covers what you want then maybe a good idea is&nbsp; then after have a 3 or up to 10 question test to see if you actually
 read the terms with some simple but important questions like "will you sue us for x y or z?"&nbsp; "T/F we can stop your service at anytime for any reason even if you have payed full price and did not violate the terms of use?" Nothing that requires typing though..
 Maybe a multiple choice, T/F and the like. If they get one of the questions wrong send them back to the terms with the section in question highlighted and a after they click next they can change their answer.&nbsp; Their are many ideas already out there or that
 many could think up but as it is I sometimes suspect really that its deliberately making the terms unfair to the users, to read, too long, too complicated, too tempting to skip and to easy to skip.<br />
<br />
12. Some people are aware and make jokes about terms of use things and even A adult cartoon had a episode on it for a reason as well as other media but for some reason a lot of people who see it dont seem to translate it to real life situations or think that
 anything could be bad in the terms of use in their products but I got news for you it can and is bad in some of them.. But most are oblivious by choice for refusing to lookThe whole read the fine print joke/life lesson has been featured in stories and media
 for a long time and some centuries old stories have spoken about agreeing to things written with out knowing what they mean.. The ideas have been around for a long time for a reason and it can be an effective way to both cover you own ****, and insure that
 no one will mess with you... Sometimes though it can be used to really take advantage of people. Its one more reason why some big companies can feel a bit safer even if they have bad service, hostile customer service and terrible tech support..&nbsp; and lawyers
 and so on who make those kind of agreements really go up and beyond.<br />

            <p>Found the solution.&nbsp; It's in Settings/Personalisation/Backgrounds.&nbsp; Change the Background options to 'Slideshow' then you can browse for the folder to use.&nbsp; Once selected go to Settings/Personalisation/Themes - Theme Settings&nbsp;and save the 'Unsaved Theme'
 as whatever.</p>

    <title>Is it possible with VLOOKUP not only to replace &#35;N&#47;A with a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylor borkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible with VLOOKUP not only to replace &#35;N&#47;A with a blank, but also include in the formula to replace 0 with blank&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a list of item numbers, and four columns to the right with VLOOKUPed prices from 4&nbsp;different tabs. As of now I only have a VLOOKUP formula to replace #N/A with blank using this:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(COUNTIF(Sheet2!$B$15:$H$84,A2)&gt;0,VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet2!$B$15:$H$84,7,FALSE),"")&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a conditional formatting in place to highlight the lowest price on each row, but it keeps highlighting the 0s. Is there a way to VLOOKUP in the 4 columns not only to replace the #N/A with a blank but also include&nbsp;in the formula another VLOOKUP that
 would replace a 0 with a blank?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.</p>

<p>

</p><p><strong>Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last</strong>. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.</p>

            <p>Hi baridoc, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to your query as we are currently receiving a high volume of support request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We perfectly understand that you need help to be able to view or forward the email attachment that you received. Let me assist you on this matter and hopefully we can get this fixed as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our initial troubleshooting process, I highly suggest that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue. This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For assistance in clearing cache and cookies on various browsers refer to the link provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear browser's cache</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also recommend that you keep your web browser up to date to get the most out of Outlook experience. If you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of Outlook might not work and it might not display properly. For more information about this, please
 visit the help article below: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-wlsettings/which-browsers-are-supported-by-skydrive-people/63a2884f-99d9-4d21-806a-156c1b185b44">Which browsers are supported by SkyDrive, People and Outlook.com?</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, if the Microsoft Silverlight installed on your computer is not updated, I suggest for you to uninstall it and get the latest version thru this
<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/Get-Started/Install/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to enhance some experiences like Active Views, sending/viewing attachments, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing so, please make sure that the Silverlight Add-on is enabled on your browser. Please follow the steps below on how to do this:
</p>
<ol>

            Does this happen only in Word or in all applications? Is the mouse wireless? If it happens in all applications and the mouse is wireless, then I can say that in a similar situation I found that rebooting the wireless router solved the problem (don't ask
 me why).

            Mine does this as well, and I agree it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> related to the mouse or touchpad. &nbsp;I noticed that it begins with using the Find feature to search for a term in my document. &nbsp;After I've done a search in my document, it seems to get stuck in a mode of searching regardless if I close the Navigation
 or remove the term from the box. &nbsp;This problem started after I installed Microsoft Word 2013. &nbsp;I've been using Word for many years and have had more problems with this version than any other. &nbsp;Still looking for the solution...

<h2>            Nokia Maps - is it now almost useless &#63;</h2>
                    
<div>Over the recent years I've owned various Nokias. A N95, a N95 8gb, a N96 and now a 5800. Throughout all these Nokias I've used Nokia Maps. I felt a compulsion to try and see how competent their navigation software was. I also at the same time tried Navigon
 and TomTom, often because the Nokia Maps application could not be trusted.&nbsp;<br />

I first noticed with the 5800 that postcode searches were now reduced to 4 characters ie PR3 4GH now returns PR3 4 - this inacuracy could be about 1/2 a mile from where you need to be. On all my other Nokias using Nokia Maps the postcode search searched on
 the full postcode.<br />
<br />
I wrote to Nokia and was first informed that the postcode search had always been truncated (it had not) and my second email received the reply that Nokia now only returned the first four characters of the postcode search.<br />
<br />
From my experience and by way of a comparison TomTom and Navigon both return full postcodes when searched.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Like a lot of others I have paid for drive and walk for the UK and also traffic subscription. Now as I have to enter the full details of where I want to go I feel that navigation is now rather pointless - you need to know exactly where you are going before
 entering the details into Nokia Maps - to be shown where to go.<br />
<br />
If Nokia now only do offer truncated postcode searches and have no plans to do differently I would strongly advise owners of Nokias with Nokia Maps to not purchase the drive and walk option.<br />
<br />
I am very dissapointed that Nokia have taken this approach to Nokia Maps, their maps are provided by Teleatlas and only recently they aquired GMBH (?) to strengthen their navigation arm. Also they are developing Nokia Maps 3 - why bother Nokia - it's an inacurate,
 unreliable piece of software.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm posting this also on the All About Symbian thread - I feel strongly about this - I want Nokia to take note and reverse their decision.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Come on Nokia - offer full postcode searches on Nokia Maps - you know it makes sense !<br />
<br />
Any thoughts anyone ?</div>

<p>Hi chazzle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You raise some interesting issues here although from a global perspective the UK is fairly unique in having such a detailed postcode (zipcode) database because it is so densely populated in areas. I might add that I also use Tomtom Navigator 6 with it's
 UK postcode zip file, although as you are well aware mapping is now unfortunately rather out of date. Since Nokia Maps v2.0 mapping has been provided by Navteq acquisition although TeleAtlas provided for Smart2go &gt; Nokia Maps v1.0. You would be very disappointed
 by present UK coverage in Nokia Maps v3.0Beta in rural areas if you gave it a go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Ford of Europe has chosen Navtek for provision of Bluetooth Mobile Navigation it will be interesting to see how this develops in this regard:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst I can accept that you feel aggrieved by this deficiency the direction now seems to be more of developing location based social network applications and as far as Nokia's growth in say China and India is concerned ownership of a car will for many remain
 out of reach or purpose.</p>

<p>If you are in a corporate environment, it could be that this feature has been disabled by your mail admin. You can contact him/her for options to get it enabled (perhaps only for this action).</p>
<p>If you are using a pst-file, you can also copy this pst-file and connect it to Outlook via;<br />

Then do an Advanced Find (CTRL+SHIFT+F) within this pst-file without any conditions so that all items are being returned. You can now easily delete all the contents folder all the folders at once by selecting the search results and then press SHIFT+DELETE.</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 Excel 32 bit versus 64 bit Calculation Times are the Same</h2>
                    <p>Have Office 2013 32 bit with&nbsp;a 64 bit Windows 7 operating system on my laptop AND Office 2013 64 bit with a 64 bit&nbsp;Windows 7 operating system on a desktop (the desktop Office 2013 64 bit&nbsp;has the evaluation software). Desktop has twice the RAM and higher
 processor speeds. Both have threading turned on and all four processors enabled in Excel Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In comparing the 32 bit 2013 Excel versus the 64 bit 2013 Excel, I used a&nbsp;file containing multiple worksheets with data, tables, formulas, functions, macros, VBA etc. The calculation times with the 32 bit 2013 Excel were exactly the same&nbsp;as the 64 bit version
 of 2013 Excel. Both averaged out to 1 minute 27 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My understanding of the two versions is probably flawed. I haven't been able find how to allow more RAM to the 64 bit version, but understood from Marketing that this would be an option with the 64 bit loads. Could someone offer further information as to
 why this may be happening or refer me to the correct document for further study?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and do appreciate all help.</p>

I suspect Glance is not supported on AMOLED screens, only LED. Just a guess, but there are other phones that don't support it either.

<p>the link is useless as the app says its not compactible with alcatel idol 4s. One ofthe reasons i like windows phones is they had glance screens as one of the first phones n i cant get glance screen on this phone!!! Its 2018! Its more usefull feature than
 samsungs edge display. it wasnt that MS bought Nokia that windows phones went down but wrong MS marketing: Lumia 950 looked ,,cheap old looking,, n most importantly OS window 10 mobile wasnt ready with a lot of bugs n put&nbsp; on the market n later/now when the
 OS is ready/good theres no windows phone. How silly. Alcatel idol s pro with low display resolution n missing glance screen makes the deffrence, too. Useless management, just cos they had the oportunity to study at expensive university doesnt mean they are
 good!!!&nbsp;</p>
