<h2>            Desktop computer display shows 1080i on 1080p monitor with settings set to display 1080p.</h2>
                    So my SSD&nbsp;recently shorted out and I had to get it replaced. After I got the replacement&nbsp;the display on my computer was only showing 1080i instead of 1080p. It also switches to 1080p when I'm in a game but switches back to 1080i when on my desktop. I have
 no idea what caused this and would like someone to troubleshoot&nbsp;this with me. Thank you!

            Hi Ryan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

            Hi RyanMiller9,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />1080 ti is a Video Card from a company called Nvidia. Do you own one?
<br />
<br />Or are you referring that is changing from 1080p to 1080i?
<br />
<br />If so, how did you find out?
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p>Thank you for your reply. I currently own an Nvidia&nbsp;GTX 1070 graphics card and have had my computer display show 1080p before. The problem only started after I got my&nbsp;SSD replaced. And yes, I'm referring to the resolution changing from 1080p to 1080i.</p>

            Thank you for the help, but none of the solutions helped with this problem. I've updated my&nbsp;drivers and have done anything I could. Yet the 1080i resolution is still there.

            Okay, let's try this.
<br />
<br />Uninstall your GPU drivers with this tool. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Then install the latest driver for your GPU model here and let me know if the issue persists.

            You likely need to use the nVidia Control Panel to fix it:

<h2>            Phone stuck on &#39;Obtaining IP Address&#39; when setting up WiFi hotspot with Internet Connection sharing</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10, I have a working internet connection via Ethernet.&nbsp; &nbsp;My LAN subnet is 192.168.18.0/24, and my router assigns dhcp addresses between 192.168.18.2 and 192.168.18.254.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a WiFi adapter in my computer that I'm trying to use as a WiFi access point / hotspot.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've verified the adapter allows use as an access point.&nbsp; I've configured and used the same adapter running from a linux host and it works fine both as a client
 and as an access point.&nbsp; From this Windows 10 computer, I'm able to ping other devices on my LAN</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through the Windows 10 'hotspot setup' process many times, with many reboots and a 'network reset' in between, and every time I have nominally the same results... my phone can see the my hotspot SSID that is broadcast, and I can try to connect
 the phone to it.&nbsp; It appears to authenticate, but then goes into an "Obtaining IP address" stage, and ultimately fails to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've enabled 'Internet Connection Sharing' on my Ethernet connection, and set the 'Home networking connection' to the virtual adapter connection of my hotspot ("Local Area Connection xx").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also been through the following threads, and the same "fixes" that I see in here repeatedly don't make any difference on my setup...</p>

</p><p>I don't understand how this is even possibly going to work, as I typically will see the following (excerpts from 'ipconfig /all' output, after setting up my hotspot and Internet Connection Sharing....</p>

<p>The subnet that the hotspot is assigned to is 192.168.137.0... and DHCP is disabled for it...&nbsp; there is no default gateway... I don't see how my router is going to assign an IP address to a device that connects to the hotspot?&nbsp; &nbsp; At any rate, I can't ever

<h2>            Tomb Raider Stops Downloading at 26&#37;</h2>
                    I purchased the xbox 360 e holiday bundle which came with Halo 4 and Tomb Raider. Ever since I got the console on New Years Eve, I have tried downloading Tomb Raider because of the code I got. The download takes around 6 hours to even get to 26 percent,
 and then I get a notification that says "Cant download Tomb Raider". I have tried everything that I could find on here, but it hasnt worked. Can someone please tell me how to get this download to work. I have been looking forward to this, but have been put
 down because of the download. I am open to any solutions.

<p>Hi try deleting the game from your hard drive and any non essential saves (if any) and download the game again</p>
<p>You could also try deleting any dlc as this has caused a couple of issues in the past, the content can be reinstalled when your game is up and running by viewing your purchase history.</p>
<p>Finally try the old favourite of clearing you cache as below:</p>

========================================<br />
I agree with Bruce Hagen that Recuva is a good app for <br />
recovering deleted files. <br />
<br />
For recovery from your system drive it would be best to <br />
use the portable version and run it from an external source <br />
like a memory card or USB flash drive to reduce the chance <br />
of overwriting the deleted files.<br />

<h3> jimtroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Viisual C&#43;&#43; Redistributable won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I was tring to update the Avid HD Driver in Windows 8.1 Pro (64 bit), I uaed the "delete driver" option in Device Manager, but this left some components in the programs list that kept the installer from running. I was able to clear these with the Windows
 Install Clean-up Utility, &nbsp;but now the installer is unable to write MS Visual C++ Redistributable -- it tries four times, proceeds with the install, reports success and instructs me to restart, but no driver has been installed. I have tried running as an administrator
 from a clean boot -- no help. Neither the old nor the new driver will install The sound card and driver have been working for months, so it isn't a compatibility issue. Anyone got an idea? Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>2. Does this issue occur after upgrading to Windows 8.1? </p>
<p>3. From where exactly do you get the reports that you were able to install Visual C++ Redistributable successfully?
</p>
<p>4. What happens when you install the driver? Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Provide more information so that we could help you further. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks fior looking at this. Here's the info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Computer is generic desktop with Asus Sabertooth X79 MB, Intel Core i7 3930K CPU</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Yes, long after -- i.e. the trouble didn't start with the upgrade. &nbsp;But I guess that if Visual C++ was already installed and 8.1 denied write access &nbsp;at a level that administrative privileges didn't override this could be the first time I saw it. Also,
 I see that Windows Updates has installed a version of Visual C++; could that be a problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Sorry, I wasn't clear. I do NOT get a message that says C++ installed successfully. I did get a message when I ran the installer in compatibility mode with Windows 7 settings that C++ had apparently MOT installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) &nbsp; A messsge box opens saying "Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable" appears and a series of status boxes fills; the window closes and immediately reopens, repeating the identical process. This happens a total of four times. The installer then
 finishes the driver install, and this is where I get the message that "Installation has completed successfully:. &nbsp;But after restart, nothing has changed -- Device Manager still shows the card as a Multimedia Controller with no driver.</p>
<p>

c. Click on it and then select “Uninstall”.<br />
d. Follow the on-screen instructions and restart the computer if prompted.</p>
<p><br />
Note: If you cannot find Microsoft Visual C++ in the installed programs list, go to step 2 to install the latest version.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 2: Install the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++</strong></p>
<p><br />
Please follow these steps to download and install the latest version of Microsoft Visual C++ components on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Click on this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>to download the latest version of Visual C++ Redistributable Package.</p>
<p>b. After the download, run the setup file and follow the on screen instructions to install the package.<br />
c. Restart the computer, if prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now check with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. </p>

            <p>Hi Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I need to ask you before proceeding -- I have 22 copies of Visual C++ Redistributable installed, what should I do? Four of them are from PACE and are the 64- and 32-but flavors for two iLoka; these I think I need to leave alone. The others are 64- and
 32-bit versions from 2005, 2005, and 2010 installed by Windows Updates, various versions of Pro Tools, and I believe other unknown apps. I can chuck all of these, but please advise. Thanks again,</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These installers are from the Avid website, and I've downloaded fresh copies since this problem started. A post on their user forum has elicited no response from over 400 views, so it's probably not a driver issue. Has Win 8.1 changed the file structure
 so that Device Manager or the Install Clean-up Utility could have deleted components needed to read or write C++? Is there a way to replace missing system files without doing a system refresh and reinstalling everything?</p>

                    <span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Task Scheduler is set to create a Restore point at every power-up and at 12:00 p.m. Yesterday when I had to reboot several times to repair the system it successfully created a Restore Point each time. Today it won't do anything.
 I opened Task Scheduler and manually triggered the task, it ran, but created no Restore Point. The Event Viewer tells me that the task did run, was successful, yet no Restore Points were created. What an I doing wrong? What could have possibly changed since
 yesterday when it created close to a dozen Restore Points?</p>

<p>Apparently no matter what settings I change in the Task Scheduler, Windows 7 will only create a Restore Point if no other Restore Points have been created in the last seven days.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378910(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa378910(VS.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>So, every morning I have to manually create a Restore Point. This is progress?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want something done, don't count too much on Windows 7. DO IT YOURSELF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to personally thank everyone for all of their help and support with my question.</p>

            <p>Hi Jonathan, <br />
<br />
<br />
To change the color of the log in screen on your Windows 8.1 device, here are your options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Windows Charms </strong>by swiping in from the right or moving the mouse cursor to one of the right-hand side corners.</li><li>Type <strong>accent</strong> on the search box.</li><li>Select <strong>Change the background and colors on Start</strong>.</li><li>From there, you should be able to independently customize the<strong> background</strong> and
<strong>accent </strong><strong>color</strong> displayed on Startup. Then, save the changes you have made.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows ke</strong><strong>y</strong> + <strong>R</strong> from the desktop.</li><li>Type <strong>regedit</strong> in the search box. Click Yes, if prompted.</li><li>On the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following key: <br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f585a460-9bdb-4931-8f6e-37ccc9c1f5d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f585a460-9bdb-4931-8f6e-37ccc9c1f5d6" /></a><br />
</li><li>On the right pane of the window, right-click on the empty area and create a new
<strong>32-bit DWORD value</strong> and name it as <strong>DefaultColorSet</strong>.

            <p>With your Windows 8 computer, it only enables the user to change the background image for your lock screen and the background color of your log in screen.</p>

            Did you ever resolve this issue? &nbsp;I am experiencing the same issue on macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 and have not been able to install any of the recent builds of Windows 10. &nbsp;I was able to install an older build the first time I tried, but it wouldn't update
 to the Anniversary or Creators updates. &nbsp;Now I can't get any build to install, it just hangs on "Getting Ready". &nbsp;The beads spin for a few minutes, the screen dims, then it gets bright again just before the beads stop spinning and it hangs like this indefinitely
 (I have left it overnight). &nbsp;I have tried several published methods, but they all result in hanging at "Getting Ready" each time. &nbsp;If I force a reboot, it gives an error that the installation didn't complete, and prompts me to restart to begin the installation
 again. &nbsp;Occasionally I am able to get into the startup recovery which lets me into the recovery console and I've manually installed all of the Bootcamp drivers with no change in behavior. &nbsp;

            When Microsoft took over Skype it became part of your Microsoft account.

<h2>            Plz Help&#33;&#33;&#33; Power supply for Xbox One, console bought in US but to be used in India&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Everyone!!!</p>
<p>Plz help me out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My uncle bought xbox one for me from US as my birthday gift and is bringing it to India to me. I read about power compatibility issues. In US it is 110V perhaps (I may be wrong) and in India it is 220V. I could not find anywhere on net what could be an authentic
 solution to it. People say you cannot use step up/down transformer/ voltage coverters/ power bricks as they void warranty.</p>
<p>I want &nbsp;to know (1) does Microsoft provides any authentic power bridge for this? (2) If Microsoft does not provide any such thing, then what could be the best thing/alternative to use which does not harm console? (3) I am in Bangalore, where can I get such
 stuff either from Microsoft or any other place?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your kind help!!!!!!!</p>

<p>But they do not provide such power supplies and the tech support person told me to get one big sturdy voltage regulator of a good brand and told that usage of this does not void warranty.</p>

<p>There are a number of countries with 230V/50Hz mains electricity where the Xbox One is for sale. Go on eBay and see if you can purchase a PSU from one of those countries, then you can use that with a plug adaptor (if necessary), without having to use a step-down
 transformer. Avoid third party PSUs though, as they will not only void your warranty, they tend to be low quality and have very noisy fans in them.</p>

<p>I have purchased on all Call of Duty: World at War DLC when they came out, I use to play them on my old XBOX360 but now I have the new XBOX Slim and I transferred everything from my old HDD to my new XBOX's HDD. My problem is that none of my DLC content

 I downloaded them from has now go onto a Silver Membership so I can't use that account but I should be able to use the content on my new account since it's on my HDD, could someone please tell me the problem here?</p>

<p>The file path to this is located here:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>You must have Hidden Files and Folder turned on. &nbsp;You can also access it by opening the Start Menu and Right Clicking on the All Programs Menu. &nbsp;There select Open, not Open All Users, and that will bring up the same thing.</p>

<p>There are two folders, one for "All Users" which is located at</p>
<p><strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</strong></p>
<p>and another one for your personal user account, which is located at</p>
<p>C:\Users\<strong>"User Name"</strong>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>

                    I have some jpeg files on an external hard drive which I no longer seem to be able to access. I get message saying I do not have permission. Have tried changing security settings, but can do this for individual pictures but not the whole file containing
 them.<br />
However, if I plug the drive into a different device (EG blue-ray player with usb input) I can access them no problem.<br />
How can I change the settings for this folder so I can view these pictures?<br />

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>My sense is that the drive needs to be reformatted and assigned proper permissions that way. So, connect the drive where you can access the files in question, download them (and anything else you want to preserve), and then reformat the drive using the freeware
 application EaseUS Partition Master. Download it&nbsp;from here:&nbsp; <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Master-Free-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html?tag=mncol;1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Let me know if this procedure solves the problem for you.</p>

    <title>Problems after resetting to factory default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leahamy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems after resetting to factory default</h2>
                    About two weeks ago I reset my laptop to the factory settings in an attempt to stop my computer from freezing, when it turned out google chrome was the culprit so that was pointless anyway. However since then there is always something wrong with my laptop.
 It runs fine like I can use it normally like I did before but I think there's something wrong with Microsoft itself. I keep getting messages from the action center telling me I need to turn on Windows Defender, that I don't have anti virus (I have the Norton
 Online Security which came built in with a 60 day free trial on the computer), that I need to check for updates etc. To try and fix the anti virus problem I tried the repositorysalvage in the command prompt but all I got was a message saying WMI is consistent,
 restarting the machine did not fix the problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am also having problems with the windows updates themselves, as I have had about three different batches of updates trying to install the past two weeks and every single one has failed. Each has tried multiple times but they always hang and so I have
 to force power off and restart. Even when I install from the action center while the computer is running they still fail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The most frustrating thing is is that I have actually been trying to fix these problems. I have ran the Microsoft Fix It tool multiple times, one time it said it failed about 3/5 things but the second time it said it corrected 2/2 and yet these problems
 are still occuring. I have also downloaded and ran the Tweaking All In One Repair Tool, and still the problems continue. I really, really do not want to perform a clean install of Windows (7, 64x) but I can not think of anything else I can do here. The laptop
 is about 30 months old and as far as I know there is no physical damage to it. I am really desperate for an answer here and if anyone has one it'd be much appreciated.</div>

            Thank you so much for replying but I think I sorted it out. When I was waiting for your reply I found a solution for Windows XP which had been said to help people with Vista and 7 and involved typing a load of stuff ending in .dll into the command prompt.
 The updates are now successfully installing. Thank you for your time anyway!

    <title>Application not appearing in the volume mixer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dplind87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Application not appearing in the volume mixer</h2>
                    I am currently trying to play EVE online on my desktop, but when I start the program it does not appear in the volume mixer.&nbsp; However, when I play on my laptop it appears in the mixer.<br />
<br />
ALL other applications appear to be running fine in the mixer, just not Eve Online.&nbsp; I have also launched an earlier version of the game, and still not showing up in the mixer.<br />
<br />
I have done these steps from another post, without success:<br />
<br />
<p><span>Check to see if the following steps help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Control Panel and then on Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double click on Speakers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under advanced tab check the option "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device". Click OK.</span></p>

Any ideas?&nbsp; It is impossible to play the game without audio.<br />

            Hey, thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Ya, it is an application launched from desktop from an .exe, but it first goes through a patcher before it launches the exe.<br />
<br />
I have skewered the eve support forums for this issue, but there is nothing like it.&nbsp; I am running on a XFX 680i LT motherboard, which has not had any updates since 2006.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also, I have checked the audio files in the game and they are all .ogg files, and .BNK files.&nbsp; All other games that I have ever heard of run .wav files for their audio.&nbsp; I don't know if that helps, but I have tried to look into any aspect of this that might
 help.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, is there a way to force an application to the volume mixer?&nbsp; Or even a way to bypass the mixer so that the application does not have to go through it to play sound?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks again for the reply; I am literally pulling my hair out right now!<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><span><font color="#000000">An app slider is added to the mixer when an audio session is created. There are two things that can cause an audio session to be created: First
 off, when an audio stream created by the app transitions to the "start" state. The other case is when an application manipulates the audio volume using the Audio Session Control interface.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">In this case it looks like the EVE online game itself is not creating the Audio Session.

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to try installing all available audio codecs for Windows 7 and then check if

<h2>            Printer error&#58; 0xE0000100</h2>
                    While trying to create the PDF Converter printer for QuickBooks, the operation fails. The title in the error dialog box is:Printers, and the error message is:Operation could not be completed (error 0xe0000100). I'm running Vista Ultimate with Service Pack
 2. I've tried uninstalling QuickBooks, running CHKDSK on the drive (C:), running Registry Mechanic, and then re-installing QuickBooks. When it gets to the point where QB tries to create the PDF Converter printer, it fails with the above error message.

<p>Hi LCubedsol,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</p>
<p><br />
•&nbsp;Are you using 32 bit or 64 bit of Windows vista?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you have any other printer installed on the computer?</p>
<p>First I would suggest that you check if the print spooler service is running on the computer.</p>
<p>A print spooler is service that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them. If you've been waiting an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you see an error message about the
 print spooler, spooler subsystem, or spooler resources, you might need to change and then restart the Print Spooler service on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>To change or restart the Print Spooler service</strong></p>
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. <br />
1.&nbsp;Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Administrative Tools.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Double-click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right-click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties.<br />
4.&nbsp;On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
5.&nbsp;If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
6.&nbsp;Make sure that the service is started and set to automatic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still does not work I would suggest that you contact the QuickBooks for more information.<br />

            <p>Hi Johan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could arise if you have the sharing wizard option disabled in folder option. Just to make sure this is not causing the issue, I suggest you to try the steps below and check:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Copy and paste the following command and press enter:</p>
<p>control.exe folders</p>
<p>3. Click the "view" tab and scroll down.</p>
<p>4. Under advanced settings, make sure the "use sharing wizard" options in checked.</p>
<p>5. Save the changes and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to remove a certain user from accessing a folder, you can directly right click on the folder, select "share with" and select "specific people" and choose the preferred users only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance, we will be glad to help.</p>
