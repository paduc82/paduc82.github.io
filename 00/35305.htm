<p>Hi Groboto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Surface model do you use your Surface Dial with? I would suggest that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit to make sure you have the recommended driver and firmware updates. This tool will also check for possible software issues that may affect the
 performance of your Surface Dial. To download the tool, go <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Afterwards,
 perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also configure the Bluetooth connection on your device so it will not put the Surface Dial to sleep when the Bluetooth accessory is unused for a few minutes. To do that, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> (<strong>Windows key </strong>+ <strong>
X</strong> &gt; <strong>Device Manager</strong>).</li><li>Expand <strong>Bluetooth</strong> and right-click on <strong>Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab.</li><li>If the <strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong> option is currently selected, uncheck the option and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I would also recommend that you share your experience about this issue using the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback Hub</a></strong> app. We will continue working on this and once the problem has been fully
 addressed, a resolution will be made available through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this post if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I have the same issue with my surface dial.&nbsp; I tried unchecking the "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" option in device manager for my bluetooth adapter (I'm not using a surface computer, but a custom built one with a motherboard
 integrated bluetooth adapter), but the dial still goes to sleep after a few minutes and takes several seconds to wake up before it functions again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the sleep mode is built into the dial itself?&nbsp; I hope there is still a way to disable the sleep mode, since responsiveness matters more to me than power savings.&nbsp; (I made a feedback hub post as well.)</p>

<p>I also have this issue.&nbsp; I use (or try to use)my Surface Dial on a Microsoft Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; I use it to turn up and down the volume of a background MP3.&nbsp; I am a working Praise &amp; Worship music musician and I need the dial to ready to vary the volume up or
 down at a micro moment.&nbsp; When the dial goes to sleep it takes a second or two to awake...needless to say when working with music a second or two might as well be 5 minutes.&nbsp; When I need it to work - I need it to work "NOW"&nbsp; I have switched back to a USB wired
 device which works fine.&nbsp; I would prefer wireless.&nbsp; I have noticed this has been a complaint for a long time now for Dial users.&nbsp; Is this going to be rectified?, or do I need to resolve myself to staying with a wired USB device?&nbsp; I tried the advise listed
 above, but no luck.&nbsp; The Surface dial still goes to sleep.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Ruz San (MS Support),<br />
<br />
Your offered solutions do not work for most user cases here including mine.<br />
I am on a Windows 10 Laptop, not a Surface device, so the suggestion to run the surface diag tool is not an option unfortunately. You need a Surface to be able to run the tool. The second solution does not help either. I've had that dechecked before I purchased
 a Dial. My Bluetooth mouse required it to function properly.<br />
<br />
Just to vent some frustrations and share a bit of backstory.<br />
I have been using the Dial with a a hate/love relationship for over a year now. When I purchased it and found out about this issue I called the Microsoft support line. At first I got refused support because I did not own a Surface. After some insisting that
 I have a problem with a product with a valid warranty I was reluctantly "helped". They told me it would be fixed with a coming windows update. This was way over a year ago. I kept on using the device, hoping for a fix, in the mean time teaching myself to just
 tap it on a regular basis to keep it awake. When properly connected it is a wonderful product and a great addition to any computer. However the sleep/standby issue is absolutely ruining the user experience if you need the device ready quickly like a volume
 button. For instance, in case of a sudden loud noise you'd want to be able to turn the volume down immediately, not have to wait anywhere between 3-10 seconds to the Dial to reconnect first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any hope we will see a fix or maybe a new improved version of the product any time soon? Would love to hear back.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Same experience here - I use it for adjusting music volume up and down.....when I need it - I need it to respond immediately - waiting for it to wake up to work make it useless to me as well.&nbsp; I packed it away and get it out from time to time to see if it
 has been corrected.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 4 and the suggestions -to-date- have not worked.&nbsp; "Microsoft- you create AI- Holograms - etc-etc....this should be an easy fix for you.....</p>

<p>I installed the recently released Window 1809 update, was hoping for some improvements since its a pretty big update. For the dial it brings zero improvement. On the plus side, I like the new dark mode for Explorer quit a bit. yay,</p>

            That is very true. It renders any action I could do with the dial really late. Useless in Photoshop when you really need to paint fast. A pitty, it has so many integrated functions there.

<p>Yep, I just bought a surface dial and it looks like it will be going back.&nbsp; Too bad I love the weight and when it's ON it's a smooth experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I need it to react immediately when I reach for it.</p>
<p>

            Hi Alan, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a fellow user.
<br />
<br />What format are the CDs in? Have you ripped them onto the drive as MP3s, or another format?
<br />
<br />You could see if the other music files play using VLC media player. It's well known for being able to play almost all media formats.
<br />
<br />Here's a link to download it:

<p>If the audio Cd's where ripped using windows media player the error could be they are copy protected; being microsoft is not selling anymore music, the content may not be able to get a</p>
<p>valid licence.</p>
<p>For future reference; select mp3 as the default rip option in wmp.</p>
<p>This will be a time consuming effort but you may have to rip the audio cd's again.</p>
<p>I use a usb thumb drive to copy all my music to then transfer to each device using the copy and past options in windows; no syncing with wmp.</p>

            Files that were ripped onto a Windows 7 machine a few months ago now won't play on a Windows 10 machine, while files ripped onto Windows 7 years ago will play when transferred to Windows 10. Is this a copyright issue or something else? Another responder
 gave me some links to try. We'll see. And also hope that someone might know exactly what's wrong.

            That would be the reason some of them don't work - they're DRM protected.
<br />
<br />DRM stands for Digital Rights Management and is copy-protection software installed by the CD publisher to prevent copying, or to limit the number of copies that can be made. It's likely that the WMA files were registered to the PC you originally copied the files to from the CD, but after copying them to a different PC the DRM activates and won't allow playback on a different PC to the one the CDs were originally copied to.
<br />
<br />Annoying, I know. But that's how copyright protection works with modern CDs. If you'd like to play the ones that don't work on the new PC, I think you'll need to copy them to that PC from the CDs again!

<p>On win7 pc, go to the default music folder, usually this would be C:/user/user/Music</p>
<p>Select a folder, click to open the folder, on one of the music files, select on file, right contents menu, properties, details tab, scroll down to protected; this will give you the status of the encrypted protection.</p>

<li>Select <b>Network Settings</b>.</li>
<li>Select the name of your wired or wireless network (if applicable).</li>

    <title>Surface pro UEFI loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leehughes864  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro UEFI loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi. My surface pro started to loop to the UEFI menu with no way to enter Windows. I've tried resetting, restoring and pretty much everything i can but still no luck. I've tried restoring from the downloaded image files as per the instructions too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to reinstall windows from the usb, it can't because it doesn't show a drive to install to, although the x recovery drive is viewable on both CMD prompt and when attempting to select drivers. I've opened the. Msi files with a program on my other
 laptop and extracted them to a USB where I've tried loading all the drivers that look like hard drive ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still in warranty but i bought it in America but i live in Dubai so there's no way to have it repaired locally, apparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please does anyone know what's going on with it? Why can't it see the drive? I'm assuming it's working as the recovery drive (presumably a partition) is showing. Diskpart doesn't see the drive or volume, only the recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always defended Microsoft for ease of modification and repair but I'm disappointed with this as i can't even replace the drive to sort the issue myself (if it is a drive failure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thks you in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one important indication of a possible drive failure that we need to check to understand why you are facing this problem. In the UEFI screen, do you see this icon&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f02b429-8522-4ea5-a932-ec0860829987?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f02b429-8522-4ea5-a932-ec0860829987?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;in
 the top right corner? If you do, this means that the motherboard is unable to detect the hard drive. It would be best to have the device replaced since this kind of issue is hardware related. I understand that you are currently in Dubai and you got the device
 in the United States. Since this is the case, please <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Support via chat</a></strong> or call the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Global Customer Service</a></strong> team in the USA. Your warranty is only valid in the country where it was purchased.
 Our team in the USA will process a replacement for you and provide the next steps so you can ship your current Surface Pro unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case there is no icon of a hard drive in the UEFI, try to perform a forced shutdown while you are in the UEFI screen. Press the power button for about 20 seconds. If the Surface boots properly afterwards, please run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. It
 will ensure that the device has the latest driver and firmware updates, and also check for underlying software issues. For more information about the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, go
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update the post with the results of the troubleshooting. I will be alerted when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Typical Shift-CapsLock behavior for Microsoft IME &#40;Japanese&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Typical Shift-CapsLock behavior for Microsoft IME &#40;Japanese&#41; not working</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded my OS to the latest insider build of Windows 10, and since the upgrade the typical behavior of the IME is not working as expected. I am used to being able to use the 'Shift-CapsLock' combination to toggle IME kana input.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e53221d-7c5d-4f65-a2ba-41fe0f8da0af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e53221d-7c5d-4f65-a2ba-41fe0f8da0af" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3900550a-acef-4245-96f0-afc67faef59e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3900550a-acef-4245-96f0-afc67faef59e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands now using this key combination, I can switch back from Kana to Alphanumeric, but not from Alphanumeric to Kana, i.e. I can only go backwards; I cannot suddenly switch to Kana. This is incredibly annoying; I have to manually click the icon to
 change it or define a custom key sequence without CapsLock because for some reason CapsLock is not an acceptable custom key to use, despite its being ordinarily in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ddbebe3-47f6-45fa-b3b3-ba5351500bb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ddbebe3-47f6-45fa-b3b3-ba5351500bb8" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/506db1a7-ca96-465b-9f0b-2c635f2800e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/506db1a7-ca96-465b-9f0b-2c635f2800e2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no 'CapsLock' in this list; it appears to default to the Japanese key for this function, which is not present on my US keyboard. I have tried using Shift-Tab as an alternative, which works. But I want the original Shift-Caps behavior which I have
 been using for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm my keyboard layout is correct:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e58b19bb-5bf5-4daa-8d5c-bcf4e7fc901c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e58b19bb-5bf5-4daa-8d5c-bcf4e7fc901c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have lived in Japan and used a Japanese keyboard. On those, the Capslock key on its own does the switch, and Shift-CapsLock is needed to engage CapsLock (reverse of the usual behavior). I may be having a similar problem as to

            <p>My issue is a different one. I am using a US keyboard as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is capslock is only working for going from IME かな input back to 英語 English. It will not operate in the other direction. Furthermore, despite capslock being an active hotkey, it is not a selectable or customizable one, therefore there is no obvious
 way to restore typical capslock behavior.</p>

            After you install windows 8 it will not ask you for a key unless your clean installing or installing from a disk.

<div>After you upgraded you can use that program to view your key.</div>

            Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; However, I had installed Windows 8 Pro then installed the free&nbsp;Media Center.&nbsp; My Pc got infected with a virus and I used one of those key finder programs that retrieves the product ID so I could print it.&nbsp; I installed Windowws
 7, then windows 8 and went to put in the produt ID and found it only worked to install Media Center.&nbsp; I called&nbsp; Microsoft and found out they had no information on my purchase.&nbsp; I looked at my bank statement and found the purchase by Arva to Digital.&nbsp; Now I
 have to wait to&nbsp;see if Microsoft can help.&nbsp; Hopefully the can.

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Customers with Windows 8 Enterprise have noticed that they cannot upgrade their OS to the new version using the normal Windows Store-based installer.

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First, and most generally, Windows 8 Enterprise is "blocked" from using the Store updater for good reason: Enterprise is rolled out to users in controlled

    <title>Internal drive won&#39;t work when connected via USB &#40;cyclic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcelo&#174;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal drive won&#39;t work when connected via USB &#40;cyclic redundancy check&#41;</h2>
                    I replaced this&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">WD1200BEVS-75UST0 SATA internal drive with a SSD on my latitude D630, running windows 7 SP1, and</span>&nbsp;got an external case to reuse it as an external drive.&nbsp;
<div>The SSD is working fine(great) but the hard drive is not recognized by Windows(7 or 8.1) when on USB. The Disk Manager shows it as "Disk x" Unkown/Not Initialized, both on Windows 7 and on Windows 8.1(on my desktop) and shows a "cyclic redundancy check"
 error when I try to initialize it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First thing I reinstalled the drive as internal on the notebook and it is still working fine. Then I connected the SSD via USB. both on the notebook and the desktop. and the external case/USB cable are working as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There ain't much DISKPART or CHKDSK can do since I'm not able to initialize or create a volume for it when on USB. So I booted from the SSD on USB, cleaned, fully formatted and created a new NTFS partition on the disk using DISKPART, while it was back
 inside the notebook. But it's all the same when I connect it again via USB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've found a lot of suggestions on forums and tried a lot of programs to fix it but nothing seems to work. Even Western Digital's own support application fails on every test and doesn't offer any solution. No program can write anything on the disk or detect
 the new partition I've created. It's like it's locked for use outside the notebook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks like a pretty simple configuration issue, but whatever it is I would really appreciate if someone could point me it out here.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Hi,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3837a08e-d00e-48e8-84c7-faee86d76253">Srimadhwa</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm starting to believe that the 6 years old hard drive is not fully compatible with the USB caddy, as you considered, but there's no firmware update available from Western Digital.</div>
<div>After all the procedures you recommend the problem remains just the same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is what I found out:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1 - All USB devices are recognized, including the faulty USB drive itself.</div>
<div>2 - No error when plugin the device, though after some tries it may start to ignore it until I switch to another USB port.</div>
<div>3 - The driver is automatically installed by Windows when I plug the drive for the first time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 1: The troubleshooter finds no issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2: The present drivers are considered the best option and maintained by Windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 3: All USB drivers were reinstalled (but the one used by the keyboard)</div>
<div><br />
<div>(I'm testing it on a quite new Dell XPS desktop with an up to date Windows 8.1 Pro and there's never been any issue with the machine)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd like to add that DISKPART states the disk is set as readable and the system log shows thousands of this system error "The device, \Device\Harddisk5\DR9, has a bad block."</div>
<div>When I try to initialize the drive it shows: "VDS fails to write boot code on a disk during clean operation. Error code: 80070017@02070008"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just as a reminder, the hard drive has no problem working inside it's original machine and the USB caddy works fine with a SSD drive, on the same machine that can't manage the hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you and I hope there are some further procedures I could try.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Hi, Palcouk.</div>

Hi,
<div><br />
<div>As I mentioned here Western Digital was of no help either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But the now retired drive is still being useful as a nice piece of decoration.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe this thread will help keeping people from wasting much time with such drives, like I did.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<p>On my home family computer there seems to be a resolution problem with the monitor (Hanns.G HW191D) there seems to only be 3 resolution settings as you can see from the picture and the picture looks very stretched. THE PICTURE HAS BEEN SQUASHED TOGETHER
 SO IT LOOKS FINE BUT THE MONITOR IS A WIDESCREEN!</p>

<h2>            Laptop to Projector Connection problem</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Laptop to a Dell XPS with Windows 7. &nbsp;I previously had a an older Dell laptop with VGA output. &nbsp;I have a Projector that uses the VGA input, and that worked great with my old laptop (no HDMI port). &nbsp;My new XPS doesn't have VGA output,
 so I purchased a HDMI to VGA cord. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PROBLEM: &nbsp;My laptop is not recognizing the Projector and not outputting. &nbsp;Is there any fix for this? &nbsp;I have messed around with Display settings and still no recognition of the projector / no output detected by the projector.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there something I can do for a driver fix?</div>

<p><strong><span>Hello. I have recorded some tv programmes with my dvd recorder and it always does so in MPEG-2 format. But when i pop the disc recorded disc into my laptop, windows
 does not detect the file, it detects the disc but show up nothing for it which means it wont let me convert it. I want to actually convert the file into an mp4 so i can put the things i recorded on my ipod for when i go away on holiday. Do i need some sort
 of code which allows windows to read the files on the disc? cheers</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>The reason you cannot play these files is because</span></span><span><span>you
 do not have a compatible MPEG-2 decoder (also called a DVD decoder) installed on your computer.</span></span><span><span>You will need<br />
to </span></span><span><span>download the codec or you can upgrade the existing DVD Decoder Codec.<br />

<h2>            Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart</h2>
                    My Gateway Laptop crashed randomly last week, and when i booted it up it came up with a error message saying 'Your PC Ran Into A Problem And Needs To Restart, It also says 'Inaccessible Boot Device'. After i restart it it does this loop thing called 'Automatic
 Repair' and goes to a Recovery Menu which is pointless. It tells me to insert my Recovery CD when it didn't come with one from my PC Manufactures. No, i cannot boot to Desktop, when i boot it up, it goes straight to this Blue Screen with a Sad Face saying
 'Your PC ran into a problem', then it automatically restarts and goes to 'Automatic Repair'.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Tipene,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may t<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ry to unplug all the external devices, except keyboard and mouse then start the computer and check if you can boot to desktop.
<br />
</span></span></p>
<br />
<p>If the issue still persists, we need Windows 8 re-installation disk to troubleshoot the issue further. As the computer is pre-installed with Windows 8, you may have to contact Gateway support for getting Windows 8 installation or recovery Disk. Or you may
 check with any of your friends for Windows 8 operating system disk. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the link: </p>

<p><br />
</p>
&nbsp; <br />
<p>After getting the&nbsp;Windows 8 installation or recovery Disk, you may perform Automatic repair by boot from the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><b><span>To perform Automatic repair on Windows 8 computer follow these steps:</span></b></font></font></p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>
If the automatic repair fails,<span><span> perform system restore to previous working date.</span></span></p>
<p>
</span></p>
<p>
</span>Boot from the Windows 8 DVD. </span></p>
<p>
</span>Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “Install now”</span></p>

            Hi Shayli, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It's possible that Veritas System Recovery hasn't yet been updated to work with Windows 10 version 1809. You'll need to check if the publisher has released an update for you to install.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you can get in touch with Veritas support for troubleshooting assistance by following this link:

            Different major releases of Windows 10 have different compatibility with apps, so it's quite possible that Veritas need to update their product before it can run with Windows 10 version 1809.
<br />
<br />You may need to get in contact with Veritas support to see if they are releasing an update for their products to work with the latest version of Windows.
