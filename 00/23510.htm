                    I move new texts from my inbox (Windows 6.211 HTC Touch2) into several sub-directories (filing my texts by sender and/or subject)<br />

<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft My Phone.&nbsp; Currently My Phone does not back up text messages that are not in the Inbox, Sent, or Deleted items folders.&nbsp; We are looking at changing this in the future but do not have any definitive plans to do so at the moment
 and we do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.<br />

<h2>            Windows Mobile Device Center won&#39;t connect Palm Treo with Windows 7 64-bit RC</h2>
                    When I plug in my Palm Treo 700wx in my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit RC, it stays "connecting" and never connects. I tried uninstalling WMDC and the driver and reinstalling and get the same behavior. When this same PC is booted into Vista Ultimate 64-bit,
 it syncs just fine. I have heard rumors of a hotfix. Anyone have any info? It is painful to have to boot back into Vista just to sync my Palm.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hi,<br />
After you installed WMDC and the 64 bit driver, did you reboot?&nbsp; Also, when you plug the Treo into your Windows 7 PC, is the Treo recognized in the Device Manager.

<h3> bsalad  say:</h3>
<h2>            TECH SUPPORT PHONE NUMBER&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Professional and Office 2010 (with Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).&nbsp; About 10 months ago I purchased and installed Project Pro 2013 and it worked FINE until last weekend (running in Office 2013 on the same machine), when I got this error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong. Sorry we ran into a problem. Go online for additional help. Error code: 30088-4."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a thread on line with the same error code and followed the instructions that were provided and clicked the "Fix It" button, which apparently did a partial uninstall of something. Though I could still see Office 2013 AND Project Pro on my computer,
 it would not open (new error code 0-2).&nbsp; And I was unable to reinstall (new error code 0-4).&nbsp;So we spent about 45 minutes walking through the detailed instructions to MANUALLY delete the program, including about 200 changes to the registry files, after which
 it was truly gone, but then none of my Office 2010 programs would open anymore.&nbsp; So we restored the original registry files, and all of the Office 2010 programs seem to be working, and Project Pro still seems to be gone. So at least that seems to have worked.<br />
<br />
Now when I try to reinstall Project Pro, it gets about 45% through the "preparing files" than I get this same message:&nbsp; "Something went wrong Sorry we ran into a problem. Go online for additional help. Error code: 30088-4."&nbsp; And all I can find on line are the
 same instructions to uninstall it.<br />
<br />
I have at least 4 hours of time invested and have gotten no where.&nbsp; I have called 4 different customer support numbers and been on 3 on-line chats which all directed me somewhere else. One of the agents I talked with assured me very politely that there was
 no warrantee or support coverage on "Professional" grade software.&nbsp; When I tried to open a service ticket on line at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/select/oas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/select/oas</a> they require&nbsp;a credit card so I can pay them $259 for a technical support call.&nbsp; The software cost $225 originally and was working FINE until last
 weekend.<br />
<br />
I am disillusioned beyond belief. This is mission&nbsp;critical software for me. Please tell me how I can talk to a human being who can walk me through a fix, without charging me more than the program cost in the first place.

</p><p>As you now know, Microsoft does not provide any free tech support.&nbsp; The problem you are experiencing sounds very serious, perhaps compounded further by messing with the Registry.&nbsp; If you are serious about using this tool, I would recommend you call the tech
 support number and give them a credit card number to pay the $259 for support.&nbsp; Otherwise, I doubt you are going to find any free support for this serious technical problem you are having with Microsoft Project, including from users in this forum.&nbsp; We are
 all volunteers in this forum, and are not tech support staff.</p>

    <title>Filter SubForm Using ComboBox on Main Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anita arnold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filter SubForm Using ComboBox on Main Form</h2>
                    <p>I have a subform called frmDashBoardSub. Its record source is a table called tblProjects.m It is a continuous form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a main form called frmDashbyProject. It has the same record source, tblProjects. This form has a single, unbound combo box named cboSelectProj. It has no control source, but does have a Row Source of:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">SELECT tblProjects.ProjectID, tblProjects.ProjectName FROM tblProjects ORDER BY tblProjects.ProjectName;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this main form is opened, I want the subform (frmDashBoardSub) to show ALL RESULTS in the tblProjects table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If (and only if) someone selects a specific project from the combo box, I want the subform to update to show ONLY the selected project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am clearly having a mentally deficient day, because I have been looking at this and a million examples all day. It just isn't making sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can help, please have patience and detail out step-by-step how to make this work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping tomorrow my brain will be better -- but.....I have a meeting about this project at 10:30, so I could really use a little help!</p>

            <p>One question: WHY do you have the mainform and the subform both bound to the same table? They'll conflict! When you try to update a record for a particular project, that record will be open for updating on both forms, and Access won't be able to resolve
 which form is the "authorized updater".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the mainform were unbound, and had only the unbound combo box, you could use the name of the Combo Box as the Master Link Field of the subform; it should then show all records if nothing has been selected in the combo, and only those for the selected
 project if something has. If this doesn't work, then you will need a little VBA code to set the Recordsource of the subform in the AfterUpdate event of the combo.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You don't need a subform at all for this.&nbsp; Simply use a bound form and put the unbound combo box in its header.&nbsp; Use the following query as the form's RecordSource property:<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM tblProjects<br />
WHERE (ProjectID = Forms!frmDashbyProject!cboSelectProj<br />
OR Forms!frmDashbyProject!cboSelectProj IS NULL)<br />
ORDER BY ProjectName;<br />
<br />
The unbound combo box should be set up as flows:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT ProjectID, ProjectName FROM tblProjects ORDER BY ProjectName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
In the combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure requery the form with:<br />
<br />
Me.Requery<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery<br />
<br />
to update its list to catered for any additions, edits, or deletions of records in the form.

<p>
</p><p>John - neither the form or subform would have been used for data entry -- the intent was more that of a "dashboard" to give a quick glance at some key fields in the underlying table.</p>

            I just read the above conversation. I am stuck on a similar issue but I have several combo boxes instead of just one.<br />
<br />
On my main form I have 4 combo boxes. User selects class ID's from these combo boxes.<br />
I have a subform that must display programs that match these selected Class ID's.<br />
I am able to link one combo box to one subform and it displays the result. But my question is how do I link all these 4 combo boxes to one subform?<br />
<br />
I am trying to do two things:<br />
1) How to link 4 combo boxes (All pulled from one table and one field - Class ID) that are on my main form to one subform?<br />
2) How do i display common programs that any of these 4 classes may have in another subform?<br />
<br />
Please guide me with details. Thank you!

            If you want exact matches on all four combo boxes then you can use the Link Master/Link Child properties of the subform control. The wizard doesn't work for unbound forms so you need to type in the control names for the Link Master and enter the field
 names from the subform record source.

            What's the logic? Do you want to use "AND LOGIC" - retrieve the record if all four combos match? or "OR LOGIC" - retrieve the record if any one of the four combos match? What are the structures and relationships of your tables? Why four - might you sometimes
 need three, or even five? More info please!

The below query displays common programs for all the classes in my database. I want to limit this. Can you help me generate common programs for only those classes that match the Class ID's selected in the combo boxes that i provided on my main form?</p>

- I'm using 4 combo boxes because I am assuming that is the maximum number of classes a student would take each quarter. But there are students who take only two/three classes<br />
<br />
This database is a student registration system which must allow to do the following:</span><br />

 in dbo_TblStudentClasses only upon hitting "confirm" button.</span><br />
<br />
 Class 255 has program "Senior Nutrition Program") - The Selected Program must be saved in dbo_TblStudentPrograms upon hitting "confirm" button.&nbsp;</span><br />

            Thank you for your response! I did try using the Link Master/Child fields. But for some reason it did not work.<br />
In Link Master Fields: Combo3;Combo5;Combo7;Combo9<br />
In Link Child Fields: ClassID1;ClassID2;Class ID3;ClassID4<br />

I may be wrong! Please assist.

<p>Sometimes such an Action Center "alert" occurs when there is a definition or scan engine update of the respective Anti-Virus program. Usually it just goes away by itself or by restarting of your AV or your computer.</p>
<p>Perhaps you need to update Vipre? Or try uninstalling/reinstalling Vipre.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, I suggest asking Vipre support: <a href="https://www.vipre.com/support/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Martina,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue that your experiencing usually occurs after installing an antivirus or program that may cause conflict with the current anti-virus software running on the computer.<br />
<br />
We would like to verify if you have installed any other antivirus on your computer aside from Windows Defender. What have you made on your computer recently?<br />
<br />
We look forward to your response.

            We can check if the issue is due to a corrupted user account. Creating a new user profile can help sort this out. You can refer to the steps provided in this

    <title>5800 - Start problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theblake---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            5800 - Start problem</h2>
                    
<p>I recently just sent my 5800 to get fixed after the display (and apparently earpiece) were not working porperly. A few days ago, after a few weeks I picked up my phone and everything was fne, they fitted a new display and earpiece, and the phone was working
 as it should have been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now though, it's not wrking again. Brilliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I start up the phone, it loads normal until I get onto my SIM Pin screen, the backlight is fully lit for a second and in that second everything works fine, but then the screen dims down slightly and pressing the screen to tap in numbers only gets an
 animation response. I can press the number, and the display shows the number being pressed down but it doesn't enter any information in the bar, so I can't enter the pin into the phone to start it up. The wierd thing is, if I'm quick enough to enter a few
 numbers in that second when the screen is lit up, the 'OK' button can be pressed, but because I don't have enough time to enter my pin number it just results in the phone not accepting the pin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, in the SIM pin start up the phone reacts to the 'OK' button being pressed (reseting the field) but any other numbered button won't do anything except show it's being pressed down. Which leads me to think it isn't a light sensor problem, as the
 phone alows me to press a particular button and get a response, but not the others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm annoyed at Nokia right now, and I should be. I just got my phone back and it's broken already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, you are not alone bro. My 5800 also keep restarting when turning on. This neber happen in v20.xx firmware. Wat I do is let it restart until it stop. By the way, when turning the phone on, the first restarting symptom will actually shut the phone down.
 You have to turn on again and the restarting issue start from there.

<p>Mine is worst than that. It never stop from restarting until you tap on the screen when the home screen appears. I hope that in the next firmware update, the problem will be fix.</p>
<p>But anyway I love this phone. =)</p>

<p><span>- resetting the IE settings to the default position</span></p>
<p><span>- clearing internet history</span></p>
<p><span>- checking compatability view</span></p>
<p><span>- logging on as an administrator</span></p>
<p><span>- managing add-ons</span></p>
<p><span>- running fix IE issues</span></p>
<p><span>- Microsoft full system scan which took about 4 hours</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All of these, and more I have tried with no success. The only thing that seems to get me in eventually is to press the refresh symbol in the address bar 3 or 4 times in quick succession as it flickers and over 50% of the time this finally gets me a
 stable log in page.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can anybody help with this strange problem?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>thank you</span></p>

</p><p>I set up a new user account on my computer and by logging in through this account I did get a stable Hotmail sign-in page.</p>

            <p>Dear Mohammed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just tried starting Hotmail using the InPrivate method that you suggested. The same flicking occurred as I always get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, before I read your note, when I logged in as normal this morning I didn't get the log in flicking and when I saw that the format of Hotmail had changed I wondered if this was the cause and the issue had been solved. But after logging out and
 later logging in again the issue persists hence I tried your InPrivate method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, still having the problem, so other suggestions welcomed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

<p><span>Thank you for your ongoing help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The log in page hadn't changed but after logging in there was a format screen telling me things would look different and they do. For instance the colours had changed ( now tones of grey
 rather than blue) and the subject matter shows me not just the title but also the first line of the contents, also the tickboxes next to the emails only appear when I hover over them. It all just looks more modern.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The top left hand side of my screen says "Outlook Email"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have added Outlook.com into compatibility view in the way that you suggested and logged out of hotmail and back in again. The same problem still occurred.</span></p>

            You can stream content to your device also by using mobiTV, Mycast or other services out there.<br />
<br />
It's still a developing service, and it requires lots of involvement. So expect to spend lots of time on their boards trying to get it working.<br />
<br />
IF you just want to watch stuff on your phone try:<br />

or try to find tv stations that stream over RTSP and set them up in your device. But it's not easy...

            DVB-h is a completely different network/system.<br />
<br />
There needs to be DVB-h antennae and base stations and a broadcaster in your area. Plus you need a device that has a DVB-h receiver (could be a phone or something else).<br />
<br />
The actual technology is based on streaming h264 encoded videos, but you need a special Receiver module and antenna to get these transmisions.<br />
<br />
It's very similar to Digital TV (cable or satellite). And it doesn't even have to be serviced by the cellular operators.

So, no operators requirement?<br />
Only the module (with the phone) and what?:)

Just select the N80 when it asks for phone type!<br />

Just tried this, it's very good but I think it may be more novelty value than an essential application. But, as you say, it is free so no complaints. Btw, you'd need a really good data package to use this without WIFI.

            You need:<br />
<br />
1 DVB-h Operator or broadcaster (That builds the infrastructure and puts programming into it). They can (just like other cable tv) bill you for the service, or for PPV events, or special channels or programs.<br />
<br />
2 DVB-h receiver device. It could be an Nseries device (N77, N92) or a stand alone DVB-h receiver.<br />
<br />
3 Some kind of linkage, either through your mobile phone, internet to buy programming and billing if needed.

Click on open, it should start installing.<br />
<br />
The other option is to make sure you have PC Suite installed and then double click on the .sis file which will start the Nokia Application Installer!

<h2>            Using a Form Field as the Email Subject Title in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p><span>We have a Word 2016 form built using Controls in Word 2016. The form also contains a submit email button with code&nbsp;that, when clicked,&nbsp;attaches the form as a document in an&nbsp;Outlook email window...&nbsp;The user would like the button to work so that when
 it creates the email it uses&nbsp;a title from the fillable form as the Subject line in the email. What code would we use for this?&nbsp;We are&nbsp;assuming it would pull from the name of the Tag within the specific Form Field
</span><span>that houses the title but&nbsp;we're not sure what the exact code would be.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In summary: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>We'd like to create a Submit by Email button, within a Word Form, that when clicked opens up a blank Outlook email draft with the completed&nbsp;form attached and the Subject line pulled from one of the Form Fields.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>Thanks Doug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like that would work if the .subject was the same every time...&nbsp;However,&nbsp;it is different depending on what title is entered into the form field. Is there code that&nbsp;will generate the .subject relative to a Form Field in the Word document?

<p>Ken's code doesn't seem to work for me. The below code is what currently works but doesn't include a subject line pulled from the form in the document. I have zero understanding of Visual Basic so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something...

    <title>Wildcard searches in Outlook task search bar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wildcard searches in Outlook task search bar</h2>
                    I have a lot of items in my Outlook&nbsp;task folder that refer to reference numbers of different kinds. Some are prefixed by letters, others are not.&nbsp;Some are&nbsp;long or short. When I try to type part of the number in the search bar with the asterisk wildcard
 in front of the digits it doesn't work at all.&nbsp; Yet, in other Microsoft apps the software has no difficulty find parts of texts or number strings within the document or file. Any ideas please ?

<p>As far as I know, there is no dedicated option to create an non-owner mailbox alert in Office 365. However, I suggest try to use activity alerts and see if it can meet your requirements. To create an activity alert, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://protection.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://protection.office.com</a>.</li><li>Sign in to Office 365 using your work or school account.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Alerts</strong>, and then click <strong>Manage</strong>
<strong>alerts</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Activity</strong> <strong>alerts</strong> page, click <strong>
Add an alert</strong>.</li><li>Complete the fields to create an alert</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to create the alert.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot for your reference:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it can be helpful.</p>

<h2>            Weird Key Press Issue</h2>
                    <p>Also posted on <a href="http://forums.techguy.org/windows-8/1075435-strange-keypress-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a computer professional and Electrical Engineer and Visual Basic Software Developer. Please try to help me with this weird problem I am encountering. When typing on my Logitech G15 Keyboard, the characters are typed correctly in the Windows Notepad.exe
 program in both Windows 7 and Windows 8. With Windows 7 this problem was intermittent but is not currently exhibiting this bizarre behavior. The problem seems consistent on Windows 8. This problem only occurs with the number buttons 1 through 0. When pressing
 the numbered buttons, not on the keypad but on the main qwerty part of the keyboard, on web forms only, Chrome, Fire Fox&nbsp;and IE10, the web form gets the character that was the last non-number key I pressed on the keyboard. For example, if I press the 'a' key
 on the keyboard then the '2' key what I see on the web form is 'aa'. If I then press the 'c' key and followed by the '7' key on a web form text field, such as MY PASSWORDS and LOGIN ID's, can you tell I am angry?, I see 'cc' on the web form. Did that make
 sense to you? It's almost like a cruel joke. Thinking that, I performed a Antivirus Scan using Norton and the free online web scan from Trend Micro. Norton found 34 tracking cookies and nothing more. Trend Micro found nothing. This problem occurred before
 I changed keyboards and spent a 'dollar sign'' 100 dollars on a new Razer Black widow keyboard. The problem followed the keyboard. The new keyboard did not fix the problem. Note, I cannot type a 'dollar sign' key due to this problem. The only reason you see
 numbers in this message is that the keyPAD is not afflicted with this malady. This problem both preceded and followed the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8 on a new previously unused 286 GB SSD Drive. I can dual boot now into either operating system. The
 Windows 500 GB standard rotating hard drive contains Windows 7. The problem is not the keyboards, the USB port or&nbsp;the mother board. I have no idea what to do except start replacing things until the problem goes away. Oh yes one more clue as I wanted to put
 my email address on the bottom here, and later deleted it. I can ctrl-c copy text in Notepad and ctrl-v paste text from notepad into a web browser text field perfectly fine. That is how the @ appeared here. How strange heh no apostrophe that's a shift 1 which
 does not work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what I can try to fix this problem or what is causing it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help if you can,</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            When will microsoft release the Microsoft Band 3&#63;</h2>
                    I had the Band 2 for a brief stint, but I did not like the design and I felt the app selection and synchronization with my phone to be fairly limited. Anyone have a conjecture on when the Band 3 will be released? I'm hoping for improved design and functionality.

            It seems the Band is doomed. There were rumors it was to be introduced in the October 26, 2016 announcement with the Surface line, but now quotes are there are no plans to introduce an updated band in 2016. Also, with all the bands being pulled out of
 the Microsoft stores and no longer on the online store and no accessories to be able to be ordered, I believe it will die along with other great products Microsoft left us hanging with like their HomeServer line, or the Timex DataLink. I also see the phone
 line dying as well. They are now saying they are going to go after the enterprise customers so us retail consumers are going to suffer.

            Yes I did forget Zune. It's sad because MS had the advantage in so many areas and for some reason just gave up. MS had the first stable phone OS that ran and merged&nbsp;the useful Word, Excel, Outlook and my contacts&nbsp;and the market was in the palm of their
 hands and had a great interface with a pen! I used my Palm Treo 728, my HTC Pro and Pro 2 and even the the Verizon VX6900. The pen with transcriber was so easy to complete an abundance of work&nbsp;right on the spot! I trusted in MS and have defended them until
 I heard about the phone line being on the verge of dying. My proof came when the big companies didn't pick up on the Windows 10 line. Especially HTC. I am still using HomeServer as there is no other product like it that not only allows to handle backups&nbsp;it
 provides remote access and hosts your own web site! My Zune died but I quickly adapted to my phone as a great music player.&nbsp;I have access to my entire collection thru the HomeServer and my large internal trans flash m

<p>For years I warned friends about the security vulnerabilities in Android phones. (I'm an IT professional.) You'd have thought that MS would've touted the Windows Mobile OS and app&nbsp;security. Now that serious Android security flaws have been in the news, perhaps
 they will. But don't bet on it.</p>

            <p>For me the Band and Microsoft are doomed. I had worn my Band for 13 months to monitor progress following a hip replacement. The wrist strap has now split which is not good enough for a £200 device. I have in the past been a keen Microsoft supporter with
 phone, Surface 3 and other products&nbsp;but no more. Microsoft have been not been interested in my problem saying no support, no repair or service for this equipment any more.</p>

    <title>N70 Power button problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tompreston---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N70 Power button problem</h2>
                    Hey all, I was hoping someone might be able to help me with a problem I'm having - though TBH, I suspect that I'll probably need to send the phone back. Yesterday, out of the blue (though it may have occurred after actually pressing it myself - can't be
 sure), my phone started flipping through the options that appear when you press the power button. It seemed as though the button was being pressed rapidly and continually. I was able to cancel out of it using the red button, or by tapping the power button
 itself a few times. However, it started doing it more often, and even started restting itself. It would also reset itself when booting back up. This has been happening during calls as well, which, as you can imagine, is very annoying. It was doing this - resetting
 and/or going through the quick-option menu - most of today but was at least turning back on, either by itself or if I played with the power button. Now, it's managed to turn itself off and I can't get it back on at all, no matter what I do with the button.
 It's fully charged and I've even taken the cover off completely and tried the button that way, just to make sure that it wasn't a connection problem between the button and the switch - still no cigar. I've got it charging now, and it's displaying the charge
 icon in the corner, so I know it's doing something. What I'm thinking is that a problem has developed with the entire circuiting section of the power button. So, if anyone's still with me, my questions are: a.) Has this happened to anyone else? b.) If so,
 did you fix it yourself? How? c.) Since the button is totally screwed, is there another way of turning the phone on? d.) Why does **bleep** like this happen _the day before_ you really need your phone? Any help or insight would be highly appreciated. I guess
 it needs sending back, but some sort of temporary fix would be heaven-sent. Cheers.

I wouldn't recommend removing the covers and trying to deal with this yourself - locate your nearest

            Hi<br />
<br />
As richcowell said, you may want to get it looked at by a Authorised Nokia Engineer, that way you don't void any warranty you have.<br />
<br />
PS: tompreston, I had to edit you post, I can understand your frustration but please be careful with you language.

I sent my N70 in for repair with a case I bought of ebay!<br />
<br />
I mean there are no sensitive electronics exposed when changing the case (well maybe a little). And you simply steer clear of those.<br />
<br />
But be very careful when removing the covers. If you want I can tell you how to remove the cover. PM me.

            I'm a little surprised you're blatantly suggesting he removes the covers, after it's been stated on various boards that it can invalidate the warranty - whether it's easy or not is not the point - if he damages the phone in any way, even if it's just a
 scratch or fingerprint the shows the phone has been opened previously - if it needs to go for repair in the future - he's not gonna be too happy if they refuse because of that...<br />
<br />
You should have PM'd him that reply really... then I wouldn't go off on one like this! lol... going quiet now :p

            Hi rash<br />
<br />
We strongly advise against removing the covers on your N70, doing so can void your Nokia warranty.

            <p>Hi Enrique,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, you are not able to activate the Office 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have already mentioned that there are issues with the time, update or correct the time of the machine with respect to your time zone and then try activating the Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Desktop mode &gt; Click the clock, and choose Change Date &amp; time settings &gt; Date and Time &gt; Internet Time &gt; click Change Settings &gt; and finally click UPDATE TIME</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should help you resolve this issue. Let us know the results to help you better.</p>

<p>I had the same problem, The settings of my clock where wrong. But even I checked several times the settings and eerything was just normal.
</p>
<p>Due to this forum I discovered I had to chose 'update time' (ducht: nu bijwerken)&nbsp;in the clock settings. Simple, but it works (after trying twice. The first time I got an error! Don't be scared of that, just try again)</p>
<p>Now several problems, (office, login-sites) are solved, thanks!</p>
