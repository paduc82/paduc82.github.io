            <p>OneNote&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't have "smarts" that Excel does for tables. So there's no way to auto-fill cells with a certain type of information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OneNote tables are great for quickly giving your information some structure. But since Excel is designed as a tool for managing structured data, it has many more features for organizing tables.</p>

    <title>JBL PowerUp Wireless Charging Speaker for Nokia MD-100W Questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmdeq  say:</h3>
<h2>            JBL PowerUp Wireless Charging Speaker for Nokia MD-100W Questions</h2>
                    
<p>In posting this message, I am hoping to reach other owners of the JBL PowerUp Wireless Charging Speaker for Nokia, which has model name MD-100W. I have two questions that I would like your answers to in the hope of determining whether the issues I am experiencing
 with the speaker are limited to my speaker, or limited to my phone, or whether they would occur with any speaker or any phone. These tests presume that you have already followed the instructions in the manual such that you have already bound a mobile device
 to the speaker through Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The first test I would ask you to perform is to power on the speaker using the spring loaded button on the rear of the speaker.</p>
<p>a. Does the speaker make any sounds, in particular a sequence of 1-3 tones?</p>
<p>b. Now, press the button again to turn off the speaker. Does the speaker make any sounds, in particular a sequence of 1-3 tones?</p>
<p>c. Now, ensure that bluetooth in your mobile device is disabled. Press the spring loaded button again to turn on the speaker.&nbsp;Activate Bluetooth in your mobile device. When the mobile device connects, does the speaker make any sounds, in particular a sequence
 of 1-3 tones?</p>
<p>d. Disable bluetooth in your mobile device, leave the speaker powered on and do nothing with the speaker for approximately 30 minutes. When the speaker enters standby mode after 30 minutes of non-use, does the speaker make any sounds in particular a sequence
 of 1-3 tones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The second test requires that you connect an audio source to the rear of the speaker using a 3.5mm male audio connector. I believe the audio source can be any audio source that is consistently providing a signal. Before performing this test, ensure that
 your mobile device is prepared for a system crash should one occur.</p>
<p>a. With bluetooth in your mobile device disabled, and the speaker powered on, start the Line-In audio source. Does the speaker play the audio source on Line-In?</p>
<p>b. Enable bluetooth on your mobile device, and ensure your mobile device is playing audio. Does the speaker play the audio source on Line-In, the audio on your mobile device, or do something else? Please describe what occurs.</p>
<p>c. Leave bluetooth on your mobile device enabled for one minute. Does your mobile device crash?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reported these issues to Nokia Support, and they would like to replace my speaker. I do not believe replacing my speaker would resolve these issues. They have asked me to reproduce the problems on other MD-100W speakers and because I only own own,
 and don't know if I have any friends or relatives who own them, I am asking the community for help. Although Nokia may possess more speakers and mobile devices than I do, I have no information that they have made any attempt to reproduce these problems.</p>

<p>Issue #1 is reproduced for all to see. I don't know if I can post a link in this forum (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/95352319@N05/8696264063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/95352319@N05/8696264063</a>) but if I can't, you'll need to
 go see your friend Flickr and search for my user name, or perhaps tags like JBL, Nokia, and PowerUp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issue #2 is difficult to reproduce. While attempting to reproduce the phone crash, I was able to crash Bluetooth and experience "picket fencing" between the Line-In and Bluetooth sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if the picket fencing occurs just wrong, the&nbsp;Bluetooth device
 itself will crash.&nbsp;I have posted, in the same place as Issue #1, a video of the&nbsp;picket fencing&nbsp;(but neither the phone nor the Bluetooth crash in this video).
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/95352319@N05/8697460314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/95352319@N05/8697460314</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arguably, the conditions for crashing the phone in #2&nbsp;might not&nbsp;happen very frequently because it depends what the audio source is and what the particular music is. The MD-100W does not have a selector for which music to amplify. So, if you have signal on
 Line In and over Bluetooth, the unit attempts to decide which one to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case, my audio source was a Sonos CONNECT:AMP (without fixed volume) and the particular music was the Rhapsody Jazz Romance channel. Over Bluetooth on the Lumia 822 was "Pearl Jam Recommends"; basically 80's alternative rock. I had the Sonos configured
 without fixed volume because before the MD-100W, it was hooked up to an iHome&nbsp;speaker that had a button selector for input and it was convenient to be able to reduce the volume or mute the sound through either the Sonos controller or the iHome speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the Jazz Romance channel would often play songs with some very quiet passages, the MD-100W would determine that there was no sound coming in the LineIn, and would switch over to the 80's pop. Then, the MD-100W would detect a louder passage on Line-In
 and switch back to Line-In. Every time it got softer, it would switch back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hope is that Nokia will address both of these issues with a firmware update.</p>

<p>At some point, Nokia moderators removed the thread at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This contained my pre-purchase question about how the PowerUp speaker selects between LineIn and Bluetooth sources. However, the thread also discussed the various notification tones from the PowerUp that discourage its use in a quiet environment like
 a bedroom. As I discussed in that thread,&nbsp;I was able to configure my audio source for a sleep setting which played music for 30 minutes. Then,&nbsp;an additional 30 minutes after my music ended, the PowerUp woke me up when it loudly announced with a notification
 beep that it was going to sleep.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are the things that generate notification tones:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Powering the MD-100W on with the rear switch</span></p>
<p><span>2. Connecting the MD-100W to a Bluetooth device</span></p>
<p><span>3. Powering the MD-100W off with the rear switch</span></p>
<p><span>4. Powering the MD-100W off after 30 minutes of non-use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Fortunately, putting a phone on the charging base turns the lights on the charging base, but does not cause a notification tone.</span></p>

<p>I just bought the JBL expressly to charge my phone while I sleep and listen to music in my bedroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I &nbsp;was rudely awoken last night by the tone as it powered down after 30 minutes. This post is the only mention I have been able to find reaging this "feature." This seems like a terrible flaw in the design of the product. Has there been a software update
 to remedy this? Or has it been address in any way by Nokia or JBL?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I agree completely. I believe Rule #1 of speakers is that they should reproduce the signal given and otherwise make no other sound.</p>

<p>I have discovered two other "odd sounds" caused by the JBL PowerUp Wireless Charging Speaker for Nokia MD-100W. Both of these occur with Bluetooth disabled on my Nokia Lumia 822.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sometimes, when I place my phone on the speaker to charge overnight, the speaker turns itself on! Normally, I wouldn't care but the speaker makes those three loud tones when it turns on, which wakes my partner up if I'm the second one to bed. Because
 it doesn't always do this, I've tried to narrow down what makes it occur. As near as I can tell, if I am watching videos, stop watching videos, and place my phone on the speaker before the lock screen activates after a minute of non-use, I get the sounds.
 I reliably don't get the sounds if I shutdown the phone and place it on the speaker (although placing the phone on the speaker will turn the phone back on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Under "Ringtones and Sounds" I have the Nokia Lumia 822 configured to vibrate and play sounds for Reminders, Key Press, Lock and Unlock, Camera Shutter. "All other notifications" is unchecked. When my phone is on the speaker, the phone buzzes an average
 of three times in six hours at unpredictable times. I recently went on vacation and plugged my phone into the wall charger instead of using the JBL PowerUp Wireless Charging Speaker for Nokia MD-100W, and the phone did not buzz overnight. Although the phone
 is making the annoying sound in this case, I've only noticed it happening when the phone is charging with the speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have Nokia engineers posted any firmware updates for this speaker? I'm eager to have all these problems fixed.</p>

            I've just bought this speaker and it awoke me after I took a nap. I am a software engineer by myself and I just thought how dumb can one be to allow this kind of sound notification upon going into standby mode. What is worse after I downloaded update tool
 it appeared no new firmware for this has been released. Shame on you Nokia and JBL.

<p>I found the answer to #2 (the buzzing during the night) and it was independent of the JBL PowerUp Wireless Charging Speaker. I used to use a "Sleep Recording" app, and I tended not to use the app when I was travelling and using a plug in charger. Some notification
 about the battery or the drain rate was creating the buzzing. I stopped using the app, and problem #2 went away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem #1 still exists, and still bites me sometimes. Usually by the end of the day, I'm running in battery saver mode and I think I only have the foreground app running, or sometimes I hold down the back arrow key and manually shut down my apps. But, when
 neither of these things occur and (perhaps?) I have Bluetooth enabled on the phone, I still have problem #1.</p>

<p>Is Microsoft discontinuing this product? If so, can they arrange to have the firmware source put in a public repo so that some of the issues can be fixed?</p>

                    When my computer is downing the build 10049 all night and when I woke up it still at 100 percent and for a long while. So I shut down my computer and trying to see if that works. Suddenly the Restoring your previous version of Windows show up and still
 there for a hour and nothing change from there. I do I manually fix this problem while it's in this state and how do I go back to build 10041?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the sent and deleted emails are missing on Outlook 2013, it can be due to the email settings of your account. We'd like to ask a few questions for us to better assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages when sending an email?</li><li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Are you using IMAP or POP for your mail server? To check it, go to your <strong>
Account Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Type</strong>. </li><li>Which domain are you using?</li><li>Were there any changes made prior to the issue? </li><li>Are you using multiple email address in Outlook 2013?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response. </p>

<p>Thanks for the follow up. We suggest that you check the third-party web mail to verify if you can see there the deleted and sent emails. If the folders are there, then try to remove your account and re-add it to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, we suggest that you repair Outlook 2013 using this

<h3> craigbr1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel VBA - Distinguishing between Run time &#34;1004&#34; errors</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a macro that includes&nbsp;opening&nbsp;files&nbsp;and&nbsp;naming worksheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some times the macro can not find the file&nbsp;and sometimes the macro&nbsp;tries to name a sheet with a name&nbsp;that's already assigned to another sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In both cases, I get error 1004</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I put in an error handler or some code that&nbsp;if&nbsp;an error occurs where the macro cannot&nbsp;find the file to open,&nbsp;it&nbsp;brings up a message box to tell the user&nbsp;what happened and then resets the actions the macro did back to its original state&nbsp;and how can
 I put in an error handler that if an error occurs where the macro is trying to&nbsp;name a sheet with the same name as another sheet,&nbsp;it brings up a different message box to&nbsp;tell the&nbsp;user what happened and then resets the actions the macro did back to its original
 state?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g.,</p>
<p>IF err=1004 (where Excel cannot access the file..the filename or path does not exist) then</p>
<p>MSGBOX ("the macro could not find the file in the "X" drive.&nbsp; Make sure the file is there...the macro will now stop and reset the spreadsheet back to its&nbsp;original point to let you check on why the file is not there...once&nbsp;the file is put there, please rerun
 the macro"</p>
<p>STATEMENTS to reset the spreadsheet back to its original state (undo what it did so the user can easily run it again after the user makes sure the file exists)</p>
<p>END IF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF err=1004 (Excel cannot name a sheet with the same name as another sheet) then</p>
<p>MSGBOX ("there already is a sheet with the name "xxx" so you can not rename it with the same name." The macro will&nbsp;now stop and reset the spreadhsheet back to its&nbsp;original point so you can change (or remove)&nbsp;the&nbsp;sheet to something else and then once thats
 done, please rerun the macro"</p>
<p>STATEMENTS &nbsp;to reset the spreadsheet back to its original state(undo what it did so the user can easily run the macro again after the user makes sure the sheet will not have the same name)</p>
<p>END IF</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>but if there is no error in finding the file or naming sheets, the macro will skip the error handler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am looking for assistance in getting the Excel&nbsp;macro to distinguish between&nbsp;these 2 types of "1004" errors so&nbsp;I can program it to do&nbsp;different things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any assistance!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Craig</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 crashes when inserting charts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurencart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 crashes when inserting charts</h2>
                    <p>I am a teacher and this is happening in a lab of 25 computers. I am teaching Excel 2013 and every time my students try to insert or edit a clustered column chart, it crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a few solutions, uninstalled and reinstalled Office, disabled Add-ins, repaired office, and installed all Windows updates. None of these worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our tech department did find a solution online to set the default printer to the XPS or OneNote printer. It seems to work but there is no rhyme or reason as to which one will work for each computer. Three computers in a row will work with the XPS
 as the default and on the very next computer only the OneNote printer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than setting these as the default, is there another solution? The way our servers are setup and the software we use at school to protect the computers doesn't allow for the default printer to be set and stay with each user. Each time a new
 student logins in, we have to set the default printer for it to work.</p>

            Forms do NOT hold data. Tables hold data. So what you are doing is previewing a report filtered for the record currently being displayed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You can use the Output To command to send the report to a PDF. You would then need to use Office Automation to send the e-mail with the PDF as an attachment.</div>

            Hi, I'm new to access. The code runs the report that filters out what is displaying on the form. How do I then get that report for specific record to, rather than opening up in preview, attach itself to an outlook email to be sent? I don't know much about
 vba, what would need to be added to the script above to make this work? Thanks

            Again, you have to do this in two pieces. You have to first output the report to PDF, then use Office Automation to generate an e-mail and add the PDF to the e-mail as an attachment. The site I linked to has another link to show you the Office Automation
 code.&nbsp;

            You use the Output TO command to save the report as a PDF. It has to be saved to be able to attach it. If you just want to include the information in the body of the e-mail that involves some even more complex coding. The Output To command will specify
 where the file will be stored and what name to use.&nbsp;

<p>Private Sub Command25_Click()</p>
<p>Me.Dirty = False</p>
<p>'This opens up the report based on the current view in the form<br />
DoCmd.OpenReport "nonconformity", acViewPreview, , "[nonconformid] =" &amp; Me.NonConformID</p>
<p>'This takes that open report and then attaches it to an email<br />
DoCmd.SendObject acSendReport, , acFormatPDF, Forms![non conformity]![Contact]</p>
<p>'Closes the open report after the email is sent.<br />
DoCmd.Close acReport, "NonConformity", acSaveNo</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Works well, so am moving onto complicating this a bit more. This will help others who are interested on how to get 'details' off a current form into pdf format (via Report) attached to an email.

<div>Are you working in a Project Server environment? If so, you will probably get a better response if you post to the server forum at,&nbsp;http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/projectserver2010general.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are not working with Project Server I'd guess your Project Global is corrupt, particularly since you say you didn't create any custom view tables. If using Project 2010, you will find the working Global file at, C:/users/[your computer name]/app
<div><br />
<div>If re-building the Global doesn't help, your Project file itself may be corrupt. Go to the MVP website at,&nbsp;http://www.mvps.org/project/faqs.htm, and try one or more of the methods described in FAQ 43 - Handling project file corruption and/or bloat.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            Hi John, <br />
<br />
<div>I'm not using it in a server environment. Deleting the global file has not fixed the issue, is there a way to make sure all custom view tables are deleted, if you think this is the case?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've tried the methods in FAQ 43 as you suggested, other than method 4. I have a decent amount of work into the formatting here that I would like to retain.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All the best,<br />

            Ludwig,
<div>What type of custom formatting?</div>
<div><br />
<div>A little background. In Project a view is made up of a screen, view table, group and filter. If you have done custom text formatting, it is embedded in the view table. So if you delete all custom views, then you will delete that formatting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried to emulate your issue by creating a custom view with a table that has only two fields, ID and name. If the ID column is locked and I delete the only other column (i.e. name), Project automatically unlocks the first column (i.e. ID). So I cannot
 force the issue to give me the error message you see. Perhaps there is some other unique combination of editing that causes the error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try this. Go to File/Organizer and click on the Tables tab. On the right had side you will see all the custom view tables associated with the file. Make a note of them. Now go to View/Data group/Tables icon/More tables. Find each of your custom tables
 and look at the makeup. Are there any view tables that have only one field or only two fields. If you have no tables like that, then I still have to focus on file corruption. Depending on your custom formatting there may be ways to retain you formatting and
 still use method 4 of the FAQ.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Excel docs anymore with my excel 2016 software, tells me I need a new app for that...</h2>
                    <p>Why can't I open my excel documents on my computer? It tells me I need a new app and directs me to the app store. This wasn't a problem before.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions on this website to open xls docs I need to set my default program as excel but it doesn't give me that option, only default app which doesn't work.</p>
<p>Is this because of an update?</p>
<p>Very frustrating that I can't work on my documents as I do normally, all of a sudden.</p>
<p>I've got to get some work done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me please.</p>

<h2>            Editing with Microsoft word for iPad pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m using iPad pro and downloaded microsoft word but I found that I couldn’t make or edit any document until I subscruibe with office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that my friend using iPad air which is sure older than mine but he can create and edit document without office 365 subscription, and without even having an account or microsoft ID!! And when I opened the app on his device I did not find
 the word (activate under Key icon)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I asked him he answered me that one day he read and offer announced by microsoft and he downloaded Microsoft package and got all apps with full features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>he also can create and edit documents by excel powerpoint etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my question is how would that be possible? To create and edit without subscription&nbsp;</p>
<p>With office 365 and even without having ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I get his version? Maybe by using his apple account or is there any other way to share his activated version on my ipad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank you very much in advance</p>

<p>Hi Muntadher,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only time that you’ll be having an issue when editing or making any documents with Word for iPad is when you have an expired connected Office 365 account with your Word app. May we asked if you have connected account with your Microsoft Word app?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, for us to have a better clarity of your concern, can tell us what exactly happens when you try to make or edit a Word documents? Can you send us a screenshot to have a better picture of it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get back to us with the require information for us to further assist you.</p>

    <title>Android OneNote Quick Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikem1820  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android OneNote Quick Notes</h2>
                    It appears that an update to the OneNote app has created a new Notebook on my phone titled "My Notebook". &nbsp;All of my quick notes that I take on my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone are now stored to this notebook instead of my previous "Personal" notebook. &nbsp;The
 problem is, "My Notebook" is not syncing to my computer and is not showing up as a document anywhere on my OneDrive. &nbsp;I now have to manually copy all of my quicknotes from the "My Notebook" to my other "Personal" book in order to retrieve and sort them on
 my PC. &nbsp;Is there a way to change the settings so that all new quick notes go to my other notebook or a way to sync the "My Notebook" on my phone to my PC?

<p>Hi Vidia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my tests, there is no setting to change the path of the Email Messages folder in SharePoint. Even if we move this folder to a subfolder, there will still be a new Email messages folder created if the mail is sent to the channel again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I totally understand your concern to have this feature included. I suggest you submit your ideas via the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public</a></p>

<h2>            Installation of Office 2016 Home&#47;Business WITHOUT Microsoft Account</h2>
                    
<p>Repeat - Install Office 2016 Home and Business Retail 2016 without live account</p>
<div>
Note: I was told by a MS forum admin that this might be the better place to get this question answered as the computers are on a domain.</div>
<p>The above question&nbsp;from a IT guy HAD a answer of "it is not possible to install Office 2016 retail without a MS account".&nbsp; Hopefully this is NOT true.</p>

<p>Here is my situation:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I'm a IT guy that has 6 new computers and 6 MS Office Home / Business 2016 (retail boxed version with key card)
</li><li>I do not want to create bogus MS emails just to get these computers loaded with MS Office 2016 Home/Business;
<ul>
<li>it will not be used; </li><li>company email&nbsp;is used </li></ul>
</li><li>A computer may not have a single user, therefore will not have a single email; some of the emails are generic
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</li><li>the company does use portal.office.com for Office 365 email
<ul>
<li>Word, Excel, Outlook are all on the desktop </li></ul>

</li></ul>
</div>
<p>Do I need to</p>
<ul>
<li>create a generic email account for each&nbsp;computer (example 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)&nbsp; </li><li>two of these computers don't need email at all but need a full version of Office 2016
</li></ul>
<p>What is the plan for a IT group that buys computers and Office to install in offices to setup the email generically?&nbsp;&nbsp; If a user has there own computer, then they probably have company email.</p>
<p>Note I am the admin for their hosted MS Excchange and I tried to use my admin email but that was not recognized.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Darryl</p>

<p>Hi Darryl,</p>
<p>As that IT guy said, it is not feasible to install Office 2016 retail without a Microsoft account. From your description, you have 6 Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 with the key card. To install Office 2016, after entering the 25-digit product key<a href="https://setup.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 here</a>, you need to sign in with a Microsoft account to select the item you want to install.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Before installing Office, you need to redeem your product key and associate it with a Microsoft account, which can unlock some free services, including Office. Although you create a Microsoft account, you can use your company email
 for communication.</p>
<p>In addition, as our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, we suggest you post a new thread in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=threads&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;tm=1459787277962&amp;auth=1">

    <title>Transforming XML in Access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasper7333  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transforming XML in Access 2010</h2>
                    I have a simple table in Access where I store the following parameters;<br />
Client;<br />
System<br />
ReportType<br />
ClientContact<br />
ClientRole<br />
<br />
I also have other fields but have been using just system and reporttype for the purpose of my test. I took a blank Word 2010 document and inserted some text and also some DocVariables to reference the info above for system and reporttype. I saved it as *.xml
 (not the 2003 version) and then on my form in access I have the following code behind a button<br />
<br />
Private Sub ExportBtn_Click()<br />
ExportXML acExportTable, "ReportInfo", CurrentProject.Path + "\jm.xml"<br />
TransformXML CurrentProject.Path + "\jm.xml", CurrentProject.Path + "\transform01.xslt", CurrentProject.Path + "\Report.xml", False, acEnableScript<br />
<br />
The jm.xml file gets created properly not a problem along with the report.xml, however the report xml file contains the values of jm.xml all on one line.<br />
<br />
My transform01.xlst contains the following info at the top <br />
<br />
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;xsl:output method="xml" version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" indent="yes" standalone="yes"/&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;xsl:processing-instruction <br />
name="mso-application"&gt;progid="Word.Document"&lt;/xsl:processing-instruction&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="/dataroot"/&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;!-- Match the tags in the xml output --&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;xsl:variable name="Client" select="ReportInfo/Client"/&gt;<br />
&lt;xsl:variable name="System" select="ReportInfo/System"/&gt;<br />
&lt;xsl:variable name="Title" select="ReportInfo/ReportType"/&gt;<br />
<br />
I have checked these and they are all closed off correctly. Am i doing something wrong here ?
<br />
<br />
This is all a big learning curve to be honest.<br />
<br />
Can put up other details just didnt want to stretch this message out too long.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>Are you committed to generating your Word document by generating XML via a transform (e.g., perhaps you are doing it on a server) or could you actually use other approaches, e.g.</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. generate the document using a .NET language and the Open XML SDK?</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. Automate Word to do it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because doing either of (a) or (b) is likely to be significantly simpler than doing it via a transform. In the case of (b) you would</div>
<div>&nbsp;- open Word</div>
<div>&nbsp;- open your saved "skeleton" document in Word</div>
<div>&nbsp;- set some values (e.g. ActiveDocument.Variables("Client").Value = ' some value that you get from Access, or from your exported XML</div>
<div>&nbsp;- update your DOCVARIABLE fields</div>
<div>&nbsp;- save and close</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you really need the transform approach...</div>
<div><br />
<div>To transform xml into a Word document your transform needs all the WordProcessingML code that the document would contain, /plus/ all the XSL code necessary to insert your field values into that code at the correct points.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't think you have posted all your transform code, but if it does have that, it can't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You mention that you want Word 2010 (for example), and although the process is similar, it's actually more complicated than generating a Word 2003 XML format document because you have to generate "Flat OPC" format, with all its parts and references. It
 can also become complicated if for example you need to generate a Word document with a variable number of parts (e.g., multiple sections with multiple headers/footers).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since Word 2010 can (usually) open Word 2003 XML documents, it can be easier to generate that instead. I'd say it's probably easier to start using the Word 2003 format because there are toolkits to help you do that (though whether they all still work with
 Word 2010 I cannot tell you).</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Word 2003 XML SDK</div>
<div>http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=21923</div>
<div><br />
<div>I cannot remember whether this contains the "Inference Tool" that helps you create an XSLT from a Word 2003 XML file - if not, it is here:</div>
<div>http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=3412</div>
<div><br />
<div>but again, I don't know whether you will be able to get that to run with more recent versions of Windows than XP.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I couldn't find a starting point example on the web.</div>

<p>Hi <strong>DamaNation</strong>,</p>
<p>1. How is the internet shared on all the computer (is it wired or wireless)?<br />
2. Who is the make and model of the router?<br />
3. Any recent changes made to the router?</p>
<p>See if port 80 is blocked on the router if yes contact the manufacturer and unblock the port.</p>

<h2>            Syntax Error &#40;Comma&#41; in Query Expression</h2>
                    <p>Trying to parse the first two sections of a five section string.&nbsp; Now getting a SYNTAX ERROR (COMMA).&nbsp; I've looked at it too long.&nbsp; Can someone please take a look and give me a hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Left((([ArborID],InStr([ArborID],"-")+1,(InStr(InStr([ArborID],"-")+1,[ArborID],"-")-InStr([ArborID],"-"))-1)),10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Please describe in words along with a few examples of what this expression is supposed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is, it doesn't make sense, but I'm guessing you want part of the ArborID between, before or after some number of dashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's a reasonably close guess, then it's a poor table design issue in that there is more than one value in the ArborID field.&nbsp; Instead you should have two or three fields, each with the individual parts of the ArvorID.&nbsp; Then you wouldn't need to parse
 the field and it would be a trivial expression to put the parts together on forms/reports whenever people need to see it.</p>

            <p>I am using this string in an expression in a query to separate "XXX??-XX?-ZZZ-ZZZ?".&nbsp; the desire is to pull everything left of the second "-".&nbsp; The second section of the string can be 2 or 3 digits and the first is 3 to 5 alpha characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BAM!</p>
<p>Your comment has made me see my errant ways.&nbsp; My table design isn't be, this is actually a concatenated field.&nbsp; Not sure why I'm trying to pull this data apart when I already have it in separated fields.&nbsp; Sometimes we just get off on the wrong track and
 don't see the train coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp; I'm going to clear my head and think logically again.</p>

            <p>Yes it is!</p>
<p>I don't do this all the time.&nbsp; I'm an engineer that happens to mess with IT some.&nbsp; Therefore, you know how companies work, "Oh, yeah, he can do that for us!"&nbsp; Then, it's been months since you did anything but input data and all of a sudden you go brain dead.</p>
<p>Thanks much for your help and have a Blessed Day!</p>
