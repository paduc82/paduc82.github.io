<h2>            Users cannot access outlook.office.com</h2>
                    Our company just migrated everyone to Office 365. Some users are unable to access outlook.office.com. They get an error message saying "oops something went wrong" with a gigantic unhappy smiley on the web address before even getting prompted to select
 an account but they are able to access their email on the Desktop Outlook application.

<p>Hello Jay,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the affected users can access the mailboxes via Outlook desktop client, it means that the Autodiscover should be right. Based on my experience and the error message, this kind of issues could be caused by the cache or it may be a temporary issue. I
 suggest you try the following suggestions to see if it works:</p>
<p>1. Clear the cache completely and sign in again.</p>
<p>2. Try other browsers to see if there is any difference. </p>
<p>3. Please let the affected users sign in Outlook Web App(OWA) via a different network connection to see if there is any difference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please capture a screenshot of the full error message for further check. And let me know if the issue happened just after the migration.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            In fact Jeanniegirl1958, Linley's suggestion is a significantly faster way for you to transfer video.&nbsp; I use file explorer to transfer ALL video and stills.

<h2>            windows activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iam doing virtual machines under UNRAID and have setup a machine, unsure what version it is, this does not matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spare machine keys when logging in as in physical keys I can select, however these will not activate on the UNRAID os/VM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wondered how it would/should work with (is it?)20h1 or the latest version available on the uup dump server, and getting windows to activate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 1903 running as the pc where I would connect via VNC-WebBrowser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested in the proper way of testing on VM's Your views and thoughts welcome.</p>

<p>I have several virtual machines running under VMware. Most have been upgraded when win10 was offering the free upgrade from win7 and win8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each individual virtual machine is considered its own computer and each one requiring its own licence. You can do total clean installs in the same vm and it will activate if previously activated. If you create a new vm, here again, it will require a new
 key, it will not activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You state you have spare keys, are they Retail keys or OEM keys. If Retail, you should be able to transfer them over to a vm. If OEM keys, they are only good on the original machine or computer and are not transferable. These keys would have to be win10
 keys as the free upgrade expired years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clears things up for you.</p>

<p>You can try, but the free upgrade is done. Have heard some still got it to work so it is worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have to remember, a new vm is just like a new computer. Needs its own key. Not familiar with unraid, but I have to use my original activated vm's. I can clean install in them, then I back up those vm's so I always have an activated vm to fall back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those keys will not be of any use as they would be tied into the original hardware that they were licensed on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint: If you install in a new vm, do it offline, this will allow you to personalize the vm to your liking, eg, dark theme, etc. Once the vm is set to your liking, then put it online. You will only lose the option to personalize from this point (not activated),
 win10 will keep your original customization and work just fine for any testing.</p>

<p>If you began with a VM and activated Windows 7 or 8, that VM could have been upgraded to activated Windows 10. However, the Windows 10 would no longer have any unique Product Key. It would instead use a generic Product Key and would be activated with a digital
 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done the above, then that VM could be maintained as a perpetually activated VM,
<em>as long as you never delete its files</em>.&nbsp; If you delete the VM files (other than the virtual hard disk file) you have deleted the device image that is recognized by the activation servers.&nbsp; Creating a new VM, even on the same host PC, will not result
 in an activated Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some VMs that were activated back in early 2015 with Windows 10 when it could be activated by an Insider Product Key. I have kept a copy of the small VM files (except the hard disk file) since then. I can still install Windows 10 Pro and it will auto-activate
 Windows 10 Pro once online.&nbsp; I have never tried using the VM files on another PC, but I doubt that they would activate on another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get Windows 7 or 8 to activate on the VM using the keys, by transferring the Windows 7 or 8 license to the VM, I would say it
<em>might</em> be possible to then upgrade to Windows 10 and activate, but I don't know if it would work. Sometimes Microsoft Support staff will help with specific Activation scenarios, since the License Terms do say that
<em>standalone</em> licenses and upgraded licenses can be transferred to another device. As has been said already, this is not possible with OEM Windows licenses.</p>

<p>I almost exclusively use Hyper-V.&nbsp; I have tried VMWare and VirtualBox a few times, but mostly to test problems that others reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think at the moment VMWare seems to have faster performance than Hyper-V, but Hyper-V has more features (like Checkpoints) than the free version of VMWare Workstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I have had trouble with VM activation.&nbsp; There is also a way to save activation to a small XML file. On an activated device, you run a copy of gatherosstate.exe, from the Windows 10 install media. It creates GenuineTicket.xml in the same folder
 that gatherosstate is run from. The file is only of use on the same activated device (such as an activated VM) that it was created on (if a clean install fails to activate).</p>

<p>Hi Pauli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Pro version of VMware. I tried Hyper-V once, just too limited for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Pro, I have 7 vm's on hand, could do more if wanted. I always install offline, once I setup windows to my preferences, install a few utility programs, I save a Snapshot. I then put the vm online, update everything and save another Snapshot. These are
 my failsafe points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I deal with risky software so I need to keep things contained. If something does go drastically wrong, one click, and the time it takes to restart windows, I am back running from my failsafe points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VMware Player does not give this option and as far as I know, either does Hyper-V. Don can clarify that.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope that explains why Hyper-V just would not work for me. Theoretically, if I doubled my ram to 32G from 16G, I would be capable of running 6 to 7 vm's at the same time. Presently limited to 3 vm's. Try that with Hyper-V.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presently I test every Insider build on upgrade offline from previous Release along with total clean installs. This is how we caught the bug on a previous Insider build that would not accept signing in with your MS account. It would never have showed doing
 build on build, which I use a laptop to test.</p>

<p>Checkpoints I was not aware of, but can you run more than 1 vm at same time? Think it all depends on what you are used to working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don did bring up an interesting topic regarding activation on another computer. As this is bike season for me, have to enjoy the weather, Insider already takes up too much time...lol.&nbsp; Have to check out installing VMware on another computer, and use a copy
 of one of my activated vm's on another device just to see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the activation is tied into the host and vm, and not just the vm itself, it would be bad news for me on upgrading system to new mb, etc. I'm still running an i7 2600 overclocked to 3.9Ghz on my main. That would be 7 licenses gone. Ouch.</p>

<h2>            N97 mini dysfunction</h2>
                    
<p>First time the phone hanged, I needed to hard reset it, to enter the phone. Now it hanged while I was swtiching theme.</p>
<p>I hard resetet it, and began from the begining again. Although, next time I turned the mobile on, it didn't go further than the white background with the Nokia text.</p>
<p>There is no point to do the procedure again, and I'm sure if I manage to enter the phone again, I will have feature problems with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something is wrong with this one.</p>
<p>Run on firmware&nbsp; 10.0.020</p>

<p>Yep, something is wrong. Have you checked if theres any fw updates for your device?<br />
<br />
Now what I would do anyway before handing it in to a Nokia care point, is to get it back on (might need the famous hard reset)
<strong>and format your masstorage</strong>. Might be possible that your mass storage are corrupted.</p>

            I see, are there any updates for your device? If not - you could take it to a nokia care point and ask politely if they could update your device to the latest fw version.

<p>Fw are released to fix issues and improve your device. The problem is with productcodes. Let's say that your phone is operator branded. - In that case it's your operator that approves the fw, and decide if&nbsp;they will release it, and when...<br />

But it might just be your second faulty device!</p>

<h2>            My Google search engine is not working. When I type in a search it gives me the message page not found</h2>
                    <p>Google search engine isn't working for the past week since I renewed my virus protection. I was a little over teh margin for renewing - got a warning that had a trojan virus - later noted that that had been removed. However since then whenever I type in
 a query into my google (default) search enjine or even Bing I get teh 'page not found' after an interminable wait!</p>
<p>I was able to use my Norton safe search as a search engine - but aIT tech turned off a few addons to make space on my aging and very full hard drive and now the Norton safe search has disappeared and I have no other recourse. Did download Google Chrome -
 not working either!!</p>
<p>Can't afford to upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<h2>            no sound&#47; internet radio won&#39;t play</h2>
                    
<p>My internet explorer searches were really slow, and as a solution, I was prompted to disable any add-ons on my computer. This I did, and it solved my problem, but in the process, it has left me unable to play certain online radio stations. When trying to
 connect, the player says "ready" but will not play when the play icon is clicked.&nbsp; Do I need to re-install&nbsp; active x control, and if so where do I find it ?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which Internet Explorer version are you using?</div>
<div>2. Have you disabled all the add-ons?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, rather than reinstalling active X control which I presume is already installed in your computer, use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to disable only the issue causing add-on and enable other add-ons. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open Internet Explorer.</div>
<div>b. Click Tools, and then click Manage Add-ons.</div>
<div>c. On the Show drop-down menu, select All add-ons to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.</div>
<div>d. For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click Disable in the Information window.</div>
<div>e. When you have disabled all the items in this list, click OK.</div>
<div>f. Exit and then restart Internet Explorer.</div>
<div>g. If issues do not reoccur, repeat steps a through c.</div>
<div>h. Click Enable for a single add-on.</div>
<div>i. Repeat steps f through h until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, make sure your speakers are not muted.</div>

            Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
On SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform, there is the <strong>Copy List Item</strong> action, which can be used to copy items from one list to another in the same site.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e24adc4f-821d-4016-8fd6-204862cd2d29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e24adc4f-821d-4016-8fd6-204862cd2d29" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
You can make the workflow to start automatically when a new item is created.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7930567-a1c9-4f1e-862b-7c1297d98be2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7930567-a1c9-4f1e-862b-7c1297d98be2" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: The Copy List Item action is <strong>not </strong>available on SharePoint 2013 Workflow platform.<br />

                    <span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)"><span>I have Outlook 2016 on a Windows 10 PC. I have got the latest versions of both Outlook and Windows installed.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)"><span>I have various 'Add-ins' installed. They were working fine. However, in the last few months, all of a sudden, every few days, they become removed from my Outlook. I often notice a few days later that they are not there
 in the tabs at the top of Outlook 2016 - especially after it is restarted - and then I have to manually add it by going to the “Add-ins” section within my Outlook Options.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)"><span>I have manually re-added them as Active Add-ins about 50 times in the last few months.
</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)"><span>Because the Add-ins constantly become “Inactive Applications” it renders the programs more or less worthless for me.
</span></span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)"><span>What can be done to stop the programs becoming Inactive please?</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)"><span>Thank you very much. I greatly appreciate your co-operation.</span></span>

<br />•	Insert a table
<br />Tables are a useful way to organize information in your notes. Start by inserting a simple grid that you can expand as necessary.
<br />
<br />Press Insert&gt; Table. OneNote starts with a simple 2 x 2 grid.
<br />
<br />Click on any of the cells in the table to display the tab Table on the ribbon. From now on, on that tab, you will find additional commands available.

<h3> j sells  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook shortens attachment file name....</h2>
                    <p>when dragging &amp; dropping attachment in outlook it shortens the file name &amp; adds .... which outlook then recognizes this as a potentially unsafe attachment because of the ....extension. sometimes if I copy &amp; paste it will correct it; other times I have to
 email from the pdf file to create the full length name and then cut &amp; paste. I am using outlook 2010. this didn't happen until I upgraded to windows 10 Pro from 7Pro.</p>

<h2>            XBOX MUSIC APP</h2>
                    <p>the xbox music app on windows 8 has some glitches such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp; the xbox would make another copy of each song therefore doubling the number of songs that were in the my music folder and the windows media player</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the xbox would rename some albums and or songs and display the different version</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the xbox would not recognize some songs that the xbox did not have in the marketplace or whatever therefore the songs would not be added to the xbox player or the xbox cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>does anybody know if these glitches have been fixed.</p>

            <p>Thank you for keeping in touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only time the Music app should be doing anything with files is when it's downloading things.&nbsp; When you download something, it does put things in folders by artist and then album, so if you only have one track from an album it would end up in a folder
 by itself.&nbsp; If it was moving things around, something odd was happening for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the metadata issue goes, the best thing to do is to have everything in a folder outside of the library, then open the app and turn off the setting.&nbsp; Then move everything back to the folder inside the Music Library to get it to show up within the
 app again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our marketplace is constantly growing, but it does take time.&nbsp; It's exponentially larger now than it was even a year ago when Xbox Music launched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>The programs serve different purposes.</p>
<p>Word is intended to create documents that consist mostly of text. It has extensive text formatting capabilities&nbsp;- not just for formatting characters, but also for formatting entire paragraphs. On the other hand, it has limited and rather primitive support
 for formulas and calculations.</p>
<p>Excel is intended for performing calculations. It has extensive capabilities for formulas and functions. Its text formatting features are limited compared to Word.</p>

<h3> liz_vc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional formatting formula with IF, AND</h2>
                    <p><span>I would like to create a formula using conditional formatting along a check box option, for example
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Column G is an admitting date </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Column H has a formula that gives you the date of follow up, which is six days after the admitting date &nbsp;(=G5+6). Column H also has a conditional formatting formula, if the dates in column H cells are less than today’s date, then the cell will be highlighted
 in red. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I have added check boxes to column, this box will be checked if and when the employee has followed up with the client.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><span>The formula that I am looking for is:&nbsp; If date in column H is less than today’s date And check box in column I is not checked then highlight dated cell in column H. Or if date in column H is less
 than today’s date and check box in column I is checked then do not highlight dated cell in column H.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Can you please help accomplish this formula?
</span></p>

            Hi Liz_VC,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to add conditional formatting in the Excel workbook. When dates in Column H is less than today, highlighting them, otherwise making checkboxes in Column I checked. I would like to follow the steps below to add conditional
 formatting:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Go to Home&gt; Styles&gt; Conditional Formatting, click New Rule.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Create a new rule as follows.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Use-a-formula-to-apply-conditional-formatting-fed60dfa-1d3f-4e13-9ecb-f1951ff89d7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This article</a> about using a formula to apply conditional formatting is for your reference.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca5e080c-118d-44a1-a23d-a3376a2e4b78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca5e080c-118d-44a1-a23d-a3376a2e4b78" /></a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. In this case, you can mark checkboxes whose following dates are not highlighted. You can refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-a-check-box-or-option-button-Form-controls-9f201e46-8f6b-4a9d-a320-f44b28088cb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. While on cell I2, go to Developer &gt; Controls &gt; Insert &gt; Form Control &gt; Check Box (Form Control)</p>
<p>2. Draw the check box in cell I2</p>
<p>3. Right click on the check box and go to Format Control</p>
<p>4. In the cell Link box, select cell J2</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you check the box, TRUE will appear in cell J2, else FALSE</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click on cell H2 and write the following formula in the Conditional formatting dialog box</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AND($H2&lt;TODAY(),$J2=FALSE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Select the Format of your choice</p>
<p>7. Click on OK/Apply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Conventional wisdom says this problem is caused by these 2 dll's if you have them on your system:
<br />
<br />C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Internet Services\ShellStreams.dll
<br />C:\Program Files(x86)\Common Files\Apple\Internet Services\ShellStreams.dll
<br />
<br />Rename them to ShellStreams1.dll temporarily, restart your PC and try to open your workbook. If your workbook opens well and good, if it does not, you should revert these files to their original name . . .
<br />
<br />Failing that, have you tried to repair the workbook?
<br />If not, in Excel choose File - Open, select the file and instead of clicking 'Open', click the small arrow to the right of the 'Open' button and select 'Open and Repair'
<br />
<br />You say 'if I try to save it in a different format in excel it deletes the macros', a spreadsheet with macros must be saved as an xlsm file or xltm in the case of a Template with macros. Otherwise the macros will be deleted in order for you to be able to open the file again . . .

            That's not Outlook - its windows 10 mail.&nbsp; It's icon is a white envelope - Outlook's icon is blue. Type outlook on the start menu - does it come up?&nbsp;

<p>Wondering why outlook email is offered free on my phone but need to pay to have it on my new laptop ?<br />
Any idea what it costs to just outlook email? I don't need powerpoint or office.</p>

<p>Outlook standalone is around $129 US (perpetual license). </p>

    <title>User unable to login in to O365 after implementing SSO with ADFS 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            User unable to login in to O365 after implementing SSO with ADFS 2</h2>
                    <p>This effects only some users.&nbsp; After going to portal.office.com and putting email address we get "Redirecting .. "&nbsp; as expected. However user is not logged in to O365. We are redirected to login page.&nbsp;The user&nbsp;is shown as logged in. If we click on the logged
 in email address&nbsp;we are shown this error message "Selected user account does not exist in tenant 'Microsoft Services' and cannot access the application '00000006-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000' in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user
 in the tenant first. Please use a different account"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only started happening after we implemented SSO using ADFS 2. <br />
It appears to effect only users with <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">both a Microsoft Account and a&nbsp;work tenant account with the same email address
</span>( and possibly the same password)<br />
<br />
Its not a "One Off" - this has happened on 2 different tenancy accounts&nbsp;we manage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;tried changing the email address of the Microsoft account - however this doesn't seem to fix the issue after 24 hours.</p>

<p>As promised for anyone else with a similar issue - its now fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem was the user in Active Directory not being able to sync with O365.</p>
<p>All attempts - soft - hard etc failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason this failed was because the Users mail box in Exchange was of type "Linked Mailbox" - not "User Mailbox" like everyone else.&nbsp; See

http://www.expta.com/2016/03/linked-mailbox-users-will-not-sync-in.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once converted to “User Mailbox”
<span>&nbsp;</span>the sync worked – user can now access O365 with ADFS/SSO</span></p>

<em>Microsoft Print to PDF</em> as your "Printer" and it will output the PDF as expected with the recolor and/or transparency changes. If you are using older versions of Windows, you'll need to use a third-party add-in to be able to save the file as a PDF.
 I like the freebie primopdf.</p>
