    <title>Code of Conduct Clarification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmc sociopath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Code of Conduct Clarification</h2>
                    I just read through the CoC and need some clarification. Near the beginning it says, "Do not do the following: ... harass, abuse, or spam other players, etc." Does this include trolling in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield? By trolling, I mean things
 like pinning people in corners, hindering your team on purpose, teamkilling, provoking people, and all the things you would generally see on a popular Youtube troll channel. I don't want to hear things like, "You shouldn't do things like that.", "That ruins
 the game for other players.", and things of that sort. It's hilarious to watch, so I don't really care. I'm asking if it can get you banned not just because of the CoC, but also because an incredibly popular troll who needs no reference has been banned close
 to 30 times. Is it just the way he trolls that results in bans, or is it all trolling Microsoft has a problem with?

<p>Most trolling results in a ban because you're generally provoking someone to get a specific reaction out of them which is pretty much harassment.</p>

<p>You just skimmed my post or you took the completely wrong tone/idea. I'm not complaining about trolls, I want to do the trolling but only if I can't get banned for doing it. My whole post summed up in two questions: Is trolling considered CoC-breaking harassment?
 and, Can I get permanently banned for it?</p>
EDIT: Now that the posts are actually loading completely (don't ask) I can see my question answered.

<p>Hi I am not 100% on whether cod of conduct would apply there but I know you can report or block players for cheating, abuse or boosting as follows:</p>
<p>From a game lobby:</p>
<p>• Select the player</p>
<p>• View Profile.</p>
<p>• Select File Complaint.</p>
<p>• Give a reason for filing the complaint: i.e. trash talking or cheating</p>
<p>In Call of duty:</p>
<p>• Push Y to go to your friends.</p>
<p>• Go to recent players.</p>
<p>• Select the person you would like to report.</p>
<p>• Click report player.</p>
<p>• From here you have 4 options to report the player Offensive language, Exploiting, Cheating, Boosting</p>
<p>Or mute and block as follows: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/mute-block-avoid-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Sorry I also misread.</p>
<p>If your actions could be classed under any of the categories mentioned in the code of conduct or any of the reporting tools then I would suggest there is a chance that you could be banned or have action taken against you.</p>
<p>Code of conduct and reporting tools are there to make Xbox live a better, friendlier place.</p>
<p>Although you may have fun trolling the only real purposes is to aggravate or bully people.</p>
<p>The majority of people have paid good money to play games on Xbox live in the appropriate manner without being hindered or abused so the likelihood is that people will report you.</p>
<p>If enough people report you Microsoft will investigate and if they feel you have breached the code of conduct i.e. harassment they may well ban you.</p>
<p>Please note serious breaches such as boosting or cheating can result in your console being banned.</p>

<h2>            Sony Video Camera not detected</h2>
                    My Acer Aspire laptop will not recognize my Sony Video camera when I connect it via USB. I loaded the software that came with the camera but it still won't detect it. It tells me the USB device has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it. I searched
 for a driver from Sony but couldn't find one for the video camera. It's a Sony Digital 8 TRV510. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>I previously ran the 32 bit Win 7 enterprise on this machine w/o incident but since upgrading to the 64 bit Win 7 pro I am getting a blue screen pretty often, but doesn't seem to be a pattern to when it happens.&nbsp; On the blue screen
 it says that "a response was not received by the secondary processor within the allotted time limit", suggests removing newly installed hardware/software or disabling memory shadowing or caching, (the latter has been done). &nbsp; The only thing newly installed
 is the windows pro o/s. &nbsp; Following is the info from the crash dump.&nbsp; This is a AMD quad 9500 series processor with 3gb of ram installed, all windows updates and hardware drivers are installed.&nbsp; Any info especially a possible solution would be appreciated.&nbsp;
 Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Olá, adquiri recentemente o jogo F1 2012, porem o mesmo está todo em inglês, acho que não observei qual versão e acabei comprando a americana, gostaria de saber se no game te a opção de alterar idioma, pois não a encontrei, ou ainda se tem algum DLC para
 deixá-lo em português.</p>

<p>Desde já agradeço</p>

<p>Infelizmente não existe nenhum complemento para traduzir o jogo ou legendas. Existem duas versões para o jogo, uma em inglês, francês, alemão e espanhol e outra exclusivamente em português, que acompanha o DVD do Ayrton Senna.. Tive que adquirir essa outra
 versão para poder jogar em PT - BR.</p>

    <title>Games App Live Tile Busted, Xbox Live Profile Avatar Not Showing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silversee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games App Live Tile Busted, Xbox Live Profile Avatar Not Showing Either</h2>
                    <p>On all of my synced Windows 8 and Windows RT machines, the <strong>Games app </strong>
live tile is no longer updating; i.e., it is not showing my profile picture or Gamerscore, just the plain controller icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, when I start the app, my Xbox Live Avatar does not show up even though the app shows me as being logged in&nbsp;and I can view my friends list. &nbsp;Instead, I see a blank avatar placeholder.&nbsp; Also, the normal profile options are missing; instead, I
 see the same options that are normally displayed for friends:&nbsp; <strong>Add Friend</strong>,
<strong>Compare Games</strong>, and <strong>View Profile</strong>.&nbsp; (Naturally, if I click View Profile, the resulting page is blank and the app says it is unable to connect to Xbox Live.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I tried all of the published work-around and troubleshooting suggestions: syncing app licenses, uninstalling and reinstalling the Games app, modifying my Avatar's appearance on Xbox.com, running the Metro app troubleshooter, etc.&nbsp; When none of these
 worked, I checked and realized that this behavior is <em>universal across all of my machines</em>.&nbsp; I also verified that the Games app is working correctly for my wife on the same machines where it is broken for my account. This suggests that this is not an
 issue with my local PCs, but is some problem with the app and my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For what it's worth, the Games hub on my Lumia 900 running Mango is working, and I can edit my avatar and Xbox Live profile via the phone.&nbsp; There is also no problem when logging in via the Web at xbox.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a history of similar problems being reported in the various Microsoft Answers forums, so I don't think this issue is isolated to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5c74ae2c-0964-4575-878c-2672d2583747" title="Nizar Qawadri">
<p>
</p><p>With a Skype Number <em>(previously known as an Online Number</em>), people can call you from mobiles or landlines and you can pick up the call in Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say your families and friends are in the US and you are located in the UK. If you will avail a US Skype number, they will be locally charged instead of international rates for calling overseas whenever they call you. It will give you a benefit of having
 a local number while you are in different countries or regions.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - blinking login screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gp-pez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - blinking login screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks.&nbsp; I&nbsp;originally had this issue, but after attempting to follow a number of other tutorials (none of which worked), I finally found a solution for MY problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Upgrade, then the Problem:&nbsp; The Windows 10 upgrade worked fine (after emptying room on the system reserved partition), and when I finally logged in for the first time, everything was golden.&nbsp; Immediately, my Razer keyboard software wanted to update,
 so I let it do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;When it asked to restart, I agreed.&nbsp; At this point, my frustration reached a whole new level.&nbsp; Upon restart, I got the initial&nbsp;loading screen with the little blue win10 logo, then a black screen, then a gray screen with a spinning circle
 of dots ... and then rapidly cycle the black screen/gray screen with dots indefinitely (I apparently lost my temper on the last attempt, walked away, and the next day when I came back to try again, it was still blinking).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode:&nbsp; Initially I did not have recovery media, so followed other tutorials to download/burn the iso (using another machine), boot using it to&nbsp;access safe mode, attempt to fix, still - nothing worked.&nbsp; Repair didn't find any issues, and none of the
 other tutorials helped me out.&nbsp; Eventually, I discovered that if I waited for the initial windows logo with the small spinning circle to spin a couple times, then held down the power button to hard cycle the machine, it would access the automated recovery
 system (for those of you that don't have an extra machine or the ability to burn the windows 10 media right now;&nbsp;if the machine shuts off immediately, you haven't waited long enough -&nbsp;you need to reach the point where you have to hold it down for a couple/few
 seconds ... long enough for windows to take over power management from the bios).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally identified the problem: I have a Dell laptop with the fingerprint reader, and a while back installed/configured&nbsp;Dell's proprietary software to enable fingerprint login in windows 7.&nbsp; This software&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;incompatible at some level, and what
 I **THINK** was causing the problem is that the behind the scenes stuff that makes this software able to authenticate with windows 7&nbsp;no longer works with windows 10.&nbsp; In windows 10, it appears to fail the password authentication, and then resets itself and
 tries again, indefinitely - and providing no options/possibilities for the user to cancel the attempts.&nbsp; After trying everything from disabling every service and startup item to renaming every dell folder on the hard drive, and reading through all of the tutorials
 and tips I could find relating to a blinking screen, I finally got creative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution: I finally disabled the "Dell ControlVault w/ Fingerprint Touch Sensor" under ControlVault Device in the device manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm stuck with an error message at every boot/login that says the device&nbsp;can't be found, and finally the ability to login!&nbsp;&nbsp;This is followed&nbsp;(every boot) by&nbsp;a prompt to update the software from the company Dell hired/contracted/licensed (?? - I assume)
 for the software: Wave systems.&nbsp; However, I'm a bit gunshy of messing with any of that right now (I need the machine for the next few days), so I'm leaving it be.&nbsp; The windows 10 software management system will not allow me to uninstall the offending app,
 as it uses the original installer and that installer is not compatible with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this maybe helps anyone that was running into the same issues I was, or can't get to safe mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

<p><span>“</span><strong><span>Revo Uninstaller</span></strong><span>
 helps you to uninstall software and remove unwanted programs installed on your computer even if you have problems uninstalling and cannot uninstall them from "Windows Add or Remove Programs" control panel applet.<br />
<br />
Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!<br />
<br />
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry
 keys that are usually left”<br />
<br />
If that does not remove it, try the Vista Secuirity Forum with your question:<br />

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per description, you like to know that windows 7 allows student to use different computers to for speech recognition or would there be only one computer that can be used.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following question:</span></span></p>

</li></ul>
<p><span>Before you get started using Windows Speech Recognition. You have to train your computer to better understand you by creating a voice profile that your computer uses to recognize your voice and spoken commands.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a result students have to use the same computer which recognizes their speech.

<p>You could have each student backup their User Profile on a USB drive and transfer it to each computer they use it on. Although this is feasible, it is time consuming. There is no way to keep a User Profile on a server.</p>

            <p>The computer is one I put together about a year ago.&nbsp; It has an ASUS P8Z68-V PRO mother board, Intel CORE i7 Processor, 8 GB memory, two SATA 500&nbsp;GB hard drives, and one SATA optical drive running Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; About a week prior to the error my power
 supply started failing, would not power up right away after hitting the power switch. I have replaced the power supply. When I powered up the system on the 21'st, prior to receiving the error,&nbsp;Security Essentials detected and cleaned malware "Adware:Win32/ArcadeWeb".&nbsp;Then
 an update to Adobe reader was installed and Google Chrome was installed.&nbsp; The event log shows I had about 125 different Fault Bucket errors, and then the&nbsp;error for the for "the driver not found".
</p>
<p>I have install the latest drivers, no help.</p>
<p>I don't understand what you mean by "then download the drives available and install them in compatibility mode" ?</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response and help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the input.&nbsp; According to the ASUS web site, I have 4 drivers out of date; Intel Gigabit Network Connection, Realtek High Def Audo, HP C6200 printer, and SATA/PCI/IDE Controler.&nbsp; Also the BIOS is out of date. I am in the process of&nbsp;updating&nbsp;them,
 but I don't see how they will solve the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have been runing for about a year with the current hardware config.&nbsp; I have not added any new hardware. Why is&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;trying to install a driver for hardware that is not installed?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>static discharge when touching my surface book - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            static discharge when touching my surface book</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2017 surface book with performance base. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When plugged in, I sometimes get hit by a small static discharge when touching the base. This, in itself, is not surprising, but recently the screen started resetting (goes dark, then immediately restores) when this happens. When I use an additional external
 monitor, both screens go momentary blank, telling me this is not really about the laptop's native screen, but, rather about the video card, or possibly something deeper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be grateful for any explanation/suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;<br />

<p>Thank you for your reply. In fact, I should have also noted that I am using the microsoft surface dock, so there's not a figure-8 connector. However, the dock is not connected to a wall outlet -- just a grounded extension cord.</p>

<h2>            Wordament Crosswords</h2>
                    <p>April has finished. Went to Crosswords calendar to get May series of games. All it presented was 2017 games. Screen indicated all months had been completed. I had finished every month for 2017. I have done all the 2018 months to May. Could not get May 2018
 to come up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled Microsoft Word games. Reinstalled from App store.&nbsp;<br />
Still only 2017 games in calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back to settings and clicked on Advanced and clicked on "reset".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only still 2017, but all data from a year and a half was removed. It had warned me about that so I can't complain.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The incorrect game configuration setting is one of the possible reasons why you're unable to get the May 2018 Wordament Crosswords on Microsoft Ultimate Word Games. For me to help you with this concern, I need to collect more information. Kindly answer the
 questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to this concern?</li><li>Have you tried using a different profile to access the game and check if the issue persists?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you run the troubleshooter for Windows apps. This could help remove problems with an app from Microsoft Store. To do this, you may click the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After running&nbsp; the troubleshooter for Windows apps, you can reset the game from settings. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset the game from the Settings menu. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and click <strong>Settings</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Select <strong>Apps and features</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Find the game and click <strong>Advanced options</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>. You need to restart your computer to let the changes take effect.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you may get with in touch with the Microsoft Casual Games support who handles this concern. You can contact them through the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/wordament" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to post anytime.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help! The problem has worked out. I'm disappointed that the Reset eliminated my status from the games as I am rated as a Novice again. Yes, I was warned. But I felt I had no other option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a senior I use these games as a brain challenge. I play daily and hang in there until I win every Wordament puzzle and get each month's puzzles done every month. I was going to have a tough time with my addiction if I couldn't get this to work.</p>

            Hi 2TwOs , wow, where did you did the instructions for editing those registry keys?
<br />
<br />Please try this . . .
<br />
<br />From that screen you are stuck on, 
<br />
<br />Go to - Advanced Option - Troubleshoot  - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to  Advanced Options - Troubleshoot - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>I would first try a <span>System Restore as </span>DaveM121 suggested. If that fails, try "<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Repair</strong>". If that fails, consider the Reset.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Toshiba Satellite C655D-S5518 Touchpad Gestures not working.</h2>
                    I recently purchased and updated my laptop to Windows 8 Pro. The touchpad works just fine but noticed gestures are not working. I did a Windows update, gestures still do not work. Weird how it's providing an older driver but I still tried it, doesn't&nbsp;work.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I then went to Synaptics website and downloaded and installed the lastest Windows 8 driver. I'm still not getting any gestures.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Under mouse settings in the control panel, my only options to configure buttons are left/right. No gesture settings. Please help as I really want gesture support for my Windows 8 laptop.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If any other info is needed that I didn't already explain, please ask. Thanks!<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I do not get any error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried multiple drivers. </p>
<p>1) Driver that was installed with Windows 8</p>
<p>2) Driver that Windows Update installed (it installs an older driver)</p>
<p>3) The official Toshiba driver for this laptop</p>
<p>4) The latest Synaptic driver for Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each driver installs successfully. Only basic touchpad controls work. </p>
<p>1) Tapping</p>
<p>2) Moving mouse around</p>
<p>3) Left/Right buttons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No gestures work, and there is no configuration for gestures in the mouse settings like I have seen on other laptops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooter found no issues.</p>

 for advanced gestures? &nbsp;I have been waiting for a fix, here we are 8 months into Windows 8 and no fix from Synaptics or Toshiba?
