<h2>            Office 365 OneNote and OneDrive - Cannot save offline copies</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Office 365, OneNote and OneDrive. When I save a OneNote notebook from my local computer to my OneDrive, when opening the location in Windows Explorer on my local machine, I only see a shortcut to the OneDrive cloud location:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c501c287-7f20-419d-a7cb-8aa34044d145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c501c287-7f20-419d-a7cb-8aa34044d145" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm not connected to the internet and don't have that notebook open on my local PC, trying to open it OneNote from my OneDrive location yields this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3516c5eb-66ca-448b-a7cc-9c0fff1fc22e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3516c5eb-66ca-448b-a7cc-9c0fff1fc22e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not surprising, as the only information stored locally on my PC is a OneDrive Link.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that I can store notebooks locally by not using my OneDrive, but then I loose the ability to synchronize notebooks across devices. Having no access to my notebooks when not being connected to the internet is not an option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use OneDrive and OneNote to sync notebooks across multiple devices, while having offline access to&nbsp; the most recently downloaded copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other files that I've sync using OneDrive work properly and keep offline copies. One OneNote files do not work in this manner. I've searched and searched for a solution but cannot find one and I'm now considering using another cloud based sync service
 for all my files, as this OneNote issue is a deal breaker for using OneDrive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise or let me know if you need more information. </p>
<p>

</p><p>While I did not know explicitly that this was one possible solution, I discounted it as being the solution for me, based on the fact that it would

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the way Onenote works for notebooks being in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup:</strong></p>
<p>Onenote has an automatic local backup (settings under <strong>File, Options, Save &amp; Backup</strong>).</p>
<p>And you can backup notebooks manually into one file using <strong>File, Export, Package Format</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Outlook attachements saving as 0k</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a Windows Small Business 2011 Premium environment with two servers (domain controller and SQL server respectively). All workstations are Windows 7 with Office 2010 installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sporadically when saving attachments from Outlook 2010, the result is the named file at 0k size and invalid. If you save again, then the file size appears correctly and the file is valid. It has been confirmed that this occurs with DOCX and PDF based files,
 but we have no reason to believe that it is limited to only these files types. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've found elsewhere that this issue has been reported/discussed with many different suggestions on resolution (none of which have actually worked). Does anyone have anything at all on this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neha Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise where the daily Poll Questions went.. i use Web browser Safari and have noticed that the poll questions have disappeared. i have searched for the poll questions the last two days now and it seems that MSN Support Engineers have removed them
 from the site. The poll questions WERE conveniently located next to the Editors Pick section, but not anymore. Please confirm that MS support Engineers have deleted the Daily Poll Questions from the MSN.com homepage if that be the case. let us know. Thanks</p>

            <p>John, you are absolutely correct. I noticed that exact same thing. MSN is just biased. It's the way the media is. Unfortunately. I was looking at these polls on MSN almost daily. Trump was ahead leaps and bounds. The media has to put there propaganda out.
 Pitiful country we live in now.</p>

    <title>Tab Spaces Using VBA code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tab Spaces Using VBA code</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am&nbsp; trying to build a report using VBA code.</p>
<p>I want to make complete paragraph as one part in the VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Output is requested to be in below format:</p>
<p>First Name:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amr</p>
<p>Last Name:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; El-Bendary</p>
<p>Live:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;XXXXXX</p>
<p>XXXXXXX:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; XXXXXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use vbTab and Chr(9) but they are not working, even when putting multiple of them after each other, it is not working on code.</p>
<p>EX:</p>
<p>txt_test = "First Name:" &amp; vbTab &amp; "Amr" _</p>
<p>&amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "Last Name:" &amp; vbTab &amp; "El-Bendary" _</p>
<p>&amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "Live:" &amp; vbTab &amp; "XXXXXX" _</p>
<p>&amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "XXXXXXX:" &amp; vbTab &amp; "XXXXXX"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also trying putting constant spaces+letters length but also when going to report it is not working when moving to report.</p>
<p>EX:</p>
<p>txt_test = "First Name:&nbsp; " &amp; Space(20- Len("First Name")) &amp; "Amr" _</p>
<p>&amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "Last Name:" &amp; Space(20- Len("Last Name"))&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; "El-Bendary" _</p>
<p>&amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "Live:" &amp; Space(20- Len("Live"))&nbsp;&amp; "XXXXXX" _</p>
<p>&amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10) &amp; "XXXXXXX:" &amp; Space(20- Len("XXXXXXX"))&nbsp;&amp; "XXXXXX"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think main issues are:</p>
<p>- vbTab &amp; Chr(9) doesnot work in VBA</p>
<p>- Spaces &amp; letters sized in VBA are reflected with different sized in report causing miss alignment</p>
<p>
</p><p>any idea how I can make it work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR/Amr</p>

<p>Thanks dhookom!</p>
<p>my main issue is that some sentences will have variable number if lines.</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p>Address: &nbsp; &nbsp; Can be 1 line or 5 lines</p>
<p>
</p><p>in this case having provision for maximum number of lines can result in empty spaces between points, this I need to avoid.</p>

<p>For some reason vbTab (nor Chr(9)) doesnot work in my code.</p>

            If there are variable numbers of lines (vertical space) I would create a subreport based on a union query. This would solve all issues ;-)

<h2>            Sync multiple SharePoint libraries to symbolic link that points to a network path&#47; file server</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to sync a SharePoint library to a symbolic link that points to a network path. I'm able to sync one library but when I try to sync a second SharePoint library I get an error,<br />
Make sure you have permissions to view it and try again.<br />
<br />
I've sufficient permissions on both library, but its always either of the library that is selected first to sync will get synced. The second library wont.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Ankit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For OneDrive for Business sync client on Windows, there is a restriction and limitation stating that the Synced folder must be saved to the local hard disk. Please refer to Windows specific restrictions
 and limitations section in this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/3125202/restrictions-and-limitations-when-you-sync-files-and-folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70d7b554-cf82-438a-a674-282b4affda79" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70d7b554-cf82-438a-a674-282b4affda79" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, for the OneDrive for Business sync app to work as designed, we suggest you save the synced files to a local drive instead of a network path when syncing SharePoint libraries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joanne</p>

<h2>            decision tree download</h2>
                    I am trying to load an excel add on for a simple decision tree. I am getting a compiler error: method or data member not found . I have to try to get a decision tree loaded onto my computer before my assignment is due in a few days. I don't know how to
 fix this, or if I need some sort of patch download, or if there is a simple download of another decision tree that I can do that does not require me to have programming skills to load into my excel. Can anyone help? &nbsp;Thanks! &nbsp; Adrian

    <title>Windows 10 Technical Preview, Bluetooth Not Showing Bluetooth Devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristian acel gene cua  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview, Bluetooth Not Showing Bluetooth Devices</h2>
                    <p>so I know that it is a Preview Version that may or may not contain several bugs. But, is it just me or anyone out there also experience a bug with the Bluetooth Radio ?? .. whenever I try to scan for my Bluetooth Devices (my Bluetooth Mouse to be precise),
 it doesn't appear on the list. Not any of my Bluetooth Devices appear either, though my Android Phone finds my Bluetooth Mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i just wanted to ask, if is it just me or others also experienced the same thing ? .. if not, how can I bypass or fix this bug ? thanks</p>

            <p>Try uninstalling and reinstalling your bluetooth drivers. &nbsp;Also, if you updated from prior versions of Windows rather than a clean install, your bluetooth may be a little borked as well, which I have not found a fix, other than to format and clean install
 WinTP.</p>

            <p>I have no Bluetooth either.&nbsp; So no Bluetooth mouse.&nbsp; Installed Win 10 and updated to latest build 9860 and still no Bluetooth.&nbsp; Tried another Bluetooth mouse without luck.&nbsp; There used to be a Bluetooth option under system settings.&nbsp; Still have touchpad so
 am able to utilize. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I had gotten used to the Win 8.1 start screen and like it better than the new hybrid.&nbsp; Hopefully, there is an option for the original Win 8.1 configuration.&nbsp; At first glance did not see an easy option on expanding the tile section.&nbsp; It is probably
 there.</p>

            <p>I am still looking for a solution to the Bluetooth problem.&nbsp; I assume that it represents a problem with a hardware-specific driver, because I have Win 10 running on a Dell Venue Pro 8 tablet and and a Sony Ultrabook laptop.&nbsp; I could detect and install my
 Bluetooth mouse on the Dell machine, but not on the Sony.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happily, the solution to your other issue is simple.&nbsp; Right click on the desktop and select 'Properties'. Select 'Start Menu' and then&nbsp;uncheck the 'Use the Start Menu instead of the Start screen' option.</p>

<h2>            Missing word document converted to an internet shortcut&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago I worked on several documents in Microsoft Word. I saved them to a folder on my desktop, so I could easily find them to save to my school's network when I returned to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to open the file, it was completely missing from the folder I saved it in. I searched every way I knew how to find the missing document (in case I had accidentally saved it in a different folder, etc.). The only way I have found my files is
 through searching my C-drive. In doing so, I found the files, but instead of having a Microsoft Word icon next to it, they have internet shortcut icons. When I try to open the file I see an error message. When I look at the properties of the files, I see it
 is saved as an "internet shortcut". I have tried searching through recent documents as well, and it is no where to be found. See below at the screen shots I took to see what I mean:</p>

            Are you sure that these aren't shortcuts, perhaps pointing to a USB drive? <br />
<br />
In the Properties dialog box (shown in your screen shot), look at the "Internet Address" field. What is the target of the shortcut?

<h2>            Editing the Breakthrough List for Quiet Hours</h2>
                    <p>On a HP Elite x3, I can not edit, or even ope or create, the Quiet Hours breakthrough list. When I follow the instructions I have found on the internet, Cortona ALWAYS opens an internet search instead of a file to edit or add or modify for the Quiet Hours
 breakthrough list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How may get to, or create, the Quiet Hours breakthrough list on an HP Elite x3 Windows 10 Phone?</p>

<p>OS build is 10.0.15254.124. Not sure when problem began. The phone is an HP Elite x3 that I got to replace a failing Lumia 1520 last April. The 1520 had Quiet Hours active and I was able to create/edit the breakthrough list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got the Elite x3 from a Microsoft store, the settings from the 1520 were loaded in to the Elite x3 at the Microsoft store. the problem of editing or even creating a breakthrough list did not come up until two nights ago my wife, who has limited mobility,
 tried to text me and call me on my Elite xs during the set Quiet Hours. Her contact info was in the breakthrough list of the 1520. But I did don have a ring through or a text beep from my Elite x3 during the Quiet Hours. So I tried to see what was going on
 with the Breakthrough list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found instructions online that stated to open Cortana, select the "hamburger menue", select "Notebook", select "Quiet Hours"and the select "Edit breakthrough list". Each time I follow these instructions, when I press "Edit breakthrough list", Cortana displays
 a screen with the message "I'd be happy to help out with that. Whit your permission, I can do things like manage your calendar, track packages, and help you send texts." There are two hot spots: "Settings" and "Maybe Later". If "Maybe Later" is selected, a
 screen with I'm afraid I can't help out without that permission. I'll be happy to do anything else that doesn't require that, though." There is one hot spot "Got it" on the screen. Selecting "Got it" goes back to the Quiet Hours screen with a on screen keyboard
 and a white box with a magnifying glass icon and "Type here to search". If I type "edit breakthrough list" in that box, an internet search is displayed of "edit breakthrough list" articles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If from the Quiet Hours screen the "edit breakthrough list" hot spot is selected, then on the resulting "I'd be happy to help....." screen the hot spot for "Settings" is selected, the "Settings" page is opened. That screen has options "Locations", "Camera",
 "Microphone", and 15 more option listed. Two of those other options are "Contacts" and "Phone Calls". Neither of the options have any sub-option to get to editing the breakthrough list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I searched on the internet for help to allow editing/creating the breakthrough list. Virtually all such listings had the same instructions I followed above. And there a LOTS of sites with commets about not being able to edit the breakthrough list, Contacts
 that were on the break trough list being deleted, and several other related problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I tried to get help through Microsoft by loggin in to my Microsoft account and searching for "Quiet Hours "Edit breakthrough list"" using the automated help agent. There is NOTHING that gets me to editing the breakthrough list!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Contacted HP support on this issue. Their responce that it is a OS, Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile, issue. So no help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have at least two "chats" with Microsoft support on the issue: I believe *** (from my PC), &amp; *** (from my Elite x3). The only ultimate responce was to use a third party support, appearantly because Microsoft doesn't want to deal with Windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a health and safety issue to me. If my wife can NOT contact me reliably during Quiet Hours, WHAT GOOD IS THERE IN HAVING A WINDOWS PHONE??</p>

    <title>The setup routines for the Microsoft excel driver ODBC Driver could - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The setup routines for the Microsoft excel driver ODBC Driver could not be found</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I did an evaluation of Office 2010 and found that it was not compatable with some of my applications. I de-installed it and proceeded to re-install Office 2007. I have picked up the above mentioned problem trying to create an ODBC connection. Indications
 are that Office 2010 does not take out its ODBC drivers when de-installed and I now have an incompatability problem.</p>
<p>I am running Windows&nbsp;7 ultimate 64 bit. I have been to this page <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260558</a>&nbsp;to try to get a few ideas. I have not been successful in resolving this problem.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be grateful for any suggestions.</p>
<p>regards Steve</p>

<h3> bairdj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pasting slides into a new PowerPoint template</h2>
                    <p>We have created a new PowerPoint template, but when we paste an older slide deck into the new template (I've tried the straight paste and the reuse methods) the slides start on the second slide, and the title slide is blank, even though the first slide in
 the older slide deck is clearly a title slide layout, as is the first slide in the new template. What are we missing, and is this an issue with the old deck or the new template?</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, is there a reason why you don't open the older slide deck and apply the new template to it rather than copy/pasting?</p>

    <title>Adding Primary domain without changing MX Records - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steverooney01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding Primary domain without changing MX Records</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are looking to deploy Office365 enviroment for a domain which although we are responsible for, the domain is used in various countries by&nbsp; users through Google Mail and this unfortunaltey can not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment we are using Exchange On-Premises with all users default (send as) domain set to the shared domain mentioned above, SPF records are set correctly to allow emails past spam checks etc.. However the critical point here is that the On-Premises
 server is NOT responsible for the domain and is not listed under accepted domains - users simply have the domain added to their Exchange account properties so emails leaving the server have their sender address set to this domain. We know if the server was
 responsible for the domain then emails to other users thoughout the world using Google Mail would not leave the server and an NDR would be produced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That takes care of outbound emails, for inbound emails they are first delivered to Google Mail as with all the other users throughout the world but are auto-forwarded to another domain which the On-Premises server IS responsible for with MX records set to
 deliver these emails to the server and users have a secondary email address in their account which is the forwarded address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a way of getting this to work in Office 365? I know I can add a verified domain and set users to this address without changing any MX records but I believe this would make Office 365 responsible for the domain and therefore not send out
 emails to the Google Mail users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the easiest solution would be to get everyone into Office 365 but this is unfortunately not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            Hi Steve,<br />
<br />
As I understand, you’d like to confirm if it’s possible to use the same custom domain in Office 365 and Google Mail, and keep the mail flow working flawlessly in both sides. If my understanding is correct, the answer is yes. You can refer to the following article
 to set up simple domain sharing to do the trick:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Pilot-Office-365-with-a-few-email-addresses-on-your-custom-domain-39cee536-6a03-40cf-b9c1-f301bb6001d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Pilot-Office-365-with-a-few-email-addresses-on-your-custom-domain-39cee536-6a03-40cf-b9c1-f301bb6001d7</a><br />

If anything is misunderstood, please feel free to specify your requirement and we will further assist you accordingly.<br />

<p>Hi frustratedwithoutlook,</p>
<p>The simple way is to delete the Yahoo account in Outlook (check <strong>Note </strong>
in the following steps). However to control deletion of messages from the Yahoo! Mail server, try these steps:<br />
a. Open Outlook and from the Tools menu, select "Account Settings." <br />
b. Click on the "Email" tab.<br />
c. Select your Yahoo! Mail account and click change.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If you click Remove, then Yahoo account will be removed from&nbsp; Outlook.<br />
d. Click on the "Advanced" tab.<br />
e. Check "Leave a copy of messages on server" if you want to save your Yahoo! Mail messages on the Yahoo! Mail server as well as on your local computer. Please note that setting your email client to remove messages from the server will cause your messages to
 be deleted from the server. Once the messages are deleted, we are unable to retrieve them.<br />
f. Click OK.<br />
g. Close Microsoft Outlook and restart.</p>

 be bold show up as bold. Is there any way to fix this problem so my tables don't look inconsistent and sloppy?

<p>Hi Benjamin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reproduced the issue here at my end by pasting a table from Excel as picture in Word application and this is the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the copied Excel table.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12042c57-860d-4fe3-8d7b-bf843abb341c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12042c57-860d-4fe3-8d7b-bf843abb341c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The table seems to paste just fine when I used the <strong>Picture (Enhanced Metafile)&nbsp;</strong>under
<strong>Paste Special</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47ccf310-b5ce-4955-b5a2-cb87b38fc81b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47ccf310-b5ce-4955-b5a2-cb87b38fc81b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're still experiencing the same issue after following the screenshot above, kindly access your Word application in safe mode. This would help us identify if an add-in or extension is causing the problem. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click Yes when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in
<strong>safe mode</strong>.</li></ol>
