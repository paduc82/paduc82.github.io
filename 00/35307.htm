<h2>            nvidia driver issues resulting in various blue screens of death</h2>
                    <p>The problems started on may 3rd iirc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was browsing when me pc froze. When i tried to reboot my pc it gave me a blue screen before i even got to the desktop (cant remember which error it gave).&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a couple of failed attempts to repair windows i decided to reinstall windows completely.</p>
<p>everything was fine except whenever i tried to install video driver it would give my a black screen and when i reboot i would get a blue screen with the error message "driver_irql_not_less_or_equal nvlddmkm.sys".</p>
<p>however i've tested my brother gtx 970 in my computer and it works just fine with the latest drivers.</p>
<p>I've also tested my gtx 580 in another windows 7 pc and it works just fine.</p>
<p>I gave up on the problem a couple of days ago but decided to test a couple of possible solutions again today.</p>
<p>none of which worked. another blue screen of death has take the place of the&nbsp;"driver_irql_not_less_or_equal nvlddmkm.sys" message though. When i try to install nvidia drivers the screen now goes black for a while and then (without rebooting) i get a blue
 screen but it has another message and then windows reboots.</p>
<p>i have tried to get my gtx 580 working again on a clean windows 7 install but i get hit by the same blue screens of death.</p>
<p>

<p>here is a link to the .rar with my last 3 minidump files aswell as my system info.</p>
<p>the&nbsp;"driver_irql_not_less_or_equal nvlddmkm.sys" is probably not in there as the last three bsod's happened while installing the nvidia driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions on how to fix this?</p>
<p>thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Changing&nbsp;boot select&nbsp;type in the bios setup, off of UEFI boot&nbsp;type did the trick for me. After that&nbsp;I updated bios from manufacture that supported W10. Downloaded Intel graphic driver package for W10 from manufacture. It was an onboard Intel Graphic chip,
 but it may help your Nvidia.</p>

<p>hey, thank you for your suggestion i'll try it tomorrow if i can.</p>
<p>do you mean that you have fixed a similar issue for your oboard intel graphics chip?</p>
<p>http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/H61MU3S3/?cat=Download&amp;os=Win1064 there are only 3 w10 drivers from my motherboard manufacturer but i'll install them all ofcourse (i think i should have them already though).</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Yes I was freezing and recovering. Then when booting got a W10 UEFI Bois boot error and kept restarting. Not exactly like yours but similar. But it affected the video drivers. Once I bypassed the UEFI Bios it booted. I also disabled fast boot in powers option
 and let it boot slow giving W10 time to load drivers. Then re-enabled fast boot.</p>

            <p>First more about the problem; it happens when I click on library or computer from start menu to try to access flash drives. The green line that shows things are loading seems slow, but it is moving but stops, and then all of windows explorer becomes non
 responsive. At this point I usually have to turn off my computer and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the memory diagnostic that showed no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to run the System File Checker and it got to 52% on first step verification process and then it stopped and after a few minutes it displayed the following message:
<em>Window Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I notice once when somehow I got Windows to log off, one of the screens that showed up was something about 'task host not responding'.</p>

</p><p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Notification icon (far right on your taskbar, looks like a square speech bubble)</p>
<p>If you cannot see the Tablet Mode Button, click 'Expand'</p>
<p>If the Tablet Mode button is blue, click it so it turns gray - this will turn off Tablet Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>Go to your Settings App (gear icon on the Start Menu)</p>
<p>Go to Personalization - Start</p>
<p>Make sure 'Use Start Full Screen' is switched off</p>

Okay, my brother's computer is 3 weeks old and is already has major issues. His computer every so often has a boot up problem and will get stuck as the 'Starting Windows' logo and sign. Today however, it will load up the Acer logo and then will 'Disk Read Error:
 Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to Restart' and this won't do anything.&nbsp;

<div>Furthermore Acer's have a really weird BIOS section and no recovery console. In addition to this, Acer do not supply their own recovery disc and the custom made recovery discs don't run or load up.</div>

            <span>Hi<span>&nbsp;
</span>NeerajMorar,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to the computer recently?<br />
2. Are you able to boot to the desktop?<br />
<br />
<b><u>Method 1<br />
</u></b>I would suggest you to access Windows Recovery Environment Options by pressing F8 key(Repair your computer) and then try Startup repair.<br />
<br />
<b>Startup Repair</b><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/startup-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/startup-repair</a><br />
<br />
<b><u>Method 2</u></b><br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
<b>Error message when you try to install an additional operating system on a computer that is running Windows Vista: "A disk read error has occurred. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart."</b> (Applies to windows 7)<br />

<br />
If the issue still persists, contact Acer support as the computer is only 3 weeks old

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
There were no changes recently made to the computer, furthermore I can't even get to the login screen let alone the desktop.<br />
<br />
The computer has been a complete headache for the 3 weeks it has been here. We are sending it back for a refund and going to buy a new computer which is not an Acer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
        </p>

<h2>            How do I combine two administrator accounts into one administrator account&#63;</h2>
                    I have pictures and documents in two different administrator accounts(one was mine and the other was my now ex-husbands). I've enabled the pictures to share with other administrator accounts. I would like to delete one of the accounts without losing pictures
 and documents. How do I do this safely?

<p>You said .....I've enabled the pictures to share with other administrator accounts.</p>
<p>How did you do that ? By putting copies of the pictures in Public Pictures folder ?<br />
If yes, you have nothing to worry about. The pictures are still in the Public Pictures.<br />
<br />
Do you have copies of those in your own admin account ?<br />
If you do, you have nothing to worry about either.<br />
<br />
If in the account that you plan to remove has some pictures and documents you want, logon o that account and get them first. ( I am, of course, assuming you have password to logon to that account ).<br />
If you don't have the password to that account, I can't help you. <br />
Reason <strong>: we are NOT allowed to assist users to crack admin password. Penalty is banned from all Microsoft forums.</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Make a NEW ADMIN account with your same password to use to test and fix with now. This is a 3rd account<br />
which will not normally be used or contain any real data. Always keep an unused ADMIN to test and fix as<br />
needed. (This is not required however is very prudent to do.) This account can be the one you use to migrate<br />
the data you want to keep from his account to your own.</p>
<p>Just copy the files you want to keep into the account you intend to use.<br />
<br />
If you really want to get into it fully use this method and pretend his account is the corrupt and yours<br />
is the new one (remember your account is already created and do not delete any data in it).<br />
<br />
Fix a corrupted user profile<br />

<h2>            touch pad, windows 8, no longer has a selection to turn off like it did in windows 7</h2>
                    When upgrading to windows 8, it disabled the touch pad of my Inspiron 1720. Thats ok, as I always use an external mouse. however, In windows 7 there was a select screen where you could turn it off with an external mouse in use . That's gone now, but the
 touch pad is still operable and there is no way to turn off. This is always there and it is a hinders use of the whole computer.

            <p>Dell site says Win 8 is not supported by them on my N7010...tried old driver install but still won't work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up date 4/19/2013: after months of no dell support or MS's either I found the only solution is to cover the touch pad with tape to render it useless but solve the problem of your palm moving the curser while typing.</p>
<p>PS I used an aluminum&nbsp;foil tape from Amazon for the thickness.</p>

<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log' &gt; Ensure 'Automatically
 restart' is un-checked. <br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Two attached DMP files, different bugchecks:<br />
<br />
<u><b>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>A kernel-mode driver or process attempted to access a protected memory location it does not have permission for, or a kernel interrupt request level (IRQL) attempted to access a memory address that is too high.
</i><br />
<br />
This bugcheck usually occurs when a driver uses an incorrect memory address. Other possible causes of this error include: bug in a device driver, system service, the BIOS, an old Anti-virus program or backup tool, or possibly memory issues.<br />
<br />
If we take a look at the call stack, we can see a page fault right before the bugcheck -
<br />
<br />

<u><b>nt!KiPageFault+0x260</b></u><br />
<br />
Page faults cannot be handled by <i>MmAccessFault</i> when the IRQL level is 2 or higher. If we look at the 2nd parameter in the bugcheck, we can see it's 2:<br />
<br />
BugCheck A, {fffff890094e453c, <u><i><b>2</b></i></u>, 1, fffff803d95bd8f6}<br />
<br />
1: kd&gt; .trap 0xfffff880094e4370<br />
NOTE: The trap frame does not contain all registers.<br />
Some register values may be zeroed or incorrect.<br />

nt!EtwpCCSwapTrace+0x8e:<br />
<br />
^^ From the .trap of the page fault, we can see that the rip register is the same as the address which referenced memory.<br />
<br />
<u><b>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced. </i><br />
<br />
Usual causes are a bug in a device driver, hardware related memory issues, corrupt NTFS volume, anti-virus software.<br />
<br />
From this, possible hard disk or memory issues. I am doubting device driver conflicts right now.<br />
<br />
Run Memtest for no less than ~8 passes:<br />
<br />
<u><b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<br />
<span><u><b>Chkdsk:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
There are various ways to run Chkdsk~</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 1:</b></u><br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
chkdsk x: /r<br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
chkdsk c: /r<br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 2:</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you'd like to get a log file that contains the chkdsk results, do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />
<br />
Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />
<br />
This will output a .txt file on your Desktop containing the results of the chkdsk.<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>If chkdsk turns out okay, run Seatools</b></u></span> -<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/</a><br />
<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced. <br />
<br />

It's possible non-Microsoft services are conflicting. Try running chkdsk in Safe Mode.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Chkdsk completed, and Seatools too without errors? How long did you run Memtest for?<br />
<br />
Did this notebook come installed with Windows 7 and you installed Windows 8 yourself? If so, I'd recommend rolling back to Windows 7 as that BIOS update sounds risky.<br />

<h2>            HP laptop hacked by ex, via USB device.</h2>
                    <p>Please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is totally screwed up! I turn on my computer and everything is changed. My account says administrator as user instead of showing usual info. Also says its locked, but i dont put in any password and it opens? I no longer have admin rights. My desktop
 is changed. It says local admin. Cannot login with my micrsoft account on my laptop now yet i can on my phone. From my phone though it shows successful login from my browser on microsost account. I noticed my pictures are deleted as well as other media files.

</p><p>&nbsp;My ex did this with a usb password hack device he bought for 10 dollars on ebay!!!&nbsp; I would like to recover my personal files but it says i have no file history ! ?&nbsp; Also says I have no back up disks. I do have a empthy 64 gb flashdrive i was thinking of
 using to back up whatever i can but only able to get drive c to save not d which says recovery......&nbsp; So i am worried that i may reinfect or install whatever is wrong with my account after i reset everything. I am not sure what else he may have done, he is
 very knowledgable technologically and I am sure he has changed more than I can tell so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that from the account that is on here now its only local and doent allow me to do much!!!&nbsp; Also there are two new files ony desktop ... same name but properties are different

<p>Contact your local Law Enforcement Agency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;should reinstall the operating system but wait until you have contacted the authorities as they may want to do a forensic examination of your machine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your unknown version of win would by default save data in the Documents location, and what you are perhaps seeing is only pointers (shortcuts), in several places, to the actual underlying data.</p>

<p>Hi Esther-Accenture,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay, your case has just moved into our category.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd like to inform you that it's not feasible to directly play the system sound while sharing desktop in Skype for Business. The workaround is to insert the video/audio into PowerPoint and use Share
 PowerPoint Files function as following screenshot. Please check the detailed steps in the following article.</p>

<h3> shadowwo1falpha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alien Language</h2>
                    
<p>I've been looking over some of my favorite alien movies and games trying to find out how alien language worked in them because I've been thinking about writing my own story with alien species in it. My question is how do the various species in the Halo universe
 comunicate with each other and how do humans understand them? I mean most of them seem to speak some English but I also hear what sounds like alien language too, are the English parts something the covenant species learned or is it for the player benifit?</p>

<p>When you hear the Covenant speak English it is because they have learned the language from their time fighting humans. &nbsp;When you hear the Covenant speaking their native language it is because they do not yet know how to speak English and/or because they
 do not wish for the humans to know what they are saying. &nbsp;In addition it seems the Master Chief's suit has a translation device because in Halo 3 when one of the Prophets was speaking natively, Cortana was able to translate his speech into English.</p>

<p>Thank you, there is alot to the Halo Universe and while I know alot more than most of my friends theres just so much information about it, it's really detailed. I figured it was the case that they would pick up some English on there own but I wasn't sure
 and I didn't know about Master Chief's translation device. But honestly in your opinion on a large scale other than picking up bits here and there why would a majority of aliens want to learn English? I mean everyone thinks there native tongue is the best
 and in the covenents case I mean humans are a race that in there opinion wouldn't be around much longer.</p>

<p>As you have stated there are many aspects of the Halo universe that have been unexplored/unexplained so it is our job as fans to fill in the gaps. &nbsp;In Halo Reach which is a prequel to Halo 1 the Covenant do not speak English as their contact with humans
 had still been recent but as we get closer to Halo 3 almost every Covenant species knows some sort of basic English which lends truth to my culture exposure theory. &nbsp;In Halo 4 the Covenant again do not speak English because they are a faction of the Covenant
 that were not present during the Human-Covenat War which means they had not yet been exposed to the English language.</p>

<p>Interesting, I didn't know that I haven't played 4 yet and wondered how the covenant was being brought back into the story. In my story I'm still debating if aliens are necessary but I'd like to keep the option open and if I do I'd like to try to fill in
 details like language not that Halo hasn't done a good job explaining things I find theirs is one of the best formed sci-fi universes I also thought this was the case with Mass Effect (until 3) but as it stand Halo has the most detail and I'd like my story
 to not leave readers to fill in to many unexplained parts unless their intentional because intentionaly unexplained things can work well with some stories as well.</p>

<h2>            Detachable Surface keyboard not working</h2>
                    I need some instruction on how to move between my on-screen touch keyboard and detachable keyboard on my Surface. It appears to somehow be locked.&nbsp; It previously worked so perhaps I reconfigured something.&nbsp; I spent an hour on the support website looking
 for a solution and could not find anything.&nbsp; Also the Start icon on the touch screen is not accessible.

            <p>I had the same problem but just worked it out - the filter Keys were "on" - this needs to be off.&nbsp; Swipe in from the right hand side of the screen and touch the search button.&nbsp; Then above the search&nbsp; tab change 'everywhere' to 'settings'.&nbsp; Then search 'filter
 keys' and choose&nbsp; 'turn filter keys on or off' then make sure filter keys is set to off</p>

 anywhere on my computer to uninstall it, and I can't get the website for Skype to give me a download option for the old version either. Totally frustrated and looking for help.&nbsp;

<p><span>I sincerely&nbsp;apologize for what you have been through. Skype for Windows 10 came as a pre-installed application on your device. I do not recommend uninstalling it, you can still use the classis desktop Skype even if the Windows
 10 Skype app is installed on your device. </span></p>
<p><span>You can download&nbsp;the classic Skype for Windows desktop on the
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Downloads</a> page of the Skype website. Once you are on the Downloads page, scroll down a little bit until you see
<em>"If you'd like to use the classic version of Skype. click here". </em>Click on it so you can download the latest version of Skype for Windows desktop. Make sure that your device meets the system requirements needed for Skype to run smoothly. Please check
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=system+requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this FAQ</a> for details. </span></p>
<p>But if you would want to uninstall the Skype application you currently have, you may try the following steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click the Start menu. </li><li>Locate the Skype icon and right click on&nbsp;it </li><li>Choose Uninstall. </li><li>If you want to install this version in the future, please download it from the Windows store.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to post back if you need further assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!<br />
<br />

            Of course Microsoft is going to tell you to keep it regardless of how bad the have messed it up. Windows 10 it is under Apps right click and uninstall it. Plenty other Win10 apps that blow this away. Microsoft needs to stay out of the app market and leave
 it to the pros.&nbsp;

<h2>            Change in Monitor Display, No longer crisp</h2>
                    I had a windows 10 update on 19 January 2018. The update took some time, so I guess it was a major update. When my computer restarted, both monitors did not display anything with the crispness they had before the update. I updated drivers for the monitors
 along with the graphics card. The monitors still look the way they looked after the update. Any ideas?

<br />
<br />There are some known issues with AMD/Radeon Video cards/drivers
<br />
<br />REDUCED DISPLAY FUNCTIONALITY WITH OLDER ATI (AMD) RADEON VIDEO CARDS AFTER UPDATE (NOT FCU SPECIFIC)
<br />An update package (not RS3 specific) incorrectly targeted ~1.9M devices and resulted in reduced display functionality with older ATI (AMD) Radeon HD 2000 - 4000 series video cards. The update package is expired, so no new exposure is expected, however we have received ~3,000 support cases and observed significant forum and social activity. We are actively working on an Answers Q&amp;A post which will include mitigation instructions.

<br />        <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a> (note you may have to do a google search to find this address
<br />   5.  Run the driver Setup program
<br />
<br />REMOVE A DRIVER PACKAGE FROM THE DRIVER STORE
<br /><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730875%28v=ws.11%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc7...</a> 
<br />When you uninstall a driver, if you don’t want it to come back automagically, you have to block it and remove it from the driver storage folder
<br />
<br />HIDE / BLOCK WIN AND DRIVER UPDATES
<br />Microsoft has released KB3073930 that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates. 
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

            Hi Mike, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />1. If you have an AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapter read this. If not skip down to 2.
<br />
<br />Check the reply byErwinJames San - Microsoft here :
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/display-problems-on-some-amd-radeon-video-cards/037b84cc-2b3f-4192-aa51-83239bf1b61b?tm=1512094687396&amp;auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />2. More troubleshooting for all regardless of your adapter make or model:
<br />
<br />Right Click the Start Button  OR  use  Windows Key + X 
<br />
<br />click Device Manager
<br />
<br />expand Display Adapter - 
<br />
<br />double-click the adapter - 
<br />
<br />on Driver's tab - use Roll back driver - OK.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />3. If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers. 
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller 
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr</a>... 
<br />
<br />Then install the desired driver you previously downloaded. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

            So much for the easy answer. Lets take another shot at it.
<br />
<br />FYI: I know it can handle multiple monitors because I have the same build a am running a 4K and HD setup.  I did have video driver abends and video BSODs when I first got the computer. They went away over time.  I still do have a problem with the external monitor powering off and on briefly. 
<br />
<br />First thing, right click on desktop, select Display Settings.
<br />confirm that the resolution for each monitor is set to "Recommended"
<br />Try playing with the Scale
<br />
<br />That probably won't help, but it has to be checked.
<br />
<br />Search for "Adjust Cleartype Setting"
<br />Work your way through that series of steps.

<p>I fixed it. Here's how I did it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I opened the Control Panel and selected Color Management (The Display icon does not display in the list on my control panel).</li><li>I clicked Profiles and selected Reset my settings to the system defaults.</li></ol>
<p>The text and displays are now clear and crisp again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone for your suggestions. I guess this is another procedure to add to the troubleshooting list.</p>

            Thanks for the update. 
<br />
<br />That is interesting. A couple of months ago we started seeing problems with color display on some monitors.  It had a similar fix, revert to the factory provided color profile.

            Hi Mason,
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Unplug all devices, especially a USB receiver for a wireless mouse or keyboard
<br />
<br />Make sure your PC cannot access the Internet
<br />
<br />Start your PC and give it 20 minutes to either complete the update or roll it back . . .

            OK Mason, if that does not work,
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

You can open <i>System Properties</i>&nbsp;by right-clicking <i>Computer</i>&nbsp;and selecting

<br />
If you absolutely need either the&nbsp;<i>&lt;</i><i>pause/break</i><i>&gt;</i>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<i>&lt;scroll lock&gt;</i>&nbsp;keys, they are both available from the
<i>On-Screen Keyboard</i>&nbsp;(<i>Start, All Programs, Accessories, Ease of Access, On-Screen Keyboard</i> or click
