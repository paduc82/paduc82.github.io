            Whatever you <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">type</span> into a Header/Footer is what will appear on each page [each occurrence of the Header/Footer]. Don't
Page#</span> button that appears in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Customize Header &amp; Footer</span> dialog or the one on the
Page Number <span style="font-style: italic">code</span></span>... or use one of the Built-In Headers/Footers that includes the page number field.<br />
<br />
Have you looked at the page Jim gave you the link for on May 21? It's based on Excel 2011 but Excel 2008 works exactly the same way.<br />

    <title>What is the impact of unchecking &#34;Updating Task status updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stretch_texas  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the impact of unchecking &#34;Updating Task status updates resource status&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Project 2010 Standard in a Windows 7 environment</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Management has decided to impose EVMS. Therefore, I need to be able to track time task %Complete separately from resource consumption. Therefore, it seems that turning off&nbsp;"Updating Task status updates resource status" will
</p>
<p>1. disconnect Earned Value from the time line and</p>
<p>2. will require me to manually update resource consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance: I have a 4 week task with the resources back loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Week: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; &nbsp;2 &nbsp; &nbsp;3 &nbsp; &nbsp;4</p>
<p>BCWS ($) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25 &nbsp;25 &nbsp;50 &nbsp;50</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 weeks, I should be 50% complete time wise, but 33% resource wise for an EV (BCWP) of $50.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I keep&nbsp;"Updating Task status updates resource status" checked, then when I set the task %Complete to 50%, the resource complete, EV will also be set to EV = 50% which is not correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, will unchecking&nbsp;"Updating Task status updates resource status" enable me to
</p>
<p>1. correctly show EV and </p>
<p>2. will that EV be rolled up correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Stretch,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure unchecking the option will get you what you need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project calculates Earned Value on % complete - which is a duration measure. &nbsp;If you say the task is 50% complete, Project will assume you have "used" half of the original duration and still have half of the duration left. &nbsp;As you note, in a 4 week task
 you should be 50% complete at the end of two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you are saying that during that two weeks the resource has only completed 33% of the work - the next question is where is the work the resource did not perform being scheduled? &nbsp;If the resource was initially scheduled to work 160 hours over the 4
 weeks and should have completed 80 hours but only completed about 52 hours has the remaining work been moved forward and extended the duration of the task? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a quick experiment I created a 20 day duration task with one resource assigned with a cost of $1 per hour. &nbsp;My BCWS at the end of week one is $40. &nbsp;I entered 25 hours of actual work for week one and show ACWP and BCWP $25 at an assignment level. At a
 task level the BCWP is $36.57 . The duration of the task is now 21.88 days because the 15 hours of work the resource did not complete week 1 has been scheduled at the end of the task. The % complete is calculated at 23%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I update my status date to the end of week 2 and in week two enter 30 hours of actual work. &nbsp;The duration of the task is now 23.13 days with 25 hours of work being re-scheduled. &nbsp;The percent complete is 43% (you should be 50%). &nbsp;The task BCWS is $80, the
 ACWP is $55, and the Earned Valued (BCWP) is $69.19.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is done without turning off the option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Noor,</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Did the issue occur when you sent the email internally or externally?<br />
2.&nbsp;Is there any Non-Delivery Report (NDR) while sending email to the shared mailbox?<br />
3.&nbsp;Can any other email account, such as “Gmail”, “Hotmail” or “Outlook.com” account send email to the shared mailbox successfully?</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message to collect the NDR if any. To access and reply to the private message:<br />
1. Go to "Your details" section on the right side of the community site.<br />
2. Click Private messages.<br />
3. Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<p>Hi Noor,</p>
<p>Thanks for your private message.</p>
<p>Now I know the message trace shows the email was delivered to the shared mailbox successfully but the email wasn’t in “Inbox” folder of the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>Given the situation, please confirm the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1.&nbsp; Is the email in “Junk” folder of the shared mailbox?<br />
2.&nbsp; Is there any “transport rule” or “inbox rule”? If so, disable the rule and check the result.<br />
3.&nbsp; Do other users have the “full access” role of the shared mailbox? If so, remove the role permission for others and send another email for testing.</p>
<p>Also, I have sent you another private message to collect the attributes of the shared mailbox for checking. To get the attributes of the shared mailbox:<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a> with an
<strong>admin credential</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Run the cmdlet <strong>get-mailbox <em>&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</em> | fl</strong><br />
Note: Change the italics to the shared mailbox.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any update is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Save as CSV with UTF-8 encoding</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I save the Excel workbook to a CSV with UTF-8 encoding?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try playing around and selecting UTF-8 in the Encoding tap of the "web option" from the "tools" dropdown menu in the save as dialog but the CJK character still shows up as ?????? in the saved CSV file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is saving as UTF-8 is a thing for Excel 365 in 2018?? I see people over on stackoverflow complaining and advise the programmer to just use Libre office for this job.</p>

    <title>How to make Office scrollbars easy to see&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill freese  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make Office scrollbars easy to see&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I understand the design principles behind making scrollbars unobtrusive, but this is too much of a good thing. Not everyone has the eyes of an eagle, ready to spot extremely narrow scrollbars, or white on very pale gray scrollbars, or white on white delineated
 by an incredibly narrow outline scrollbars, or, worst of all, invisible scrollbars that are supposed to come back when you need them, but never do without a struggle. Even with good vision, I reach for a scrollbar while looking at my work. I want to see the
 scrollbar in my peripheral vision. I need contrast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some option that will allow me to get back the kind of clunky, ugly, old-fashioned, hideous, undesirable scrollbars that I actually desire so I can get some work done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen similar questions posted with a response asking which software specifically has the problem. The answer to that question is everything on a computer in the last ten years, but most specifically today I am looking at Word, Excel, Access, Outlook
 and Powerpoint, in both Windows and Macintosh current versions. I am selecting "Microsoft Office Word" because the Microsoft Community form insists it is impossible for a problem to apply to more than one Office product, but this one sure does. Please, give
 us a setting we can change that makes the scrolling block bright blue, or red, or green or a good dark black, and if such a setting exists, somebody direct me to it.</p>

</p><p>and also scrollbar for windows 10 and Office 10 are in opposite color style. Windows 10 is "Gray on White" while Office (including Outlook) is "White on Gray". Please fix this.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to import contacts into Nokia 515&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My need is very basic: I want to import my phonebook into my Nokia 515. It doesn't matter whether I import it directly from Outlook, from a csv file, Bluetooth to my iPhone - whatever works. I don't even need a sync, I just need a way to import my &gt;1,500
 contacts without having to type everything anew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded several applications, done all sorts of Bluetooth connections, read several forums on the net, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks if someone can give me a step-by-step explanation of what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Off topic:&nbsp;Now I know why Nokia was close to bankruptcy. It's rubbish. There isn't a simple way to do something as basic as importing contacts from another source)</p>

<p>Hi &nbsp;,</p>
<p>First and most important, the Nokia 515 phone&nbsp;has a maximum capacity of 1000 contacts, so it does not meet your demands. As a Series 40 phone&nbsp;I expected it to&nbsp;be supported by Nokia Suite, but it is not listed on the Suite support page. It may work with Nokia
 Suite contacts import/export anyway, if not the latest version 3.8 then the ealier version 3.7 - but&nbsp;the capacity problem remains.</p>

<p>There is a free software called 'PhoneCopy' which synchronizes your old phone contacts.</p>
<p>Go to</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonecopy.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.phonecopy.com/en/</a></p>
<p>and register a free account</p>

<p>for information regarding setting it up in your Nokia 515 phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have your old contacts in your Android or Iphone, you can install the PhoneCopy app.</p>
<p>Or if it is in your old Nokia phone you can set it up in the Configuration settings.</p>

            <p>You've probably worked around this problem since, but this is what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply exported the contacts from my old phone memory to my sim card.&nbsp; Depending on your sim card, you'll probably be able to save 200+ (maybe even 500) contacts on to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I put the sim card into my Nokia 515, and imported the contacts into my Nokia's phone memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a lot more contacts, you'll have to do this step 6 more times.&nbsp; You'll have to clear out the contacts on your sim to make room, so put the sim back in your old phone, select the option to just show contacts from sim card, select them all,
 then delete. Switch back to show contacts from phone memory.&nbsp; Then do the export/import process all over again, selecting the next 200 - 250 contacts to export.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tedious part for you would be highlighting the next 200 or so contacts.&nbsp; There's a 'select all' option, but there's no way to select blocks of contacts.&nbsp; I wish you can hold down a 'select button' and choose the beginning and end of your selection block,
 but you can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes a little time to do this, but I already spent a lot of time trying to find ways to export.&nbsp; As already mentioned, the bluetooth sync isn't compatible with most phones, and Nokia Suite doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have less than 200 contacts, the whole process should take only 5 minutes.</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 Modern Authentication registry settings per user</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a doubt: I know Office 2013 with Modern Auth requires the computer to have a specific set of registry key settings, according to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-Modern-Authentication-for-Office-2013-on-Windows-devices-7dc1c01a-090f-4971-9677-f1b192d6c910?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enable-Modern-Authentication-for-Office-2013-on-Windows-devices-7dc1c01a-090f-4971-9677-f1b192d6c910?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\EnableADAL </p>
</td>
<td>
<p>REG_DWORD</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity\Version </p>
</td>
<td>
<p>REG_DWORD</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>From the path, that is done in Current User hive, my question is: If I modify this settings for one user, will modern auth be enabled for other users that use that same computer? I know for shared PCs every user that logs in requires to activate Office ProPlus
 2013, but this registry key is applying to Current User and not Local Machine, so I don't know if I need to go and modify it on every user that shares a PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>I'm using Vista Ultimate. I have installed Windows Mobile Device Manager and established a partnership with my HP Ipaq h1910. It synced using USB cable and I installed Onenote2007 and Outlook2007 and all data was transfer. Now when I attach my ipaq the PC
 doesn't see it (it doesn't show up in device manager)&nbsp;and Windows Mobile Device Manager says its disconected. Sometimes I get a message saying unkown USB device attached. Mostly I just hear sound of connecting and disconnecting.</p>

<p>Running Vista Home Basic and IE8.&nbsp; When I bring up the internet, it usually runs very slow and affects the speed of all programs on the computer.&nbsp; The hard drive light stays on continuously and CPU usage will go up to over 50 percent a lot of the time.&nbsp;
 I have found that if I bring up task manager and end the process "ielowutil.exe", the computer will immediately run as it should and will usually continue running that way until it has been shut down for awhile and then started again.&nbsp; At that time I have
 to go through the same procedure.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling IE8 and reinstalling, but it doesn't help.&nbsp; Obviously, I can turn off protected mode, but that isn't really fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I start IE8 without add-ons, the same thing still happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any clue as to what the problem is?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Was AVG and Ad-Aware Ad-Watch running in the background when you installed IE8 and/or SP2?</p>
<p>Did you upgrade from AVG v8.5 to v9.0?</p>
<p>Did you install AVG Linkscanner, Search-Shield, Active Surf-Shield, Security toolbar, and/or&nbsp;any of the email scanning components? Most of them do not play nice with IE8.</p>

 for resources and tools to keep your PC updated with the latest updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>My personal recommendations include:</p>
<p>=&gt; Install IE8 manually, not via Windows Update/Automatic Updates!! =&gt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx</a></p>
<p>=&gt; Save the installer to your desktop, do not Run it.&nbsp; When you're prepared to install IE8, right-click on the saved file and select "Run as Administator.</p>
<p>=&gt; Uninstall all third-party toolbars (e.g., Google; Yahoo; Windows Live) and third-party Windows Themes
<p>=&gt; Close all open applications (i.e., anything with a taskbar icon) before installing or uninstalling IE8.</p>
<p>=&gt; I would strongly recommend disabling your anti-virus application and any anti-spyware application's "system protections" (other than Defender's; this includes Ad-Aware Ad-Awatch and Guard) before installing or uninstalling an IE upgrade.&nbsp; If you're running
 a third-party firewall, I would recommend disabling it and then enabling the Windows Firewall before installing (or uninstalling) an IE upgrade.</p>
<p>=&gt; Create a Restore Point manually before installing IE8.&nbsp; [Do NOT use System Restore to remove/uninstall IE8; instead, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957700</a>.&nbsp; Then use the Restore Point prior to reinstalling IE8 per these recommendations.&nbsp; Norton users will need to see
<a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/symantecdoc1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bertk.mvps.org/html/symantecdoc1.html</a>.]</p>
<p>=&gt; Reboot twice after installing or uninstalling IE8, then check-in at Windows Update and install any critical security updates offered.</p>
<p>=&gt; For best chance of success with IE8, make certain that your anti-virus application version, any anti-spyware applications (other than Defender), and your third-party firewall (if any) are supported in IE8&nbsp; before you decide install it.</p>

<h2>            Does Win 10 32bit support MBR&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Win10 64bit adn GPT requirement</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's great that Microsoft is moving forward with newer, better technology, but there will be a lot of older machines that will not run Win10 because of it.&nbsp; I have a 2009 HP Pavilion laptop.&nbsp; It runs win 8.1 great even with Media Center.&nbsp; Unfortunately as
 of build 10061 and 10074, Win10 won't even boot.&nbsp; I'm assuming because it converts the MBR to GPT and my old laptop doesn't support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question:&nbsp; does Win 10 32bit support MBR?&nbsp; I'll have to download it and try if it does.</p>

Doing so gives such participants access to an early preview of a product still in development and the possibility to help shape its release with early feedback. Over the years, the methodologies available to do pre-release testing of Microsoft code has opened the door to a new set of early adopters who are more willing to take such products for a early spin without hesitation. Microsoft has responded to the rapid changes since the early days of Windows 95 and in more recent times Windows XP which were only available to a select technical group of private testers.

<p><strong><span><span>Hi charles chambers,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Were there any changes made prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode and check if you come across the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-Ons" mode</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Start, and then type Internet Explorer in the Start Search box.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons). Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If it works then you can disable add-ons (follow step 2).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine which add-on is causing the issue</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Internet Explorer 8.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Tools, and then click Manage Add-ons.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Show drop-down menu, select All add-ons to display all add-ons that are installed on the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each item in this list, select the add-on, and then click Disable in the Information window.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have disabled all the items in this list, click OK.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exit and then restart Internet Explorer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If issues do not reoccur, repeat steps&nbsp;a through c.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Enable for a single add-on.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat steps&nbsp;f through&nbsp;h until you determine which add-on causes errors to occur.</span></span></span></p>

                    I am looking to do the opposite of what a mail merge does. For example one cell contains "Cleveland, OH" I want to separate that into one cell with "Cleveland" and another cell with "OH" I have a list of 34,000 city,state that I need to separate so doing
 it manually is not an option.

            Are your 34,000 city,state cells in a single column? If so, select that column and find the "Text To Columns" button on your Ribbon (I can't tell you where it is because I don't have XL2010, although you may be able to bring it up by holding down the ALT
 key and pressing DE). Once the dialog box appears, select the "Delimited" option button and press the "Next" button. On the next dialog page put check marks in the "Space" and "Comma" checkboxes and make sure there is a check mark in the checkbox labeled "Treat
 consecutive delimiters as one"; then click the "Finish" button.

            You are welcome. Good point about the space... the reason I suggested comma/space was so that the space would be "absorbed". Because you used the comma only, I think all your state abbreviations now have a leading space in front of them. No worry, though...
 since your state abbreviations cannot have any internal spaces, simply select the entire column and use Excel's Replace function (press CTRL+H to bring its dialog box up) to replace the space character with the empty string... that is, put a space in the "Find
 what" field and leave the "Replace with" field empty (click the "Options&gt;&gt;" to see all the available options and make sure the "Match entire cell contents" checkbox is NOT checked).

    <title>Nokia 6300 memory card can&#39;t be seen&#47;recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n0kia27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6300 memory card can&#39;t be seen&#47;recognized</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 6300 and I bought a MicroSD card, but when I put it in, I can't see/find the memory card folder in the Gallery, it looks like my phone doesn't recognize the card. I can't even format the memory card, because I don't see it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone can help? Is the memory card no good? Or it just not meant for that particular phone, even tho it fits? Or my phone needs to be restored? I did try to restore my phone, but I don't remember my security code and the 12345 code doesn't work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Possible problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Faulty card</p>
<p>2. Incompatible card</p>
<p>3. Faulty card reader in the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try the card in another phone or any other card reader. You could try another card with the phone. You could also tell us a little more about the card like make, type, where you bought it from etc.&nbsp;</p>

            So I played with the card in the slot, and in the Gallery, the Memory Card appeared, so I went to Options to format it, and couldn't find it, and when I came out of Options, and clicked on Memory Card, I got Memory Card Removed..when it actually wasn't...so
 perhaps there's something wrong with the phone?

            Not necessarily. Try out the suggestions in my previous post and you will have a better idea afterwards. Most problems with memory cards are due to the card being faulty. Cards bought online can be dodgy.

    <title>Office 365 Home - Can&#39;t activate - Account Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex vojacek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home - Can&#39;t activate - Account Issue</h2>
                    <p>Like the title says.. whenever I try to activate my Office 365 subscription it says "Account issue".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent days with MS Tech support trying to fix this and I was sure it was something related to my account and not my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 4 days of struggling and with the tech support saying to me that I need to wait because Microsoft is migrating servers and that may be preventing me from activating then it came to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to use one of my family's e-mail that is associated with my Office Home suscription and it activated just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here it goes:&nbsp; Microsoft is denying that my account has any restriction but as soon as I&nbsp; try to use MY OWN ACCOUNT it says "Account Issue".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is evident that MS is restricting my account, for unknown reasons as the rest of my family (which is associated with my own account with Office that I AM PAYING) can activate it just fine!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What sorcery is this?.&nbsp; Why would MS block my own account from activating the subscription I AM PAYING through MS?</p>
<p><br />
Does this happened to anyone else on the forum?<br />

            The Support and Recovery Assistant app runs on Windows PCs and can help you identify and fix activation issues with Office 365.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380#bkmk_sara" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />Try using that to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />then
<br />
<br />Reinstall Office
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forgot-the-account-i-use-with-office-eba0b4a2-c0ae-472c-99f6-bc63ee2425a8?wt.mc_id=scl_installoffice_home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/i-forg...</a>
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />
<br />This begins the download of Office. Follow the prompts on your screen to complete the install.

<p>
</p><p>Tried Tier 1 and Tier 2 tech support... no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to login with a family member e-mail that is part of my OWN ACCOUNT.&nbsp; It activated just fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd

<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:

                    Ever since I bought a replacement laptop (now using Windows 7 and IE 9) my financial websites no longer work. I can log into them, but I can't view monthly statements. I click on the links and just get a blank page. If I go back to my old laptop, I can
 see them fine. This isn't a problem with a single website, but with my bank, cell phone company, internet provider, and power company.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything and I think that is problem some profile users, because when I logon as other users signatures in outlook is OK. No error message is created, only the outlook does not create a new signature pattern.&nbsp;The same problem happens to us in more
 than one company in different local station (Win7,W10 + Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013)</p>

<h3> milo1272  say:</h3>
<h2>            wifi only&#59; no data plan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm thinking about buying an E63 but I want to know what features I can use on the phone without a data plan.&nbsp; I&nbsp;currently use a pay by the minute plan from T-mobile and I want to avoid&nbsp;the large&nbsp;monthly charge.&nbsp; My office campus is wireless everywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It's clear from the documentation that I can search the web and link up to email, video, etc. through various web sites.&nbsp; But, can I connect with corporate email (ms exchange) or VPN through a web connection, assuming my employer's security settings allows
 it?&nbsp; Can I also reach documents through OVI only using a web connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, can I use the full features of this phone without a data plan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other option is to get an ipod touch and carry it with my current phone.</p>

<p>Of course you can. I only use wlan when I am within range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, before getting one, you might want to have a chant with your IT dept to ensure that the E63 is compatible with the security on your office wlan.</p>

<p>I would say that often WiFi functionality is even wider than cellular data connection. Some applications, which use streaming voice/video, do not work via 3G.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess that this is to avoid competition with service operators, but who knows...</p>

            Thanks for the information.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do any of you have any&nbsp;thoughts about the touch vs. smartphone comparison?&nbsp; Obviously you can't easily make calls on a Touch (although there is a work around with VIOP and headphones with a microphone), but you can do all of
 the web based applications easily.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<p>the only difference with data and wifi (aside from the speed) is the access point you're using. with data, you utilize your service provider's internet access point. hence you pay for it. with wifi, you either set up your own access point (such as your home
 internet with router--in which case you technically still pay for it, but to your isp provider not your cell carrier) or through a wifi hotspot. If public, you get a free connection to the internet while some other bloke pays for the actual service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the Touch vs smartphone, I would personally go with the smartphone. the Touch technology is pretty much still in it's infancy as opposed to the smartphone's history. (mind you there are touch phones that are smartphones as well, I'm just not a big
 fan of touch). The touch adds another factor which is input method which should it malfunction, you're gone. in contrast, the smartphone only has to deal with the continuous quest for a better and better operating system.</p>

<p>By default when you use an application that wants to make a network connection it will prompt you which connection you want to use. On that list is any GPRS connections you have defined and WLAN networks in range. So if you are within WiFi coverage then
 it will work just as it would if you had a data connection from your carrier (without the expense.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I like phones without the touchscreen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, stevea51,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Hotmail.com and MSN.com are powered by Outlook.com. New accounts will have the outlook.com domain added after the User Name @.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Simply use your existing Microsoft ID to log into </span><a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.outlook.com/</a><span>
 and your files will be there. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would advise is to create the Outlook.com account first.</p>
<p>Next, add the Hotmail account as an Alias. You'll then see the folders in the new account listed under your Hotmail user name.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-or-remove-an-email-alias-in-Outlook-com-459b1989-356d-40fa-a689-8f285b13f1f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add or remove an email Alias</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make the Outlook.com account your primary account.</p>

<span><span>However, if you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you –<strong><em>‘Where do you want to save your emails?’</em></strong><em>,<strong>
</strong>y</em>ou will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder
 will appear in the left pane under <strong>‘Folders’ </strong>and all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></span></p>
