<h2>            Utilizing Multiple Fields from a List Box</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to&nbsp;make a database to help build configurations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table that lists all the codes I'm "building" items with, including: code, category, description, price, and model. (Each category has multiple codes associated with it, and the same code can have different prices based on which model the item is.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a form that allows users to pick one code from each category. (Each category has a query filtered by that category. When a model is selected on the form, the queries also filters by that model.) Each list box is populated by a query and displays
 the code, description, and price.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the bound values to code (except for the model list box, which needs to be description so I can use this as an input&nbsp;filter for the other queries). The form is linked to a table which logs the codes chosen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, I want to be able to print a summary for each item with the code, description, and price for each category. Running a report from the table with bound values only shows a third of the picture. I basically need it to look like the form, but
 without the un-chosen options. Can I either access multiple bound values from the same list box, or use a vlookup equivalent to populate the description and price for each category by finding the values associated with the code/model/category combination in
 the first table?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also open to ideas for how to completely redo the database to accomplish this more efficiently. I'm brand new to Access and have been teaching myself how to do things as I go along but I have no experience with structuring these things.</p>

            Hi Marisa, I'm an independent adviser and will try to help. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like you might have a Bill of Materials type of application. You have a configuration and choose from multiple items to build that configuration. If that is the case, I would suggest you search on Bill of Material database, you should find many articles that detail how to build such an application. 
<br />
<br />You need to have, at least, three tables here. One table will list the configuration and the attributes of the configuration. The next table, will be the list of items that go into building the configuration. The third table will be the list of items that you choose from in building your configurations. 
<br />
<br />the way you would enter the data here is with a mainform/subform. The mainform would be bound to Configuration table with a subform bound to the Items table and linked on ConfigurationID. You would add a record in the subform for each item in the configuration. 
<br />
<br />I suspect what you may have done is add a field in your table for each Category of item. That would be a non normalized table structure.
<br />
<br />If you need more clarification on this, please feel free to ask specifics.

<p>Okay, I'm looking into BOM databases. Is the idea to have one table for each hierarchy branch?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So instead of two tables with</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;codes&nbsp;| category&nbsp;|&nbsp;description | price | model&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(items and categories)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; configuration ID | category 1 code | category 2 code&nbsp;| category 3 code&nbsp;| etc...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (configurations)</p>
<p>
</p><p>four tables with</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; models | categories&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (models)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; categories&nbsp;| codes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (categories)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; codes&nbsp;| code details&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (items)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; configurationID | category 1 code&nbsp;| category 2 code&nbsp;| category 3 code&nbsp;| etc...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (configurations)</p>
<p>(categories apply to multiple models but models don't have every category)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I address the same code having a different price depending on the model it's on in this format?</p>

            Ok, Well I didn't want to confuse things too much. But yes, Using different tables for each entity (Models, categories, etc.) is more normalized design. 
<br />
<br />But using numbered field like Category 1 code, Category 2 code, etc, is NOT the way to go. Again, each category within a Configuration should be a separate record with the ConfigurationID as a foreign key. If you need to make sure that each category is selected then you can prepopulate that table with one record for each category and fill in the code in the correct record. 
<br />
<br />What you need to determine is if there is a unique combination of model, category, etc. So you can select one code for each category. Or you may have to select multiple codes to identify the item that goes with that category.

<p>Hi Parker,</p>
<p>I would like to collect some details to better understand your situation:</p>
<p>1.Are you using Outlook desktop when encountering the issue? If yes, which version is it?<br />
2.Does the issue occur in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>?<br />
3.When you cannot open the folders, do you get any error message? If yes, could you provide a screenshot of it?<br />
4.Can you open your Inbox folder and view the email inside?</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are using Outlook desktop, corrupted profile can also lead to bad performance. You can try to create a new profile for your Office 365 account, also for a test. See:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918</a>.</p>

                    <p>I have an SBS 2008 Exchange server and am thinking of migrating the mailboxes to Office 365. One issue is that the server does not have an IPv4 address, only IPv6. (That's one of the reasons I want to migrate.) Will the migration tools work if the server
 is only accessible via IPv6?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. I currently have an Office 365 Business Account and am thinking of upgrading to Office 365 Business Premium but have not done so yet, and have not investigated all the options for migration. I have a simple migration, only a couple
 of mailboxes, so was hoping to use the tool to cut over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I am on Office 365 I am not worried about IPv4/IPv6. The problem is that my ISP has given me a double-NATTED IPv4 address so it is impossible to make inbound IPv4 connections to my server. Once the migration is complete I won't have to make inbound
 connections to my server so this should not be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is a bit of a mess. The MX records for mydomain.com point to an email hosting company and email is initially delivered there. My server runs PopGrabber to fetch the mail and deliver it to Exchange. My server is a domain controller&nbsp;for mydomain.local
 on my local subnet, and has a valid certificate for https as mydomain.local. Outside of my local network, clients connect using RPC over HTTP to mydomain.dyndns.org, which my server does not have a certificate for, so the clients have to ignore the certificate
 error. Because of all this I am nervous about upgrading to Business Premium and then discovering that it is very difficult to actually migrate the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that I am just asking questions on a free forum for now. If necessary for full support&nbsp;I could take out a 1 month Business Premium subscription; please let me know.</p>

            Thanks, it took me a while to sort things out. In the end I bought a new certificate so I can do the migration. I learned that, right now, migration is
<strong>not </strong>possible from an IPv6 host (both the migration endpoint setup and the connectivity analyzer fail). I ended up renting a EUR3/month VM from online.net and running socat to forward from IPv4 to IPv6, and have now successfully set up a migration
 endpoint, though not yet performed the migration.

            <p>Hi Misard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To delete the user, you need to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to Office 365 PowerShell</a> (not Exchange Online Powershell) and the run the cmdlet
<strong><em>Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -RemoveFromRecycleBin</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about this cmdlet, you can refer to:</p>

            <p>This is where I think I messed up and can't work out how to fix it. When I created my Office 365 account, the user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was created as part of the account setup. When I then added the domain mydomain.com, I ended up adding the
 user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and that is how I was logging in to my Office 365 account (before the email migration). When I was having trouble with the migration, I changed that user to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** so when I run Get-MsolUser I see</p>
<p>
PS C:\Users\misard&gt; Get-MsolUser<br />
UserPrincipalName &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DisplayName &nbsp; isLicensed<br />
----------------- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;----------- &nbsp; ----------<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** My Name False<br />
<br />
PS C:\Users\misard&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems there is still some trace of the misard user even though the Domain principal is now admin. I am nervous about trying to remove the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** user since that's the only domain user listed as you can see, and I'm not sure how I would log
 in if I succeeded :)</p>

            This is website specific functionality. Some websites like to put images in plugins so that they can have features such as these. Otherwise, I simple image&nbsp;cannot be handled in such a way.

            I see this happen occasionally myself. Outlook itself is not
    responsible for previewing items. It passes that task to QuickLook,
    which is part of the Mac OS, so I'm not sure if this is really an
    Outlook issue or an issue with QuickLook.<br />
    <br />
    You can try deleting these QuickLook files to see if that resolves
    the issue (the " ~ " represents your home folder):<br />
    <br />
    
    ~/Library/Preferences/ com.apple.QuickLookDaemon.plist<br />
    ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.QuickLookDaemon/Cache.db<br />
    ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.QuickLookDaemon32/Cache.db<br />
    <br />
    You may need to log out and log in again or simply restart.<br />
    <br />
    Hope this helps!<br />

    <title>Page number sequence problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krogertroutman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page number sequence problem</h2>
                    
<p>In a long document, I moved several pages of text using cut and paste method. However, the original page numbers moved also. I have tried to remove the page numbers both above and below the problem area -which it visually does. However when I reinsert the
 pagination the old numbers appear.</p>
<p>I can correctly paginate the document by forcing it to start at the correct number but then I have to reenter this number every time I insert a page before the problem area.</p>
<p>If I enter text before the problem area so that it continues into the first problem page and/or insert a page break, the problem persists.</p>
<p>In the documentation area below the document on the left handed entry it says "Page xx" for example 193 (the precopy page number) even though the page above it says 960.&nbsp; To the right of the "Sec" I am currently on the page may be "960/1170", the 960 being
 the actual page of the document I am currently on. There is no Section Break at this point.</p>
<p>No matter what I have tried to do either in Word 2003 or the same document (on another computer) converted to Word 2007, nothing seems to work, including (in 2007), using the "Remove", "Insert", "Design" buttons.</p>
<p>Thanks for shedding any light or suggestions to resolve this issue.</p>

<p>It sounds like your document contains multiple Sections and that the portion of the document that you have relocated is a Section that has the page numbering defined to start at a particular number, rather than continue from the previous number.</p>
<p>You could try running a macro that contains the following code (on a copy of the document to be on the safe side) and see if it fixes the problem</p>
<p>Dim i As Long <br />
With ActiveDocument <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For i = 2 To .Sections.Count <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Sections(i).Footers(wdHeaderFooterPrimary).PageNumbers.RestartNumberingAtSection = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next i <br />
End With</p>
<p><br />

<blockquote>In a long document, I moved several pages of text using cut and paste method. However, the original page numbers moved also. I have tried to remove the page numbers both above and below the problem area -which it visually does. However when I reinsert
 the pagination the old numbers appear.
<p>I can correctly paginate the document by forcing it to start at the correct number but then I have to reenter this number every time I insert a page before the problem area.</p>
<p>If I enter text before the problem area so that it continues into the first problem page and/or insert a page break, the problem persists.</p>
<p>In the documentation area below the document on the left handed entry it says "Page xx" for example 193 (the precopy page number) even though the page above it says 960.&nbsp; To the right of the "Sec" I am currently on the page may be "960/1170", the 960 being
 the actual page of the document I am currently on. There is no Section Break at this point.</p>
<p>No matter what I have tried to do either in Word 2003 or the same document (on another computer) converted to Word 2007, nothing seems to work, including (in 2007), using the "Remove", "Insert", "Design" buttons.</p>
<p>Thanks for shedding any light or suggestions to resolve this issue.</p>

<h2>            Insert or embed a video into MS Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to insert and/or embed a video into a word document. I have seen how it can be done, using the objects option. I have however noticed that if I email or put the document onto a usb stick and someone else tries to run the video on their pc, it
 doesn't work anymore because it can't find the file.</p>
<p>I want to be able to have a document that contains the entire video, usually a small one, no bigger than some photographs that are inserted, and have it work without sending the original video file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve this, be sure you do&nbsp; <strong>not</strong> check the "Link to file" box in the Insert Object dialog. That will cause Word to embed the entire file in the document.</p>

<h2>            OneNote just won&#39;t finish syncing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote just refuses to finish syncing. I got the error "We haven't synced all the changes in this notebook... the section will be moved to "Misplaced Sections" at the bottom of your notebook list," but even after I deleted the misplaced sections and tried
 to re-sync and emptied the recycle bin, it still refuses to finish syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't instruct me to go through the OneNote or OneDrive troubleshooting pages - I've already tried everything here multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seemed to start after I used the onenote tool in Chrome a few times. Some of the things I clipped didn't show up. Is there some way I can look at what's trying to sync in the onenote clipper tool and clear those out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I too am having this problem, canceling/ re-syncing does not seem to help. I've tried closing the notebook and reopening and its the same issue. I'm using OneNote 2013 desktop on my PC but also want to be able to use it with my iPad Air 2 app.&nbsp;

<p>Hi clouduser2,</p>
<p>I understand that the Push Subscription is a development tool that can simply and centralize subscription administration and can receive notifications when events occur in a mailbox.</p>
<p>As our forum focuses on Office 365 business online services, we‚Äôd suggest you post the issue in our

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds like it is related to a software issue, we strongly suggest to perform a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will not remove
 anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset:<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the volume down and Power button until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
Take note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'Slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
We're just here if you have further questions.<br />

</p><p>I've been trying to connect to a group session on my laptop a couple of times and it isn't working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I'm joining the session it acts like it connects fine, but I can't see or hear anyone and the others don't have visuals or audio either. After 8-10 seconds&nbsp;the call disconnects automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My iPhone connects just fine to the same session on the same Wifi. Our WiFi's downloading speed is 240 MB/s at the moment, so there shouldn't be an issue.&nbsp;</li><li>I already removed Skype from my Macbook and I've reinstalled it but this doesn't solve the issue.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>I've Skype-version 8.10.0.4 installed, and OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 on my Macbook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Are you originally part of the group call or are you a joiner to the call? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are joining an on-going call, I'm afraid it is currently not possible as stated on this support page:

FAQ and known issues with the new Skype</a>. On the page, it's stated that:</p>

<p>Ah well, that solves the issue of when I'm joining the call on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I still can't be the one to start a group call and if there is a group call started and I accept it it&nbsp;will sometimes just refuse to connect. In both cases, Skype will still just quit after a second or ten after acting like it is connecting.</p>

<p>The issue when you&nbsp;accept an incoming call while&nbsp;engaged in&nbsp;a group call that does not connect is still part of the known issue. However, your issue when it comes to initiating a call is not part of it, and that's what we need to pay attention at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the case, I am requesting for the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it happening for a specific group that you're calling or for all of your groups? If you can try, please create a new group and test if the same issue will occur.</li><li>Are there phone number contacts added on the group or purely Skype contacts?</li></ul>

</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Okay, perfect. I'll look forward to the update that fixes that issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one group I use Skype for. I made a new one with the same people and that doesn't work either, so I tried to connect to one person (she was online) and that didn't work. None of my contacts are phone number contacts.</p>
<p>The first couple of times I tried to start the group session, it looked like it was connecting but it quit. Now Skype says that my connection is too weak, but on the tests (speedtest.net) I have currently a download speed of 33 Mb/s and an upload speed of
 11 Mb/s, and that should be enough for a session of 4 people total, right?</p>

</p><p>Here are some things we can try to narrow down the issue&nbsp;you're experiencing&nbsp;with Skype, please test them and let me know the result.</p>

<li>Use a different device using the same connection - this will help us test if the issue is specific to your MacBook.</li><li>Use a different connection - this will help us confirm that the issue has nothing to do with your Internet connection.</li><li>Turn off anti-malware software installed on your device&nbsp;- some anti-virus apps limit the connection of Skype.</li></ul>

<p>
The Microsoft Store rep said it was not possible to get the firmware update for a Lumia 950 on T-Mobile. I did not accept it.</p>
<p>
Here's what worked for me. I downloaded and installed the Windows Device Recovery Tool. Then I followed these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>I backed up the phone because this process does
 a factory reset</span></li><li><span>Turned off BitLocker on the phone.
</span></li><li><span>Turned off the Reset Protection on the phone.
</span></li><li><span>Ran Windows Device Recovery Tool on the PC.</span></li><li><span>Plugged the phone into the PC.</span></li><li><span>The Windows Device Recovery Tool recognized the phone and updated the software.
</span></li><li><span>Several times I got a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù message on the PC screen. I repeated these steps until it went away:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Leaving the phone plugged in, I would reset the
 phone by holding down the power and volume down buttons simultaneously. </span></li><li><span>Then the Windows Device Recovery Tool would not recognize the phone. I continued and manually choose my Lumia.
</span></li><li><span>I clicked through the battery warning.
</span></li><li><span>If the "failure" appeared, I would repeat.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Eventually, I got a success message.
</span></li><li><span>I set up the phone again. The Anniversary Update was now available for download.
</span></li></ol>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>I hope this helps.

            Have you downloaded SP1 for Office 2010? This is supposed to correct the problem. Otherwise, you can try the rebuilder at

    <title>Excel date autocorrect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> efk-needsanswers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel date autocorrect</h2>
                    I want to know why there is no way to prevent Excel (2013) from automatically changing a fraction to a date. If there is a way, then please do tell! Other forums have resulted in insufficient answers. It is so incredibly frustrating! I want to put 7/3
 into a cell exactly as it is (not as a date or its number value 2.33). I have tried formatting the cell to text, but instead it gives me 42070, not what I originally typed. If I wanted a date, I would put it in. If I wanted the value I would put '=' before
 the fraction. A lot of the time these auto-corrections do not help at all!

<p>Change the custom Number Format to the following (ie. remove the leading #)</p>
<p>
</p><p>?/?</p>
<p>
</p><p>then 7/3 will appear exactly as entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get into using more than one digit in the denominator or numerator then you will probably need to use additional question marks like the following to say display 43/23 otherwise Excel will round to near single digits.</p>

<h2>            Can the Outlook.com mobile web app be cached like the Forecast web app on an iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can the Outlook.com mobile web app be cached like the Forecast web app on an iPhone? You can visit&nbsp;http://forecast.io/ and it will install as a cached web app on your iPhone. It runs independent of Safari. I would like to be able to use the Outlook.com mobile
 web app this way since there is not a native app. Currently I have the Outlook.com mobile web app bookmarked on my iPhone's home screen but it opens in Safari. I would like to run it as an independent app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively is there a mail app for the iPhone that I could use to view my Outlook.com mail without downloading all of the emails. Just view them upon request like the web app.</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you'd like to know if there's an available Outlook.com app on an iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com app is not yet available for all iOS devices and you can only use the default mail app to configure your Microsoft account. If you want to visit Outlook.com via your mobile's web browser, you can just simply go to

            Well, if the SIM functions are not working (no calls, etc.) and replacing the SIM doesn't work, then as Polina points out, it's most likely a hardware problem -- probably with the SIM socket or related circuitry.&nbsp; Sounds like the unit should go back to
 the supplier for repair/replacement.

<h2>            Problem with Referencing Formula</h2>
                    <p>How should this be written as a result of a recent change I made?&nbsp; We placed a macro in the workbook to automatically delete blank rows, but it messes up the formula I made&nbsp;in cell I12 copied down through I36 as seen below.&nbsp; Can this be written somehow to
 only reference cells down to just above the blank cell in column B?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Example - If after blank&nbsp;rows have been deleted there is only data in column B12:B22 then it would see the blank in B23 and only include cells I12:I22 respectively.</p>
