<h2>            Spelunky on Xbox One won&#39;t allow us to sign in guests&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Can you please fix this? On Xbox 360 this game is allowed to have guests but on Xbox One it won't give us this option. Other games like TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT 2 allow the use of guests on Xbox One so this must be game specific. Spelunky is more fun when using guests so could you please update it so that we will be able to do it?</p>

    <title>Unable to install Windows 8.1 Mail App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flatbread  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Windows 8.1 Mail App</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason my Windows 8.1 mail, calendar and contact apps stopped working. I than accidentally deleted them, but now I'm unable to get the back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the App Store, under my apps, the Mail App is displayed as bought, but not installed on this pc. When I click it, it says I'm the owner and I can install the app. When I click install, I get a message the app is installed, but it isn't. About a second
 later, the text changes back to say that I' the owner and can install the app, but no install button. If I go back or reload the page, the install button reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried resetting the store with WSReset.exe. On another account, the app works without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to reinstall this app? Without losing all my data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the troubleshooter before, but without any luck so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what I did to day is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I restored the "windowscommunicationapps" folders in de WindowsApps folder, the Mail app reappeared in my account as Not Installed. I tried installing again with the same problems as before (windows notified my that the app was installed, but it wasn't
 or at least couldn't be found anywhere). I also tried this again after running the troubleshoot app with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with most apps in the WindowsApps folder, there are multiple folders for each app. For the windowscommunicationapps, I had three (I replaced the key at the end, as I'm not sure if that is a personal key):</p>
<p>
</p><p>microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_2014.515.1007.2079_neutral_~_1abcde2f3ghij</p>
<p>microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.5.9600.20498_x64__1abcde2f3ghij</p>
<p>microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.5.9600.20498_neutral_comm.language-nl_1abcde2f3ghij</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only with one of them (I believe it is the x64 one) in the WindowsApps folder the app was recognised in my account. For the other two it didn't recognise the app in my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing still gave the Installation error described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with the first two folders together in the WindowsApp folder, I was able to get a little bit further. After installing the Mail, Calendar and People tiles actually reappeared on my start screen, albeit completely blank (only the name of the app/tile
 was displayed in the lower left corner). in the Store it now says that "I have this app"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicking the tile, I got a notification from Windows that the app couldn't be opened with a link to the Store. In the store I got a message that the app needed repair. But after the repair, the tiles are still empty and the app can't be opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few attempts to repair the app, it finally worked and it's all working again now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks for the replies!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I too am having problems viewing images on my Finepix HS50. The computer shows the folder but when opened, it says this folder is empty. I connected my camera to another computer running Windows 8.1 and everything is visible. I have checked all the bullet
 points you have made in your response. I have installed the appropriate software, including updates. The images are still visible in the camera, but not on my computer running Windows 10. This looks like a Windows 10 issue. I can view and upload images from
 my Samsung phone and from my Panasonic Lumix camera. Please advise.</p>

<h2>            Customizing music folder header columns</h2>
                    
<p>I have a single drive dedicated to all music and audio files. I want to create an Explorer template that is assigned to all sub folders/sub folders/etc - all the way down to the last sub folder. I have gone to the music root drive, set up the columns I want
 (title, album, rating, genre, beats per min, etc.), then right click on the drive, select properties/customize, select Music and 'Also apply this template to all music'.&nbsp; Result - no changes.</p>
<p>Do I have to modify the Music template somewhere to get the results I want? Surely, I don't need to do this folder by folder!</p>

<p><span>Hi deputydog65,</span></p>
<p><span>Applying Music template to all folders in folder properties will not add the columns you added in one of the folders. It will just add the default
 template and you will have to manually which columns should appear in each folder and you cannot do it once for all the folders. This is by design.</span></p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem updating my computer. The problem started a copule of weeks ago when windows update askes to restart the computer to install some updates. I restarted the machine and left home for a while.&nbsp; When i back after around six hours, i found the
 computer still stuck at shoutdown logo and showing installing update stuck at 30%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I force shotdown and start the computer then I found that there was no space in drive C:. So, i did a disk cleanup and run cc cleaner to get some space.</p>
<p>when i start update again , WU keep showing error 80080005. I get the fixing tool to fix this problem . after that i got a new error 80070002. So i did the mentioned solutions to fix this problem with the hot fix KB947821. After this fix , Windows update
 is keep checking for update forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to do SFC /scannow , but it ends with the following message : " windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation ".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;installed a new 256GB SSD and cloned my system to it to try to do repair install , but&nbsp;it asked to restart&nbsp;the computer and get the latest windows update?</p>
<p>

<p>Processor : i7-2670QM </p>
<p>RAM : 16GB </p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replay, unfortunately after applying all the methods above the problem still existing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first method took around 20 hours&nbsp;for detecting problem and it seems running forever, so I abort the first method and started the second method which was not helpful since I cant see any installed update at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third method at some steps it take a long time when I search for updates, I leave it for more than 5 to 6 hours with no results. When I reached the final steps in the third method, the error 080070002 started to appear again when searching for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope if there are other options to solve this issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response and keeping the status updated. I appreciate the troubleshooting you tried in the computer.</p>

</p><p>You are experiencing this problem because of system corruptions on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have windows 7 installation disc with you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform inplace upgrade on the computer to repair the corrupted files on the computer:</p>

            <p>Hi Moble,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. I am sorry for the delay in the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download and run System update Readiness Tool which would fix the issues with the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20858</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't help, I suggest you to perform a in place upgrade on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system.
<br />
Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below link to know how to perform inplace upgrade o&nbsp; the computer:</p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should<strong>get them for at least the video card and the monitor</strong> and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor
 or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.

<h2>            Skype &#38; Microsoft account</h2>
                    I have alwas used Skype with my iPhone without any problem. This morning when I opened the App, I was requested to log in with my Microsoft data, which I did. Since then, each time I open Skype, it automatically shuts down after 2 seconds, i.e., I cannot
 use it anymore. Can anybody help solve this?

            Unfortunately this does not help me, because since I registered with my Microsoft account, when I open Skype I immediately access it without login (I may have checked the box for my password to be remembered). Now my Skype App is useless.

            I now desinstalled Skype from my device and reinstalled it. I was asked again to log in with my Microsoft acvount (no option for the Skype account) but it seems to work.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built a new PC a few days ago and bought Windows 10 to go with it. I'm also trying to use
<span>Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000 which works fine with the Windows camera app but is super dark in skype. I don't exactly know the version of skype I'm running (will check when i get home) but I know it's the integrated version
 in Win 10. I think it's up to date since I installed Windows about 2 weeks ago and I'm&nbsp;</span>regularly updating it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically i have the same issue than what previous comments discribed. Apparently, Skype is indeed the only program where the image is dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution for this issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 WIRED controller not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baracoda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 WIRED controller not working.</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently discovered that my WIRED xbox 360 controller is not working, every time i plug it in to my 360 it blinks twice. once as player 1 and 4, then all 4 lights. after it has finished flashing the controller will NOT work and just acts if it has
 no power.<br />
i tried plugging my WIRED controller into my pc with windows 7 ( i have used it countless times) and what i get is a message saying that the usb device has malfunctioned.<br />
<br />
i am however able to play with my wireless controller for now. but i dont enjoy using it.<br />
<br />
could someone PLEASE help me?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WIRED CONTROLLER.<br />
<br />
i have seen countless threads which people say to sync it. but its WIRED, WIRED, WIRED.<br />
<br />
NO BATTERIES. MICROSOFT MADE. BLACK.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Baracoda</p>

<p>Have you tried plugging the controller into a different USB port on your console? If it works in a different usb port, then the one port that you originally tried is bad. However, from the information provided, it seems likely your controller itself has
 malfunctioned. If you just recently bought it, you could try to return it to the store. If it's in the warranty period, you can go to XBox's online service center and request a repair here: myservice.xbox.com. &nbsp;If the controller is not under warranty, the
 advisable thing to do would be to buy a new one.</p>

<p>As both the Xbox 360 and PC are unable to use the controller it sounds like something has worked itself free inside the controller. If that is the case, a new 360 wired controller would be needed.
</p>
<p>If possible, borrow one from a friend first and make sure your Xbox 360 can connect with it before you do just so you are certain a new controller will solve your problem.</p>

<p>How old is your controller? If you have had it for a long time and use it frequently it may have gone into disrepair from wear-and-tear. You may need a new controller. (My Play and charge battery pack died recently)</p>

<p>My wired 360 controller did the same thing and after several hours of inspecting and tampering it ended up being the end of the controller wire that plugs into the break a way extension, so I cut it off and wired (color matched) an old USB end on and voila,
 like new. &nbsp; Hope this helps someone. </p>

            <p>Just to help you understand better.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fan is not turning on and off.&nbsp; It is changing speed.&nbsp; It normally runs at a lower speed which is all but inaudible, but speeds up when the system senses heat has risen to the point that more air is needed to cool the processor and other heat producing
 components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This higher speed is a good thing, as long as there is a reason that is like yours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Video uses a lot of internal computer resources that produce heat.&nbsp; If it only happens coincident to that activity, that is a good thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a desktop computer, there are things you can do to reduce this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me know if your IS a desktop, and I can provide suggestions to you.</p>

    <title>Lost Favorites after upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpawl1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Favorites after upgrade</h2>
                    Last night (30Sept17) Windows 10 updates itself. Today I open Edge and it acts like this is a new install - Welcome, Get Started. I cannot find my favorites anywhere. The only option I find is to import favorites from Internet Explorer. Only problem with
 that is I have been running Win10 for a year so any favorites I have added in the last year are not in Explorer. Are these saved anywhere or did Microsoft do me the favor of just erasing everything for me?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really odd that your favorites in Edge disappeared after an update occurred, when all it has to do is to enhance the performance of your computer. However, we suggest that you check if it's still in the favorites folder on your computer. Follow these
 steps to locate the favorites folder:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows icon + R on your keyboard, then type in "AppData".</li><li>Once done, navigate to this location, "<strong>Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\MicrosoftEdge\User\Default\DataStore\Data\nouser1\120712-0049\Favorites</strong>".</li><li>If your favorites are still on the folder, import it to your Edge browser.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028355/windows-import-favorites-in-microsoft-edge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to
<strong>import favorites in Microsoft Edge</strong>. On the drop down, choose "<strong>Import from a file</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback.</p>

<p>I have been backing up my system on a weekly basis since I set the unit up which was back in early 2008.&nbsp; I have Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; For the last couple of weeks I have been getting this message<br />
The backup did not complete successfully.<br />
A shadow copy provider had an unexpected error while trying to process the specified operation. (Ox8004230F).<br />
What is causing this and how do fix it?&nbsp; Also how do I continue to backup my system if the system will not respond.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />

<p><span>Hi Sunedaz:</span></p>
<p><span><span>After looking for your error it would seem that the error “</span><span><span><strong>0x800423F0”
</strong></span></span></span><span><span>might be more to do with the ability of the backup system to see the location where you are
 backing up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are the questions I am finding on the error: is the “Back Up Drive”
 connected?, it the backup drive full or close to full?, is the backup location on the main drive (if so this will cause this error), is the backup drive running on a fast enough interface to handle the speed?, and is the backup drive partitioned and set to
 “allow Compressed files”?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please check this information and get back to us. Though you have been
 backing this up for a long time and there have been no problems, leads me to thank there is something with the drive, settings in the system that might have changed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check it out and let us know.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for your post.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Shared Folder Not Showing</h2>
                    <p>I worked around this with a hyperlink on another computer using Windows 10 that I have now deactivated, now have a new computer and am having the same issue.&nbsp; I have used troubleshooters and explored old posts and tried most even going into

<p>
</p><p>From my two year old primary computer I can see other computers on my network.&nbsp; All have Windows 10.&nbsp; I though cannot see my primary computer from them.&nbsp; On my other computers I can though make a desktop hyperlink of "\\computer name\folder" to the shared
 folder and access this primary in that way.</p>
<p>

            If you perform a Google search on your error message, you will find a few good ideas that have many happy endings (this seems to be a relatively common issue).&nbsp; There is even a Microsoft KB article about it, but depending on several unknown factors, it
 may not work for you:<br />
<br />

<br />
There are other ideas on the Internet that seem to be effective when the MS article doesn't work out.<br />
<br />
It is too bad that we know absolutely nothing about your system, but that is the way it goes around here.<br />
<br />
If we knew more about your system and what you have, you would probably be done by now!<br />

<h2>            Minecraft Xbox One edition stuck in trial mode</h2>
                    I understand that minecraft xbox one edition isnt available for online purchase.... but weve had this game physically for about 2 years. My son was playing all day, but just now he went to open it back up and its locked on the trial screen. It wants you
 to download the new one... which we have, but he prefers his old one and all the worlds in it and his friends all prefer the old one. It wont even offer you the option to get to the screen with the works and mini games. It says the trial expired... but we
 have the game. The disc is in the console. Why wont it let him play???

<p>Hello Nikki!</p>
<p>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game directly from the disc? Any worlds or progress should return when the console syncs back up to the cloud after the reinstallation. Give it a try and let us know with a reply if that helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out!</p>

<h2>            Forcing retail end-users to jump through these hoops</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/slow-boot/de94caf3-9b65-4601-9949-a7e8ed9d62ee" title="Split from this thread">

<p>
</p><p>Gerry, I know you're just doing your job, and that there is a rote script that support services have to follow, so this message is mostly directed at Microsoft as a whole...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forcing retail end-users to jump through these hoops, when the problem is clearly widespread and easily reproducible in a &nbsp;lab is unacceptable. The problem occurs with a bone stock clean install, so it's pointless to keep asking people about their system
 logs, when it can be re-created in 15 minutes in Redmond. Now, if somebody from MS has done this, and would like to chime in with "Yes, we're seeing it", or "No, we're struggling to re-produce the problem", that would be peachy, because it would at least show
 some respect to the people who have taken the time to post in this forum. My time is valuable, and I'm not spending another minute looking at system logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail end-users should not be expected to behave like beta-testers. Windows is going to be in serious trouble if Vulkan takes off. Directx is literally the only feature that keeps me and numerous others from switching to Linux full time.</p>

</p><p>Nobody is being forced to jump through these hoops. If you do not want help with a problem you simply walk on by.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most problems solved by examining Event Viewer log files are resolvable by the user with the problem. However, interpreting log files can be problematic and that is why I offer to help. Few solutions&nbsp;to problems I resolve require assistance from programmers
 in Redmond. It is simply not practical&nbsp;to expect programmers in Redmond to resolve every user problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems mostly occur from the interaction between the operating system and third party software and / or hardware. There are so many variables that it is not simply a matter of reproducing the error in Redmond. If it were we would have error free computers
 in rapid time. Even after extensive field testing of Windows 10 pre-release and a year since release there still are multiple bugs in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;a user&nbsp;approaches Microsoft for help that is a pay for Support service. This is expensive so many do not want to pay for the privilege. Help through these forums is free and informative.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I appreciate the offer, but I guess it might help most if you would acknowledge that my computer is not "broken", and this is not a problem that any computer repair shop can fix. It's clearly an issue
 with Storage Spaces that didn't exist until the Anniversary Update, as has been demonstrated by myself and many others in the forum, who after many combined hours of troubleshooting, noted that the problem vanishes when storage spaces are disabled, and returns
 on a bone stock install when a storage space is enabled. This can only be fixed by Microsoft in future OS updates, but it's a moot point now for me. I really liked storage spaces for a number of reasons, but have already migrated back to a hardware level RAID
 1 array, and everything is working well again. It's really frustrating, because I believe Storage Spaces is one of the better features added to Windows over the years.</span></p>

            <p>This latest update has been horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was pleased with 10 up to this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my programs worked great, I had it setup the way I wanted and life was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then comes the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Breaks crucial programs like QuickBooks that I had to shell out 250 bucks to get an updated version for, reset all my settings that I had spent hours fine tuning and then broke the Windows Edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC I'm using is less than a year old and came with Windows 10 so it wasn't an upgrade to start with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm supposed to spend countless hours trying to fix what the update broke?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a PC user but also have the first MacBook (the white ones) and guess what. It still works great and is using their latest operating system. The only thing I ever had to do with it was add more RAM so it could run the latest. This laptop was purchased
 in 2008 and still works just dandy. How many Windows based PC's work after 8 years? I can tell you I've gone trough at least 5 Windows based PC's in that time frame I guess because I'm a glutton for punishment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This latest update looks to me like it wasn't even beta tested for any length of time. They ran it through a few tests and launched. All the postings on this board and around the Internet are testament to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is how you lose customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going to break the next time they update? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my PC to earn a living this latest update has cost me time and money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seriously considering just getting an iMac and be done with it. Now that most of the Adobe programs I use are cloud based and offer both PC and Mac versions, I no longer am locked into a PC like I was before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that Apple is perfect by far, but at least their computers work after an update and my 8 year old original MacBook is proof to me.</p>

            If it's demonstrable on a clean install, I'd put it into the feedback app. &nbsp;It's not a critical problem that would justify and out of band update (no data loss/security problem), just an extreme annoyance. &nbsp;Microsoft takes the problem reports seriously,
 and of course they use this system too so it's probably been reported internally anyway. &nbsp;At the very least you'd assume that the team that creates the feature will notice the problem (or the reports of problems) and add it to their to-do list. In the meantime,
 just work around it (as you did, or otherwise by using sleep instead of a cold boot for example).

            I bought a Asus G1 "gaming PC" in 2006 that came with Windows Vista (the model was originally built for XP, but I got one of the first off the factory that shipped with Vista). &nbsp;I upgraded it to 7 almost immediately (2 months later). &nbsp;Obviously 7 performed
 better than Vista by far, even on the same hardware. &nbsp;Like youk, I also did add RAM later... and I continued to upgrade it from Vista to 7, to 8, to 8.1, to Windows 10, and now both the 1511 and 1607 Anniversary Update. &nbsp;That's 4+ full operating systems, going
 on a decade of use, and it's still going strong. I love that laptop.
