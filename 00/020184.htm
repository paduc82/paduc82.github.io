<p>There are a couple of things that may cause this:</p>
<p>If you open the document the active printer is different from the one that was active when the document was saved, the layout of the document may have changed to suit the active printer.</p>

    <title>Differences between MS Healt, HealthVault and MSN Health &#38; Fitness - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Differences between MS Healt, HealthVault and MSN Health &#38; Fitness</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I have Lumia 930 and use MSN Health &amp; Fitness. Could anybody explain me the&nbsp;differences between Microsoft Health (https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-health/), MSN Health &amp; Fitness (http://www.msn.com/en-us/health)&nbsp;and HealthVault (https://www.healthvault.com/)?
 I don't have Microsoft Band, just my Windows Phone Lumia 930.</p>
<p>I use MSN Health &amp; Fitness to track my activity (runs, steps, food). But I don't see any history on the web portal, but the mobile app has long daily history available. And it shows information that my health data will no longer sync with my HealthVault
 account and will now sync to the new cloud store. Which cloud store?</p>
<p>But when I want to access Microsoft Health (Dashboard), it shows that I need MS Band. And the mobile app MS Health&nbsp;doesn't work without MS Band either.</p>
<p>And finally HealtVault doesn't show anything, empty history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also Xbox One and use Xbox Fitness. Where can I see the history of my workouts? Now it should synchronize the exercise routines with MS Health, but how can I access it without Band?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it confusing. Can I use MS Health without MS Band? Or where can I see my history (runs, steps, food) and add for example lunch in addition to the mobile application MSN Health &amp; Fitness?</p>

            <p>MS Health only controls the Band and shows Band data.&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot use it without a Band and it will not integrate with Health &amp; Fitness.&nbsp; It will send data to HealthVault.&nbsp; It does not have any sort of food logging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Health &amp; Fitness works with either the Windows Phone app or Windows 8 "Metro" app, and yes they share data.&nbsp; Does not integrate with HealthVault although I swear it used to.&nbsp; Does not integrate with MS Band.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HealthVault: The data repository.&nbsp; Integrates with a lot of applications and devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, as far as I can tell, there is no way to push food data into HV, but you can (painfully) input it into HV.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was right. I don't understand why is it so complicated... Microsoft said that Health will be the&nbsp;universal health platform. And on the health website is written:
</p>
<p>"Microsoft Health is a cloud-based service that helps you live healthier by providing actionable insights based on data gathered from the fitness devices and apps that you use every day. Activity-tracking devices like the new Microsoft Band, smart watches,
 and mobile phones plus services like RunKeeper or MyFitnessPal connect easily to Microsoft Health. Using this fitness data and our Intelligence Engine in the cloud, Microsoft Health provides valuable, personal insights so you can reach your fitness goals."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it looks like it's not true, because I cannot use it without Band. And even I cannot access my fitness data from Xbox One Fitness...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand it and I find it weird... Hope somebody can explain it how to use it. How to best use MS health platform (generally speaking&nbsp;- MS Health, MSN Health&amp;Fitness, HealthVault) without MS Band, but with Xbox One Fitness and Windows Phone 8.1
 Lumia 930.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Since they are two different entities, I bet it's time to write off MSN Health &amp; Fitness as any kind of health tracking app. I mean Microsoft Health Vault is no longer accessible via this app. I actually liked the information that was available on my laptop,
 tablet or phone. Oh well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to try using one of the phone apps, like mapmyrun, etc. AND see if you can register or sign up on the webpage and then connect between Health and other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have a band and activated it through Microsoft Health app on my phone, I cannot experiment with other apps or devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website implies from the graphic that Microsoft Health requires a fitness app to connect to devices like a smartphone or wearable.&nbsp;</p>

            I cannot use it without Band :( I have RunKeeper account, but I cannot connect it to MS Health. And the same with MapMyRun. The only way how to connect it is through MS Health app (here it is
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/tiles/connected-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/tiles/connected-apps</a>), but I cannot start MS Health app without MS Band... So I HAVE to have MS Band, and I cannot use MS Health platform without Band. That is REALLY bad :(

            I bought the band ONLY because it's more than a fitness band. I don't know if I'm having a blast with it but it's been worth it and at a price point lower than fitbit &amp; others. Fitness &amp; connectivity in a wearable with Cortana.

            <p>It's not so easy for me :) As you can see from my english, I'm not from the US. But my friend will bring me one Band in June when he is going to visit us. So I have to be patient :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I mean is that Microsoft should consolidate and simplify&nbsp;these services and MS Health should be available to all, not just for a Band owners. This is my opinion.</p>

            <p>Oh. Most, if not all, of the advanced features are supposedly only available in the U.S. These are the reasons why I bought the band and not a competitor. Additionally, The band is the only one that I know of compatible with the Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you mean though. A little more research leads me to believe that Microsoft Health started as a synchronization app and became more than that due to its success. I think it is so undeveloped that MS is looking for developers who will help
 bring it along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, your english is fine.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have come across the article earlier on, and the article indicates that it is possible to receive email notifications on the band from all email accounts. But that isn't the case, and that is also what you tell me. So that article on the Microsoft support
 site should be corrected, it is very disinformative.</p>
<p>
<strong>Manage notifications for specific email accounts</strong>
</p><p>If you have several email accounts on your phone, you can manage which of them delivers notifications to your Band. For example, you might want to get notifications from your personal accounts but turn off your work account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can manage email notifications on your phone through your phone‚Äôs Notification Center. Check the documentation that came with your phone or go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website to learn how to manage notifications.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I replied as if this thread were "mine". I have a similar question in this support forum, hence the "owner"-like reply. Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still can¬¥t get any other email notifications on my band than those from my Microsoft account. No way to get email notifications from my work account, which is the only email I use for emailing.</p>

            Try these basic troubleshooting steps first and check after each step and please update me. (Please note your data is stored on the cloud, hence you won't be losing data)
<br />
<br />1. Reset the Skype
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Skype &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and reinstall Skype app (Note - You will not lose any Skype data because of this)
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below, paste into Powershell &gt; Enter 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage

<br />Copy and paste below and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù}

<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</p>
</li><li>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DVD-ROM, DVD-RAM, BD-ROM, etc. drivers come with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the latest Windows 10, you have the latest DVD drivers installed. You don't need any other drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine ( shown below ) is a BD-HD-DVD-ROM-RAM Re-writable Drive and it runs on Windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40807fa7-9141-49f0-ae08-04da7649bdb2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40807fa7-9141-49f0-ae08-04da7649bdb2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to play DVD movie disks, you need a program, either free or payable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>this worked for me, update was stuck at 31% for 2 days until this made it work.</p>
<p>From the WinX Menu, open Command Prompt (Admin). Type the following one after the other and hit Enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>net stop wuauserv</p>
<p>net stop bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will stop the Windows Update related Services.</p>
<p>Next browse to the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder and delete all the files and folders inside. Press Ctrl+A to Select All and then Delete.</p>
<p>If the files are in use, and you are unable to delete some files, restart your device. After rebooting, run the above commands again. Now you will be able to delete the files from the mentioned Software Distribution folder. There were 2 files I could not
 delete so I continued on anyway.</p>
<p>After you have emptied this folder, you may restart your computer and run windows update.</p>

            I have had the same problem in the last few builds. As a work around, try creating a local account with admin privileges and upgrade to Build 14251 from there. If it works, log out and log back in with your Microsoft account. This worked for me, I reported
 the issue on Microsoft Feedback, so hopefully it will eventually be fixed.

            I had this problem as well as many others. &nbsp;I opted to skip 14251 and when 14257 came out yesterday, I updated to that without issue.

<p>Let me just say I too was stuck on 11102 with the constant rollback.&nbsp; I then tried installing 14257 and it too rolled back to 11102.&nbsp; It would get to 75% Drivers etc. then reboot then immediately rollback when it should have jumped over to the part of setting
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give step by step what I did today and believe it or not it finally went back through Checking for update and finding the latest and remember I was stuck on 11102 and trying to get now to 14257 since 14251 was a complete failure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I did is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) All settings\Update &amp; Security\Recover\Advanced startup Restart now</p>
<p>2.) Troubleshooting</p>
<p>3.) Pick #4 which is Safe Mode</p>
<p>4.) Once in safe mode I deleted these folders ($WINDOWS.~BT, Recovery, Config.msi from Root of C:) - I then proceeded to delete (SoftwareDistribution) folder from C:\Windows</p>
<p>5.) Open up Administrative Command Prompt and type net stop cryptsvc and then proceed to C:\Windows\System32 and delete (catroot2) folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>6.) Went into C:\Windows\Temp and deleted everything within this folder and also went to C:\Users\Yourusername\AppData\Local\Temp and deleted everything within this folder.</p>
<p>7.) Reboot</p>
<p>8.) Let everything load up normally within Windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>9.) In "Ask me anything" type disk and pick Disk Cleanup tool</p>
<p>10.) Let it do its thing but then pick System Files and it will do the same thing all over again, this time within the window select everything and pick delete.&nbsp; It will do its thing again and pick (YES).&nbsp; Once it completes.</p>
<p>11.) Go to Windows Update again and let it check.&nbsp; It should now and finally do everything properly and correctly.</p>
<p>12.) Reboot and keep your fingers crossed.&nbsp; Everything here finally worked and allowed the latest version to install without issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This took me from release of 14251 up until today and after the failure once again of 14257 but now is (FINALLY) - ALL GOOD.&nbsp; Hope this helps.&nbsp;

            I had thesame problem. I made a local account with adminstrator rights. And logged in with this account the update was good. Problem solved. Of course log out the local account and sign in my MS account after the upgrade.<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable IE11, but not remove it as is part of the Windows 10 (for PCs) operating system.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Calendar Response Option&#58;  Decline &#40;but leave on calendar with a unique format&#41;</h2>
                    It would be great if Microsoft offered an additional response option to a meeting invite in the calendar function of Outlook. &nbsp;Currently, the options are: &nbsp;Decline, Tentative and Accept. &nbsp;I would like an option which is "Decline but Keep." &nbsp;In this way,
 meetings I have "declined" stay on my calendar in case my schedule changes, I can decide to "accept" an invite I had previously "declined." &nbsp;Currently, once you "decline" a meeting invite, it is removed from your calendar and you have no easy recollection
 to which meetings you "declined." Also, if the meeting changes, you are still kept in the loop and your schedule may now allow you to attend.

<h2>            Bookings Calendar  &#38; ical &#47; Office 365 Calendar -Will they work together</h2>
                    I want to use the Bookings app but I'm not sure if it will mark my time in the booking area as unavailable for scheduled meetings I manually input on in my calendar via iPhone or Office 365. Is there a way to link the two calendars or will I have to solely
 use the bookings app for my calendar.

            <p>Thanks for the info. There is hope. I've tried everything and can't seem to make them completely link. &nbsp;Somehow there were 24 appointments scheduled for 6pm tomorrow (these shouldn't be there and were all blank) &nbsp;When I deleted them, I did receive calendar
 notifications on my cell phone and they were showing up in my Outlook Calendar. &nbsp;But when I go to the bookings page, it just shows available per the open business hours. I only assigned myself to the one meeting type available and I just can't figure out where
 the disconnect is. I've even started a new calendar just to see if I missed something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>What happened if you create a new calendar? Does the booking page still shows the available time period?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may need to confirm the following for further analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The detailed timeline. You add the booking first or join the calendar item first?</p>
<p>2. The detailed steps to add yourself to the booking item.</p>

            <p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before deleting all the info, as an admin, you can export the calendar data to another user mailbox via steps below:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Search-Mailbox -identity <em>user</em> -SearchQuery kind:meetings -LogLevel Full -LogOnly -TargetMailbox
<em>user@contoso.com&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to start the Bookings fresh in Office 365. You can contact the booking organizer to remove you from the staff list to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only means that the format of the photo that you are trying to open is not supported by your phone that's why it is asking you to install a certain app for you to open it. You may try to download third party app from the Store for you to be able to open
 pictures with that certain format, please click this link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>There is no way to add your new phone after its initial startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are already using your new phone, then do a reset by going to settings - about - reset. When you turn it back on, sign in using your windows phone Microsoft account and that will make your phone show up on windowsphone.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the phone starts after the reset you have to enter the account information the first time through the initial setup.</p>

            Actually there is, you can do a forced backup on the phone if it didn't show up in the first place.&nbsp; If you deleted your phone then you can't re-add it, but if it never showed up the first place there's a couple things you can do to make it show up.

<h2>            Errors when opening multiple Excel workbooks</h2>

<div><em><strong>0riginal Post:</strong> </em><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>I'm running Windows 7 &amp; Office 2010 on a pretty new Dell Latitude; the problem occurs when I try to open multiple workbooks.
<p>When I have several Excel windows open and try to open another workbook in an existing Excel window, I get: "Excel cannot complete this task with available resources.&nbsp; Choose less data or close other applications."&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click "OK" I get the following: "Excel found unreadable content in 'filename.xlsx.'&nbsp; Do you want to recover the contents of this workbook?&nbsp; If you trust the source of the workbook, click Yes."&nbsp; Clicking yes causes the first error message to come up
 6-7 times, then I get: "The workbook cannot be opened or repaired by Microsoft Excel because it is corrupt."</p>
<p>The only way I've found to open the workbook is to open it in a new Excel window.&nbsp; Even if I try to open in a window with no workbooks open, I'll get the same train of error messages.</p>
<p>No relative names, no file sharing, no links to other workbooks, all the workbooks are pretty small and relatively simple. This seemed to start when I upgraded from Office 2007 to Office 2010.&nbsp; I've tried repairing the installation.&nbsp; I had no problems opening
 multiple workbooks with Office 2007.</p>
<p>Help?</p>
<p><em><strong>Received the following answer:</strong> </em></p>

<div><strong>I'm still having the same problem.</strong> <br />
</div>
<div>Repairing the Office 2010 installation did NOT solve the problem; I also uninstalled and reinstalled Office 2010 but I am still having the same problem.&nbsp; The Office14/XLSTART folder is empty.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Should I just go back to Office 2007?</div>
<div>Can anyone help? <br />

<p>I think it's time to go back to Office 2007--I didn't have this problem with that version and the problem opening workbooks far outweighs any of the improvements (some of which are not improvements at all) in Office 2010.</p>

            You might want to check the virtual (swap) file on your computer. If it is a fixed, low value, the swap file may be running out of room. Try increasing the size of the swap file or click the allow windows to manage radio button. Might need a restart after
 that, but it is worth looking into. Also, how much RAM memory does the computer have?

<p>A couple questions for you, if you please.</p>
<p>1-Exactly how many is "multiple workbooks"?</p>
<p>2-Exactly "how" are you trying to open them......programatically, or Recent Workbooks, or how?</p>
<p>3-Does the problem show up "always" when you try to open the second, or third or fourth etc...</p>
<p>4-Is it always trying to open the same workbook that is where the trouble shows up?</p>
<p>Just trying to isolate the problem a little more.......</p>

<p>The computer has 4MB of RAM</p>
<p>1- Multiple workbooks is 6-10</p>
<p>2-It doesn't seem to matter how I try to open them: Recent Workbooks, double-clicking an email attachment, once it starts doing this the only way I can open another workbook is to open another instance of Excel from Start/Programs</p>
<p>3-No, it seems to come up suddenly: everything will be working fine, working with several workbooks open in just one or two Excel windows, then the problem starts and doesn't stop until I restart the machine.&nbsp; Once I restart, Excel will work fine for a little
 while and then the problem will start again.</p>
<p>4-There is no pattern as far as which workbook will trigger the problem: sometimes it's an attachment, sometimes it's a file from my recent workbooks list or elsewhere on my computer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help--this is driving me crazy.</p>

<p>I dunno Dan.......obviously if you could do it in 2007 and can't in 2010 the porwes to be must have changed something......we just don't seem to be able to identify what........about the only thing left would be to ry it on a different computer running 2010...........but
 for sanity, and to get your work done, you may have to use 2007 for this feature.&nbsp; Personally, I have several versions of Office on my computer, albiet for a different reason, but nothing saying you can't have both 2007 and 2010 if you want.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 and Office 2013</h2>
                    My Windows 8 computer updated to 8.1, but now I can't open any of my Microsoft Office 2013 components.&nbsp; When I click open the circles and then does nothing.&nbsp; When I try troubleshooting it says that WinWord is not compatible.&nbsp; Does that even make sense?&nbsp;
 And how do I get into Word.&nbsp; I'm taking online classes and I need to get into my files as well as do other writing for class.&nbsp; Any help?<br />

<p>Hi Tanya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is interesting. There could be a few possible reasons why this is going on. This could be because of the configuration settings in Outlook. For us to narrow down the issue, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which email provider are you using, is it Google, Outlook or Yahoo, among others?</li><li>Can you tell us how Outlook was configured on your device?</li><li>Which type of account are you using, is it an Exchange, POP or IMAP?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, you may check this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-an-email-account-to-Outlook-for-PC-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> as a reference on how to setup your email
 account in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Why is Microsoft interfering with my email when I&#39;m right in the middle of it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This has happened several times previously. Right in the middle of an email, a horizontal column appears at the top of my screen with Microsoft informing me that for "my security" the do this frequently... and that is, Sign me Out so I can sign myself &nbsp;back
 in!! &nbsp;That is not only annoying, but unnecessary. I know who I am!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, it would not let me continue with my email, and in the &nbsp;chaos my email disappeared!!! I am so mad. I could not find it in drafts (where you would think it would go), not in the trash.... nothing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I had to start all over again, and the momentum was lost. &nbsp;This is just plain rude. And, don't anyone from Microsoft try to say it's for MY security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop doing this to me!</p>

<div id="LastReply" class="thread-message thread-message-enus"
     pagepos="1" msgpos="1" msgsection="Replies"
     translated-to=""
     translated-from="">
            
            <div data-bi-id="message-username-image-link" class="message-user-image message-username-image-link circular-display avatar-size-extrasmall" role="img"
<h3> oceanlady805  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I was about 3/4 of the way through it and it was at least a page long. &nbsp;I even clicked on "Save Draft" because I have been kicked off before.... But, there was no draft saved and nothing in the trash. I just don't get it.
