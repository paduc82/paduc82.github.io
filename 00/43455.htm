<h2>            Windows 10 Pro&#58; File History still broken after anniversary update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>File History is still broken!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated Windows 10 Pro to ver. 1607.&nbsp; I foolishly tried adding/excluding File History folders using the new style UI, hoping that Microsoft finally, finally fixed the issue.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; File History still adds folders back in that I removed, and others
 I never wanted.&nbsp; It's got a mind of its own and is determined to back up my 6TB media drive to my 1TB File History drive, instead of just my important documents like I try to tell it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's turned off now.&nbsp; I did have it working before the "update" after much trial and error, fighting the very buggy UI every step.&nbsp; I really don't want to spend another several hours trying to get this feature to work as advertised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is Microsoft going to fix this?&nbsp; Or is the plan to just quietly drop File History without notice in favor of some other new scheme in a future update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked my File History drive.&nbsp; It was full after backing up media files I didn't want, so I told it to delete everything except the most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALMOST ALL OF MY BACKUP DATA IS NOW GONE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a good work-around, that actually works reliably?&nbsp; A backup solution that doesn't reliably back up everything as expected is worse than nothing at all.&nbsp; File History is now turned off, and I'm manually copying folders until I can set up some third
 party solution.</p>

            <p>The plain fact is, Eeshwar, that File History <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
is</span> broken, in that It backs up everything in sight, regardless of whether files have been changed or not, with the result that it fills up our hard drives exponentially with gigabights of duplicated files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had Microsoft 'Help'(?) line people admit this on the phone (July '16), who go on to say that Microsoft is working on it, but that they&nbsp;can give&nbsp;no time frame in which a solution
<em>may</em> be forthcoming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would politely suggest it is disingenuous of you to ref all sorts of 'maybe' answers, when Microsoft know perfectly well that File History is well &amp; truly broken. A much more acceptable approach commercially would be, like some of your telephone colleagues,
 to admit there's a problem &amp; give us a time frame for its likely resolution.</p>

            <p>Thank you, I couldn't have said it better myself.&nbsp; I just got around to checking back to see if there had been any progress or useful information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it's just too much to ask for Microsoft to give its customers what we really need to deal with the inevitable bugs and other varieties of software issues: some visibility into its software issue tracking database.&nbsp; If there is any way for a non-employee
 to access anything like this, please enlighten us.&nbsp; Just being able to see that an issue you're having is a known bug would be a huge time saver for customers.&nbsp; Even better would be to see the issue more precisely defined, how it's manifested, any possible
 workarounds, the priority to fix it, if any work is being done, estimated completion time, current status,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; This is the kind of thing that makes open source software really attractive in comparison.&nbsp; I can see why Microsoft or any commercial developer
 might balk at openly advertising software faults, especially faults they don't intend to fix.&nbsp; They probably won't do it until their customers firmly demand it.</p>

<h2>            Windows not recognizing blank DVDs</h2>
                    Infortunately it did not solve my problem because Shell Hardware Detection was already selected. Have searched everywhere but cannot solve the problem of blank DVDs not being recognized. However CDs are. I've spent five hours searching solutions. (Windows
 7 64bit)<br />
I removed Itunes because it caused lots of problems after installation, but that hasn't fixed the issue.<br />

            Thank you very much for your help Sandeep. <br />
I have no problems playing DVDs and no problem burning to CDs<br />
<br />
I had already followed Method 1 &amp; 2 (via the HP help &amp; Support links) before posting my query however I went through those proceedures again after reading your suggestions. I still had the same issue however I now wonder if somehow the discs were ALL faulty
 for some reason. I had used Panasonic, Sony, Emtec and Imitation - 10 different discs. Some DVD+R, some -R and some +RW. I decided to purchase even more discs however I came across one I had not tried and lo and behold it worked!!!<br />
With all the others the burning proceedure seems to be in progress and then I receive an error message telling me:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;"There was an error burning this disc. The disc may no longer be usable"<br />
<br />
The properties for each of the discs show blue (full disc) yet zero bytes.<br />
<br />
Does this mean one has to purchase about 20 discs to find one that works? Is it a fault with the discs of all makes? Or is it my system and would reinstalling the driver correct that?<br />
I did have this problem shortly after purchasing the computer and I returned an entire pack of DVDs to the store believing it was the make (Dick Smiths own brand). I didn't have any trouble with the next pack of Emtec. But now it doesn't seem to make any difference
 which brand I try. <br />
<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />

It's possible that your DVD Burner requires service or replacement.<br />

No doubt...I could be incorrect and it definitely would not <br />
be the first time but no, I'm not kidding. The intermittent <br />
behavior you describe sounds like a hardware issue to me. <br />

            Thanks for your input. I have just found a website <a href="http://computing.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
computing.net</a> - Windows 7 issues,&nbsp; in which a technician has replied to one of the very many queries on the internet about this same issue, and Tom, the technician's reply states that his system also shows the same result (start: cdfs file reader disabled)
 - and it doesn't prevent him burning or reading any discs. Perhaps it is always disabled for some reason....<br />
<br />
I inquired at the store where my computer is still under warranty and they told me I have to update Cyberlink - the software that came with my computer - (and for which I have to pay).<br />
I asked doesn't Windows provide disc burning software in my computer (HP Omni200 All in one) and he said no.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have purchased&nbsp; new DVDs - and they are working. <br />
Perhaps HP will be able to tell me if I still have to upgrade Cyberlink or not.<br />

<p>I'm sorry to say it, but I think that you've been scammed.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't make calls like that or offer such a service.&nbsp; Uninstall any software that they had you install.&nbsp; If you paid by credit card, cancel the charge immediately and consider canceling
 the card and getting a new one, since the crooks behind the scam now have your credit card information.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the complete and exact error message that you get?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Cause of this message:</span></strong><span> <br />
Some computers are designed to use a dual core processor or a coprocessor to improve performance. A coprocessor is an additional chip designed to supplement the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer. Essentially, coprocessors give added speed and efficiency
 in the way the computer handles information.<br />
<br />
On some occasions, non-standard video drivers loaded onto a computer can cause conflicts with the coprocessor, resulting in an error message. One visual indication of a problem with a corrupted driver, or a conflict between the BIOS(Basic Input Output System)
 and a driver, is the display of a yellow exclamation point next to a driver in Device Manager window.
</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
These conflicts can occur if you:<br />
1. The only option to resolve this issue is contact you <strong>product maker</strong> and get a driver or
<br />
2. Go to <strong>device manager</strong>, right click on the <strong>processor</strong>,
<strong>properties</strong> and select <strong>update drivers/click on reinstall drivers.</strong></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span>Hope this information helps. </span></p>

<p>Not really. I use (at least I am trying to) use my skype account&nbsp; name. I was used to use the old version. If I signed out the last time that I used it, to sign in again I had to use my password. Not it goes straight inside the account&nbsp;</p>

            I see. I get it now. Since you are using the older version of Skype, you can enable the auto-signin by going<span style="color: rgba(60, 64, 67, 1)">&nbsp;to Tools &gt; Options.
 Locate&nbsp;</span><strong>Sign</strong><span style="color: rgba(60, 64, 67, 1)">&nbsp;me in when&nbsp;</span><strong>Skype</strong><span style="color: rgba(60, 64, 67, 1)">&nbsp;starts
 option and check it if you want to&nbsp;</span><strong>turn</strong><span style="color: rgba(60, 64, 67, 1)">&nbsp;it on. After you're done, click the Save button to save changes.</span>

            This is the problem. In the WIN 10 version, even thought I click sign out, the program does not ask me for the password for signing in.&nbsp; Give it a try in yours (if it is a WIN 10 version) and let me know. Thanks for your help.

<h2>            Hauppauge HVR-1800 driver not installing.  9996 System does not meet requirements.</h2>
                    I see a number of folks have had similar issues, but I don't see resolutions (and the dates appear a few months back).&nbsp;
<br />
I just did an upgrade to my HP MediaCenter which was OEM Vista to Win7 Ultimate.&nbsp; In my case, the Hauppauge WinTV does not even turn up in the device listing.&nbsp; I tried removing the card, refreshing the device list with to no avail.&nbsp; I found new Win7 drivers
 on HP site...I could not get them to install as they gave me the 9996 error.&nbsp; I tried updating the chipset driver (from HP) and got the very same error message.&nbsp; Finally, I tried intalling in Safe Mode, still the same error.<br />
Is there a know resolution to this problem?

            Hey BearPause,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
The following error occurs while attempting to install an update from HP:<br />
Your system does not meet the minimum requirements for this update. Update has been cancelled (9998).<br />
The error displays when ...<br />
<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same or newer version of software is already installed (computer already has the updated software),<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The update requires certain hardware or software that is not installed on your computer (examples: keyboard replaced with a non-HP keyboard or Microsoft .NET software is not installed),<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer does not meet a certain minimum hardware or software requirement (examples: 4 GB minimum memory, 200 MB free disk space, or .NET version 2.0 required and 1.0 is installed).<br />
Usually, this error indicates the update is not needed for your computer and it should not be installed.<br />

            Thanks but I am no further ahead...<br />
<br />
I understood the error message (and my system meets and exceeds all the minimum requirements).&nbsp; Note that all worked under Vista, its just not working under Windows 7, so the only change that creates an issue is Microsoft driven.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The driver installs through Hauppauge fail with virtually the same reason (although the language of the error is more tied to device not found).<br />
<br />
I worked through HP support and the solution they are now suggesting is a clean install of Win 7.&nbsp; I see this as a drastic measure and a recommendation made when one doesnt actually understand the underlying issue and grasps at straws.&nbsp; If this is indeed the
 only (guaranteed) solution, I would prefer to see the recommendation from Microsoft along with an acknowledgement of a bug / issue / shortcoming in the upgrade approach to installation.<br />
<br />
Is this the case?

<p>The information on the HP site is not 100% correct.</p>
<p>A more detailed explanation of these errors can be found at <a href="http://the-computer-site.com/update-has-been-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://the-computer-site.com/update-has-been-cancelled</a> -- and they will be able to help you with any similar installation error.</p>
<p>In this case, error 9996 means that the installer did not recognize your hardware&nbsp; (the windows HardwareID for your device was not found in the list of HardwareIDs embedded in the installer).&nbsp; So you're installing the wrong driver</p>

<p>Hey there Gregory!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to level up in Black Ops 2.
</p>
<p>I split your post from it's original thread so that we could make sure to give this issue it's appropriate attention.</p>
<p>Now, seeing as this game is backwards compatible, can you tell me whether you're playing it on&nbsp;a 360 or a One?</p>
<p>Also, can you outline any troubleshooting steps you have already taken to try and resolving this issue on your side?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confident we can get to the bottom of this provided a little more information on the situation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<div>Hello everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have compaq cq40 606-tu, and my laptop cannot boot. The problem started since i was doing a chkdsk and the electricity suddenly shut down. (my mistake because i released the battery and just used ac power). &nbsp;After that i tried to turned on my
 laptop and it worked, but the next daythe laptop cannot boot, it went until "starting windows" screen, then bsod and restart again. The laptop then gave me two choice:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Startup repair (using program from compaq, only command prompt)</div>
<div>2. Start Windows Normally (restart again)</div>
<div><br />

<div>I searched the internet for solution&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. Used Sfc /scannow and chkdsk /f /r</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. Used windows 7 disc installation and used 'repair your pc option'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But they did not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;When I tried to boot using win7 disc installation, i got the problem details</div>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to perform System Restore from Windows recovery environment? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up. If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware
 causing the issue. </p>

Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply,</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I was trying to repair my laptop, I already disconnected all external devices. I suspected corrupted system file as the main problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Method 1:</div>
<div>I already used the advanced startup options, but my laptop still cannot boot. After using the command prompt, my laptop showed me a 'Windows boot manager' display and and kept circling in a loop between 'select os' and 'windows boot manager' display</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2:</div>
<div>I have already tried your method too. Unfortunately I did not have any restore point on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Actually I did not want to re-install my windows, I wanted to save my personal data and I still attempting to look after the solution to repair my laptop. However, I found an option 'Load drivers' in&nbsp;<strong>System Recovery Options dialog</strong>&nbsp;box.
 With that option, I can open my computer data. Later I plugged an USB and &nbsp;I can copy my personal data.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, I finally resolved my problem by re-installing my windows, because I need my laptop in urgent. anyway thank you very much for you help and information. I really appreciated it!</div>

    <title>Can I increase text size&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> restrictedgolem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I increase text size&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I'm slightly blind, my TV is a 26 inch flat screen, that's mounted in the corner of the bedroom, about 12 feet from my bed, and the Skyrim text is quite small. Even with my glasses on, I can't read the damn stuff. Does anyone know of a way to make the
 text bigger at all? Either an in-game setting, or a TV setting? I have the cord that connects my Xbox to the TV set to just "TV" instead of "HDTV", which helps slightly. I also used the picture changing option on my remote, but the only three settings are
 Panoramic, Normal, and Wide. Normal is really small, wide is better, and Panoramic, is better then wide, but still not exactly good. I can just barely make out the text, but I'm reading more by "The shape of this word looks like its---" then by actually seeing
 the letters.</p>

<p>Any advice for a blind guy?</p>

<p>Can't it be adjusted, like in the Main Menu? And why can't you change save device like in Fallout 3/NV? There you had an option to go Load &gt; "Save 1" and you could change the save destination with X or Y (can't remember)</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with my old Mitsubishi TV. The HDMI cable, not a cheap one either, and console settings for 1080 and the TV will do a much higher graphic display for you. Clarity will be noticeable. As far as making the in game text bigger? I doubt
 there is a specific way to do that. If clarity does not help enough get closer. There are TV mounts that have eccentric arms also that might help bring the TV to you.</p>

<p>playing 360 games on a small non HD screen (or HD screen but set to SD) will make text VERY hard to read if it can be read at all. Setting you screen to HD will allow you to read the text more easily.</p>

    <title>Folder&#47;File permissions in properties tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bwhobby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder&#47;File permissions in properties tab</h2>
                    I have a particular program that will not start because I do not have write permissions for the folder, sub-folders, and files associated with the program. Going to the properties tab reveals that the folder is read only. I uncheck the box but can't seem
 to make it a permanent change. It always comes back up as read only. I have gone into every imaginable edit/advanced tab possible and given permissions to every possible group I can think of, yet despite the fact that every kind of permission possible is enabled
 and visible, I still can't uncheck the read-only box permanently and I still get "you do not have write permissions" from the program. I have tried changing ownership, running as administrator, and yet no progress on this problem.

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span><span>At this moment, I would like to confirm if I was logged in as an Administrator, so that I can enjoy all the privileges and rights of being an Administrator
 of the computer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try changing the attributes of the folder by logging into the Default Admin Account.<br />
</span></span><span><span>To Enable the Default Admin Account<br />
- Logon to Vista using your normal username and password. <br />
- Click on the Start button <br />
- Click on Start Search.<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
- Type, cmd. Right-click cmd, select 'Run as administrator' from the shortcut menu.
<br />
- In the black 'DOS box', type the following at the command line: <br />
Net help user<br />
The idea of the last command is just to observe the options for Net User.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In particular, examine the syntax to set the password. <br />
The next instruction is the crucial command.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have chosen password = 12345678, you may want to choose different characters.
<br />
Net user administrator 12345678<br />
Net user administrator /active: yes<br />
- Check the message: The command completed successfully <br />
- Switch User, or logoff <br />
- Logon as Administrator Password 12345678 (Your password may be different!)<br />
<br />
Also have a look at “Enable and Disable the Built-in Administrator Account”:<br />

Read-only on a folder isn't like read-only on a file.

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help us identify the cause of the issue and then find the proper resolution for it, please tell us if you made any significant hardware or software changes on your PC prior to this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, let's diagnose and fix common connection problems using the Network troubleshooter. To run the Network troubleshooter, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Network troubleshooter</strong>, and then select
<strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>Follow the steps in the troubleshooter and see if that resolves the problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you update the network adapter driver. An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. You may refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>In Device Manager, select <strong>Network adapters</strong> &gt; the network adapter name.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;the network adapter, and then select <strong>
Update driver</strong> &gt;<strong> Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>. Follow the steps, then select
<strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>After installing the updated driver, select the <strong>Start</strong> button &gt;
<strong>Power</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Restart</strong> if you're asked to restart, and see if that resolves the connection issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a different PC and save
 it to a USB flash drive, so you can manually install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            Dude, no worries. I’m here to help people, no matter how that help comes. Sometimes just chatting and troubleshooting leads people thinking differently and looking at different things. Great work finding the fix. 
<br />
<br />Mark this issue resolved, and we’ll call it a day. It’s been a pleasure!

<h2>            Skype account is blocked and can&#39;t recall the password</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mother wanted to log in to her skype on new computer but forgot her password. After plenty of unsuccessful tries to enter the right password her account was blocked. So I have few questions regarding this situation. How to unblock the account and to restore
 password.</p>
<p>I tried to restore it using form on site but we didn't provided enough information in her account before and her previous email (that was associated to this profile) is deleted - she didn't used it for a few years. But I've noticed that she's still logged
 in to skype on her laptop so we've added a new mail and her current phone number. And still, when I was trying to restore password on the first page I still saw the old mail address.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Would be really awesome if somebody could help me.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Kate</p>

            I am experiencing this same problem after Windows 10 Pro version 1511 Build 10586.29 came down on my computer a couple days ago. I've run your solution and it did not fix the problem. I can click on the "Search the web and Windows" box to the right of
 the Start button, the mouse icon flashes a blue circle twice, then nothing. When I ran the SFC /scannow command it did report that there were corrupted files found. I'm not surprised as since the earlier Windows 10 setup my computer has been shutting down
 or going into sleep or hibernate suddenly (not sure which but it does not wake up; have to press and hold the power button). It would be really helpful if you explained what the above is supposed to do.

<p>An Adblock is just an extension that is installed in browsers which blocks troublesome ads like Popups etc.</p>
<p>The best Adblocker is Adblockplus, <strong>which supports all of the popular browsers except Microsoft Edge.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.adblockplus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adblockplus.org</a></p>
<p>In addition you want to be secure from malware, try malwarebytes free version.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>In addition, Windows 10 has a built in antivirus i.e. Windows defender, so you do not need to install one.</p>

<p>That is just poor misinformation JimBob..... &nbsp;People are banned/suspended daily. &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, If you have done nothing wrong, no action will take place. &nbsp;Personally, I would be more upset about the corrupted save file but, that's just me. &nbsp;FYI- the enforcement
 team does NOT read the forums..... Except section 9. &nbsp; &nbsp; Smwutches and True red are correct. &nbsp; BF4 has some issues as I understand...... &nbsp;GOOD LUCK!!!</p>

<h2>            Your privacy settings prevent chat with some people.</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have been playing Xbox for years and have always kept my setting open so I can chat with anyone that come across online. Recently I tried starting an Xbox Live Party and I got a warning telling me "Your privacy settings prevent chat with some people". I checked my setting and they are open to anyone, I even went on the computer and made sure my setting were open throughout. After restarting my console, clearing it's cache, and restarting my internet a couple of times, my Xbox does not seem to allow me to chat with my friends or anyone for that matter. Please help.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Video Presentation in Skype Meetings</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Situation: I have a video embedded in the ppt (from Youtube). I have to present this ppt in Skype meeting using "Present power point files" option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem: The video in the ppt has to played by each audience by clicking play button.</p>
<p>Required Solution: If the presenter plays the video in the Skype, all the audience should see the video without clicking play button.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Dear PraveenAdi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to present a Power Point file with youtobe video through embedded code to insert the video as you do, and all the audience has to press the play button too. This is a design limitation in Skype for Business. Here is the

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Home button stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox One Controller home button just doesn't seem like it wants to work. It worked Saturday but is not working now. If I plug it up with a usb cable it'll come on but the home button still won't work. It's been working on and off but not working more
 than anything. Any fix to this problem?</p>

<p>I have the same problem. My controller is fine but the Home button won't work. I know it's not my console because I can home from the app on my phone but when I try the button on the controller it does nothing. Maybe I need to buy another controller?</p>

            <p>Jay - the console can store up a cache that will sometimes hamper use of other things including the controller. &nbsp;Holding the power button clears the cache to enable things to start working properly again. &nbsp;Please give that a try.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work then there may be an issue with one of your controllers.</p>
