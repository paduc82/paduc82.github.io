<h2>            Outlook Calendar Events Mostly Gone after Deleting Corrupted Email Account Help</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2016 Email / Calendar Problem&nbsp; (not using exchange).&nbsp; this is all on a W10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook synced to Four Email Accounts, where xxx.xxx is firstname.lastname<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (set as default)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For several days the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account has had an error in syncing and as a result Outlook fails and has to be reloaded.&nbsp; It doesn't reload without a computer restart, as it says it can't open certain folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I backed up the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** file, then went into Outlook and deleted that email account, then reset it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The emails and syn / update worked finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big problem though is that every entry into my calendar (except one for some reason) are now all gone, past and future!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm fairly sure that many of my contact addresses are gone too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a way to try to get my calendar back, I put the new 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** into a backup folder, and moved what I believed was the old
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** back into the correct folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went back to outlook, the calendars entries are still all (except one) missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ron.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the type of email account which experiences this issue? Is it a POP3 or IMAP account?

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check by opening all backed-up PST files, one at a time, for all email accounts in Outlook 2016 and check if you are able to find your lost calendar entries
 in Outlook 2016. Search for PST files and try opening all the PST files in Outlook to check if you find your calendar entries in any file.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, if the email account is an IMAP account, login to the account’s webmail and check if the calendar entries are available on the webmail calendar.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; business domain.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is confusing and not helpful that almost<br />
every MSosft<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; technology response seems to assume that any problem with an OST file<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; implies that there is an associated Exchange copy.&nbsp; That is not the<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; case!!<br />

<span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;calendar was also synced/backed-up?<br />
</span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.<br />
<span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and would hang up Outlook completely, needing not just a restart Outlook,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but a restart of the whole computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Gmail.com is not the default email<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; account.&nbsp; &nbsp;After I set up my business domain email account, I shifted the<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; default email account to the business hosted domain account.&nbsp; &nbsp;This was<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; done in Outlook account settings, months ago.&nbsp; It worked fine until a few<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; days ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;The default email account is my hosted domain account and<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doesn't have a problem.&nbsp; I did not back it up and it continues to sync<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; correctly.<br />
</span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.<br />
<span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; months before the business domain account was set up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I assume that<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; somehow that it is how / why all the calendar entries and<br />
contacts are now<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; missing.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I look within accounts at the Calendar tabs, there is no<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; indication of a calendar.&nbsp; This is very confusing, to not know where your<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; calendar is being saved, or how to back it up.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was never able to sort<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; out how to sync my calendar entries from Outlook 2016 to my<br />
windows phone.<br />
</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<ol>
<li><span>How did you back-up your default email account?&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I did not back up the default email account.&nbsp; The way I backed up the gmail account once I figured out it was the one getting hung up.&nbsp; I exited Outlook went to the folder with all of the OST files (one&nbsp;OST file for each email&nbsp;account was&nbsp;in there).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I created a copy of the gmail.com.ost file (about 2 gb), I then moved that copy&nbsp;into a newly created folder to ensure that it would be kept separate from any effort to fix or delete the problem file.</span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now with a backed up copy in a new folder, I went back to Outlook, and deleted the&nbsp;gmail account (knowing I had a backup).&nbsp; Knowing also that all the gmail emails were online at gmail, I recreated an email account for the gmail email
 address, knowing it would resync with gmail.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once that was done, I found that the new gmail account&nbsp;sync'd with all the emails on gmail and thought all was well.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I then discovered that all excep one of my calendar entries&nbsp;past and future were&nbsp;gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't spent time checking contacts and tasks, but assume there's probably a&nbsp;problem there too.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I then realized that my calendar entries&nbsp;that I had been creating manually within Outlook 2016, were somehow all going into the gmail.com.ost file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was never obvious, and should somehow be clear, so you can select where they
 are being saved.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I tried to revert back to the gmail.com.ost file that I had backed up and put into a separate folder, by many different approaches.&nbsp; None have worked.&nbsp; That means that backing up my OST, doesn't imply for some reason that you can recover
 from it.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I seem to be in a situation, where even though I backed up the ost file, I can't use it to recover!!&nbsp; My only resolution so far seems to be paying for an OST to PST converter that is listing somewhere between $70 and $200.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That can't
 be what MS intends for back up and restore for an&nbsp;OST.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also note, that it hasn't been my option whether to create the email accounts in Pop2 or IMAP.&nbsp; When you use the auto set up with Outlook, in each case it has created the email account with IMAP.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in each case there is no Exchange
 Server involved.</p>
</li><li>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</div>
</li><li>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I also looked on gmail.com online, and none of my calendar entries are in the calendar for my email account.</div>
</li><li>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Any&nbsp;help to regain my Calendar and&nbsp;get going again with my gmail account is appreciated.&nbsp; Otherwise I have to&nbsp;buy one of these converters and hope that it works.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't seem right though as it should be possible to back up and
 restore an email account file.</div>

            <p>Hello, This is an important question that I asked, as I have lost all my calendar and contacts information, due to a corruption to one of my ost files for my gmail.com email account.&nbsp; Who could have known that that file had all my calendar entries!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
 even backed it up once I saw it started to hang up when replicating.&nbsp; At least when I took Outlook offline, I could see my calendar and contact and email data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It now seems that having backed up that OST file was a useless exercise, and there is no way to
 use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You asked me to provide more information to you in order to solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I provided that information about a week ago.&nbsp; You haven't responded since then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I received an email asking whether the problem has been solved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please
 let me know if you've looked at my response and can help or whether I need to provide more info.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe that there's no way to back up then restore an ost file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help.</p>

    <title>Receiving error &#34;An error occurred while PowerPoint was saving the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arshvd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Receiving error &#34;An error occurred while PowerPoint was saving the file&#34;</h2>
                    <p>The error occurs when a large pptx file (&gt; 250 mb) is <strong>synced</strong> to my desktop
<strong>OneDrive</strong> client from a&nbsp;<strong>SharePoint Online</strong> Document Library. Opening the synced file in PowerPoint (desktop version) and performing a save results in the error&nbsp;"An error occurred while PowerPoint was saving the file".&nbsp; The pptx
 files are large due to the amount of media in many of the slides (video, images, etc.). I have performed a media compress for 250 mb files, making them small enough to not produce an error, however compressing pptx files larger than 400 mb does not reduce
 the file size enough to stop the error. Is there any way to solve this issue without media compresses etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exact steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sync the file to your local OneDrive desktop client by opening the SharePoint Online Document Library and clicking “Sync”</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once syncing is complete, click the OneDrive icon in the system tray</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Click the elipses on the file
 that was just synced and click “Open” to open the file in the local PowerPoint Desktop client</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the file is open, turn off “Autosave” by switching the Autosave slider to the Off position.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong><span> Click “File” on the top ribbon and click save</span></p>

<p>Hi arshvd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to help you.</p>
<p>Please go to SharePoint Online and check if you could edit presentation which approve you have valid permission for the file.</p>
<p>Do you have any difficult when saving other presentations? Try to create a new presentation and save in your sync client folder. I<span>f the issue only happen in this specific, It 's more likely that the root cause is the file itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Assume you have already create a new presentation and without saving problem, you can copy&nbsp; the slides from problematic presentation then paste them to the new one. In consider of&nbsp; there must be a lot of slides, you don't need to copy all the
 slides in term of testing, you can move almost 20-30 slides and check the result. If there is no error message , go on untill the issue occur.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, you can share the presentation to us. To protect your privacy, you can remove personal information in it then upload to your OneDrive, and share the related link on the forum. I will try to repro it by my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eric</p>

            I have no idea what your "old version" is, but if it precedes Office 2008 the problem is that the newer versions of OS X do not support the PowerPC
<em>software</em>. The documents, themselves, should present little - if any- problem in a version of Office supported by the newer OS. The most important considerations are the specific file type in which the files are saved &amp; the actual version of Word used
 to create/save them.<br />

<h2>            Mixed distribution list with both internal and external delivery&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, we need to have an Office365 distribution list that contains both internal users and external contacts.</p>
<p>To my understanding though, such a list will only deliver to all recipients when mailed from an internal source, but external use of the group will not deliver to the external contacts of the list but only internal users.</p>
<p>Is this limitation in Office365 correct? In that case, how is it possible to overcome this limitation so both internal and external use will deliver to all reciepients?</p>

<p>hi timeskyit,</p>
<p>by default, only senders inside your organization can send messages to the distribution group.</p>
<p>however, you can also allow people outside the organization to send to the distribution group.</p>
<p>the message will be delivered to all members no matter whether they are internal users or external contacts.</p>
<p><br />
you can change this in the delivery management tab of the group settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6d53ebd6-d204-425c-8c4a-dd4050ee5dfe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6d53ebd6-d204-425c-8c4a-dd4050ee5dfe" /></a></p>
<p>if&nbsp;the option "senders inside and outside of my organization" is enabled and the external contacts still cannot receive the messages, please
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj200712(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Phillip,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the problem only occurs when you are running the IMAP migration in the
<strong>Exchange Admin Center(EAC)-&gt;recipients-&gt;migration</strong>, right? It is suggested to let other Office 365 admins run the IMAP migration tool and see if there is any difference. If it doesn’t work, I need to collect some more information for further
 check: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Capture a screenshot of the configurations of the migration batch and endpoints.</p>
<p>2. Where did you see the error message? Please capture a screenshot of the entire interface.</p>
<p>3. After the IMAP migration fails, it will generate a report. Please upload it via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a> for further check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>I'll try making someone else an admin and running the migration. Doesn't quite make sense to me but i'll try anything at this point.</p>

<p>Hello Phillip,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the information you provided, the reason is that it cannot connect to the IMAP server. Did you configure the endpoints correctly. If other admins failed too, please click “<strong>…</strong>”-&gt;<strong>migration endpoints</strong>
 and delete all the endpoints there. Then click <strong>+ </strong>to create a new one. Please contact the mail provider to make sure that are using the correct IMAP server and port. Delete all the migrations batches and re-create it to start a new migration
 process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43726e55-ec7b-408a-bfa9-ed8ba8d154a7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43726e55-ec7b-408a-bfa9-ed8ba8d154a7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If the issue persists, please double click on the migration batch, and choose
<strong>migration reports</strong>. Download the reports here and upload them via private message for further check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Rick,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i tried with the same batch under a different user with admin rights and still got an error.</p>
<p>Seeing as how it was the same batch, i started with a new batch with just one user in it under the same user with admin rights. I get the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, i tried running a new batch again with the only change i can make, from SSL to TLS with the same port#</p>
<div>
<p>Same Error.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>The endpoint is an imap server under Fusemail.com (imap.fusemail.net)</p>
<p>i used basic authentication, No SSL, port 143 (this is the same settings from Outlook client used to connect to that server)</p>
<p>I verified the password is working by logging into the fusemail web portal under that users id and password. I set the same password on the O365 portal to match.</p>
<p>All these things work on 2 third party migration tools i have tried under trial with this one user. One trial allowed me to transfer 10 emails and the other (MigrationWiz) verified endpoints and connectivity. I'm about to go the
 MigrationWiz way as i've used it before for another more technical migration. I just figured for something this simple i wouldn't need to purchase that tool. The report that gets made is a less than 1k txt file that shows as empty when you open it. I dont
 know if you still want to see that? i attached it anyway to the private message.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Phillip,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. I totally understand it has caused many inconvenience. I have read the post again and see that you have tested the migration endpoint via PowerShell and it comes back good. Given the situation, please refer
 to this article and do the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/powershell/use-powershell-to-perform-an-imap-migration-to-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
IMAP migration via PowerShell</a> to give it a shot. You can create a new endpoint(Please also try the existing endpoint to see if the migration works) to do the migration.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please capture a screenshot of the entire PowerShell results for further check. Meanwhile, I will do some consult about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>&gt; I tried to change from the file associations to outlook 2003, was not successful.</p>
<p>&gt; tried to change the default programs, still not successful.....</p>
<p>&gt; tried to Manually/partial rip outlook 2013 from office pro 2013 suite, but still the tool that i use is trying to trigger outlook 2013 application!! (which is not on the computer now, hence i get a error message when outlook 2013 is triggered)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally Found that there is some file/protocol called as "mapi client" which i found out to be responsible to trigger outook 2013 if i try to send mails from word application.</p>
<p>but that file is associated with outlook 2013 ONLY!!!<br />
</p>
<p>Is there anyway of changing <strong>that email mapi client</strong>&nbsp; from outlook 2013 to outlook 2003 ??<br />

please help!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Vicky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I undestand you are facing issue working with the Outlook 2003 as a default client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is your computer connected to a domain or a network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is the email account configured in Outlook (POP, IMAP or an Exchange)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case your computer is on a domain or a network, you may also post the question in the following link and check if it helps:</p>

            <p>HI, </p>
<p>am connected to the home network but am using an exchange account in outlook 2003 but the server&nbsp;that am connected to and the tool that i use to send invoice, does not support outlook 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but i have installed office pro 2013 and outlook pro 2003 on my win 7 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i try to send an invoice from the tool,&nbsp;the outlook 2013 application opens, but i want outlook 2003 to open up as, thats the version that my tool supports.</p>

            <p>Assuming that you are referring to having installed the Outlook '2013 "click to run" version along side O'2003, then you will not be able to designate O'2003 as the email client referenced by your 3rd party application. Doesn't make a difference whether
 or not you have O'2003 open or not - the net result is that O'2013 will be invoked by your app and you have no control over that (leastwise not that I've been able to find that would over-ride the default behavior in this scenario). Not just an issue for your
 application but any app invoking Outlook programmatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to round out issues related to having 2 versions of Outlook on your system (O'2013 and any other version)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- each Outlook version can have a different default Outlook profile using different accounts/PST files etc</p>
<p>- If both versions use the same email accounts and data stores (i.e. PST files) - the last version of Outlook to be opened will fail since the data stores will already be in use</p>

<h2>            possibility of 10 and 8.1 lumia 640 lte</h2>
                    Greet the community. I discovered a feature on windows 10. You can do and at the same time to exit the menu or from the arrow, either from the main windows key and the call does not exits,&nbsp;shows up a bar on the top of the screen with information, and at
 the same time you can join other application. Question: become in 8.1 the same? Can someone look? I'm thinking back on 8.1 but I see possibilities. Lumia. 640 LTE. That unlocks the keyboard; With space doesn't. Half screen works with the Windows button pressed.
 Also at 8.1 at YouTube i could turn of the screen at the same time hearing the sound of video without closing the explorer,but at 10 the sound stop,close explorer so I cannot save battery.Thanks .Lumia 640 LTE.

    <title>Notification error and no reminders - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Notification error and no reminders</h2>
                    
<p>I'm re-posting this as a new topic because the other "answered" topic I found didn't actually provide an answer and replying to it got no response...</p>
<p>I had to restart my phone a few days ago and when it came back up I had a "Notification Error" popup with the text "Cannot execute" (no program name) that can't be closed. I ignored it at first since the shell started up and couldn't see the error anymore,
 but then noticed that reminders haven't been working since then. I've tried restarting the phone a few times and I get the error every time and reminders are still not working. Error reporting has been off for a while, so the error shows up regardless and
 I assume that would only hide the error even if it worked. I'm using an HTC Diamond with Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional CE OS 5.2.19965 (Build 19965.1.2.3)</p>
<p>I assume this is some registry setting or something that got screwed up or left behind? How do I fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

 touch my phone just in case something happens, my phone was working complete fine until this update, bearing in mind I was actually trying to downgrade back to windows 8.1 but instead it updated windows 10 technical preview.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you reset your apps reinstall and the system apps update. You have to go to the store, menu, downloads and updates and tap update all when the&nbsp;system updates are ready to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not update to the insider by itself. You installed the insider app and accepted the terms to install 10 insider to start with.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Download and install the preview only if you<br />
Aren't installing it on your primary phone. If you have a backup phone, that's a perfect candidate for Insider Preview.<br />
Want to try out software that’s still in development and like sharing your opinion about it.<br />
Don’t mind lots of updates or a UI design that might change significantly over time.</p>

We're not kidding about the expert thing. So if you think APN is a cable news network, Insider Preview may not be right for you.

    <title>Excel 2016 on Mac jumpy scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prodigyj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 on Mac jumpy scrolling</h2>
                    I notice a rather annoying problem with Excel 2016 - when scrolling using either a trackpad or mousewheel, the scrolling is not at all smooth. &nbsp;Instead, the scrolling is very jumpy. &nbsp;By jumpy, I don't mean that the scroll will go from point A to point
 B in a snap rather than a smooth motion. &nbsp;Rather, when initiating a scroll, the spreadsheet will sort of vibrate and bounce rapidly back and forth before the scrolling commence. &nbsp;The problem is particularly obvious when scrolling horizontally, and it sometimes
 won't scroll at all, no matter how many times I try. &nbsp;In such instances, the only way to move around the spreadsheet is either the arrow key or by clicking on the scroll bar. &nbsp;Sometimes initiating a scroll would cause a beachball to appear for a sec or two,
 and I'm on a Quad core 2012 Retina Macbook Pro. &nbsp;This is a persistent problem and has not be fixed in the last Excel update. &nbsp;This is also not a machine dependent problem, because I experience the same scrolling problem on my 13" Retina Macbook Pro as well.
 &nbsp;Anyone else having this issue?<br />

            Yeah, sent the frown and explanation already. &nbsp;Hopefully they'll fix it in the next update. &nbsp;It's very annoying.

            It's unreasonable to expect this (or any other) fix in the next update. The next update is probably already complete. What we both should be expecting is that it will be fixed before the final release.<br />

            <p>Actually it is reasonable.&nbsp;As long as a update hasn't been released It is expected that until and hour before its ready to upload a new update that all efforts should be made to Fix defects reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Preview its different than a Final Release. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As long its in Beta it’s a work in Progress.&nbsp;And if developers are requesting suggestions. Then they should be be fixing items up until an hour before upload time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FeedBack request on a Final version basically reports are bugs that haven't been fixed. There fore need more time to fix as they are items that are not so easy to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this herky - Jerky scroll issue should have been one of the very first bugs they should have fixed. I Know&nbsp;I sent a Frown Report. It very annoying, disconcerting and and time waster, to have to wait for it to settle down before you can continue doing
 your work. I know with me it takes 5 seconds or so to settle down I shouldn't have to wait that long. and once&nbsp;I release it should quit dancing around. The same issue I haven't found in Word or PowerPoint. I don't use Outlook. I find SeaMonkey a better format.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to you stop Word 2010 from automatically adding every little change to paragraph as a new style&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Word 2010&nbsp;is such a pain when it comes to formats and formatting changes.&nbsp; I have turned off
<strong>Keep Track of Formatting</strong> under Advanced Options, and under Proofing Autocorrect Options... I have tried to kill
<strong>Autoformat as you type</strong> and <strong>Autoformat options</strong>, but Word STILL insists on adding every little change as a new style.&nbsp; This is a roaly pain and makes my work life harder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I permanently turn off this VERY problematic "feature?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, how can I delet those formats that word automatically adds to the document?&nbsp; In previous versin of Word I could stop this bad behavior and delete the crappy styles.</p>

            <p>Peter,</p>
<p>In the Styles task pane, at the very bottom, click options, under&nbsp;select formatting you want to show as styles, remove the checks next to paragraph, character and numbering, activate the radio button New documents based on this template, click OK.</p>
<p>That should stop the adding of formatting as new styles.</p>

            It <span style="font-weight: bold">may</span> be attributable to a bug that somehow seems to have Word misreading temporary files related to the printer currently in use.&nbsp; That being the case you can usually 'unscramble' the display from File=&gt;Print and

<h2>            security certificate errors endless loop</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having a problem with a user and his certificates, already searched for answers here but nothing solves my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've changed his machine and now he's working with Win7 and IE8, migrated all information from the old computer to the new.</p>
<p>Install of the certificates was peaceful but now opening a certain page that needs the certificate (in the old pc it was working), it calls the certificate, i click on ok and then the IE starts an endless loop trying to load the page and getting back to
 the previous page.</p>
<p>To quit that i have to click twice on the back button or kill the process.</p>
<p>I removed the certificates and installed again, it does the same.</p>
<p>Any ideias of what's happening and fix this? Re-install IE8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Luís.</p>

    <title>bar chart with time as x-axis, and the width of bar changes according - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xeu4max  say:</h3>
<h2>            bar chart with time as x-axis, and the width of bar changes according to the time interval</h2>
                    I have 3 colums of data:<br />
1. time (0, 5, 15, 30, 35, 45.....)<br />
2. value<br />
3. time interval (0, 5, 10, 15,5,10,15, .....)<br />
<br />
How to create a bar chart with time as x-axis, and the different value as y-axis. and the width of the y is acoodring to the time interval. and the bars are plotted together, i.e.&nbsp; there is no space between two bars (except when the value is 0)<br />
thanks a lot<br />

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>that's a variable width column chart, a kind of Marimekko chart. Jon Peltier has a tutorial on his site here:&nbsp;<a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/variable-width-column-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/variable-width-column-charts/</a></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the article with the chart you posted points to exactly that tutorial.</span></div>

            <p>thanks teylyn.<br />
<br />
I did check that post. The problem is that I only have the data like <br />
time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value&nbsp; time_interval<br />
.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...... ...&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br />
.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .....<br />
<br />
<br />
but not like the table Peltier has with columns from E to J and rows from 1 to 15.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or does that mean that I need to extend my data table to that kind of form manually? I mean to add zeros?<br />

            Well, with any kind of chart that goes beyond a next&gt;next&gt;finish you must be prepared to put in some extra yards. Charts are a lot easier to manage if the source data is arranged clearly, so, yes, you will have to create a source table that does that.

<br />
<br />I'm Charles, an Independent advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />It has tried to perform a reinstallation, generally, this process solves that problem, for it, uninstall Office and re-execute it. As support, I will add two links, one where it indicates step by step how to uninstall and the next shows the reinstallation. More detail see here:
<br />
<br />Uninstall Office
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manually-uninstall-Office-4e2904ea-25c8-4544-99ee-17696bb3027b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manual...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall Office

<h2>            Word document corrupt. All text turned to asterisks. Recovery help request. Office for mac 2011. MacBook Pro.</h2>
                    Dear Sir or Madam,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really hope you can help me recover a document. My word document (120pgs approx, nothing fancy, only text, but maybe 600 footnotes) turned entirely to asterixes. No warning. I have Office: mac 2011, a MacBook Pro. Both were bought in January 2013 and
 have been used very little, just for work in Word and browsing the internet. I have plenty of memory, no signs of viruses.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The document in question looks corrupt. Only asterixes where each character and space was. When i open that document, word crashes: I get the spinning colour wheel and have to force quit. When I do that it says Word is not responding. When i sent the document
 to my husband's computer (also a macbook pro, but not sure what office for mac version) the same thing happened with Word crashing immediately and needing to force quit. Everything else on my laptop, including the other word documents, works normally. Word
 functions as normal with all my other documents, including larger ones.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Total catastrophe. I really need to recover the doc urgently because the 2 weeks of work in this document is due this afternoon. And no, I don't have it backed up externally. Yes, I know that's stupid. So, can you help me?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best Regards.</div>

            <p>No, you are looking at the wrong company's updates :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, go to its Help menu and run "Check for Updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to run it several times, because first it has to update the updater, then it will update Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you buy software, the version on the disk is "Version 1". &nbsp;You need to get up to version 14.5.0, so you have a few updates to suck in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, sorry, the "Asterisks bug" is actually a mistake in some code inherited from Word PC. &nbsp;It was an EXTREMELY obscure bug that to a lot of finding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the time you see that it has struck, the only way to save the document is to have had Word&gt;Preferences&gt;Save "Always make backup" switched on. &nbsp;If it wasn't switched on before the bug struck, then your text has literally all been replaced with the asterisk
 character.</p>

<h2>            Outlook won&#180;t start - AppVIsvSubsystems32.dll</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m facing the same problem as many others in this Community.</p>
<p>After installing Office 2016 I get the following Error Message in Application Log (German MUI Installation of Windows 7, 64 Bit Ent):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name der fehlerhaften Anwendung: OUTLOOK.EXE, Version: 16.0.4266.1003, Zeitstempel: 0x55ceb248<br />

Berichtskennung: c55a0be4-6730-11e5-ae91-402cf4dada03</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´ve tried several workarounds. Uninstalled Office, reinstalled Office, deleted all COM Add-Ins from Registry (I know they are still installed, but they are prevented from loading), deleted all registry items, deleted all Exchange Profiles, installed 64
 Bit Version of Office 2016 (guess what, in this Case it´s the&nbsp;AppVIsvSubsystems64.dll throwing the Error Message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the way: E-Mail Management in Control Panel is not accessible either. There it gives me this Error:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any hints what else I can do? Reinstalling Windows is NOT an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Just to make clear. All other Applications of Office 2016 work just fine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>just wanted to let you know that McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention ist creating this issue. It is NOT supported for Office 2016 in Version 8.0 - and as we see, it blocks Outlook from opening. McAfee states it has to do with Outlooks internal overflow protection
 that is not compatible with McAfee overflow protection. However McAfee is working on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you stop Host Intrusion Prevention (note: less security!), Outlook 2016 works just as you would expect it.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I've contacted McAfee and related the issue contained in this thread. They have confirmed this issue is related to a known incompatibility between our Click-To-Run (aka App-V) technology used to deliver Office 2016 and their Host Intrusion Prevention 8.0
 software. The incompatibility is discussed here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For now, the recommended&nbsp;fix is Workaround 2 from the article, disabling the Host IPS API engine.</p>

            After reading this thread, i uninstalled McAfee Plus and outlook worked without a problem.&nbsp; I was unable to stop the service causing the issue.&nbsp; Every time i did, it would start it again.&nbsp; McAfee needs to fix this ASAP or i will need to go to a different
 virus software.&nbsp; i can not function without Outlook, but there are lots of virus applications.<br />

            I have this same issue.&nbsp; I went to try and run Outlook from the Root directory and I noticed I don't even have the dll file&nbsp; mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is listed, but the size of the file is 0.&nbsp; I hope there is some solution to this.&nbsp; Adding another user profile
 didn't work either.&nbsp; This is crappy!

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 v2.0 won&#39;t scroll in MS Excel</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this has a solution!</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo Thinkpad T510 notebook which has Windows 7 64bit OS.&nbsp; I have Office 2010 32bit installed and this is working fine except that the mouse wheel will<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></strong> scroll vertically in Excel
 ONLY.&nbsp; The horizontal scrolling works fine and vertical works fine in MS Word.</p>
<p>As an accountant, I work mostly in Excel so this is hugely frustrating.&nbsp; The hardware is the Microsoft wireless desktop 6000 (Keyboard and mouse combo).&nbsp; I tried downloading the latest driver and specified that I install the 64 bit driver so I'm confident
 that I have the recommended driver - unless I'm missing something of course!</p>
<p>The problem is not restricted to Excel though as some web pages don't scroll either (this text box for example!!)</p>
<p>Please can someone help me.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Blaise</p>

 the problem), enabled software rendering in internet options/advanced settings. Windows updates are all up to date, tried installing Adobe Reader (newest version of the Adobe Site), still not working. Can anybody help with this issue??</p>
