<h2>            Wireless Keyboard stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft 3000 Keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked fine for about 3 months after upgrading to Windows10, then suddenly stopped. Diagnosis: WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys (driver) corrupted or missing. It is there, so assume corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard works fine on my laptop. It also works on current desktop when I disconnect C drive to load Windows XP. Unfortunately, I can't figure out to load both drives &amp; XP without a keyboard. (Thought XP may not mind overwriting system files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the driver file but cannot over-right existing file (C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys) as system won't let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have loaded all Windows updates, have bought a new keyboard with same result, and have chatted on-line with Microsoft support, but no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly a problem of Windows10 but not common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated as touch keyboard is driving me mad.</p>

<p>3. Run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter&nbsp; and follow the on-screen instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall keyboard driver</strong></p>
<p>Try uninstalling the keyboard driver and restart the computer and have Windows automatically install the latest driver upon restart.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select Device manager.</p>
<p>2. Locate the keyboard driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks Wungraileng, but still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 goes through the motions and wants computer restarted but does not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2. First thing, cannot press Windows key + X without a keyboard. Went into Device Manager via All Apps\Windows System\Devices and uninstalled wireless keyboard (there were 2) and ticked to delete driver. The driver file WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys
 is not deleted. On restart, keyboard still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read through article 'Troubleshooting: Keyboards' but don't think any apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would still like to try overwriting the driver file but don't know how to get authority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the PC is self built so no access to manufacturer's drivers.</p>

            <p>The plot deepens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dug out an old wired Digital Media Keyboard to try. Uninstalled wireless keyboard first then plugged in wired. Computer recognised keyboard but couldn't load driver! This keyboard works OK on laptop and doesn't seem to need a driver loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just give info in case this adds a pointer.</p>

            <p>Some additional questions, how does it connect wireless? </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try this software driver : <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/wireless-keyboard-3000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/wireless-keyboard-3000</a></p>
<p>Or from Device Manager, locate your keyboard driver and then follow this &gt;<br />
Update this Driver &gt; Let me check on this PC... &gt; Browse on this PC... &gt; and select the appropriate keyboard for it. If you have doubt, lets us know the options. Then restart the computer.

            <p>Thanks for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I still have no keyboard (and little hair). From research and lack of success with following the&nbsp;advice it looks like a problem with the wireless keyboard filter rather than any keyboard, which I believe is there to plug a security problem
 with the wireless mouse. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me that a reinstall of Windows may be the only answer. I have over 50 Apps/programs installed so don't really relish this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So two questions please: Is this likely to cure the problem; Is there likely to be a problem with Product Key / Licence when reinstalling Windows and Office (2010)?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Either wont be a reason for the said issue. Driver failure or outdated drivers are the culprits for this. Since that we are using a Microsoft Keyboard, I recommend to check our MS Techs from support.microsoft.com for further assistance. Also, I&nbsp;suggest
 to download Bluetooth driver&nbsp;from your PC Manufacturer that fits for Windows 10&nbsp;to be ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>First, thanks for all the replies. I have been impressed with the number, speed and helpfulness of the replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the suggestions worked, as did none of the suggestions elsewhere on the internet. After applying all suggested remedies, Windows 10 gave the impression that there was probably another problem, despite still working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to clear the PC and reinstall Windows 7 while there was still time for a free upgrade. The previous upgrade worked first time, but of course, this time it took 6 attempts to upgrade. Added to which my laptop developed a fatal corrupt hard drive
 at the same time. Fortunately I had 5 copies of my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info on Microsoft Community proved invaluable in sorting out a solution. Glad to say that despite the problems encountered, all is now well and I have a fully working Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, many thanks for all the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 battery bulged out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonhodkinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 battery bulged out</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased the following June 7, 2017;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Surface Book 13.5" LED Detachable Notebook with Performance Base - (Intel i7-6660U 2.4GHz, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 Professional) Si at a cost of £2,249.00&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>A couple of days ago I noticed the laptop was sitting at an odd angle on the top of the work surface&nbsp; and when I investigated I found that the battery in the keyboard section had bulged, distorting the keyboard upward and causing the bottom plate to become
 unglued. Fearing the worst I immediately unplugged the power brick and placed the laptop on the least flammable place I could find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i went to look at support options to discover I'm supposed to post the device to Microsoft ( at a cost of £492 possibly ex VAT?), as the device is out of warranty. For this the will send me a "similar" refurbished replacement in circa 12 working days....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After calming down......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to write this, in order to ask the community for any possible contact details where I could express dismay at spending £2249 on a premium machine, have it malfunction in a potentially dangerous way, only 18 months later and then be expected to
 pay another £492 for a refurb machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming I'm not alone in such a predicament, and would be grateful for any direction as to how to improve my outcome from the current woeful position.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Microsoft web support. After saying no to the automated attempts to find a solution i selected the "speak to a person" option. I entered my phone number and was told i would be called back. I was called backed. Within two minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained the issue, to a human being, and was told "that issue isn't normal". What followed was a long call involving taking serial numbers, verifying identity, use case, uploading photographs of said machine.&nbsp; I was told this was to create a comprehensive
 support case, which would be referred upwards and I wold receive a reply within 2-3 business days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked questions regarding if I was alone and if any damage was caused, what sort of things i had plugged into the laptop and how long it had been used that day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the first two questions in terms of corroboration, liability and estimation of damages if things became horribly legal. IE if the house burnt down ( no damage was caused to my goods and chattles, luckily) but the rest of the questions I
 found a bit odd. Surely, there are no circumstances in which a battery should exhibit this behaviour in a consumer device? Maybe the questions are to help Microsoft form a picture of the situation in which the fault occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if you have a similar problem perhaps try the web help and then select "talk to a human" to get a case logged. It takes a while but for £2249 plus a possible additional £492 I can answer copious details.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will up date with the outcome of the next contact...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To update,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was contacted, and I was shipped a replacement Surface book free of charge. SO a happy outcome come. In answer to your question</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>I too have the same problem now. It is very difficult to get a person to contact me to understand how I can get this replaced, as mine is still under warranty."</span></p>
<p>I'm just an average user, I would urge you to contact Microsoft by email or search the web etc, and make contact somehow, to start your support journey. Good luck.</p>

    <title>Blue Flame Armor Effect &#38;amp&#59; Bungie Nameplate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bogeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Flame Armor Effect &#38;amp&#59; Bungie Nameplate</h2>
                    
<p>This quick mini-FAQ was created to clear up some of the common questions with the release of the Bungie App. If you have any questions not covered in this post, feel free to ask. I'll just temporarily pin this for a few weeks since these "perks" will be
 released on Bungie Day (July 7th) to the rest of the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Where can I get the Bungie App!?<br />
</b>First off, you need an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch with iOS 4+ to download this app. This app is not available on the Android Marketplace so Android users, I'm afraid you're out of luck for the time being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Alright, I downloaded the app, what do I do now to get my visual flair?<br />
</b>Go to the app and you'll be prompted by a lovely message from Bungie. Here you can enable the 'All -Star Nameplate' as a nameplate. To activate the 'Eternal' armor effect, go to the tab in the app that says 'Love Bungie' (logo is a heart &lt;3). Select 'Blue
 Flames' and enable it! Bam, you now have blue flames!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I have blue flames, chya! I can now haz 'Bungie' nameplate?<br />
</b>Of course you can! To enable the 'Bungie Nameplate', go to <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Account/nameplates.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> page and click 'Change Nameplate' where the Bungie logo appears. You need to activate the blue flames first in order to have the Bungie nameplate be available under your nameplates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So what's this whole thing with gifting the 'All-Star Nameplate'?<br />
</b>Since you have the app, you are able to gift the star nameplate to seven friends, strangers, or random gamertags you enter. To gift the 'All-Star Nameplate', go to the Bungie App and under the 'Love Bungie' tab you'll see the option to gift the nameplate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on that note:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR THE 'ALL-STAR NAMEPLATE' ON THE FORUMS OR OFFER TO GIVE IT AWAY. KEEP THE GIFTING PRIVATE!</span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">-------</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! Thanks peeps!<br />
</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No, it was posted that the flames would burn eternally (I forget which Bungie employee said it). But, I take that as saying we can haz recon I mean the flames<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /> forever.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight:</p>
<p>If you have the app, you can unlock blue flames and use them straight away, and can keep them after Bungie day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have the app you have to wait til Bungie day and you also get to keep it after that day (Or do you lose it afterwards?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it cost any credits to use?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Correct, if you have the app you can get them early. If you don't you have to wait until the 23rd and will be able to keep them afterwards. It's Bungie's way of celebrating twenty years of Bungie awesomeness and sharing it with us.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You’ll need to free up some space. Installing the Windows 8.1 RT Update requires 1 GB of disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider moving some files to OneDrive or a thumb drive, at least until the installation is complete. For more info see

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Try running in a Clean Boot state see if that fixes it. If it does, enable some of the programs to try and pinpoint what software is causing the
 issue.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />

</span><span>Note: Follow step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed previous version of Google earth.

<h2>            Skype Room System v2 microphones</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have recently implemented several Skype Room Systems and have found the microphones to be very sensitive - picking up every small noise in the room. How can we lower this sensitivity? There doesn't seem to be any options in the settings for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hello David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m writing to take over this thread. Given the situation, please go to <strong>
Control Pane</strong>-&gt;on upper right corner of the window, choose <strong>Large icons</strong>-&gt;<strong>Sound</strong>-&gt;Under
<strong>Playback</strong>, choose your <strong>Speakers</strong> and click <strong>
Properties</strong>-&gt;go to <strong>Enhancements</strong> tab-&gt;Disable the enhancements that you don’t need.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fc6c025-7023-4f6a-9b1e-e890d6efa4cd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4fc6c025-7023-4f6a-9b1e-e890d6efa4cd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>If you already disabled all the enhancements, then there is no other options to lower the sensitivity of microphones. Your understanding is highly appreciated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2) What is the exact/complete error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the&nbsp;steps mentioned below and check if it helps</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Set the computer to clean boot state to check for the software conflicts and check if it helps.<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow step 7 in the above article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Also, check ‘Event viewer’ for the detailed error message when the computer crashes/freezes and let us know.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I would suggest checking your RAM and running some type of malware removal along with your antivirus software.</div>

<h2>            Can Someone Help&#63; Computer not recognising USB Flash Drive&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    I have just bought a brand new Toshiba 32BG 2.0 Transmemory Flash Drive. I got it straight out of its packaging, plugged it into my usb port, it starting installing the driver software, and like normal said that the device was ready to use, except when
 I came to open it, it was nowhere to be seen. On the computer tab it isn't recognised there either. I have been on computer management, device manager, USB controllers, and then scrolled down to USB Mass Storage Device, and scanned for hardware changes, updated
 driver software, and even uninstalled and then reinstalled it. It just keeps going round and round in circles, telling me it is ready for us, that the device is working properly, but no matter what I do, it will still not show up on my computer so I can access
 it. Yet when I plug in a USB I have used many times before it works perfectly fine?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks :)</div>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> margaretdooley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recently ( about 1 month ) I followed the prompt to upgrade my Medion Akoya laptop to Windows 10. The upgrade worked pretty well for three weeks and then bang, my laptop died a death. &nbsp;Now when I press the start button nothing happens. My laptop
 has never acted in this way so I can only assume that Windows 10 is the cause of my problem. So what now, can it be revived or is it time to bury it. I would appreciate your help. Thanks all.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It worked for me, but many users have had trouble with the last&nbsp;Windows update. Check what happens when you remove the update. If full functionality returns to you, block the update - &amp; begin your wait for a MSFT fix.</p>

1. My wife bought the computer new, gave it to me.   


2. Norton has been installed since it was first used. 


3. I installed SpyBot because I started getting the iastor.sys blue screen of death after doing a bunch of Windows updates, and I thought it might be a virus.  I do not have Tea Timer enabled.  I installed it only a week or so ago, and AFTER the problems installing these three updates. 


4. Malware Bytes was installed two hours prior to Spybot - see above.  BOTH have found and removed problems.  Also, my Norton keeps telling me it has been stopping various attacks.  My MBAM trial real-time protection option is no longer enabled (trial ran out). 


5a.  Nothing.  In fact, I ONLY get it when the system is idle for 10-15 minutes.  If I am actively using the device, I can use it all day.  I get it after **** boot (boot and do nothing), boot and run a program, like Media Player, or boot and download something that takes a long time to run. 


5b. I jotted it down once - something like, "

<h2>            HP Laptop shutting down when &#34;close lid&#34; option is set to &#34;sleep&#34; after Windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
Need a bit of advice. I recently upgraded my HP Pavilion laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and love it but am having issues with a technical setting. I have always set my laptop to "go to sleep" whenever I close the lid but now it is shutting down. My laptop
 is a bit older so it takes a looooong time to start up so this is a bit frustrating.
<br />
<br />
Whenever I open the lid it will either start up from a shut down or give me a ":(" error and say my PC needed to restart.<br />
<br />
Any insight? I really need my laptop to sleep, not shut down!<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. I would&nbsp;like to assist you further from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the Laptop would shut down instead of&nbsp;enter into sleep when the lid is closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to try to restore the settings for the power options settings in Windows to default and then again set it to your preference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key and R from the keyboard to open the Run Command Dialog Box.</p>
<p>Type the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Disable the sleep mode option: <strong>powercfg -h off</strong>.</p>
<p>B. Reset and Restore All Power Plans to Default: <strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, please feel free to write to us and we will be&nbsp;glad to help you.</p>

<h2>            how to obtain windows 7 ISO for laptop w&#47;win 7 preinstalled,  upgrade to win 10 in july, recently replace HD&#47; reinstalled  win 10</h2>
                    <p>Dell Inspiron N5010, windows 7-64 bit preinstalled at time of purchase. one of the first free upgrades to windows 10 in july. recently replaced hard drive (unrecoverable) and reinstalled windows 10. I am trying to obtain an ISO for windows 7. &nbsp;this has proved
 to be quite difficult. my attempt prior to replacing my hard drive using the old product key was unsuccessful as the site does not accept keys from pre-installed versions. &nbsp;If I am understanding it correctly in an article I read it said that when I upgraded
 from win 7 to win 10 the product key remained the same. However, when my hard drive was replaced and windows 10 re-installed that product key was replaced with a digital license. &nbsp;I have 3, possibly 4 questions: 1.) Has my product key now become a digital
 license? 2.) If so, can this digital license be used to obtain the windows 7 ISO? If so, where can I find the digital license? 4.) if none of the above, any suggestions how I can get a copy of windows 7 Iso? I am very frustrated and out of ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thank you VeeW</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when you upgrade to Windows 10, you can go back to Windows 7 at anytime. Obtaining Windows 7 reinstall media will be dependent on certain factors.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My Win 7 Home key that came with my Fujitsu SH760 notebook (under it) can no longer be seen. Can I just use my Upgrade Key (for Win 7 Pro) to do a clean installation of Win 7 without the Win 7 Home key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If cannot will my Fujitsu SH760 notebook run in Win 10 if the only way is to have a Win 7 Disk?</p>

            <p>If you have the recovery disk set you can reinstall the computer without the use of a key. The factory image has its own key which is different to the label version anyway. If you can get into Windows it may still be possible to create the recovery disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 7&nbsp;is still bootable once the Fujitsu Logo disappears repeatedly tap the F8 key to get to the Troubleshooter menu. Follow the System Recovery options to reinstate the original Windows factory image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then upgrade from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively try installing Windows 7 without entering a key. Then install again upgrading the existing install by using the key (this loophole may have been fixed).</p>

<h2>            Error 1316 driving me crazy.</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting this error in my Event Viewer.&nbsp; How do I get rid of this?&nbsp; Running Win 7 Premium 64 bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tried the Microsoft "Fix it" which seemed to do nothing.&nbsp; And the "Event Log On-line help" doesn't go anywhere either.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm at my wits end to fix this error.&nbsp; Wasn't sure what section I should post this question in, so it's two different ones.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>System is working fine, no crashes or BSODS, just this error in Event Log.<br />

            What happens when you try? &nbsp;Be sure you are dragging from the icon picture and not from the name text.
<div><br />
<div>If it's still not working there are some registry changes that can try to alleviate the issue. &nbsp;But because registry changes are tedious and dangerous, I'd recommend letting the system repair them for you. &nbsp;Here's how:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Type <b>restore</b>&nbsp;into the Start menu search box to find and open <i>Restore system files and settings from a restore point</i>.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click Next, pick a date before the problem began, then click Next once more.</li></ol>
<div>
<ul>
<li>This process only takes about 2 minutes and only restores your system files/settings: it won't touch any of your files, documents, pictures, emails, or anything else.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>If the system restore doesn't fix the issue try this to replace missing or corrupt system files. &nbsp;Here's how:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Type <b>cmd</b>&nbsp;into the Start menu search box, then press Ctrl-Shift-Enter to launch it as an administrator.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Type <b>sfc /scannow</b>&nbsp;at the command prompt to begin the System File Check.</li></ol>
