<h2>            creating a training matrix that flags training required</h2>
                    Hello, looking for a template or help creating a training matrix / tracker for staff in a care home.
<br />
<br />
I want to track multiple mandatory training programmes with different schedules for refreshers so that when a staff member needs to do training again it is flagged in red or a reminder pops up on the computer.&nbsp; The matrix needs to be printable and preferably
 with the functionality to create reports for different training programmes in order to demonstrate compliance to the powers that be.&nbsp; I've selected excel as the topic, but happy with any office programme that works incl. Access.<br />
<br />
Any help gladly accepted as I am pushed for time and want to spend as little time on this as possible.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            <p>There aren't that many Excel templates out there that are going to suit such specific requirements. I could probably help you create one, but it would take considerably longer over this forum than via email and/or skype. Why don't you draft something in
 Excel to start with? Such as:</p>
<p>One sheet that lists the names of the people that need to train, and any other information that you require to track about them.</p>
<p>One sheet that lists the trainings and refreshers, their schedules, and any other information that you require to track about them.</p>
<p>One sheet that emulates the historical data.</p>
<p>Each of these sheets should have headings in row 1, and data beginning in row two. You'll want to provide perhaps 10 rows of sample data, whether real or not.</p>
<p>Load it up here for anyone to help or email it to me. Email is in my signature.</p>

    <title>SUBFORM DROP DOWN LIST - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reneed14  say:</h3>
<h2>            SUBFORM DROP DOWN LIST</h2>
                    <p>I have a form that shows employee name, estimated start time, estimated end time, a yes/no check box which all these fields are in one table. I would like to have a subform where I can select what unit # the employee&nbsp;is working on and there maybe be more

            You need a table (call it tblEmployeeUnits) something like this:
<div><br />
<div>EmployeUnitID PK Autonumber</div>
<div>EmployeeID (Foreign Key)</div>
<div>UnitID (FK)</div>
<div>TimeSpent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your subform is bound to this table and linked tot he main form on EmployeeID. You add a combobox for the user to select the Unit and a text box to enter the Time.</div>

            Did you try doing what I suggested? You have a one to many relationship since a worker can be&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;multiple units. Therefore, you need a child table like I suggested, whihc requires that the Units be assigned using a subform.&nbsp;

            If you have multiple units per company then you will need tables for both units and companies as well as the EmployeeUnits table on which the subform is based, e.g.<br />
<br />
Units<br />
....UnitID (PK)<br />
....UnitNumber<br />
....CompanyID (FK)<br />
<br />
Companies<br />
....CompanyID (PK)<br />
....Company<br />
<br />
Each table can have further columns of course to represent other attributes of Units and Companies respectively.&nbsp; Diagrammatically your model is like this:<br />
<br />
Employees----&lt;EmployeeUnits&gt;----Units&gt;----Companies<br />
<br />
EmployeeUnits is modelling a binary many-to-many relationship type between Employees and Units by resolving it into two one-to-many relationship types.<br />
<br />
In the subform the combo box in which the unit is selected would be set up as follows:<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnitID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT UnitID, UnitNumber, Company FROM Units INNER JOIN Companies ON Units.CompanyID = Companies.CompanyID&nbsp; ORDER BY UnitNumber;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm;2cm;3cm<br />
ListWidth:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert them.&nbsp; The important thing is that the first ColumnWidths dimension is zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; Experiment with the other dimensions to get the best fit.&nbsp;
 The ListWidth should be the sum of the ColumnWidths dimensions.<br />
<br />
To enter a unit number which is not currently represented in the Units table you can type it into the combo box and use its NotInList event procedure to open a form bound to the Units table, passing the new value to it.&nbsp; In this form you'd select the company
 to which the unit relates via combo box, whose NotInList event procedure will allow you to enter a new company of necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll find examples of the use of the NotInList event in the file NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
In this little demo file you'll see that there is a form in which you can enter a new city in a combo box, which opens a form in which you can select or enter the region in which the city is located.&nbsp; This is analogous to your situation.<br />

            <p>This part has me confused:<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT UnitID, UnitNumber, Company FROM Units INNER JOIN Companies ON Units.CompanyID = Companies.CompanyID&nbsp; ORDER BY UnitNumber;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My unit #'s are in their own table called UNITINFO and is seperate from the Company name table called COMPANY INFORMATION but are linked by COMPANYID (PK) in the COMPANY INFORMATION TABLE. On my UNITINFO table UNITID is the PK and then UNIT # is the field
 name where the # is stored that I would like to&nbsp;be able to use on my subform.&nbsp; The main form comes from a table called WORKED DAYS with the following field names:<br />
ID (PK)</p>
<p>DAY WORKED</p>
<p>START TIME</p>
<p>END TIME</p>
<p>WOKRED</p>
<p>ODL REC'D</p>
<p>WORKER</p>
<p>The field called WORKER is set to look up the name from a query that has been created to add the workers first &amp; last names togehter as they are stored in the table called EMPLOYEENAME in seperate fields. Now I have created a table called EMPLUNIT with these
 fields:<br />
EMPLOYEEID (PK) (also the PK on my EMPLOYEENAME table)<br />
UNITID (PK)</p>
<p>EMPLOYEEUNITID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this help for you to understand my configuration a little better?</p>

            First, You should not be storing Worker name in your Worked Days table. You should be storing the EmployeeID. That's part of your problem&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As I said, initially, you should have a main form bound to the Worked Days table and a subform bound to EMPLUNIT table. Linked on EmployeeID. You can't have a link on EmployeeID if its not in the Worked Days table. So once you have properly set up the
 tables and forms, then your RowSource for the Unit combo on the subform would be be:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select UNITID, UNIT# from UNITINFO;</div>

            Firstly you need to make the changes Scott describes.&nbsp; I'd then suggest you consider extending&nbsp; the RowSource property of the combo box in the way I described so that it shows in its drop down list not only the unit number, but also the name of the company
 to aid the user in selecting the unit. The RowSource property to do this would be:<br />
<br />
SELECT UnitID, [Unit #], Company <br />
FROM UnitInfo INNER JOIN [Company Information]<br />
ON UnitInfo.CompanyID = [Company Information].CompanyID<br />
ORDER BY [Unit #];<br />
<br />
Set the combo box's other properties as I described in my earlier post.&nbsp; I've assumed that the column in [Company Information] which stores the company name is called Company.<br />
<br />
I've changed the table and column names in the above SQL statement to the commonly used convention of CamelCase to aid readability, using upper case only for SQL keywords.&nbsp; The table and column names themselves do not need to be changed, though you might wish
 to consider this.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>UNITID</p>

I am having a hard time wrapping my brain around how these are all connected especially since I have to take the employee name from the query that puts last name &amp; first name together.

<h2>            Outlook 2013 People Search Not Working</h2>
                    <p>The People search returns no results on Outlook 2013. &nbsp;Search works everywhere else (in mail folders), even the People quick search works. &nbsp; As a precaution, I repaired the Office 2013 software. &nbsp; I followed the instructions in MSKB 276951 and even rebuilt
 the search index. &nbsp; But no matter what I try, I can no longer search through my 400+ contacts. &nbsp; Any ideas on how to fix this? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Creating Multiple documents with common sections</h2>
                    
<p>I am looking for some feedback on a challenge I have come across.&nbsp; Here is what I am trying to achieve:</p>
<p>I need to create 7 documents that share some common sections.&nbsp; My goal is to create the common sections someplace that will allow me to update the common sections in one place and these changes automatically get update in each of the 7 documents.&nbsp; I realize
 I can insert objects (i.e. Text from file or bookmarks) and it will work, but here are the issues I am seeing:</p>
<p>- My 7 documents have "numbered lists" and the common sections end up in different places through out my 7 documents.&nbsp; For example, in Document A, the Specifications section would be numbered 5 (with subsections under this) and then in Doc B, the specificaiton
 section is 8.&nbsp; If I embed a document, I cannot update the numbering between docs.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; When I embed a document, I seem to have formating issues.&nbsp; I might be able to resolve this, the issue above still prevents me from doing this.</p>
<p>I have considered putting all of this in Access and creating a report for each document (with approriate cross refernce tables to identify the sections numbers and what content would be included), but this is more work than I have time for right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just looking for suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi ProcBizGuy</p>
<p>You can do this using INCLUDETEXT fields. In the document containing the common material (the source document, bookmark each portion that you want to be able to refer to in the other documents. Then, in the target documents, where you want the text replicated,
 insert an INCLUDETEXT field pointing to the relevant bookmark in the source document. See Word's help file for more details.</p>

            Hi, MT_TG. Welcome to the forum!<br />
<br />
We believe you are only getting this behavior with the Viber app, correct? If no, verify first that the internet connection of the phone is up and running by browsing any websites via phone's browser. If the connection is active, try accessing the internet-based
 apps on your phone.<br />
<br />
If the issue only happens with Viber, we suggest checking the below links for possible solutions regarding this issue:<br />

<br />
Before doing the steps, consider uninstalling and then re-installing the app first.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps or not.

<h2>            Setting each of the &#126;25 Lock properties on each shape on a page to false</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to iterate through each shape on a page to set each locking property to false. I don't want any shapes locked.</p>
<p>The pseudo code is something like:</p>
<p>For each Shape on the Page</p>
<p>&nbsp; Shape.LockCalcWH = 0</p>
<p>&nbsp; Shape.LockWidth = 0</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recorded a macro to set LockCalcWH to 0, and it produced this code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ActiveWindow.Shape.CellsSRC(visSectionObject, visRowLock, visLockCalcWH).FormulaU = "0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it seems clear that my pseudo code lacks an understanding of the Visio object model. I am trying to get my head around CellsSRC. Parameter 3 is clear to me. But I am quite confused as to what to enter for the first two parameters. I understand that the
 3 parameters are section, row, and column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hmmm....I see that some sections (e.g.,&nbsp;User-defined cells, ShapeData) have&nbsp;rows and columns on the ShapeSheet, but the Protection section just seems to have rows and no columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've got it - for the Protection section, there seems to be a sort of artificial row placeholder, which is called visRowLock. I ran the following code (sorry out my Hungarian notation!) in VB.Net, and it worked.</p>

<h3> bigb_13  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows Mobile Facebook application &#40;v1.3&#41; will not install from Windows Marketplace on my Samsung SGH-i637</h2>
                    
<p>The Windows Marketplace prompted me to install a new Facebook for Windows Mobile 6.5 yesterday. &nbsp;The marketplace shows this was released 11/24/2010. &nbsp;When I try to install the Facebook application, I receive an error that states "Facebook for Windows Mobile
 could not be installed." &nbsp;I have tried installing on both the device and the memory card, with the same results. &nbsp;I have also gone as far as to reset the device to factory defaults, and attempted to install this application before any others, but still receive
 the same error. &nbsp;The worse part is that the upgrade has removed my existing version, and I can not find the older version to install, so I now have no&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;application at all that will work.</p>
<p>I cannot find any Microsoft support site for this, even though the application states it is "from Microsoft".</p>
<p>Thank you for any help regarding this issue,</p>

<p>Thank you j.andrewy27. &nbsp;That did work, but...this was the older version that I had to begin with. &nbsp;This is not the same newer version that the marketplace is still saying I need to update to. &nbsp;However, this is much better than no working Facebook app at
 all! &nbsp;I do thank you for pointing me to this version. &nbsp;Now, if I could find and manually install the newer version, wonder if that would work???</p>

<p>hello xboxbrian,</p>
<p>I'm very happy for having helped you to install facebook to your mobile although it is&nbsp;the&nbsp;ancient version and you got back your facebook application on your phone :) Just keep in touch with this thread, I will do a search about this and when I will found
 the a link to a newer version of facebook for windows mobile I will just paste the link for you to give it a try :) and install it the same way&nbsp;you did with the older version. Sometimes microsoft is a bit late about uploading new&nbsp;application to their site,
 don't know wether it is for testing purposes or any other things. Just keep in touch with your thread, I promise that when I find the newer version, I will send it to you :)</p>
<p>Hope I was able to help you at least one problem is resolved and the other one just a little bit more patience my friend :)</p>

<p>hello tito335,</p>
<p>apparently a lot of users are having problems with the new release of facebook. I don't know wether it is compatibility issue with windows phone 7 and 6. I've done my research about this and finally found a standalone installation for the facebook ver1.4.
 Uninstall the previous version of facebook you have and install the new version manually. Send it to your mobile via your USB cable and then install it either on your storage card or device memory but it is preferable to send it to the storage card. Keep the
 device memory as empty as possible for speed reasons.</p>
<p>here is the link, I have uploaded the standalone installation on my megaupload account, I've scanned it with norton internet security 2010 and I assure you that this is not a virus. Already tested and working on HTC HD2</p>

<p>Thanks again j.andrewy27. &nbsp;I did download your 1.1.0.26 cab file and first manually removed the previous version of Facebook mobile, then tried to install to both the&nbsp;storage&nbsp;card and the device. &nbsp;In both cases, the installation was unsuccessful, however,
 the error I received using this method was slightly more detailed than the error I have been receiving when &nbsp;trying to install from the marketplace.</p>
<p>Here is the error I am receiving using this manual installation method, "Installation was unsuccessful. The program or setting cannot be installed because it does not have sufficient system permissions."</p>
<p>This error has only appeared trying to install this new Facebook app. &nbsp;I have successfully installed both apps from the Windows marketplace, and manually installed apps such as Slingplayer and Opera Mini, without receiving such an error.</p>
<p>I can only guess that this new version of Facebook is trying to access part of the ROM that is locked down on many devices, but apparently not all, running Windows Mobile 6.5.</p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>

<p>I've read an article just now that says that microsoft is discontinuing support for windows mobile 6.X for facebook just too bad. But I have downloaded 3 versions for you including version 1.3 in it. Let's consider it as our last chance to finally make the
 final version of facebook work on windows mobile 6.1 :) one final hope lol</p>

<h2>            Excel app crashes when opening a file downloaded from Outlook mail.</h2>
                    I have a Sony Xperia ZL with Android 5.1 - My school sends a lot of mails and often with Excel schedule sheets. I download them (tested both with mobile data and Wi-fi) from the Outlook E-mail app and when I open the file Excel app crashes. Any help? (sometimes
 crashes after 2-5 seconds of leaving it open). Phone has been factory reset recently, so I don't think it's a file issue or something. I already tried reinstalling the app.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can I sync more than 1 contacts folder from OUtlook 2007&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone, <br />
<br />
Am using Vista and Outlook 2007. <br />
<br />
I have a contacts folder that sync to my phone. Now I want to make another folder and called it 'Business' and sync that as well. I made the folder and added contacts to it, but it doesn't sync. Only the default 'Contacts' folder will sync.
<br />
<br />
Is what I'm asking to do, possible?<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Yes, there is a way. A third party application called PocketMirror Professional will help you achieve that. You try download a trial from

            Hello LuisSmith, 
<br />
<br />I understand that you are having an issue with logging into your old Outlook account. I know how frustrating this is and I will try my best to advise you on this.
<br />
<br />In order for me to properly assist you, I need additional information from you:
<br />
<br />1. What is the error message?
<br />2. Can I ask when was the last time did you log in to Hotmail?
<br />
<br />I find this article may be helpful to you: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402697...</a>
<br />
<br />If the error message is, "Microsoft account doesn't exist anymore..."
<br />
<br />Your Microsoft account might have been deleted due to inactivity. You may refer to Microsoft Services Agreement section 4aii: 
<br /><code>ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.</code>
<br />
<br />I am sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />I hope my answer is helpful to you. :) 
<br />
<br />Regards, 
<br />Sutharsan

            <p>Hello Rddvl,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community! I' be happy to assist you with your concern on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand when you send emails with attachments the emails bounce back&nbsp;but you don't encounter this issue when emails without attachments are sent. If so,&nbsp;please provide the affected email address and the messsage header of the bounce email
 in the private message area that I've created for&nbsp;us to determine the cause of the issue. The steps on how to get the message header are&nbsp;also provided&nbsp;in the private message area.&nbsp;Just click on the "You have a private reply to this message" link above your
 post to view the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, kindly provide us more infomation about your concern by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&nbsp;are the file types of the attachments in&nbsp;your email? </li><li>What is the total file size of the attachments that you are trying to send? </li><li>Do you encounter this issue when sending emails with attachments to a specific contact or to all your contacts?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>it does not matter the size: if it does not have attachments, I receive the message, if there are attachments, I don't. It can be JPEG, Word document (.docx), etc.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting, I am concerned whats going on here as Skype has no call recording components. I seem to recall that on some Android devices it would show a red banner with something like "Skype is using your Microphone" or "Microphone Recording" when
 it was infact simply being used in a Skype call.</p>
<p><br />
Can you confirm some more information around what your seeing.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Raymond,
<br />
<br />If it works in IE, it means that this is not an issue  with OWA but with Google Chrome. You will have to contact Google support for that. 
<br />In the meantime you can try to delete the cache and test it in in-private mode.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions, if not - please mark the topic as solved.
<br />
<br />Thank you,
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Manuela

<p>This might be because the new Skype on Desktop, <em>which you are using</em>, doesn't support chat commands. If you want to utilize this feature, it will be best to use the classic desktop client instead. Follow the steps below to download the classic Skype
 for Windows desktop <em>version 7.40</em>. </p>

<p><span>Hi Ajey,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have done some tests based on your description. About importing contacts manually as I mentioned above, sorry for my unclear explanation. This is another workaround for the shared mailbox. However, the shared mailbox contacts only can show in the
 people list, not in the “To” list. Therefore, it cannot meet your requirements.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To achieve your requirements, there is one workaround. You need to create a new address list directly and set up condition to show related people from the original GAL.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before doing that, I suggest you create the mail user with special company name. After that, you can create a new address list to show these users. Here are steps:</span></p>

<p>Hi tkfuzzkid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have noticed that the post has been inactive for quite some time. We'd like to confirm if you are still experiencing the same issue. If so, are you using Outlook.com or the Outlook application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the Outlook application, you may follow these steps on how to change the default font size for messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>File</strong> tab, choose <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Mail</strong>.</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f71ebc7cf-2b27-4b98-a86d-6fbddc3c1389.png" /></li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Compose messages</strong>, choose <strong>Stationery and Fonts</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <strong>Personal Stationery</strong> tab, under <strong>New mail messages</strong> or
<strong>Replying or forwarding messages</strong>, choose <strong>Font</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Font</strong> box, choose the font, style, size, and color that you want to use. You can see a preview of your changes as you make them.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose <strong>OK</strong> three times to return to Outlook. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>Your new settings will take effect immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>You have to set your font preferences independently for both new messages and replies and forwards.</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>If the font that you choose isn't installed on the recipient's computer, then the recipient's mail program substitutes an available font.</em></p>
</li></ul>

    <title>Why do you want to force people to completely disable Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kizzume fowler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do you want to force people to completely disable Windows Update altogether&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When you take away people's choice in what updates they want to install, you're forcing people to turn off ALL updates, since it's pretty much the only option at that point if people want any sort of choice. &nbsp;People will simply turn off the services that
 allow Windows Update to run so Windows Update won't work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought your goal was to get people to keep their computers up-to-date with <strong>
important</strong> updates, particularly security updates. &nbsp;The way you're doing this, it's going to completely backfire on you and will leave many people's computers open to some really bad things. &nbsp;You could have simply given people the choice of whether
 to install updates <strong>other</strong> than important security updates, but you're taking away people's choices completely. &nbsp;<strong>Deferring</strong> the choice for
<strong>30 days</strong> on the Pro edition is <strong>still forcing</strong> people to install updates
<strong>they may never want</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't Microsoft understand human psychology? &nbsp;This has to be one of the most stupid moves Microsoft has
<strong>ever</strong> made. &nbsp;This is like the original plans for XBox One to force people to have it online all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft just doesn't seem to learn from their mistakes, which is their complete disregard for human psychology and human nature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bet within a year, Microsoft will be forced to give people a choice as sales won't be meeting the projected figures. &nbsp;This is going to go over by the public worse than Windows 8. &nbsp;Just watch. &nbsp;People are going to feel it's "big brother"--the same mindset
 that was behind the original plans for XBox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just watch.</p>

</p><p>That is all well and good, but if your machine is unbootable because of a driver/patch gone sour - then you will have serious trouble in even being able to use those steps. I still say we should have control over updates that are/are not installed. Why cant
 we simply have the option to untick an update like we can in windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This simply does not make sense to me or a lot of others it would seem - think MS need to listen and change this very soon imho.</p>

<div>The easiest way: &nbsp;Type Opt-F11 (also hold the fn-key down if you're using a laptop) to enter the Visual Basic Editor (VBE). In the VBE, choose "Immediate Window" from the View menu. Then type or paste this in the window that opens:</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Commandbars(1).Reset</div>
<div><br />
<div>followed by the Return key. Type Opt-F11 again to return to XL. Close XL to save the preferences.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Slightly harder, but less scary for those that don't like VBA: With ALL Office apps CLOSED, navigate in the Finder to the&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Having issues with Excel 2013 &#40;Changing Data source with pivot table&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a trouble with Excel 2013 files with Pivot Tables and was wondering if MS community will be able to guide me in the right direction to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>When I am trying to change a data source (pivot table) from Analyze Tab -&gt; Change Data Source, Excel would grey out either Select a table or range or Use an external data source from time to time. &nbsp;The problem is that when I want to change the data source,
 I have no way of doing so as another option is greyed out.</p>
<p>For example, I have an excel sheet (in .xlsx format) that I download from a web server. &nbsp;All pivot tables are pre-configured to show the data. &nbsp;Now, I have another sheet of raw data I just copy pasted from another excel file (report) I queried and I would
 like to change the PivotTable Data Source from "Use an external data source" to "Select a table or range" so that I can choose the sheet that I just copy pasted which has rawdata.</p>
<p>What could be an issue? I am pretty sure I was able to do this a while ago but now that it's been a while I can't find what the issue is and why Excel is not letting me change back and forth from Select a table or range to Use an external data source.</p>
<p>Any pointers or help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
