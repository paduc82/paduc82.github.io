    <title>Error 1402 while installing Adobe Acrobat - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error 1402 while installing Adobe Acrobat</h2>
                    Adobe Acrobat 8 stopped working when I upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; I was unable to either repair the program in place or remove it.&nbsp; At the suggestion of Adobe, I used Windows Install Clean-up to remove the remnants of Acrobat 8 and attempted to install Acrobat
 9.&nbsp; Now I get a failure with an error 1402 and the path to the error key is \UNKNOWN\Components\ and a lot of hex characters which don't offer me a clue as to where to find a bad record in the registry.&nbsp; At the further recommendation of Adobe, I removed all
 of their products from my system.&nbsp; I still get an "unable to write" to a key that only exists in an "unknown" location.&nbsp; I need to work with pdf files and I am stuck.

            I had already removed all traces of all Adobe programs when I got the 1402 error code.&nbsp; The problem occurred after copying all files to the hard disk and trying to write new values to the registry.&nbsp; It was not a problem with Adobe, although they spent
 hours on the phone with me trying to resolve the issue.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I took a few hours to completely re-install Windows 7, from scratch, and the problem was resolved.&nbsp; I was able to retain my settings and still fixed the problem.&nbsp; If that hadn't worked, I was prepared to do a "clean" install, reformatting the disk and starting
 over.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I do have one major complaint with the installation process.&nbsp; I was upgrading from Windows Vista Ultimate which had been operating quite well in both English and Japanese.&nbsp; I was upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate which I also intended to use bilingually.&nbsp; But
 the installation software decided, on it own, that I was changing from an English installation to a Japanese installation and refused to copy any of my settings.&nbsp; Major Bummer.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 mouse cursor jumpy</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a second hand surface pro 4, everything was going fine until today when the mouse started to jump randomly when i used the touchpad from my type cover. I tried everything i found on the internet, changing the power settings, disabling touch
 controls, reinstalling the type cover driver and reconnecting the type cover.</p>
<p>Nothing worked, can any of you guys suggest me a fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks heaps!</p>

            Sorry for the confusion with two separate threads.&nbsp; I did one at work&nbsp; and couldn't find my original,&nbsp;the other at home used my default ID.<br />
This does work with win explorer now so the problem must be with this other non microsoft application (IBM).<br />
I'll have to work with them with this.&nbsp; It does work with all other versions of Windows.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is getting a BSOD and specifying that it's a driver power state failure. I used WHOCRASHED and it told me that it was "probably caused by the following module:
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ntoskrnl.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ntoskrnl.exe</a></span> (nt+0x14F1A0) " for the last 10 crashes.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>It crashes whenever I close/re-open the lid (sleep) and when I restart it will often take an extremely long time and sometimes show a BSOD. Somtimes the computer will become unresponsive during use and then i'll get a BSOD.&nbsp;</p>

Thanks in advance, Tane</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s After some googling it seemed that the Intel RST/ raid was the cause and out of dat0e. I looked for it in control panel but found no such driver ( intel 7 series chipset family SATA AHCI controlled was there instead. This driver is up to date)</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tane,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that your computer crashes and gives BSOD whenever you close and reopen lid.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue is caused by these faulty modules:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Pshed.dll</span></li><li><span>Bootvid.dll</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the instructions below to resolve the issue:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Disconnect all External connected devices.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disconnect all the external devices except keyboard and mouse.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Perform Chkdsk to fix harddisk error</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, type &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>cmd</strong>, and then press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.</span></li><li><span>If the <strong>User Account Control</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>chkdsk /r</strong> and hit
<strong>enter</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want <strong>chkdsk</strong> to correct disk errors, you cannot have open files on the drive. If files are open, the following error message appears:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>‚ÄúChkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)‚Äù&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose to check the drive the next time you restart the computer,
<strong>chkdsk</strong> checks the drive and corrects errors automatically when you restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector
 if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After completing chkdsk see if the issue persists.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Prashant,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you posting on Microsoft Communities Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that ‚ÄúDriver Power State Failure‚Äù error whenever you restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be because of the driver incompatibility, BIOS update, due to the external hardware which is connected to the system doesn‚Äôt have proper digital signatures and due to Advance Power
 management setting in the BIOS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get better clarification on this please answer the question below.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the model number of the Gigabyte mother board?</span></li><li><span>Have you installed exact chipset software for Intel G2030 CPU?</span></li><li><span>Is your windows is up to date?</span></li><li><span>You mentioned that the issue occurred after the Windows update happened. Do you know which update caused the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You can try the method below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install all the Windows updates including optional updates</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can manually check for and install the update by following these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Make sure your PC is connected to stable internet.</span></li><li><span>Press ‚ÄúWindows Key + R‚Äù and Type ‚Äúwuapp‚Äù in the run box</span></li><li><span>Click on ‚ÄúCheck for updates‚Äù on the left pane</span></li><li><span>Install all the updates which is displayed, if it is slow internet connection try to install 10 updates at a time and restart the system and again try to install pending updates 10 at a time.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Go to Motherboard Manufacturer website and install the latest drivers
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer the below link to get the latest updates or Gigabyte mother board.</span></p>

</p><p><span><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/download-center.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/download-center.aspx</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disconnect external devices</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disconnect all external devices. External hardware such as USB peripherals can cause this error. If no errors occur while these devices are disconnected, visit the manufacturer‚Äôs website for
 the latest drivers or contact the hardware manufacturer for suggestions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Nitro Pro 8</h2>
                    I have been using Nitro Pro 8 to create PDFs.&nbsp; It has worked correctly.&nbsp; However, I just downloaded McAfee and now I cannot create PDFs using Nitro Pro.&nbsp; The error message I get is "occurrence of user-interacted or failed conversion".&nbsp; The only change
 to my PC has been downloading McAfee.&nbsp; I just exited an on-line chat session with McAfee and they say it's not their problem.&nbsp; I have a Lenovo all in one.&nbsp; Have also tried using Lenovo support and cannot get past their pre-determined questions.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

check the path if the dll file .. if it locate in a place such as \AppData\this cannot be a system file..
<br />
may be a third party software/malware has tampered with startup items....<br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>(1)</b>&nbsp; if there is anything related to the&nbsp; .exe u you have described here , at system tray start up disable it ..<br />

<br />
try to use "Autoruns for Windows"&nbsp; and check whether there is a startup entry related to the .exe u you have described and if so remove it..

you may use regedit.. Press windows R key and type regedit and click ok.. <b>(before editing export the key your are going to edit or delete)</b><br />
then navigate to these paths.. <br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]<br />
<br />
then look for .exe file you have described here and delete that key.. REBOOT

            After the suggested restart and remove and reinstall try checking to see if the Netflix app is down. Hulu and Netflix sometimes have load issues based on the device it is being launched on from the streaming services not xbox.

<p>Hi Mario</p>
<p>Are you refering to the Wallpaper for the Desktop background?</p>
<p>If so, that wallpaper is simply an image and you can use any image you wish.</p>
<p>If I am not understanding, please provide more details.</p>

            <p>Try setting the laptop to a lower&nbsp; resolution in which both monitors work. Or try lower resolutions for laptop and check which one will work.&nbsp;<br />
Perhaps 1024 x 768.</p>
<p>If Windows can't identify the additional display, you can manually open the New Display Detected dialog box by using one of the following methods:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢Press the keyboard shortcut on your mobile PC that turns on an additional display. The function (FN) keyboard shortcut FN+F5 is used for this purpose on many mobile PCs. To determine which keyboard shortcut turns on an additional display, check the information
 that came with your mobile PC, or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢Open Windows Mobility Center by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Mobile PC, and then clicking Windows Mobility Center.
</p>
<p>Then, on the External Display tile, click Connect display even if it says "Connected".</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem I am facing is on start up of windows 10 on my HP pavilion it gives me an error that says THE PARAMETER IS INCORRECT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no external drive plugged in at the time of start-up because the fixes that are described&nbsp;online are for a fix on an external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance&nbsp;will be highly&nbsp;appretiated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that maybe the latest windows updated could fix the error so I am in the process of upgrading</p>

    <title>iCloud for Windows installer problem with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gurujon  say:</h3>
<h2>            iCloud for Windows installer problem with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with icloud installer that I downloaded from the apple site:&nbsp;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204283 and clicked the download button. &nbsp;I saved it to my desktop. &nbsp;Ran the application as an Administrator. &nbsp;Below is the versioning information
 for iCloud installer file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6051769c-d320-47fb-8812-dbe37d01a5cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6051769c-d320-47fb-8812-dbe37d01a5cf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation went on as normal and at the end it threw up an error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8bd43ad-2098-4535-89b6-2f6b5a6b3846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8bd43ad-2098-4535-89b6-2f6b5a6b3846" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On clicking OK. &nbsp;The following happened. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50e274c1-6227-4ec3-9592-18f7450ca6a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50e274c1-6227-4ec3-9592-18f7450ca6a8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9073dd23-9703-408c-b9b1-0578c64cdd03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9073dd23-9703-408c-b9b1-0578c64cdd03" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some information that you might find useful:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76d92d7c-f713-4321-8bc6-335182f694db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76d92d7c-f713-4321-8bc6-335182f694db" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I have done is several things. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Services and started the Windows Installer Service as per instructions I found on this site:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/problem-with-windows-installer-package-in-windows/50bded74-c05a-45cb-aee7-851da34d2f53</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the following:</p>
<p>
Press Windows key + X and then click on run as administrator.<br />
At the command prompt type each of the commands below and after typing each command press enter.&nbsp;<br />
msiexec /unreg&nbsp;<br />
msiexec /regserver
</p><p>
</p><p>Again information gleamed from this site:&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/install-itunes-with-windows-10-apple-support-says/23964cd2-084e-4c53-b940-9c964e5515c4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the instructions on this link:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/i-tried-to-reinstall-icloud-but-i-get-error/9d56cced-0209-41f3-b260-42957b880b45</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to apple who tell me its a problem with Microsoft. &nbsp;I imagine that is quite an easy answer to give. &nbsp;But I have got reference to pursue the matter further with them if Microsoft are not able to help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grateful of any help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: My PC is up to date with patching and I downloaded the software from apple today. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Start by uninstalling every single piece of Apple Software you have installed. This includes iCloud itself, iTunes, Apple Support software etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally recommend you use Revouninstaller to thoroughly remove all Apple Software. Its a possibility you might encounter the same error attempting to uninstall each without Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at http://www.revouninstaller.com (freeware). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure you uninstall the Apple Software Updater itself too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing iCloud and iTunes again. </p>

The most important thing to remember is: If it sounds too good to be true; it probably is...<br />
<br />
This is a pretty common statement throughout life and applies perfectly in these common e-mail scams outlined below.<br />
<br />
Read through the 5 types of email scams below and learn how to recognize each kind, and help protect yourself!<br />
<br />
<br />
Verify your account now to avoid it being closed!</span><br />
<br />
This is a scam email circulating that several Hotmail users have received asking them to verify their Hotmail account. This is a scam designed to gain access to your Hotmail account so spammers can use it to send out spam.<br />
<br />
Sample:<br />
<br />
From: @hotmail.com<br />
<br />
Subject: Hotmail Warning (Verify Your Hotmail Account now To Avoid It Closed)‚Äè‚Äè<br />
<br />
Date: Sun, 10 Aug 2008 19:28:54 +0000<br />
<br />
Dear Account User<br />
<br />
This Email is from Hotmail Customer Care and we are sending it to every Hotmail Email User Accounts Owner for safety. we are having congestions due to the anonymous registration of Hotmail accounts so we are shutting down some Hotmail accounts and your account
 was among those to be deleted. We are sending you this email to so that you can verify and let us know if you still want to use this account. If you are still interested please confirm your account by filling the space below.Your User name, password, date
 of birth and your country information would be needed to verify your account.<br />
<br />
Due to the congestion in all Hotmail users and removal of all unused Hotmail Accounts, Hotmail would be shutting down all unused Accounts, You will have to confirm your E-mail by filling out your Login Information below after clicking the reply button, or your
 account will be suspended within 24 hours for security reasons.<br />
<br />
* Username: ..............................<br />
<br />
* Password: ................................<br />
<br />
* Date of Birth: ............................<br />
<br />
* Country Or Territory: ................<br />
<br />
After following the instructions in the sheet, your account will not be interrupted and will continue as normal. Thanks for your attention to this request. We apologize for any inconveniences.<br />
<br />
Warning!!! Account owner that refuses to update his/her account after two weeks of receiving this warning will lose his or her account permanently.<br />
<br />
How to tell it‚Äôs a scam?<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It asks for your personal information. No legitimate company, especially Microsoft, will ever ask you to provide you username, password, date of birth and/or country, credit card information, etc via email.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The email is generally unprofessional or unpolished looking, including:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice the branding (logo &amp; background image) on the mail. The header only goes half-way across.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; Random words are capitalized in the email, including: Email, Email User Accounts Owner, User, Accounts and others.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second sentence, the first word of the sentence, ‚Äúwe‚Äù is not capitalized.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp; There is poor grammar throughout, but especially in the final statement, ‚ÄúWarning!!! Account owner that refuses to update‚Ä¶‚Äù<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an urgency of response time. This pressures you to feel like you need to make a decision more quickly and do not have time to research the legitimacy of it.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signature is incomplete, stating awkwardly: ‚ÄúThe Windows Live Hotmail‚Äù, not ‚ÄúWindows Live Hotmail‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Windows Live Hotmail Team‚Äù.<br />
<br />
Two other similar scam emails that we have seen come to Hotmail accounts:<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ebay account suspension notices that ask you to verify your account information.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paypal needs you to resubmit your credit card and bank account information.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is actual text from a scam e-mail received, promising $7M to provide personal information.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;‚ÄúThe outcome of the summit has prompted the Federal Government to empower only our Bank; First Bank of Nigeria PLC to Identify the owners of these funds and pay them outright with no delay. We have been asked to start the payment of US$7,000,000.00 (SEVEN
 MILLION US DOLLAR) as compensation to all affected Persons(Entities)i.e:&nbsp; Individuals Companies and organizations.<br />
<br />
You are one of the Beneficiaries on our list submitted to us so please reply to our mail for confirmation so that we can begin forwarding all other necessary evidences, facts and needed information to you.<br />
<br />
The Federal Government has earlier approved the release and payment of the accumulated funds in the Bank belonging to the Foreigners, but my boss Mr Jacobs Ajekigbe and the Former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) collaborated together and refused
 to notify and tell you the truth on how to claim your fund. My Boss and the Governor are using the accumulative-interest to enrich themselves without the knowledge of the owners including you.<br />
<br />
Confirm to me your:<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal Information;<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone and Fax Number;<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banking Information‚Äù<br />
<br />
How to tell it‚Äôs a scam?<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reference to ‚ÄúFirst Bank of Nigeria‚Äù (or any other international sounding bank name), which is a common trick in scam emails.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odd capitalizations throughout the email.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did this government employee find my email address?<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are they randomly giving people $7 M?<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are they airing the dirty laundry of a conspiracy to not tell me?<br />
<br />
<br />
You won something!</span><br />
<br />
Scammers commonly impersonate/use large companies that it‚Äôs likely you do business with. This next example appears to be from Microsoft, but it‚Äôs not. Read through the email below, to see if you can spot all the ways to tell it‚Äôs a scam, and then read through
 my list of things that tipped me off.<br />

<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ‚Äúfriendly name‚Äù that the email is from is ‚ÄúMicrosoft Promotion Team‚Äù, but if you look at the actual email address it came from (Memmi82@netti.fi), it‚Äôs not a Microsoft address, or a promotion management company.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reply-to address is a gmail address. Microsoft would not use a competitor‚Äôs email service as their reply-to address. Additionally, it‚Äôs different than the sender address.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not addressed to an individual. Occasionally, there are legitimate sweepstakes that you‚Äôre notified via email, but they will be addressed to you as an individual.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The email begins, ‚ÄúThe prestigious Microsoft and AOL‚Ä¶‚Äù A corporation wouldn‚Äôt tout themselves like that. And more likely in a legitimate sweepstakes email winning notification, it would start out with something like, ‚ÄúCongratulations, you have just
 won‚Ä¶‚Äù<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It asks for your personal information. No legitimate company, especially Microsoft, will ever ask you to provide you username, password, date of birth and/or country, credit card information, etc, via email.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sudden emergency!</span><br />
<br />
You receive email that appears to be from one of your friends that says they are stranded and need only a few thousand dollars to help them out.&nbsp; Any person would help a true friend if they can, right?&nbsp; Sure they would, but before you respond or act, ask yourself
 about the likelihood of your friend being in that situation.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have they mentioned that they will be traveling? <br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do they regularly participate in the kind of activity described? <br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanity check the information and if at the end you still aren't sure, then pick up the phone and call them.<br />
<br />
Today's technologies make it easy to impersonate someone and hard to find out whom is really behind the act. We must all realize that each piece of information we read and act upon has the time needed to pass our logic checks before we respond.&nbsp; One false click,
 and it result in you needing to spend time recovering your email, blog, or other service; or it could be months regaining your identity.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don‚Äôt forward this email, something bad will happen.</span><br />
<br />
We‚Äôve all seen emails that promise great things if you forward the email to all your contacts, or threaten bad things if you don‚Äôt.&nbsp; Topics Hotmail customers and friends have asked about most frequently are listed below, and link directly to the snopes.com
 articles debunking them:<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fee will be charged for Hotmail.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get cash from Microsoft, or other companies or get free items (gift certificates, phones, etc) for forwarding an email.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet petition to keep Messenger a free service.<br />
<br />
¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical appeals usually involving injured or sick children.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigate the information.</span><br />
<br />
Take some time and check up on the information. Often sites like snopes.com can provide information on known chain letters and other scams and untruths.&nbsp; Do not click on links within the mail, but do go to that company‚Äôs website, and contact their customer
 service reps via phone or online to verify the validity of the email.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp; Report suspicious activities.</span><br />
<br />
If you think someone has accessed your Hotmail account, that the Live ID sign-in page looks fraudulent, or you receive an email that tries to confirm a password change you didn‚Äôt authorize, change your password immediately by going to: http://account.live.com.
 Next, help ensure your PC has not been infected with a virus or malware by running a free full-PC scan.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;&nbsp; Help the Hotmail team identify new scams.</span><br />
<br />
Click on the Junk button in Hotmail and select ‚ÄúJunk‚Äù or ‚ÄúReport phishing scam‚Äù to report it to the Hotmail team. Whatever you do, do not reply back to the sender.

    <title>Ready NAS network visibility after latest windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guacanoele75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ready NAS network visibility after latest windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I read lots of threads about windows not being able to see the netgear nas drives after updates, I have made sure that SMB1 is ticked but still no joy. But what I have now is very
 weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has two profiles, one profile had access before the update and still does, the nas drive is still mapped, but when I go to add it again it does not show up in the network list.
 The other profile was created after the update, I cannot map the nas drive at all. But I can access it through the media bit of the network folder view. But the weird thing is office docs are not visible in the folders, it is only music, video and pics (media).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on one profile I can access everything through windows explorer but the other profile will only see media. I have tried switching off the nas drive, I've done SMB1 but it just appears
 that because the connection was existing on one profile it still works but from now on I cannot get it to work at all. What do I do, help!! I am not tech savvy so dont give me lots of blurb, just the basics LOL</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in accessing the NETGEAR NAS drive on your device after the Update.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Provide us additional information to assist you better with this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which Update has been installed recently?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you checked to make sure the NAS is in the same workgroup as your Windows 10 machines?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you getting any error code/error message while trying to access the NAS drive?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which Antivirus software is installed on your device?</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here are the few workaround you can try to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the below mentioned services are running.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + R
</span></strong>to open <strong><span>Run</span></strong>. Then type "<strong><span>Services.msc</span></strong>" in the run box and hit enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The names of the services which you will need to check are:
<br />
&nbsp;<strong><span>Function Discovery Provide Host. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;Function Discovery Resource Publication. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;SSDP Discovery.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;UPnP Device Host. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Also Check for DHCP Client and DNS Client.</span></strong> </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the above services and then go to properties.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Under General tab, make sure that the Startup type is automatic and Service status is running.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then go to recovery tab and change all the entries (next to 1st failure, 2nd failure and Subsequent failure) to Restart the Service.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Check if the Network sharing is ON</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open Control panel. Click on <strong>All Control Panel items</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Under Private, <strong>Turn ON </strong>the Discovery and File &amp; Printer sharing.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Enable NETBIOS over TCP/IP</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, Click on <strong>
Network and Sharing center</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Change Adapter Settings. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>Network Adapter</strong>-&gt;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click to select <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong> -&gt; Properties -&gt;<strong>Advanced</strong>-&gt;<strong>WINS</strong></span></p>
</li><li>

<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then check the status of the issue</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 4</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I see that you have already tried enabling the SMB1. However, please verify if you have followed the same procedure to ensure that you have followed the same procedure.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Programs &amp; Features</strong> &gt;
<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>From the list of options, one option would be <strong>
SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if there is a Checkbox associated with it and press
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
