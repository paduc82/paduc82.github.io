                    I simply want to change my device in profile to Samsung Note 8. &nbsp; I have the same phone number.&nbsp; So far it does not make any difference, since I am using the Note 8 now and connection with MS works fine. &nbsp; But....you never know when some rule changes.

<h2>            Is there any documentation ANYWHERE for Word VBA changes in Word 2016 vs. Word 2011&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work as an editor in book publishing and I have a bunch of copyediting macros that I painstakingly wrote and debugged over several years that now work beautifully in Word 2011 and have saved me from hours of repetitive document cleanup tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I've successfully hacked the ribbon UI in 2016 to get these macros to appear as groups of buttons in custom ribbon tabs that more or less correspond to my custom toolbars from Word 2011, I am discovering that the MACRO CODE ITSELF is behaving differently
 in Word 2016 vs. Word 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one example that randomly replaces accented é's with an ellipsis ( . . . )! Seriously.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macros that have gone buggy had been stable and problem free for years! What happened? Were there any release notes that I somehow missed or anything warning about changes in 2016 that would effect how legacy macros operated? I was expecting to have
 to tweak some syntax and deal with new members in the object model ("StylesPane" vs. "StylesTbx" or whatever), but I was NOT expecting random characters in my documents to start getting swapped out with other random text just because I don't want to have to
 re-write every macro I've ever written from scratch for Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are simple find/replace operations that I wrote macros to perform just to save a few clicks and keystrokes since I do them on every document I work on. It's not rocket science VBA that I'm working with here. I really didn't expect that macros based
 on simple find/replace functions would be incompatible between versions of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But to get to the point, my question for insiders is: is there <strong>any</strong> documentation
<strong>anywhere</strong> for the changes Microsoft made to how VBA code is handled in Word 2016 for Mac vs. Word 2011 for Mac that would allow me to anticipate--or at least to target my debugging energy toward--the most likely sources of incompatibility between
 macros written for 2011 vs macros written for 2016? I really don't want to debug this stuff line by line if I can avoid it. If I knew what Microsoft changed about Word Mac VBA functions for 2016, it sure would save me a lot of time in figuring out what I need
 to change or update to make my legacy macros functional in the new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance that Microsoft will ever produce something like release notes for VBA changes in Word Mac 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, is there anyone here in the publishing industry who has looked into switching over to Adobe InCopy for preproduction text editing? At this point I could probably learn the new environment and redo all my macros in GREP in about the same time it will
 take to debug my Word/VBA macros just to get them working again in Word.</p>

            <p>A belated thanks for the reply, Jim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links you provided don't have the kind of fine-grained info I'm looking for about differences in the VBA environment in 2016 vs. 2011, but thanks for taking a stab at answering.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'm just going to conclude that the answer to my question about whether any formal documentation exists for VBA in Word for Mac 2016 (or differences in VBA for 2016 vs 2011) is no, it doesn't exist anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been piecing together tips and observations on VBA in 2016 from a variety of sources (including many helpful answers on this forum), and of course I've been debugging on my own using good old trial and error, but it sure would be nice to have the difference
 between versions documented in one (searchable) place by the programmers who actually know what's different under the hood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to debug my most recent problem with ellipses on my own by using the Chr(201) character code instead of the ellipsis character itself, so my advice to others adapting macros they created in 2011 for use in 2016 is to go through all of your old
 VBA code and replace any remotely "special" characters (ellipses, en and em dashes, paragraph returns, letters with diacritics, etc.) with the specific chr codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I should have been using character codes all along, but in my defense, a) I'm completely self-taught in VBA, and b) the macro worked fine for years in 2011 and it was the "record macro" function that "wrote" the original macro using the ellipsis
 character rather than chr(201). I didn't write that one from scratch, but it never gave me trouble until now so I never really looked at the actual code.</p>

            <p>Yours is the first report I've noticed about this particular difference. Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, there aren't many changes in VBA from 2011 to 2016. A lot of features were dropped from the user interface in 2016. Some are still programmable using VBA. Others aren't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some new features that didn't exist in 2011 are supported by VBA. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The ellipsis thing might be a bug or might have something to do with the character set involved. If you feel it's a bug, use the Smile button in Word to report the problem to Microsoft.</p>

            The VB Editor in 2011 is the same as always, but the current VB Editor in 2016 is merely a stub. Microsoft plans to restore the VB Editor in 2016, although the time-frame for doing so is still ambiguous.

note they posted</a> on the Word Mac 2016 uservoice forum on January 29, 2016, which is why I posted this question in the first place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the two VBE environments are definitely NOT identical. Entire menus worth of commands are missing in 2016 compared to 2011. Just look.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you're familiar with what was available under Insert, Format, Debug, Run, and Tools in Word 2011, then these two screenshots provide a pretty good summary of what functionalities are missing in 2016. I look here after every update/release to see if anything
 has been added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty sure this is what Jim Gordon means when he says that the VBE for 2016 is "merely a stub."</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't even view the freaking object browser ("View--&gt;Object Browser" in 2011). So I guess we're just supposed to have native-speaker fluency in VBA and have the entire library of objects, classes, members, and constants memorized if we want to write
 code for Word 2016?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have no idea how to create a user form if there's no Insert menu. Curious to hear how you did this, d0gknees.</p>

    <title>Copy and Insert data from one workbook to another BY ROW &#40;not by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frant1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy and Insert data from one workbook to another BY ROW &#40;not by selection&#41;</h2>
                    I am an advanced Excel user - actually a MOS Instructor and know Excel 2003 like the back of my hand.&nbsp; Recently, I had to switch from 2003 to 2010 - and ran across a couple of snags.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I work with 12&nbsp;'master' 8,000&nbsp;line work sheets (1 workbook)&nbsp;&nbsp;One&nbsp;sheet for each month.&nbsp; Generally, these are people's names and each person has about 10-30 rows of data (about&nbsp;25 columns). (These are my master "month" sheets).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have about 400 workbooks - by last name&nbsp;- all with 12 pages (one for each month).&nbsp; Each of these workbooks have programmed summary sheets as the last sheet that will tabulate month-to-month.&nbsp; The summary sheets are printed out at the end of the year
 and kept in a binder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2003, I could open my master workbook, Select my rows of data, open up the person's workbooks and "INSERT" copied cells BY ROWS.&nbsp; I would click on the A2) &nbsp;and It would automatically insert my copied&nbsp;cells and know enough to move the rows down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
 tabulations at A3 which get moved down and automatically tabulate the information and the Summary sheet will grab those figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2010, I find that selecting the whole row and trying to&nbsp;Insert Copied Cells&nbsp;&nbsp;it into another workbook &nbsp;(It has to be
<strong>inserted</strong> as there is a formula line in the sheet (see above paragraph in the sheet that I don't want to copy over).&nbsp; I Want to INSERT rows at A2.&nbsp; I tried it today, and they want me to "select the data' from the other sheet - not the rows.&nbsp;
 When I do this, I get a pop-up saying "move cells across or down" and I select down.&nbsp; This is a huge problem as my rows are go up to 30 or so columns and selecting by ROWS is much much faster than having to select A1-to EE32.&nbsp; It will take me forever to do
 400 people where I can do&nbsp; it in a couple of hours now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft couldn't have taken this away, could they?</p>

<h2>            activesync 4.5 via USB conflicts with wireless connection </h2>
                    using xp sp3 on a dell 420, when a windows mobile device ( 5.0 or 6.1) is connected , the activesync&nbsp; 4.5 causes the wireless connection to the adsl broadband router to disconnect.
<br />
<br />
The 'advanced option'&nbsp; from network connection properties has specified the correct priority for the wireless and pda connections
<br />
<br />
please advise how to correct this.

            Greetings Roger!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
Normally, an ActiveSync (AS) connection would not interfere with your ADSL Router Connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However, after giving it some thought, I could&nbsp;see&nbsp;the possibility that&nbsp;there&nbsp;might be an incompatibility between your Broadband Router and your WinMo device if your Router connects to your computer via USB connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that scenario, your ISP would likely
 have more experience at dealing with this issue and should be able to provide better support&nbsp;than we would be able to provide.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your Router connects to your computer via an ethernet connection (RJ45 connector or CAT5 or CAT6 "patch cord"), then you should
 not be having a conflict.&nbsp; In that case, please provide more information: <br />
<br />
<strong>1.)</strong> Your XP version (home, pro),<br />
<strong>2.)</strong> Your Network Card make and model, as well as driver version.<br />
<br />
Also, try going to <strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections Tab &gt; USB TO PC</strong> icon.&nbsp; Uncheck the option to make your AS sessions faster, perform a Soft Reset, and attempt to reconnect via AS.

                    I am running on a Surface Pro 3/256/8GB and have the docking station. &nbsp;In Network Connections, ETHERNET Surface Ethernet Adapter is DISABLED. It was enabled and working in previous builds. &nbsp;When I choose the option to enable it just says "enabled" but
 the object is still greyed out and then stay as DISABLED. &nbsp;Full shutdown had no effect either.

<p>Hi Andrea, <br />
<br />
<br />
If "<strong>Birthdays</strong>" is no longer showing in the Calendar app after updating your phone's software, this is something that you have to report through the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> app. Microsoft will look into it and make a solution.
<br />
<br />
In order to submit a new feedback, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in <strong>Cortana search</strong>, then launch the app.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Feedback </strong>in the left menu, then press <strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.
</li><li>Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking <strong>Begin monitoring</strong> (or
<strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form; <strong>Stop monitoring</strong> when you’re done.
</li><li>Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>My feedback</strong> at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).
</li><li>Open the item you submitted, then click <strong>Share</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Copy link</strong>, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/&lt;unique link&gt;).
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to post your query anytime.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Pantech Duo - Messaging link with Hotmail broken - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pantech Duo - Messaging link with Hotmail broken</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up a Hotmail account on my Pantech Duo in the Messaging section.&nbsp; It worked for ~ 2 weeks, then all of a sudden stopped synchronizing with Hotmail on January 7.&nbsp; I have tried everything I can think of to fix it to no avail.&nbsp; I went to the AT&amp;T store
 where I bought my phone and service to ask for help - they advised me to switch to Gmail because Hotmail now has problems synchronizing with Windows Mobile.&nbsp; They then advised I go home and download a new device driver for the Pantech Duo.</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft has a better answer than "switch to Gmail."</p>
<p>Also, I've searched for a free device driver download, again to no avail.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to get my phone back to being synchronized with Hotmail?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply - I have added nothing to the phone, and no changes other than cosmetic like choosing the home screen, etc.&nbsp; I have tried to delete the account and nothing happens.</p>
<p>I've tried to add the Hotmail account again and it doesn't seem to have changed anything.&nbsp; When I force a send/receive, it tries and then says "Error Syncronizing"</p>
<p>I have not reset the device yet - I'll try to do that ( I don't know how, but I assume the manual will tell me)</p>

            I'm not sure - I don't see a Windows Live icon anywhere.&nbsp; When I try to create a new Hotmail account, it takes me to a page that says "Help with Windows Live" and asks me to click a link to access my account - but this tries to take me to the Internet,
 and I'm wanting Hotmail synced with my phone without visiting Windows Live via Internet Explorer.

<p>I've reset the device.&nbsp; When I go to setup my Hotmail account, it tells me to go online.&nbsp; I've since gone to Windows Live and setup a Mobile profile with my phone number and password.</p>
<p>The best I can tell is that Hotmail wants you to go to the Internet to mobile.live.com in order to view your Hotmail instead of porting it directly to the device.&nbsp; (Although, I still can't even login to Hotmail via Windows Live on my device)&nbsp;
 It seems that they're trying to set up some security to ensure that your phone is being used by you.</p>
<p>What it's actually doing is driving me to GMail.&nbsp; I set up a test GMail account and my phone instantly found it and set it up.&nbsp; Ironic considering my phone uses the Windows Mobile operating system.</p>

<p>Most WM6 have Windows Live builtin, but some mobile operators prefer to remove it because they don't want you use messenger. Previous version of Windows Mobile had Pocket MSN installed. So I'm not sure I understand
 how you configured Hotmail on your device.</p>

<p>I just answered this question in another thread so I won't got into much detail here but to say the problem seems to occur when your Hotmail Inbox gets too larger, especially if you have many very large attachments
 (over 4MB). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply answer is to keep your Inbox slim. It worked for me.</p>

<h2>            Cannot checkout from Amazon.com due to empty cart.</h2>
                    I've been using Explorer 9 Beta with no major problems until today.<br />
Today I wanted to make a purchase from Amazon.com.<br />
I put items into my cart, but when I went to check out, I found my cart empty.&nbsp;<br />
I asked Amazon for help, they worked on it a bit, told me the fixed the problem...&nbsp; but when I returned to the site to place my order, same thing happened.<br />
I did a little scouting around and found a suggestion that if I enabled session cookies it would take care of it.<br />
Enabled session cookies through the tool menu...&nbsp; but the problem persisted.<br />
I then moved to my husband's computer, he is still using XP sp3 with Explorer 7.&nbsp; I placed the order with no problem.<br />
If this is a settings thing, can you please explain what I have to do to correct it?&nbsp; If it's a bug, will you please work on it?<br />
Thanks very much!<br />

<p>Hi MarkPollard8587,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, could you firstly check the following?<br />
1. Whether you have ever signed in with another account. I’d like to explain that it’s not feasible for us to connect to Sharepoint on Office for Mac if we have signed with another account. I’ve found a similar scenario about this, for your reference:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/153/t/349302 &nbsp;<br />
2. Try sign out and sign in again to see whether there is any improvement.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information for further investigation.<br />
1. Whether you can open the file directly from the SharePoint site and see if that allows to sign-in?<br />
2. Does the issue happen on other Office applications like Excel?<br />
3. The version of your Office application.<br />
4. A full screenshot about the error message. To insert a screenshot, please click on
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and select the <strong>Insert Image</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Allan</p>

<p>this problem is still persisting, there are numerous bugs that have been created by office 2016 for Mac and El Capitan, its extremely disappointing that this error occurred, two companies of the size of Microsoft and Apple still make the fundamental errors
 that have plagued commercial software for the best part of 30 years, they don't learn and once again the end user has to suffer the incompetence of individuals.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my research, forwarding or simultaneous ring works with call queues as well. Please refer to the below Step 1 in the following link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-Cloud-PBX-call-queue-67ccda94-1210-43fb-a25b-7b9785f8a061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-Cloud-PBX-call-queue-67ccda94-1210-43fb-a25b-7b9785f8a061</a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all the settings are correct but the issue persists. Please let us know more details about the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Please tell us which kind of environment do you set up, is it purely Skype for Business online or else?

<div>Hello and thanks for your time reading my question. I also tried to uninstall and reinstall the software, but it wasn’t a matter of installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I proved to use the Zune Network services with another account that I have, which, by the way, has Xbox Live services attached to, and there was no problem with it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I proceeded to call Microsoft, and, apparently, it seems to be that this issue is related with the fact that I have several billing addresses linked to my troublesome account, and thus it might be creating this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But, for the sake of clarity, I would like to know with certainty what the meaning of this cryptic error code is and what possible spawns it has across Windows Live ID, Xbox Live Services, and so forth.</div>

<p>Hello and thanks for your reply. I already replied to Jaimemontelephone and stated that the problem wasn't related with the service but rather a complicated arrange of internal factors in Microsoft and the way that they related the billing information.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4&#58; With Secure Boot enabled, can&#39;t dual boot Win - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4&#58; With Secure Boot enabled, can&#39;t dual boot Win 10&#47;Win 10TP</h2>
                    <p>See thread title.&nbsp; I didn't notice this until I tried with 16193, but it's weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP4 dual boots between 15963 and the latest Insider build.&nbsp; It's never been a problem before, but now suddenly there's an issue when I try to boot into the public build (the Insider build is on the main partition).&nbsp; With Secure Boot enabled, trying to
 boot into the public build kicks up a 0xc00000e9 error and says my device needs to be repaired.&nbsp; Booting the Insider build never has even the slightest issue.&nbsp; Yet, as soon as I disable secure boot, suddenly the public build comes up with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where it gets interesting. I have a USB stick with the ISO for the public build on it, so I plugged it in, thinking I'd boot from it and run the recovery tools as advised.&nbsp; No luck--no matter what I did, it wouldn't boot from the USB drive until
 (again) I disabled secure boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I'm not running into this on any of the non-Insider machines that dual boots something else with the public build (one machine even triple boots, between XP, 7, and 10), I'm hazarding a guess that the Insider build is somehow responsible.&nbsp; I've got
 no problem leaving secure boot disabled when I want to use the public build, but this is an unusual enough problem I figured I'd ask if anyone else had run into it, and if so, what you did to solve it?</p>

<p>Alright, l got it solved.&nbsp; With Secure Boot disabled, I booted into the public build and did an in-place upgrade, just as I would for a misbehaving Insider build.&nbsp; Once it finished setting up, I powered the SP4 down, then re-enabled Secure Boot, and once
 I'd renamed the bootloader entries, everything's back in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still a weird problem though.</p>

<h2>            problem printing &#39;Selection&#39; in excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi I'm focusing a problem when I print a excel sheet with 'Selection'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>create a sheet with horizontally elongated dataset, for example 30 x 50 (A1 to AX30)</p>
<p>select 30 x 15 (A1 to O30) celles</p>
<p>select print and check: 'Print: Selection' and 'Scales to fit'</p>
<p>print</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above procedure gives me very small print of selected cells.</p>
<p>It seems print is small so that entire sheet can fit to a paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is a bug and hope to be fixed soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if this happens to you.</p>
<p>Or if I'm doing something wrong, let me know...</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.4</p>
<p>Excel: Microsoft Excel for Mac Version 16.12 (180410)</p>
<p>Printer: FX DocuPrint C4000 d v3018.103 PS H2 (driver)</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s.</p>
<p>It worked perfectly until some days ago.<br />
It might be related update of OS or Excel.<br />

<h2>            PLC Notebook not provisioning in Teams</h2>
                    <p>I have been teaching and training our teachers and staff members to use teams. The plc notebook is not provisioning correctly when you create that type of team. You can see the plc notebook tab but it does not have any of the provisioned sections for members.
 It shows as just a blank notebook. It does not show in the settings either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm able to log into my Hotmail account and see my old messages that have been there since before my email wasn't sending and receiving new emails. Even my junk folder is empty and I usually get around 7 spam emails a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched around and haven't found a conclusive answer as to why this is happening. There's a few important emails that have been sent to me that I need access to and I'm not sure what else I can do besides post here.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Jesinta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I just removed my account and when I try to add it back on I am given the error message, "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">This
 email is part of a reserved domain. Please enter a different email address.</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never used my Hotmail account any other way besides when entering my log-in information by going to the URL, "hotmail.com" and do not use any other Microsoft app or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now see the note on the page at the below hyperlink that Hotmail addresses can not be recovered:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-alias-account</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely ludicrous! This was the only supposed 'fix' to get my account back into working order on an email address I use for many important things (not only based on your response but on subsequent research I did) and now I can never use this email
 again without even being given a chance to make the necessary steps in order to move to a different email address, as my mail has now been out of order for a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new 'alias' I set up is still not sending or receiving messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I recover my previous Hotmail address and access my emails again?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You removed your primary&nbsp;(original) email address&nbsp;as an alias and it cannot be&nbsp;added back&nbsp;as an alias.&nbsp;We regret to inform you that you&nbsp;cannot recover your email address. However, you may try creating&nbsp;a new&nbsp;account with the same address after 30 days.
</p>
<p>You will receive emails sent to your current primary alias address. </p>

<h2>            Moving multiple selected emails to another folder</h2>
                    <p>I used to be able to select multiple emails in a conversation, click the MOVE box in the banner and send the emails to another folder, without having to send all future emails in the conversation to the other folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to send an email to another folder
 without having all future message go there, I can only select and move 1 message at a time. If I select multiple emails the only available selection in the MOVE dropdown is 'Always Move Messages in This Conversation'.</p>
<p>I would really like to have the option to&nbsp;move the selected messages without having all future messages in the conversation go to the other folder.
</p>
<p>The enhancement does have value to me but there are cases when I do not want all future messages to bypass my inbox.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration of this issue.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Let's work on this together. You can use the Messages View rather than the Conversations View so you have control on what emails to move to a certain folder.<br />
<br />
Here is a <a href="http://https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-how-email-is-displayed-in-Outlook-com-or-Outlook-on-the-web-e650ae23-b558-4fbf-bdd1-73268f6852b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>How do I add a phone number that has called me to Skype contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kair service  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add a phone number that has called me to Skype contacts</h2>
                    <p>My system and Skype plan info.</p>
<p>I am using Skype version 12.1815.209.0 on windows 10 home version.</p>
<p>I have the subscriptions for a Skype phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the subscription for the ability to call and receive calls from standard phone numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this:</p>
<p>How do I add the phone number described below to my Skype contacts?</p>
<p>The phone number I want to add is a standard united states cell phone number. Not a Skype account or number.</p>
<p>The phone number I want to add has already called me using my Skype number. </p>
<p>Because the phone number I want to add has already called me, it is listed on the left side of the Skype program in the recent calls list.</p>
<p>I do not want to invite the person using this phone number to Skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can not, and do not want to change to the "classic Skype" program due to being on a very limited satellite internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additional information:</p>
<p>Many of the Skype help resources list a "add contact" button that no longer exists in the program.
</p>
<p>I remember that there used to be a "add contact" because I have been using Skype for about 8 years now.</p>
<p>I have a large list on contacts that I added in the prior 8 years before the "add contact" button was removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Click the contact's number from the left column to open the chat screen on the right side of the app. From the chat screen, locate the number on the upper left part and there should be an option to save the number under that number.</p>

<p>If I click on a number listed in the recent calls list on the left side of the Skype program these are the options that are available on the right side of the Skype program screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-An icon of a video camera (that I assume is for a video call), this option is grayed out and not clickable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-A blue and white phone icon (the icon I would click to make a standard call)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A light blue and black icon of a person with a + mark near it's head. If I hover over this icon with the mouse it brings up the words "Create Group". It I click this icon it brings up a menu in the center of the Skype program that gives the option to "Add
 Participants". I assume this is for something like a conference call. It does not give me any options to save the number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-In the center top of the screen, to the left of the three icons I described above, the number I want to save is shown. If I double click the number itself it brings up a menu in the center of the Skype program that only gives me the option to "Block Contact".
 It does have only other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a screen shot of the top of the Skype program page (with the phone number blacked out for privacy reasons). This shows there is no options listed under the number to save it.</p>

<p>Also attached is a screen shot of the window that opens when I click the number. As you can see there is only the option to "Block Contact". (I have blacked out the phone number in this screenshot also)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0423e62-242f-41d2-8015-adc17abb14d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0423e62-242f-41d2-8015-adc17abb14d5?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Since there's no option to save, it's possible that this number is already saved to your address book. Check your People app and select Skype, try and look for the number you wish to edit, as you can edit the number from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help. Manually dial the number from the web version of Skype (<a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com</a>) and call the number. Drop the call immediately as the purpose of this is only for saving the number. After dropping the
 call, you will see the number on the left column. Right-click on that number and select add to contacts.</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion to use the web version of the Skype application. Using that as part of the process I was able to save a contact. However there were multiple steps to the process that were not intuitive so I will list all the steps below for
 anyone that is having similar difficulties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I do desire to make a request, that in the future, Skype simply add an "Add contact" button to the desktop version of Skype. By adding this button it would make the process of adding a contact much easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this is the process I used to add a contact to the current desktop version of Skype&nbsp;<span>version 12.1815.209.0 on windows 10 home version.</span></p>
<p>1. Open the&nbsp;<span>web version of Skype (</span><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com</a><span>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Log in (if required, it logged me in automatically)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Left click the number on the left side of the screen in the recent calls list you want to add to your contacts (if you do not see the number listed, then call the number as outlined by the Microsoft Agent's above
 forum post:<em> "c</em></span><span><em>all the number [then] drop the call immediately as the purpose of this is only for saving the number. After dropping the call, you will see the number on the left column."</em></span></p>
<p>4. Now that you have selected the number you want to add to your contacts, you must left click the large version of the number displayed in the center top of the screen.
</p>
<p><em>Note: You can <strong>not </strong>simply right click the number displayed in the recent calls list, it does not give you the option to save it as a contact in that drop down menu (as shown in the screenshot below).</em></p>
<p>Attached below is a screen shot where I have added a large green arrow pointing to the location of the number you have to left click (or click the small downward facing &gt; symbol next to the number)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af0307cb-f34a-43ed-8571-18f8ed44229c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af0307cb-f34a-43ed-8571-18f8ed44229c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Once you have clicked the number as outlined in step 4 you should see the following screen (shown below). A screen that finally gives you the option to "Add to contacts".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62fa40b2-e782-4f65-9d59-b4ef04edae52?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62fa40b2-e782-4f65-9d59-b4ef04edae52?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. However we are not yet finished. As far as I could tell, there is no way to edit the number/name of contacts in the web version of Skype. You must now open the desktop version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. With the desktop version of Skype open, open your contacts and locate the number you added to contacts with the web version of Skype. Right click the number you have saved to your contacts and select "view profile" in the dropdown menu. This will open
 up a profile window in the center of the Skype application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. You can now click and edit what is displayed as the name of the number you saved as a contact. Don't forget to click the check mark after you have added the name of your contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That process seems to work at the moment. Hopefully they will simply add a "add contact" button to the desktop version of Skype soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, let me once again thank the Microsoft agents that have helped me resolve this problem.</p>

</p><p>Let me just quickly say that the process this Microsoft agent posed does not work in the current desktop application&nbsp;<span>version 12.1815.209.0 on windows 10 home version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the desktop version of Skype, If you "view profile" on any number that is not already in your contacts, it will not give you any options other than to "block contact". Below is a screen shot showing this.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As for as I can find, you must use the web version of Skype to add contacts. There does not seem to be a way to add a contact using the current Skype desktop application. Hopefully this is patched/fixed soon.</span></p>

</p><p>If you are only seeing block option to the number on your screenshot, the possible reason is that the number was already saved on your device's&nbsp;local address book, However, on the local address book of your device you can edit the name but it wont appear

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the the number is not already saved to my device's local address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be proven in two ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can open my devices local address book and look through the numbers listed. There are no numbers listed there that I match the one that just called me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, because I always add the name (or business name) of the contacts I saved (before the 'add contact' button was removed from the current Windows10 desktop version of Skype') a phone number without a name would be easily found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. More simply though, If I open the web browser version of Skype (As suggested by Microsoft Agent Serds_P) and simply click the 'add to contacts' option, the added number will appear in 'contacts' of the current Windows10 desktop version of Skype (and the
 local device address book).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of these two above reasons, I have a theory that there was an error made in
<span>Skype version 12.1815.209.0 on windows 10 home version. If there are any persons reading this that are in charge of future product patches, please add the option to "add contact" to the next update of Skype on windows
 10 home version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: If you are a Skype user that would like to add a contact to your Skype address book, please refer to to my prior posts were I explained the somewhat complex process that did find that allowed me to add a contact to Skype using a combination of
 the web browser and PC desktop version of Skype. Credit goes to&nbsp;Microsoft Agent Serds_P for suggesting the use of the web browser version of Skype for this process.
</em></p>
<p><em>I just double checked this process and it still appears to be the only way to add a contact to Skype.</em></p>

    <title>Excel Table Sort&#47;Filter Question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emily_668  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Table Sort&#47;Filter Question</h2>
                    <p>I apologize in advance if this has been taught in another discussion, but I have been unable to find an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created an Excel table where&nbsp;many&nbsp;rows contains multiple answers for one column category. I would like to be able to sort/filter by the individual answers within this column. This is hard for me to put into words, so I created an example below.</p>
<p>
<table>



<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Object</span></strong></td>
<td><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Shape</strong></span></td>
<td><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Color</strong></span></td>
<td><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Size</span></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>Circle</td>
<td>Blue, Green</td>
<td>Small</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>Square</td>
<td>Red</td>
<td>Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>Triangle</td>
<td>Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange</td>
<td>Large</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>Square</td>
<td>Orange</td>
<td>Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>Square</td>
<td>Green, Blue, Yellow</td>
<td>Small</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>In this example, the top row is my header row and I have formatted it as a table. I would like to be able to click the little down arrow that appears next to the header "Color" and select "Blue", and see all of the "Objects" that include "Blue" in that category.
 However, the options only show as "Blue, Green", "Yellow, Blue, Green, Orange", etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am aware that you can use "Text Filters", "Contains" to find how many contain "Blue". Just wondering if there is another way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, the&nbsp;table&nbsp;that I am wanting to use this technique for is much much longer with a lot more data. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Hello AWal_758, <br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience. <br />
<br />
I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />
See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a><br />
<br />
In case it is still not working for you, it could be a <strong>browser-related issue</strong>.
<br />
<br />
May I suggest you to delete your <strong>Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies</strong> and clear
<strong>browser caches</strong> then restart the browser? <br />
<br />
- selectively deleting browser cookies <br />

- clearing browser caches <br />
<a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a><br />
<br />
Alternatively, open in <strong>private mode</strong> ("incognito mode") or try with a
<strong>different browser</strong> <br />
<br />
Otherwise, clear your <strong>DNS revolver caches</strong>: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter
<code><strong>cmd.exe</strong></code> then key in <code><strong>ipconflig /flushdns</strong></code><br />
<br />
Please ensure that your browsers have <br />
<br />

            Hi AWal_758, this is a big issue at the moment a lot of Outlook users are affected, this is expected to be fixed within the hour, a lot of users are reporting they can access their Email from their Mobile phone, but not their PC/Laptop . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft has identified a potential issue impacting the availability of the Outlook Mail service, which is causing users to be unable to access their email. 
<br />
<br />More details on the service status here:

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Microsoft is having problems with the Outlook.com service 
<br />User Impact: Users may be unable to access their mailbox from Outlook, Outlook on the web, mobile devices, or other protocols.
<br />Current status: The deployment has almost reached 100% saturation. We are seeing a few isolated outlier availability issues on a small portion of infrastructure that has received the fix. We're analysing diagnostic data and service log files to identify why the fix was ineffective for some customers. 
<br />Scope of impact: Impact is specific to users that are attempting to access their mailbox using basic authentication.
<br />Start time: Thursday, November 15, 2018, at 10:05 PM UTC
<br />Preliminary root cause: A recent update introduced an issue impacting service availability. As a result, users may be unable to access their mailbox via multiple protocols.
<br />Next update by: Friday, November 16, 2018, at 12:30 PM UTC
<br />
<br />You can validate the service status in: 
<br /><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
