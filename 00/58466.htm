<h2>            Win 10 - new hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Have Asus G73SW with Windows 7. &nbsp;Upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;After last Microsoft update, hard drive would not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried to restore with media creation tool and USB drive. &nbsp;Even after I solve errors, will not find HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purchased new 1TB SSHD, and now Windows 10 install tells me it is missing a media driver (DVD, USB, HD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot get around that error. &nbsp;Running CHKDSK /R /F right now to determine if the original drive is bad - so far no errors. &nbsp;I have a chipset driver I am going to try and install to see if that corrects the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read numerous posts about Windows 10 update, errors 000034 and 000000f, but none of them seem to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last attempt to see if there is a way to get this computer running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions from the community?</p>

<p>I'm not sure exactly what you were expecting to get with the Bass Expansion ( new tracks maybe? there are none ) but here's some info from the official Rocksmith website</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Is there bass in the game?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Rocksmith Guitar and Bass Edition includes bass for 53 on-disc tracks and all in-game features. If you own the original release of Rocksmith (non ‘Guitar and Bass’ edition) you can download the Bass Expansion DLC on Xbox LIVE® Marketplace for Xbox 360® or
 PlayStation®Network for PlayStation®3.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Which songs will I be able to play using a bass?</p>
<p>You will be able to play bass on the 53 songs on the disc which feature a bass part. Bass guitar arrangements will also be added for all supported previously released DLC.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Will I need to repurchase past DLC to play them with bass?</p>
<p>No, the new bass content will add bass arrangements for all previously purchased DLC.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Do I have to pay more for future DLC to play them with bass?</p>
<p>There will be no extra charge for bass support on future DLC songs. Bass arrangements will be included with the guitar arrangements currently being offered.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Which features can I use with my bass?</p>
<p>Nearly everything playable with guitar can be played with a bass! There are brand new bass technique challenges and instructional videos, bass specific equipment for playing</p>

<p>I'm having a problem with my Bass Expansion DLC. I purchased the DLC on 2/4/2013 soon after buying the game. My brother and I have been able to play the Bass Expansion for a bit and even unlocked achievements for it (you can verify this in my achievement
 history).</p>
<p>However, recently, the DLC won't detect while playing the game, it just redirects me to the purchase page. The DLC is actually still on my hard drive. The Xbox support page recommends that I delete the DLC then redownload it but I'm not sure If I should
 yet. I'm still using the same account, same console, same everything, yet I somehow have this issue.</p>
<p>As of now, I'm currently trying to contact a Community Ambassador while I wait for a response to this forum post, I also might wander the Xbox support page some more.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is in the wrong thread. Please try to respond soon.</p>

<p>EDIT: Disregard my previous message. After searching through the Xbox support page for a while, I managed to chat to a Microsoft support agent via IM. After awhile, he directed me to a Microsoft Support phone number, and after a long phone call, the problem
 was resolved, I can use the DLC again.</p>
<p>Apparently, it had something to do with an error regarding payment and download history.</p>

<h3> wsdp881  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get &#34;STEREO MIX&#34; or &#34;WAVE OUT&#34; as a Recording Option&#63;</h2>
                    <div>From the Desktop, right click the Speaker and choose Recording devices.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only two that show up are the external mic and the 3.5" mic/headphone jack.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why is there not a Stereo Mix or Wave Out? This is the first Windows device I've ever used that doesn't have one of those listed as a Recording Device. &nbsp;My old HP and Dell laptops have it, even my mother's old 1998 Gateway has a Stereo Mix recording option!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to record web streams, etc. in real time and I do so in noisy environments. Those two options allow you to record sound coming from your computer. While "Mic" allows you to record sound from speakers, it also picks up every sound coming from your
 environment so you're recording the sound from CPU as well as the dog barking behind you, the man on his cell phone next to you, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need the sound coming out of my computer ISOLATED.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This seems like a Sounds Card / Driver update that was missed before the Surface was released. Please advise how/when to get this option to appear ASAP!</div>
<div>___</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ATTN Microsoft Techs - this is how it should look (from my HP laptop purchased in 2006): http://i242.photobucket.com/albums/ff268/wsdp/sound_zpsa2f5e982.jpg</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You see both the internal ("integrated") mic, the external plug in mic, and the stereo mix that catches the sound exiting your CPU without using either of those mics. That's the record input needed.</div>
                </div>

            Sorry, busy Easter weekend.<br />
<br />
Just tested this.<br />
<br />
The update you are hiding should be 22KB, which means it is ONLY a driver file for the audio. You can expect this to occur EVERY time there are new updates pushed out each month.<br />
<br />
The process I would recommend is to install all available updates. If the update then breaks or removes Realtek, re-install Realtek and do not reboot after the install. Close the install without rebooting and then use the classic Control Panel to check for
 updates. If an update appears that is 22KB and is labeled System Hardware Update, hide it as you have done previously. That should fix it, but again, it will only be temporary until the next update series. Windows Update has a driver file that it pushes and
 it is automatically going to identify the Realtek driver as "out of date" or OLD. This is why it will continue to occur.<br />
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This is due to the System Hardware Update for 3/12/13. It appears Microsoft is forcing an update for the audio if you install something other than the default driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only workaround is to install the Realtek package and then open Windows Update from the classic Control Panel, check for updates and right click the system hardware update and choose hide update. That will block it from re-installing the default driver,
 which should show as 22KB in Windows Update.</p>

<h2>            No icons on the Task bar.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem with Windows 10. There are no icons on taskbar, no calendar, no time, no Cortana, can't left and right click on Start Menu(that means I can't turn off and restar my PC) and open action center ignores me. I have tried cold boot but problem
 is still there. I can't even check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S Yesterday I had similar problem. There was no sound and I couldn't left click on Star Menu(but I could right click) and there were icons. So I have tried&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sfc /scannow and it said that there were corrupted
 files and that they are fixed. Could that be a problem?</span></p>

<h2>            How to get Portuguese keybord to type with accents&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:portuguese keyboard</p>
<p>I have a notebook with Windows XP SP3 and Office 2010 Professional installed.</p>
<p>I had a problem with the keyboard and had it replaced by a US-International keyboard while waited for a replacement to my Portuguese keyboard.</p>
<p>The Portuguese keyboard finnally arrived and I replaced it.</p>
<p>Installed the Portuguese Layout Keyboard with Portuguese (Portugal) and English (United Kingdom).</p>
<p>The keys are correct and everything works fine ("ç" included) with the exception of accents.</p>
<p>When using a Microsoft Offfice Program, I can use the accents if using CTRL + accent key&nbsp;then letter key while before the correct way to do it was simply accent key then letter key.</p>
<p>But this doesn't work outside of Microsoft Office Programs ... it doesn't work on Notepad or on any Web forms ...<br />
I've already tried some suggestions found on foruns, like Sistem File Checker or copying kbdpo.dll from dllcache to system 32 or cleaning the registry ... but without changes.</p>
<p>Help with be apreciated !</p>

<h2>            Unable to add PayPal</h2>
                    
<p>My account doesnt work with any cards (due to MS) so I thought now with the PayPal support I can finally buy things direct from the dash (like points.) But whenever I try to add my PayPal account it displays this message:</p>
<div><span>Unable to complete your request</span>
</div>
<div><span>The reward method you chose is not authorized. Please use another reward method to request your cashback reward. If you get this message multiple times, contact customer support.</span>
<br />
Message <span>8017</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Now it might just be a tempory issue, or it could be not liking my PayPal account (like my card.) Any help would be greatly apprechated.<br />

<p>I've been on the phone with MS before, when they blocked my card. And after a few weeks of going round in circles (they said billing will get back to me, billing did and then they said have you tried a different card I said yes, then they said we will phone
 you back.) It was just a never ending circle so I gave up in the end.</p>

    <title>Bootsect.dat file is corrupted, NTLDR is missing&#47;compressed on x86 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vernon d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bootsect.dat file is corrupted, NTLDR is missing&#47;compressed on x86 pc with WinXP Home Edition Sp3 and Ie8</h2>
                    <p>I have a x86 pc with WinXP Home Edition SP3 and IE8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>While preparing for an eventual upgrade to Win 7, I have been considering repartioning and&nbsp;multibooting my HDD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have been trying to get WinXP operating as best as I can.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have been checking out how to use the Windows Recovery Console to reinstall WinXP and transfer files for a clean reinstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered while checking "All Boot Paths" at Start\Run\msconfig\BOOT.INI that one Boot Path was highlighted with errors indicating that the "File is Corrupted because a disk read error occured" and that NTLDR is missing or corrupted.&nbsp; In fact, it is garbled.&nbsp;
 It points to "Microsoft Windows Recovery Console/cmdcon".&nbsp; I have not used the Recovery Console, ever.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Gateway 5310S desktop (retail) and no original XP disks, apparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have, but have never used, a&nbsp;4ea. set of Recovery CDs dated 5/12/05 that I must have created after purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have been having numerous, odd, problems that come and go, including trouble displaying various websites, Yahoo Home Pages, and eMail that keep going into compatibility mode or blanking outright.&nbsp; The video and audio on Hulu and online video services
 are always out of sync.&nbsp; I have problems editing posts on sites like this even though I can edit my profile pages just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This particular set of problems started occurring recently and very suddenly, from one day to the next.&nbsp; This was after it had actually been working fairly well for a change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea how long the boot.ini file has been corrupted, I actually discovered it by accident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can not reinstall certain programs such as Family Tree Maker 2005 and 2008 after it was suggested to me by ancestry.com to uninstall/reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest Java and Adobe Flash Player.&nbsp; I have defragged and disk checked my drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used CCleaner to remove temp and junk files daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have run Hitman Pro, MBAM, MBAR, MSE, and SAS multiple times with no viruses or malware detected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as I had mentioned above, I am having problems with the editor on this site, right now.&nbsp; Sometimes it just freezes and I have to exit to clear.&nbsp; Other times it duplicates entire sentences.&nbsp; It also flip/flops between a full page editor and, like now,
 a half page editor window on the left half of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions you folks can come up with would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; This is getting really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vernon</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Here's how to<span>&nbsp;
</span>make a bootable xp recovery console cd</span></strong></p>
<p>Courtesy of JoseIbarra </p>
<p>You need to start by booting into the XP Recovery Console using a CD you can make (no XP media required) and run a chkdsk with error correction enough times until it runs clean and if that doesn't work, you can create a new boot.ini file (it is usually one
 of those two things).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>rc.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecomputerparamedic.com/?p=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thecomputerparamedic.com/?p=8</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(courtesy of Daavee)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient.&nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to
 go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>===============</p>
<p>
</p><p>as for the other problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>have you used any registry cleaners??</p>
<p>
</p><p>these can harm your system</p>
<p>
</p><p>since you appear to be infection free, it would seem that some part of your cleaning process has deleted a necessary file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>===============</p>
<p>
</p><p>checkdisk with the /r parameter should be run. and run again until no errors are found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>==========</p>
<p>
</p><p>are you fully updated and patched at Microsoft updates??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Battery notifications Surface 3 have stopped</h2>
                    <p>in the 'Battery' section of Settings, under 'Battery notifications', it says 'No notifications for battery life right now'. I used to get warnings at 10% and 6% from memory, now my Surface 3 just turns off when the battery runs out, with no warnings/ notifications.
 My Battery settings notifications are turned on too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can not find any options to turn the low battery notifications back on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Easy Fix Solutions didn't work. Anyway I had already done all the troubleshooting on my device, which is apparently the same.</p>
<p>The thread that you linked me to doesn't actually have a proper solution, it isn't solved. So it seems many people still face this issue. Do you by any chance have an actual solution to fix the problem?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yeah thanks @barb i am aware of those settings and they are set to notify me already, but aren't functioning as they are set to.</p>
<p>someone has suggested that turning battery saver off will make the warning reappear, so i will try that. Even though that's not how it's supposed to function, they should exist and operate independently if each other. I'm also confused as to why there are
 no notification options showing up in the settings too, asper my screenshots.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone from Microsoft can chime in and shed some light on the situation.&nbsp;</p>

Yes it worked, but of course is not the ideal fix. It will have to do until it is fixed properly&nbsp;

            Hello,<br /><br /> I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help. <br /><br /> Can you check if Skype has permission to use your microphone on your computer?<br /><br />Click on Windows Start, then Settings. Under Privacy, select Microphone on the left and then check if Skype has permission to use the microphone.

    <title>Bluetooth issue on Windows 10 pc related to file transfers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth issue on Windows 10 pc related to file transfers</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 home.</p>
<p>Version 1607 (OS Build 14393.693) with all available updates applied.</p>
<p>And, all of the Bluetooth devices in the device manager are updated as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal:</p>
<p>Transfer a file from my Galaxy S4 Android phone to my laptop (above) via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Transfer a file from my laptop (above) to my Galaxy S4 Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth is turned on.</p>
<p>And my phone and the laptop are paired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read how it is supposed to work, but it doesn't quite work that way on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on&nbsp;"Settings/Devices/Bluetooth/Send or receive files via Bluetooth/Receive Files"</p>
<p>I immediately get a Bluetooth File Transfer dialog that reads: "Windows was unable to transfer some file. &nbsp;An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used. To try again, click the Back arrow".</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the back arrow doesn't respond. &nbsp;It "blinks" when I click on it but it doesn't take me back to the previous screen.</p>
<p>I have to hit the Cancel button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I can repeat this failure as many time as I want.<br />
</p>
<p>If I choose instead, to right click on the Bluetooth icon in the system tray and choose "Receive a file", I go directly to the failure message described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started and stopped the the "Bluetooth Support Service" and made sure it was set to "Automatic".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to send a file, I get to choose the dive that is currently paired with the laptop, then I get to choose a file, &nbsp;but after clicking the "Next" button, I get the exact same failure message described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Expand Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Right click on the driver, in my case it read "Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) and choose to delete it.</p>
<p>Then I went to the HP software and download site (Cuz I have an HP ENVY Notebook) and chose to download and install the "Broadcom Bluetooth Driver".</p>
<p>Once the install was completed, all of the Bluetooth objects appeared once again (including my phone. It was still pared with my Win 10 laptop).</p>
<p>I was then able to send files from my laptop to my phone and my phone was able to send files to my Win 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, earlier today I right clicked on the (now deleted and replaced) Bluetooth driver and chose to update it.</p>
<p>Updates were applied but my issue continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OLD Bluetooth driver was the one that was installed on my pc when I purchased it new about a year ago.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have ever tried using Bluetooth on my Windows 10 pc.</p>
<p>So I wonder if it ever worked at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, things are now working according to the "How To" Bluetooth guides and I am grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else is experiencing this issue, they mu consider my experience and documented solution.</p>

    <title>Dual screen background changes after waking from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dual screen background changes after waking from sleep</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Ok, so I've searched for a while and cannot find an answer so I must ask it on my own. I currently have a dual
 monitor setup. The primary monitor is front of me and the second monitor is mounted direct above the primary. I have one background image that spans both screens. The problem is, when I wake my computer up from a sleep, the background image will be the same
 on both screens. For example, both screens will show the bottom half of the overall wallpaper. This can be remedied by rebooting the computer but who has time for that, and is definitely something that shouldn't have to be done. This cannot be fixed by selecting
 another wallpaper or doing anything at all other than rebooting the computer. I am running Windows 10 Pro.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Not subscribed to Game Pass after code redemption</h2>
                    <p>I recently redeemed a 3 month Game Pass code I got free as part of the Microsoft Rewards Quest. It's been two days since the redemption, but my account is not showing as subscribed. When I re-enter the code, it states the code has already been redeemed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already talked to a chat representative and I've created a support ticket. Both methods got me nowhere. How can we resolve this issue?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us in regards to this issue. I would like to clarify one thing. Do you have more than one account on your console? It could have been that maybe you accidentally redeemed the code else where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to check over any extra accounts you may have.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WTF... Game Clip voice recording - Why is this not possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After googling around and speaking to Xbox live support I have come to discover that it's not possible to record a game clip (start clip rather than previous minutes) and use your headset mic to record your commentary as you play?</p>
<p>Why is this not available??? it seems to cancel out the whole game clip function on the Xbox One!</p>
<p>Can anyone help with a solution for this?</p>
<p>Either Xbox themselves adding this function or an external solution... maybe that involves the Kinect recoding the voice while you play?</p>
<p>Help... anyone?</p>

<p>You are able to add commentary to your videos via the Upload studios app on the console! :) But if you feel your idea could be useful then visit the

    <title>Warranty Sticker Misplaced&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Warranty Sticker Misplaced&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I thought this was interesting and I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.&nbsp; This happened a few years back so I'm not looking for any repair help or trying to get my money back, just looking for&nbsp;similar experiences.&nbsp; I bought my Halo 3
 edition 360 at Best Buy, I also bought their extended warranty.&nbsp; About a month before my warranty was up, I got the RROD.&nbsp; I thought "no problem, extended warranty"!&nbsp; I took it to Best Buy expecting it to be replaced but when they pulled the face plate off,
 the warranty sticker was not covering the seam where the two sides of the case meet.&nbsp; I had never even heard of that sticker, let alone removed it.&nbsp; The sticker looked intact and brand new, as if it had been misplaced originally.&nbsp; I had owned the 360 since
 it was new (It was not advertised as an open box item when I bought it) and I never loaned it to anyone, it was always at my house with me.&nbsp; Needless to say, Best Buy and Microsoft were no help, not that I expected it, I understand their position.&nbsp; It has
 always bothered me though that I honestly did not tamper with the seal or open the case and I still got BF'd.&nbsp; Anyone hear of anything like this happening?</p>

<p>As you've said they have probably misplaced it on retail.</p>
<p>Aslong as they have allowed you to get a fix for your RROD, don't worry too much - If this isn't the case contact your retailer and point out all of the points of what the problem is and they should no doubt apologies and maybe hook you up with a gift card
 or something like that? I'm not sure - I've never shopped at Best Buy.</p>

<p><em>I couldn't imagine this being a production error really, but I guess you never know.<br />
<br />
But about Best Buy, I have seen one other post where a user bought a 'new console' from them (advertised as such).<br />
He got it home, turned it on and there was a profile and DLC content on the HDD, so it was obviously not new.<br />
<br />
The guy posted here to ask why a profile &amp; DLC content would be on the HDD and how to be rid of it all, he was less than happy to find out he had actually been sold a pre-owned console as new.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that's what has happened with you but it goes to show it does happen.</em></p>

<p>Hi EXLEX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to answer that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, any items in the Microsoft Store that constitutes as virtual currency, in-game credits, one-time power ups, or anything that can only be redeemed once to any account, like the gems and other add-ons&nbsp;from Gems of War, cannot be bought as a
 gift for someone else. This feature only applies to digital content like games and other things like map packs or season passes. You can find more information from this support article
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/purchasing/help-for-issues-when-gifting-digital-xbox-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortnite V-bucks also cannot be sent as a gift if that is what you are referring to because the "Buy as Gift" option is not listed in the product page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One suggestion is getting an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-gift-card-digital-code/cfq7ttc0k63h?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Digital Gift Card</a> which sends a code to your email after purchase which you can then give to whoever and have them redeem the money into their account and they can use it how they like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hello GentlePotatoe,</p>
<p>If the code is not 25 characters long, it sounds like it needs to be redeemed with the retailer, not Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If you bought from the Microsoft Store, log in there and add a $60 cde to your basket and go to the basket: where it asks you to enter a code, enter the one you were emailed and you should see the price of the basket drop to zero.</p>
<p>If you bought from another retailer, you should be able to follow very similar steps to get the content.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Check if you have all the latest Windows Updates installed. If not, install them and check. Also, check for any optional updates which
 might have the related drivers. Refer the below mentioned link.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Windows updates</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>You can try to completely uninstall the device and reinstall it to check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Start, type “<b>devmgmt.msc</b>” (without quotes) in the Search textbox and press Enter.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expand the device. Right click on it and select Properties.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Driver tab, click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the computer. Windows should now install the related drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b><span>&nbsp;</span>I would also suggest you to update the chipset with the latest drivers and also other available drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 - connection to Xbox Live issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikewalsh19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 - connection to Xbox Live issue</h2>
                    <p>I have unearthed my old Xbox 360 in the hopes of transferring my old Borderlands 2 characters to Xbox One. I have been unable connect the Xbox Live servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I couldn't log into Xbox Live because I needed an update, and I couldn't get the update because couldn't log into Xbox Live. (classic catch-22, well played Microsoft) I was able to download the update to a USB drive and install the update manually,
 so are good there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it simply says that it cannot connect to the Xbox Live server. I have run the network check, and the system could get to the internet, but says the Live server is unavailable. The website assures me that all services ARE available. The recommended solutions
 are to: 1. Reset the router (which I have attempted a few times over the past few days) or, 2. Adjust the router settings to allow connections to Xbox Live (But I have the Xbox One on the same router and it connects to Live without issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can usually troubleshoot network and hardware issues just fine, but this one has me completely stumped. I would REALLY appreciate any help that people could offer.</p>

<p>Yeah, that seems like your best option at the moment; But I would move your save data to an external storage device in the event that somthing goes wrong, as said by WPAK I would also suggest looking into the support page:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/networking/connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/networking/connection-error-solution</a>, hopefully it helps....my old xbox did a similar error as well, i would highly suggest trying to reset your networking settings as somtimes that seemed to help me...</p>

            If you aren't already, use Windows 98 compatibility mode. If that doesn't work, also try Windows 95 and Windows XP.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a><br />
<br />
Due to the age of the program (released in 1998), if the compatiblity options don't work, there isn't anything we can suggest.

<h3> lindseyweingarten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable password upon startup W10</h2>
                    <p>I have tried MULTIPLE methods to disable the requirement of a password upon startup and none of them have worked because I am still prompted for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran netplwiz in the command prompt and disabled the requirement for a password and hit apply</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have went to hardware settings/power settings and disabled password upon wake up</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have went to sign in options and from the drop down for "if you've been away..." selected "Never"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even added a new account, which worked fine, but the only problem with that is it's a brand spanking new account that has nothing I've already set up on MY account. And then of course also with this option, I can't just delete the other account if
 I did just set up the new account to my liking instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the only one who uses this computer and the only one who even has access to the room where the computer is because my bedroom is under lock and key thanks to student housing, so I might as well live alone with the amount of privacy I have.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I ticked the (password not needed) box, then the ****** thing would not let me sign in, even with the password.</p>
<p>And you WANT people on W10?</p>

<p>got the wife a new pc, hadn't even finished installing programs on it and my eyes were fuzzy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>still, although the old crashing has improved (improved, not gone. NEW w10 install had a box flash up with an error code then vanish before i had chance to read it all.)... we are still getting blue screens.<br />

</p><p>you <strong>can </strong>disable the password even if you are using a Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you are using a Microsoft account when you are asked in Netplwiz for a username&nbsp; you need to enter the full email address of the Microsoft account.</p>

            &nbsp; Try this. Go to password. Request change password. when it asks for old password first enter old one. then leave new password BLANK. that should do it. This is all for starting your computer from off etc. Hope this helps all.
