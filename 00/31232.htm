            Hi HgMercury
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should analyze this folder with help of third party software. TreeSize is most popular one and is a Microsoft Store app. See what size does it show in TreeSize.

<br />
<br />This looks like a bug that needs to be reported. 
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

            <p style="margin-left: 30px">See the following from ElderK (or wait until he shows up in person).&nbsp; Because I don't know if your old Dell can boot from USB -- but probably does have a CD drive -- I've given you his directions for creating a bootable CD.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>***************************************************************************************************</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">For that message, you always, always, always need to start with a chkdsk with error correction first - that will usually fix things up.&nbsp; After that you may want to undo your registry restores...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>cmd</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</strong><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may
 appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may
 even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system. </p>

            <p>Yes - for that error, you should always start with a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) but you are going to have to boot on something in order to do that and that something is a Hiren's Boot CD or Hiren's Bootable USB.&nbsp; From a working system you
 can create whichever you need and you will be glad you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a Dell computer, what is the Service Tag Number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is <em>extremely </em>unlikely that the file is really missing or corrupt.&nbsp; The problem is usually that XP just can't find the file due to some corruption in the NT File System (NTFS).&nbsp; The NTFS can can get corrupted from things like a power interruption,
 plug pulling, using the power/reset button, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)?</p>

    <title>Xbox Custom Controller Debacle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cliftontaylor1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Custom Controller Debacle</h2>
                    I ordered an Xbox custom controller on February 1st. The first thing that went wrong was my card was charged immediately even though the site said that it would only be charged when it shipped. "No big deal", I thought, as long as I received my controller.
 Well, over two weeks went by and it was still being listed as "Pending" on my order page. So at this point I chatted with customer service to cancel the order

 the charge did show up on my card and my order site was still showing it as pending. So I asked him to send me a confirmation that it was canceled and I received his email at 5:27pm on Feb 18th confirming the cancellation. Then on Feb 19th at 12:08am, I received
 an email that it had just been shipped. Why would it be pending for two weeks and then magically get shipped after I call to cancel it? I was on the phone with customer service today and I was able to get the whole thing resolved

 but what an inconvenience and disappointment that I would get so much disinformation from a Microsoft agent telling me that my card was declined when it was not, and telling me it was cancelled (with email confirmation) when it was not. When I talked to the
 agent today who resolved the situation for me, he said that they don't keep a record of the customer service chats. What?! really?! Why not? So these guys can say anything and not be accountable?! Disappointing that a company as old and established as Microsoft
 can't get a simple thing like customer service right. I will probably never buy from this site again. Not worth the potential problems. Glad it was resolved though, even though it took two hours out of my day.

            When dealing with Microsoft Store shipments, it's best to work with the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/28808/microsoft-store-contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store Support system</a>, instead of that for <a href="https://support.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live</a> itself. Of course, where you choose to make future purchases is completely up to you, and I'm glad to hear your situation was indeed resolved.<br />

            Just to add, with design lab controllers you are charged immediately since this is a custom product and then it takes 2-3 weeks for shipment (which is noted when you check out). So aside from the support agent, your order was actually processed and done
 correctly.

<h3> yfrancois  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer blue screens or forces restart constantly</h2>
                    <p>Basically whenever I try to play any game (WoW, Pubg, Battlerite and so on) and browse on chrome at the same time I blue screen or my computer forces a restart immediately sometimes it happens even just while I'm playing games only I'm unsure what the cause
 is at this point and not sure where else to ask.<br />
<br />
Specs:</p>
<p>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz</p>
<p>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB</p>
<p>SSD: Kingston sv300s37a240g</p>
<p>HDD:&nbsp;Seagate ST1000DX001 1CM162</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of things I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CHKDSK</p>
<p>Verifier Scan</p>
<p>Scanned for Viruses</p>
<p>Updated Drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Computer doesnt overheat I'll be crashing and both GPU and CPU are sitting at &lt;60 degrees one more notable thing about the crashes is that generally I will recieve a windows stutter and audio stutter than windows will be the first to crash I'll be able to
 play for a couple minutes more before I blue screen but I can't open task manager cause windows doesn't respond and than other programs one by one begin to also not respond until I blue screen.

            Yes, it says the same.
<br />
<br />Did you get the driver updated?
<br />
<br />Can you check what version is now installed:
<br />
<br />Open the Device Manager and double-click the wireless adapter &gt; Version
<br />
<br />What is the "Driver Version" ?

            OK, good luck!
<br />
<br />12.0.0.448 does appear to be the latest version so hopefully the issue is fixed.

<h2>            Splite&#58; ZoneAlarm interfering with Windows Update</h2>
                    Hello again,<br />
<br />
After the last re-install of Windows I decided to let the Live One Care trial period run out instead of installing my ZoneAlarm Anti-Virus and Firewall program. Everything worked fine. When the Live One Care period expired I installed my ZoneAlarm program and
 the problems started happening, but not specifically with Windows Update. I think the problem in my case was the Internet Security ZoneAlarm Suite. I think there's a compatablity problem between Vista and ZoneAlarm.<br />

            Security suites are known to cause interferrence with Windows Update, I suggest disabling them if the update is not successful and retesting. Are you able to apply any windows updates or is this occuring for all?

    <title>IR blaster setup&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikelavella  say:</h3>
<h2>            IR blaster setup&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently bought an Xbox One without a Kinect and am trying to connect my tv, satellite box and audio receive through these IR blaster cables:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Extender-Blaster-Cable-Head-Foot/dp/B00I47O26E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Extender-Blaster-Cable-Head-Foot/dp/B00I47O26E</a></p>
<p>I wasn't able to get the three components to turn on and off with the Xbox so I wasn't sure if I need an IR blaster with three heads? &nbsp;Also, I'm using the Xbox Smart Glass app. &nbsp;Will I be able to turn everything on/off with the app or do I need the Media
 Remote?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The only way I know to use the IR blasting tech is through the console with the Kinect. &nbsp;The smartglass app connects directly to the console and the kinect is needed to broadcast the IR signal.</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses. I was able to get everything to be controlled by the Xbox with the IR blaster cable without Kinnect. &nbsp;What I needed to do was use the HDMI cable that came with the Xbox to plug that into the Dish receiver and Xbox one. &nbsp;Apparently
 that HDMI cable that comes with the system is able to send and receive signals between both components? &nbsp;Not sure about that but I read it online somewhere. &nbsp;I then positioned the IR blasters in locations that my tv, audio receiver and Dish receiver could
 receive the signals from my Xbox. &nbsp;Pretty cool to be able to control everything through the use of the SmartGlass app!</p>

            Hello,
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB:
<br />Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

    <title>Dropdowns in Windows 10 collapse on their own in seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dropdowns in Windows 10 collapse on their own in seconds</h2>
                    <p>New Toshiba w/ Windows 10 Home 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:&nbsp; Any dropdown menus automatically collapse from opening ranging from a fraction of a second to five seconds.&nbsp; Generally this makes it difficult to impossible to open a dropdown menu and make a selection b/c the options are only available for a limited
 period of time.&nbsp; When the windows collapse the cursor will gain the circular process icon momentarily.&nbsp; It was like this out of the box so I'm certain that the cause isn't anything I've installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this has to do with moving the cursor.&nbsp; For instance at the bottom of this post there is a dropdown menu to select the Topic.&nbsp; If I click on this dropdown it immediately opens and closes.&nbsp; If I click again w/o use of cursor I can up/down arrow
 my way through w/o the dropdown disappearing.&nbsp; Just as soon as I touch the laptop pad the process circle appears and dropdown collapses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Examples of dropdowns:&nbsp; the URL bar in Firefox/IE; system windows like task manager 'Options' dropdown, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            Laptop charger plugged in but not charging&#33; help&#33; urgent&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I have a Samsung Laptop and currently running Windows 10 build 1604. Few days ago, when I plugged off the charger from my laptop then it shut down completely and plugged in again and turned the power button. Laptop works fine but the I noticed that the
 charging LED doesn't changes it colour and it's flashing. I then clicked on battery icon and says "73% available(plugged in, not charging)". Just to let you guys know, I have tried this solution from the internet:</p>
<p>1) Open device manager, uninstall "Microsoft ACPI- Compliant control Method battery" &amp; "Microsoft AC adapter"</p>
<p>2) shut down and remove battery</p>
<p>3) plugin the power cord and turn laptop on and repeat process 1 &amp; 2</p>
<p>4) remove the power cord and place the battery and plugin the power cord, turn on the Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this doesn't fixes my issues and the problem still remains. please help if you have any idea. help!!! Urgent!!</p>

<p>Hi! First of all, I can't use my laptop if it's not plugged in and when I plug in the charger then the orange led flashes rather than staying at the same position(green when full charge) but it's not doing that anymore and keeps on flashing. The status of
 the battery stays the same. Any idea then please help!</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

            <p>That cannot really be answered, I don't know where you are to suggest sources that you can use. Possibly not appropriate to recommend specific brands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously the safest option is the manufacturer brand but that tends to be the most expensive. The main thing to avoid are direct Chinese supply which takes a week or more to deliver, you should expect reputable companies to supply from local stock.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. but I have got one more problem which I want to discuss. My system drive (not local disk:C) is fragmented 57% and when I try to optimise it then it stays at the same rate apparently! when I installed windows 10 then it fragmented
 like 8% and by day it increased and then I say that it went to 57% and my local disk is also fragmented to 5%. However, I have tried defragmenting it with different software(smart defrag) but with no luck it stays at the same when I analyse it through the
 default defragment and optimise app(Defrag and optimise drives). </p>
<p>please help if you can. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 photo app incorrect dating of folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airbournepickle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 photo app incorrect dating of folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I see various other posts of a similar nature. I'll try to explain the problem I'm having and post a screen shot to help illustrate.&nbsp;<br />
The issue is this.&nbsp; I have photos and videos on a Canon Camera which I have imported using&nbsp; windows 10 app: Photos, but some of the resulting folders have a folder name of a date which does NOT match the date that the images were taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the images in the attached screen shot were taken ("date taken") on
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">7th</span> Jan 2018.</p>
<p>&nbsp;the expected behavior of the APP when importing is that it will import the photos to a folder named as follows:</p>
<p>"2018-01<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">-07"</span></strong></p>
<p>However, what "photos" is doing is creating the folder with the <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">
wrong date .</span></p>
<p>eg, for some reason, it is creating a folder named&nbsp;</p>
<p>"2018-01-<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">06</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">"</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though all the photos that are inside the folder have a "date taken" attribute of 7th Jan 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to do this with some days, and not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this might seem like a minor issue, (eg 'why don't you just rename the folder?')&nbsp; I don't want to have to do that for the hundreds of days worth of pictures that I have. It would mean having to open each folder, then open and image and check if the
 issue has presented itself and then manually rename the folder to have the correct date. This would be time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so we are clear - this is a new computer, the system clock is fine and accurate (eg the time and date are "up to date")</p>
<p>Also there is nothing wrong with the camera, and the date and time on the camera are (and always have been) up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to provide a little context - the process I'm using in windows Photos app is as follows:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">1) click on Import (top right of app)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">2 Choose "from USB device"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">3) App askes me to choose the photos I want to import. I select all, and clicked "Import settings" first....</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">4) In the Import settings, I <strong>check </strong>
that I have it set to "<strong>By Date</strong>" and then click "done"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">5) I click on "import Selected"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">6) I watch as the photos app begins to create folders, for which the naming conventions is "by date" but... as described above, it uses the
<strong>wrong date</strong> to name <strong><em>some </em></strong>of the folders,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            stop games from being deleted</h2>
                    
<p>hi. i'm just wondering if there's a way to prevent downloaded games from being deleted as the delete option is directly under the play which can be accidentally pressed by my 3 yr. old. i just find the placement of the delete option silly or at least there
 should be a password protect as the downloaded content is sometimes 4gb and is a pain to download again and again.</p>

<p>Set the game up and running &nbsp;for your kid, then keep an eye on them while they play so they cant back out &amp; delete the games.

<p>There is no lock or password to do it so as far as I know this is the only way..</p>

</p><p>Typing the name of a known file (e.g. IMG_1234.jpg) results in no results...unless...I click on the Photo Filter...then Cortana it finds it. &nbsp;This occurs regardless of the location of the photo file (e.g. within Pictures, on the Desktop, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reset Cortana search...without resetting the entire system?</p>
<p>Why can't the "All" filter be the default...it seems to be on my other Windows 10 machine (laptop w. Anniv.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue was present before and after the Anniversary update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your consideration and help,</p>

            <p>Since the above steps did not work, let’s try these methods:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Rebuilding Index</strong></p>
<p><br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on <strong>Start</strong> <strong>Button</strong> &gt; select <strong>
Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open <strong>Indexing</strong> <strong>Options</strong> &gt; click <strong>Advanced</strong>
<strong>Options</strong> &gt; click <strong>Rebuild</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fffebd0-22e2-4e75-922c-108dca94f66f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fffebd0-22e2-4e75-922c-108dca94f66f" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Under <strong>File</strong> <strong>Types</strong> tab, you can also choose the type of files you want to search.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Train Cortana</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Cortana</strong> search box.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f61bbbae-4ba3-4d0a-9302-49ce841f0f53" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f61bbbae-4ba3-4d0a-9302-49ce841f0f53" /></a><br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select <strong>Settings</strong>. Make sure that <strong>“Hey</strong>, <strong>
Cortana”</strong> is enabled and that <strong>“Respond</strong> <strong>to”</strong> is set to
<strong>“To</strong> <strong>me</strong>.” Select <strong>Learn</strong> <strong>
my</strong> <strong>voice</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b27c7703-96a9-4148-a9d1-a19768fb9263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b27c7703-96a9-4148-a9d1-a19768fb9263" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0cab06c-98a1-4b49-95de-af17de239f58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c0cab06c-98a1-4b49-95de-af17de239f58" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the steps through the wizard and repeat the test phrases back as prompted.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you’re done, <strong>Cortana</strong> will understand you better and will respond more quickly and accurately to your voice.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Carlo F. but no luck with Method 1. &nbsp;I don't use voice control so did not try Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe a graphic will help:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Figure 1</strong>...this is what I see after I type "M-Audio" in the Search Windows box (after Windows Key). &nbsp;I'm looking for a photo that starts with "M-Audio". &nbsp;Note the 2 filters (circled in red).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then click More, and click on the Photos filter icon. &nbsp;Only then do I find one or more photos (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). &nbsp;By the way, the photo file is not found even when I click the All filter icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are my search results being limited by the filters Apps and Documents? &nbsp;How can I eliminate that restriction?</p>

            I lanuched the troubleshoot and rebuilt the index, and they did not solve the problem. I did not "train Cortana" because I don't use the microphone, I just type the words.<br />

            <p>Hello again from Mike...I started this discussion many months ago</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is still not resolved for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In frustration, I have moved on to use a third party search tool (Everything from David Carpenter)...it works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recent <strong>unsuccessful </strong>efforts to fix Win10 Search:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed a link to a site that spoke to this issue (screen cap below). &nbsp;It suggested a change to Group Policy...but as a Win10 Home user (Win 10.0.14393), I am not allowed access to that feature. &nbsp;But maybe it will help others. &nbsp;Because it discusses issues
 caused by a user disallowing Web results when using Win 10 (I did that), I tried enabling Web results using the Settings in Search...no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My post on Oct 31st (with Figures 1 &amp; 2) is still the best statement of my problem.</p>

    <title>How to backup registry - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to backup registry</h2>
                    From time to time I will see suggestions on how to fix different issues.&nbsp; Sometimes it requires someone to use regedit and they will be warned to first make a backup of the registry.&nbsp; My question is this:&nbsp; if I have restore enabled on my machine does tyhat
 provide registry backup?&nbsp; I thought that when one does a system restore to a prior date it was the rtegistry for that prior date that is being put back up on the pc.&nbsp; Is this enough or should I take additional steps if I ever need to use regedit?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

Always do a Backup of the Registry before editing it.<br />
<br />
System Restore is not infallible; and neither is the access path&nbsp;to it.<br />
<br />
Follow the advice given to you to back up the Registry.<br />
<br />
Here is a very good guide by <strong>John Barnett MVP</strong> on how to do it:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Printing 2 Pages on 1 Page Problem</h2>
                    Hello. Since upgrading to Windows 10, when I try to print a 2 page PDF or 2 Page Excel document, the print preview shows a page range of 1-2, I can clearly see both pages, Print ALL pages is checked, the page orientation of Landscape is checked, yet every
 time from multiple printers, it still prints in Portrait, and shrinks everything to fit on one page. I have used this same method of printing for the last 3 years with no issues and understand the printing settings. Everything looks right in the preview, but
 I cannot get the actual print out to match the settings.

<p>
</p><p>Go to the Services pane in your Task manager. Find the windows update service and stop it. Make sure its stopped. Then disable a service called BITS. Make sure that is stopped too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution. Delete everything in that directory. Not the folder itself, but the stuff in it. Make sure everything is deleted properly. Now restart your computer. The Windoes Store should now open and download everything properly.
 This also fixed mail not opening for me too.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 forgets language switching key combiantion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jozsef szasz-fabian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 forgets language switching key combiantion</h2>
                    <p>There is a VERY ANNOYING problem in Windows 10. It's resetting by itself the language switching keyboard combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, people at Microsoft... It is so hard to save the content of a dialog and keep it FOREVER?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to reproduce the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to language preferences</p>
<p>2. Click "Advanced keyboard settings"</p>
<p>3. Click "Language bar options"</p>
<p>4. Select the "Advanced key settings" tab.</p>
<p>5. Click "Change Key Sequence"</p>
<p>6. Set Ctrl+Shift+1 for the 1st language,&nbsp;Ctrl+Shift+2 for the 2nd language,&nbsp;Ctrl+Shift+3 for the 3rd language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outcomes, not predictable, chaotic:</p>
<p>- If I click "Apply", the key sequence may reset. Sometimes. Sometimes mean by random, I can't find the cause of the behavior.</p>
<p>- Keep setting over and over again the key sequence. After closing the dialog, the key sequence DOES NOT WORK. I have no ideas why does not work. So I'm logging out and back in, SOMETIMES the keys sequences are working.</p>
<p>- After setting the key sequence 1000 times and logging out and back in 1000 times, the key sequences work, but after some time (between 15 and 30 minutes), the keys sequences STOP WORKING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 computers, all of them has the same behavior. I tried to use online/offline accounts in the hope that something gets wrong with the account sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 here, Feature update version 1803 (2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft offer a separate software that will run in the background and will set the keyboard language switching key sequence every 1 minute? Because the designed way DOES NOT WORK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please people at Microsoft, do a test, people are trying to work with computers, not constantly seek for support, reset settings, reinstall software, etc.</p>

<p>Hello Jozsef,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing me a detailed information of your concern. Upon researching the said issue, it seems that Windows 10 has separate language settings for the Lock Screen. Due to this, whenever you're about to use your computer again from sleep, hibernation,
 screensaver/lock screen; it switches back to the default settings. I'd suggest applying the steps below and check if this helps resolve your issue with Language hotkey/key sequence:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Apply/configure your desired hotkey/key sequence.</p>
<p>2. Launch <em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em>, then select <em><strong>Clock, Language, and Region</strong></em>.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong><em>Region</em></strong>, go to <strong><em>Administrative</em></strong> tab. Click on
<strong><em>Copy settings</em></strong> button.</p>
<p>4. Under <em><strong>Welcome screen and new user accounts settings </strong></em>window, make sure to check the boxes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Welcome screen and system account</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>New user accounts</strong></em></li></ul>
<p>5. Click <em><strong>OK </strong></em>to save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have done that countless times. I applied the language settings to welcome screen and other users (which is another bug, entering the welcome screen why does clear the settings??).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, <strong>it's a bug</strong>. Not tested well enough, made in hurry, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, the computer isn't going in sleep or welcome state. I'm just working. The settings are lost WITHOUT REASON.</p>
<p>See the screenshot what I get after opening the same dialog after 30 minutes:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c75b99ea-a5f6-4d44-9dec-7df29bc23306?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c75b99ea-a5f6-4d44-9dec-7df29bc23306?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Now, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Ctrl + Shift + 1</span> changes to English - ok.</p>
<p>But <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Ctrl + Shift + 2</span> <strong>DOES NOT WORK</strong>. Although in the dialog it seems to be set.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Ctrl + Shift + 3</span> Changes the lang. to RO - ??? This setting seems to be cleared, but still works. What's happening here?</p>
<p>So changing to HU does not work, although the settings show another thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I start the computer, I set&nbsp;Ctrl + Shift + 1,&nbsp;Ctrl + Shift + 2&nbsp; and&nbsp;Ctrl + Shift + 3. Then copy settings to Weclome screen and New user accounts –
<strong>THE SETTINGS WILL NOT WORK UNTIL SIGN OUT AND SIGN IN AGAIN</strong>. Ok, sign out, sign in, start working, after 30 minutes I get the settings attached above and Ctrl + Shift + 2 not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please file an urgent bug report to developers. Tell them, stop doing fancy things, fix what was working in XP and 7, and it's broken in 10. The problem is at least 2 years old, Microsoft has failed to solve this simple 1st grade programming task. Just google
 the problem, you will see, countless people has the problem. Nobody provided until now a working solution, because there is a hard coded bug in Windows.</p>

            My problem is related. The system Windows-2010 does not remember the keyboard language set on the previous session. On restart the keyboard language aleays has to be reset. There is probably a simple solution to this I hope so . It would be good to know
 what to do.

<p>Ok, are there any updates on this by now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have had several Windows updates and I can sadly confirm, that this *bug* remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had just two languages installed, the keyboard shortcuts would all be wiped at times.</p>
<p>Now that I have four languages installed, with the fourth one being Chinese, oddly this one survived, and the first three get wiped at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am saying at times because it is hard to know what triggers this. Activating the lock screen does not trigger it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sometimes have the suspicion that the deletion of the Language Bar Options of the Advanced Keyboard Settings is actually triggered by updates or a reboot but I am not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, this isn't very 'advanced' to let users switch between keyboards when they have to work with more than one language. This affects a lot of people, at least everyone who needs to deal with English and their native language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, this isn't a minor annoyance, the loss of the keyboard configuration happens quite frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, assume the situation at a university, where different students speak different languages. It must be possible to have a user-specific setting for the keyboard, not one that is uniform across the whole system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, not even a uniform setting for the whole system can be configured through the settings dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also kindly request that this issue is escalated -- thank you for your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>D Kreil</p>

<h2>            Skype gibt keinen Ton von sich</h2>
                    <p>Guten Morgen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seit einiger Zeit, kann ich meinen Ansprechpartner per Skype auf meinem PC nicht mehr hören. Wir sehen uns, Sie hören mich, ich höre nichts.</p>
<p>Meine Boxen oder Headsets funktionieren bei allen anderen Programmen ganz gut, nur bei Skype nicht. Kann mir jemanden helfen?</p>
<p>Das Programm deinstallieren und neu laden, habe ich bereits 2x erfolglos durchgeführt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Danke für die Unterstützung.</p>
<p>Catherine</p>

            Try these 5 basic troubleshooting steps first and please update me
<br />
<br />1. To isolate the issue, can you make call using either Web Skype or Classic Skype (Download)
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>

<h2>            BSOD - Driver Verifier DMP file -- Driver IRQ Not Less or Equal &#40;and others&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I followed Patrick's advice in a January thread.&nbsp; I'd been getting&nbsp; BSOD's several times per day.
<br />
</p>
<p>The one that googled me here is "Driver IRQL Not Less or Equal.".<br />
Also got "PFN_LIST_CORRUPT"&nbsp; and "MEMORY_MANAGEMENT" and "WIN32K.SYS"<br />
<br />
Before booting into Driver Verifier:<br />
Removed IOBIT, cleared the Registry and did a disk search for urlfilter.sus<br />
Checked settings as advised, to assure generating a dmp file<br />
<br />
Driver Verifier BSOD'd at boot.&nbsp; I never got in, but had no trouble turning Verifier if and booting into regular Windows.<br />
<br />
My dmp is on OneDrive with editing privileges.&nbsp;&nbsp; http://1drv.ms/1kfGlHi<br />
<br />
I;ve had a computer in my home since 1978, (small-business computer in those days), but I was blown away with the level of help, detail and clarity that I've discovered here.&nbsp; You folks ROCK.<br />

            Yes I posted only part of the analysis that was important.<br />
<br />
<p>BugCheck 1000007E, {c0000005, 8f0f2503, 807868cc, 807864b0}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : SASKUTIL.SYS ( SASKUTIL+7503 )<br />
<br />
I looked at a lot of possibilities and none helped.<br />
<br />
As&nbsp; said in my last reply because you tried Linux and re-installed Windows that points to
<br />
hardware almost 100% (like 99.999%).<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
Hardware issues do not necessarily mean hard drive issues. Hardware included all parts of the<br />
computer that can be touched (have a physical presence).<br />
<br />
Heat related does not always&nbsp;mean excessive heat as any one electronic component could<br />
be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat. Do try adding a fan to see if that helps</p>
<p>at all. If it does help heat is part of the issue though it could mean a failed/failing component.<br />
However if it doesn't help it does not mean heat is not part of the issue.<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
Yes there has been an issue here lately with Submit and some other functions. It often<br />
helps to refresh the page and try again.<br />

<h2>            HD Audio Bus Drivers required but not found.</h2>
                    I have a compaq nc6320 laptop. I had to reinstall the OS, Windows XP Pro &nbsp;and everything installed EXCEPT the audio. Before the re-install, i took note of the audio drivers, SoundMax with MS UAA. OK, but am unable to locate the driver for the bus. Eveything
 out there is "Driver Detective or Driver something" and they want $$$. HP.com doe not have the drivers for this. Amazing! Does anyone know how to re-install the audio?

            &nbsp;&nbsp; have you tried the maker of the processor's website for the right motherboard, chipset drivers ? Your audio will be one of these as well, and they should have the correct ones for you. "http://downloadcenter.intel.com ". for an "intel inside machine.&nbsp;
 "http://support.amd.com/ ". if it is an AMD equipped unit. THESE WOULD BE THE PLACE TO GET THE CORRECT DRIVERS, FOR FREE, MATCHED TO YOUR UNIT AND MOTHERBOARD, AND OP SYSTEM.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Make
 sure your installation of Windows XP has been updated to service pack 2 or service pack 3 before continuing. Right-click on “My computer” icon on desktop. Select “Properties\ General. If your system does not include service pack, please update from Microsoft's
 official website. Connect to internet and launch “Internet Explorer”, click “Tools” on the tool bar and select “Windows Update”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Make
 sure that the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio” exists in “Device manager\ System devices”. Right-click the “My computer” icon on your desktop. Select “Properties\ Hardware\ Device Manager. If the “UAA Bus Driver” does not exist, install
 it from the download link below to install on your system (for some reason, Microsoft does not post a download link for this update anywhere on their site). Launch the sp32646 file you have downloaded from HP's website (URL below) and reboot computer after
 the installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio” is working properly, there may be an “Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus” or "Realtek High Definition Audio" behind “Sound, video and game controllers” or an “Unknown device” behind “Other devices”.
 Please disable any of these devices. You can skip this step if device mentioned earlier does not exist in “Device Manager”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Disable
 the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio” under "System Devices".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>After
 that, uninstall the “Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for High Definition Audio" by right-clicking the device and select uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>When
 finish with the above steps, click the “Scan for hardware changes” button by clicking on the computer icon with magnifying glass toward the top of the page. When the “Found new hardware wizard” is displayed, don't click the “Next” button. Instead, cancel the
 installation by clicking cancel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>You
 can now install the audio driver from the driver file that you have downloaded from the internet (recommended, Realtek site below) or from your driver CD/ DVD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
