            Your best bet is to reinstall the OS as you don't know what else was done (meaning any Group Policy, etc). Failing that, you can click
<br />
Start &gt; right-click Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Change Settings (where it says Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings) &gt; Change (To rename this computer or change its domain or workgroup) &gt; Select Workgroup and type WORKGROUP &gt; then OK it all. You will be
 prompted that you have to reboot for changes to take effect.<br />
<br />
Note: it will prompt you for an account with authority to remove the computer from the domain. Your wife's account probably won't cut it, but it doesn't hurt to try.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            I format my PC and have the product ID but not activation key</h2>
                    Hello people,<br />
<br />
As the question says, I format my computer forgetting to retrieve my activation key. I did, however, retrieve my product ID before formatting the device. The copy of Windows installed previously was purchased through Anytime Upgrade.<br />
I know that, typically, there is no way of getting that key back, but is it at all possible given that I have the product ID and the same hardware set? please advice.<br />

<p>Will you send me an email confirmation with my Product Key?</p>
</b>
<p>Yes. An e-mail containing your Product Key will be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Windows Live ID or to the e-mail you provided if you skipped account setup. Note: If you are using an e-mail spam blocker tool or junk mail filter, make sure
 you can receive e-mail messages from microsoft.com.</p>

<p>If you lose your Product Key you can return to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/i-format-my-pc-and-have-the-product-id-but-not/www.windows7.com/getkey">www.windows7.com/getkey</a>
 and sign in using the 'Sign In' link in the top right corner of the page. This will retrieve your Product Key if you established your account with your Windows Live ID. If you did not setup a Windows Live ID account initially there is no record of your Product
 Key online. Check your e-mail since this is the only record of your Product Key.</p>

<h2>            File Associations</h2>
                    By default, images are automatically opened by HP MediaSmart. I&nbsp;have installed ACDSee (viewer) and want to use this program for my default viewer. I clicked on
<strong>START</strong> / <strong>DEFAULT PROGRAMS</strong> / <strong>ASSOCIATE A FILE TYPE OR PROTOCAL WITH A PROGRAM</strong>&nbsp;<br />
I find my&nbsp;file format (.jpg) in the list and highlight it. I then click on <strong>
CHANGE PROGRAM</strong>.&nbsp;A list opens up but ASCSee is not listed there. I click on
<strong>OTHER PROGRAMS</strong>. ACDSee is not listed there either.&nbsp;I click on <strong>
BROWSE</strong>. ACDSee is not listed here either. How can I change the default program to open a .jpg if I can't find ACDSee listed?<br />
<br />
I have clicked on&nbsp;<strong>MY COMPUTER</strong> to&nbsp;locate and open a folder containing many thumbnail images. I have right-clicked on a .jpg image to get the properties. The computer tells me the&nbsp;<strong>TYPE OF FILE</strong> is: HPTSMSMVP.JPG (.JPG). I clicked
 on the <strong>CHANGE</strong> button. I'm&nbsp;again looking at the same information in the first paragraph above, and there's still no sign of ACDSee anywhere. What gives? ACDSee is&nbsp;definitely installed on my computer and works just fine.&nbsp;Please tell me how to&nbsp;prevent
 HP MediaSmart from opening these common image files, allowing ASCDSee to do&nbsp;it instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 HD w&#47; DLC for Xbox 360 from Sega&#58; no voices. Why&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently got up a plethora of games for the Xbox 360. I recently started playing Sonic Adventure and immediately realized I could not hear the female narrator. I start playing the
 game and there were no voices from a characters during the dialogue scenes. I went into the options and cannot find anything viable to turn them on. I exited the game, deleted it from my hard drive, and re-downloaded it. I got the same result: no voices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started playing Sonic Adventure 2 and I still got no voices. I restarted my system and still got the same results, although I did not delete and re-download the game. The voices during
 the dialogue scenes were not active but during gameplay, I can only hear grunting from the characters every now and then. I started doing research online about this and found absolutely nothing, at least for the Xbox 360. I found plenty of problems and solutions
 to the exact same problem and more for the PC version pre and post-Steam release of the PC version port of the Sonic Adventure games.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to search elsewhere online. I have found gameplay footage on YouTube of the Xbox 360 versions of both games that have the dialogue of the characters working. Now I am at a complete
 loss as to why the dialogue does not work for either game. Iâ€™ve played a bit of Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast and Sonic Adventure 2: Battle for the GameCube. I know this is not supposed to be disabled by any means. I bought both HD remakes and their downloadable
 content between last Thursday and Friday. My ultimate question is: why is there no dialogue at all in either game? They are what make the games special to me.</span></p>

<h2>            Errors found in the Event Viewer</h2>
                    Hi Microsoft!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm very sorry if I have so many inquiries regarding these messages found on the event viewer. I was able to see this when the laptop suddenly shut down during playing games. The screen just turned black without notice, and it gives me quite a headache.
 Here are some error messages in the event viewer:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The speed of processor 1 in group 0 is being limited by system firmware. The processor has been in this reduced performance state for 14 seconds since the last report.</div>

<div>"A new BITS job could not be created. The current job count for the user DAI-PC\user (98) is equal to or greater than the job limit (60) specified through group policy. &nbsp;To correct the problem, complete or cancel the BITS jobs that haven't made progress
 by looking at the error, and restart the BITS service. If this error recurs, contact your system administrator and increate the per-user and per-computer Group Policy job limits." (Bits-Client)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Your computer was not assigned an address from the network (by the DHCP Server) for the Network Card with network address 0x06659D26B4D6. &nbsp;The following error occurred: 0x79. Your computer will continue to try and obtain an address on its own from the

<div><br />
</div>
<div>"LMS Service cannot connect to Intel(R) MEI driver"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Custom dynamic link libraries are being loaded for every application. The system administrator should review the list of libraries to ensure they are related to trusted applications."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And this was the message that I was quite puzzled when I rebooted the laptop:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hadn't installed anything lately on the laptop, the last one was months ago and I didn't have a problem like this. Whenever I play computer games, 5-10 minutes later, the laptops suddenly shuts down without a reason.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By the way, here is the specs of the laptop:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Acer Aspire 4738Z</div>
<div>Intel Dual Core Pentium Processor P6100 @ 2.00 GHz</div>
<div>2.00 GB RAM</div>
<div>500 GB HDD</div>
<div>Intel HD Graphics</div>
<div>Windows 7 Starter</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am very hopeful that someone can answer my inquiries. I am very troubled on what is happening to the laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thank you in advance Microsoft to your reply. :)</div>

            Hi John,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which game are you trying to play?</div>
<div>2. Is it an online game or a game which is installed on your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

In order to troubleshoot this issue, I would suggest you to try performing a <em>
clean boot </em>on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer: <strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong></div>

            The games that I play that have the shutdown-problems were Rome: Total War and Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth, somewhat old games that were release few years back. Since I am not a fan of having it played online, I only do it on the laptop.
 I could play it for about a few minutes, then suddenly whenever I finish a battle(for LOTR) or end a turn (for RTW), the laptop suddenly shuts down without reason. Since then, I haven't played it yet.<br />
<br />
I would be trying the clean boot later, on my spare time.
<div><br />
<div>The BIOS of the laptops seems to be updated, since this laptop was bought back almost 2 years ago. And, we have a cooling fan for the laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In terms of the game performance problems, the games are updated up to the latest version, and DirectX 10 is installed in the computer. Device drivers, also, are updated according to the laptop (whenever I press Update Driver, it says it is updated). The
 graphic properties of the games mentioned above can be handled at medium to high settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows Experience Index, however, rates Graphics to 4.1 while Gaming graphics to 5.0.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is something that I never encountered with the other laptop here at home. I just find it weird since I am just fond of playing games.</div>

            If the laptop completely shuts down without warning when playing games, there is a good chance that it is simply overheating. &nbsp;When the laptop overheats, the computer will shut down without warning to prevent damage.
<div><br />
<div>I had the same happening. &nbsp;I downloaded a programme that can read out the temperatures, and indeed, when playing games (both proper games, but also some poorly programmed online flash games), or when watching some streamed TV (depends on the provider though
 as some streams put more strain on CPU/GPU than others), the temperature shot up hugely and then shut down when reaching (I think) 107Â°C.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The solution I found was to use a laptop cooler, which is a tilted stand made of metal mesh, which has several fans attached to the bottom that blow air into the laptop. &nbsp;I have one where the fans can be attached at various places so I tried to find the
 parts of the laptop that got particularly hot, and had openings for air, and attached the fans appropriately.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I still had one or two cases of shutdown since buying this a couple of years ago, but generally, it has prevented the computer from shutting down.</div>

            I think that is the case itself. I just uninstalled my Rome:Total War a month ago so that the problem would be gone. Everything worked well already after that, up until last night. I was playing Battle for Middle Earth for about 30 full minutes when the
 laptop suddenly shuts down again. Before that, the laptop was very much noisy on its cooler and when it shut down, the cooler was hot.

            I don't see RAM as the case, since I can play NBA 2K12 (on medium graphics) without even experiencing the shut downs. I even had full scans to check if there was malware, but nothing was found. But on BME (on medium graphics), it shuts down.

<h2>            PAL Issues with XBox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,<br />
So yeah, after being filled with nostalgia by the Hitman Absolution reveal at E3, I decided to buy Blood Money through Games on Demand. However I've not been able to get onto the game yet. Each time I launch the game I am greeted with the following message,
 before being diverted back to the Dashboard;<br />
"<i>This game does not support PAL-50. Please change your display settings to PAL-60. To change your setting, in System, select Control Settings, Display."</i><br />
<br />
However I cannot for the life of me find any settings for PAL at all. I've tried it both over HDMI and Scart on two separate televisions, and it doesn't appear anywhere. Am I being completely blind, or is something else the problem? Any help would be greatly
 appreciated [=</p>

<p>So, I upgraded from Vista to win8 on my laptop about 3 months ago (via dvd/cd). &nbsp;Now I want to update to 8.1 but there's a big problem...I have limited data plan and use my phone as a hotspot. &nbsp;So...can I get a cd/dvd (free) to update my system? &nbsp;It seems

<p>Unfortunately, there is a new free Windows 8.1 DVD available right now.&nbsp; It is however available for
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8.1/productID.288401200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
purchase</a>.&nbsp; As you have a limited data plan, I would suggest you to wait till the Windows 8.1 ISO is released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<p>I have done the fix it bit, and they showed once, for about 1/2 second and then when I tried to click on them, they disappeared. No matter what I do, I don't seem to get any language packs. I had them at one time and then Dell messed my computer up and I
 had to do a complete reinstall and they ERASED the language updates that I had transferred from the old computer to the new one and now I cannot find any of them and I also HAD the Chinese and Japanese, etc. and they have gone away and are no longer available
 apparently. AND it will not let me download the .Net update it keeps insisting is important. I don't even know if I HAVE the network installed but I cannot make this go away.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Avoid re-activation prompts when installed in Virtualbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donald-dino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Avoid re-activation prompts when installed in Virtualbox</h2>
                    Is there a way to avoid constant prompts to re-activate Win7, which is running in Virtualbox under Linux?&nbsp; I frequently change OS versions and distributions under my root partition (/) but my home partition (/home), where Virtualbox and Win 7 are installed,
 is constant.&nbsp; It seems like I get prompted to re-activate when I upgrade distro versions or complete distros and, especially, if I make hardware changes to the real OR virtual environments.&nbsp; At this point, I've started ignoring the prompts because I'll soon
 run out of re-activation allowances (started with only 5).&nbsp; Is there a technique I can follow to that will allow distro activity without depleting my re-activation allowances?&nbsp; Is there any harm in just not re-activating ... I don't care too much about updates?&nbsp;
 Thank you.

            <p>Hi Sanjay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you aware of any hardware or changes made on the PC prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might face this issue if the PC is infected with a virus/malware or if annoying script or a program was installed&nbsp;unknowingly when browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:<br />
First, let's run a virus scanner with Microsoft Safety Scanner.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, let us diagnose the issue in Safe Mode and in a Clean boot state.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>Safe Mode: <br />
</span>Starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not get this error message in Safe Mode, then you can troubleshoot the issue in a Clean Boot state.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Clean boot:</p>
You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.

<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; After troubleshooting, refer to the section â€˜How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshootingâ€™.</span></span></p>

            Hi JT-KFI,
<br />
<br />I would do a disk cleanup to remove temp files and unused system files:
<br />
<br />To delete temporary files:
<br />Search for Disk cleanup from the taskbar and select it from the list of results.
<br />Under Files to delete, select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.
<br />Select OK.
<br />If you need to free up more space, you can also delete system files:
<br />In Disk cleanup, select Clean up system files.
<br />Select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.
<br />Select OK.

            Thank you for this information however I have tried this and it will only delete minimal megabite files...&nbsp; I go in to "Settings", "Updates &amp; Security", "Update History", "Uninstall Updates" and I can see the updates listed however I have no "Uninstall"
 option on the header bar to the right of the "Organize" option.&nbsp; I also tried right clicking on a file name and nothing, no Uninstall option...&nbsp;

            Sorry to hear that.  Over the last 6 months or so, many people have been learning that 32GB drives are simply not adequate for running Windows 10 in the real world. While they are above the minimum requirements they just aren't big enough.
<br />
<br />This wiki has several tips for freeing up additional space
<br />

<br />
<br />32GB DEVICES ARE TOO SMALL â€¦
<br />If you have a 32GB drive, you have my condolences (I just barely dodged that particular bullet myself). 
<br />Go to this Feedback and upvote it and do ADD your comments!: <a href="https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb</a>
<br />MS has marked it â€œWeâ€™ve got itâ€, but that is not enough. They need to be â€œencouragedâ€ to produce a publicly documented fix for the problem they have created.
<br />
<br />The wiki / article (link above) includes many tips and techniques you can use to free up space on your drive.
<br />
<br />Or, you can bit the bullet and do a clean install of 1709 Fall Creators Update, or even 1803 Spring Creators Update. In the long run, even with re-installing lost applictions it may be faster.

            Ciao KarlaAuld,  
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, you can disable the password if you want.
<br />
<br />Type netplwiz + ENTER in Search bar &gt; Clear Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer &gt; OK &gt; Type username &gt; Type password twice &gt; OK &gt; Restart.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow. 
<br />
<br />Ciao 
<br />Ugo

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            to change the password go to settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; sign-in options
<br />under password,  click the change button 
<br />
<br />do not use blank passwords, this could leave you vulnerable to external hacks and you will experience issues with some other options such as sharing folders.
<br />
<br />to prevent it asking for a password when waking from sleep, go to settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; sign-in options 
<br />under "require sign-in" select Never. 
<br />
<br />to remove the need to enter your password when booting
<br />click start 
<br />type netplwiz and press enter 
<br />untick "users must enter a username and password..." 
<br />click apply 
<br />(if it is already unticked, tick the box and click apply then untick it again and click apply)
<br />you will be asked for a username and password (used to automatically log on). 
<br />if you are using a Microsoft account enter the FULL email address. 
<br />enter and verify your password and click ok 
<br />next time you boot the computer it will automatically log on. 
<br />
<br />
<br />hope that helps please let us know if you experience any problems.

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like the problem you encountered is caused by enabling the metered connection. Though you have allowed to download the updates over metered connection, there's still a possibility of data limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn off the metered connection, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Start&nbsp; &gt; Settings&nbsp; &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi&nbsp; &gt; Manage known networks</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Wi-Fi network &gt; Properties &gt; turn off Set as metered connection</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try installing the update again.</p>
<p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for getting back and for providing some screenshots, Jonathan. The message you received may have something to do with your computer's privacy settings. Let's try to modify it and see if the message
<em><strong>Some settings are managed by your organizatio</strong></em><em><strong>n
</strong></em>will disappear. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy</strong>.</li><li>In the left pane, select <strong>Feedback &amp; diagnostics</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Diagnostic data</em>, select the<strong> Full </strong>option.</li><li>Once done, go back to <strong>Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows update</strong> and see if the message is still there.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

<p>In that case, please try creating a new user account and see if the same error appear. If the error is not present on the new user account, then there's a possibility that the current one is corrupted. Follow these steps to create a user account:</p>

<p>Got it, Jonathan. It's not the Microsoft account that may be corrupted, but the user account on your PC. However, you may skip doing that. In the meantime, let's double check on your registry editor if your Windows Update access is enabled. Please follow
 these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In your Cortana search, type in <strong>regedit</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Once the <em>Registry editor</em> window opens, navigate to: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SOFTWARE &gt; Policies &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; WindowsUpdate</strong>, and then change the
<strong>DisableWindowsUpdateAccess </strong>from <strong>1 </strong>to<strong> 0</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try installing the update again and see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update this thread with the result for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> larrylewendon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to format disk before you can use it - but the memory stick has been used before and is full of data</h2>
                    <p>Windows has been hanging to which the only remedy has been to power off and reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp; I get a screen that says because Windows didn't shut down correctly I should be careful...&nbsp; I always select Start Normally and it seems to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most recent time
 I think that I may have inadvertently told it to start in safe mode.&nbsp; Because it started busily deleting some registry files (I think, not too certain).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plugged in&nbsp; a memory stick that is on regular use and for the message "You need to format the disk in drive F: before you can use it.&nbsp; Do you want to format it?"&nbsp; I cancel and remove the memory stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the stick on other USB2 sockets and other memory sticks on all USB sockets with the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the restore utility to go back to a point when the sticks were being accepted - but I am getting the same message when I try to read a stick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought of using another computer to copy the data from the present sticks onto a different stick that I had formatted using my Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that likely to work?&nbsp; Is there a more elegant solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Amith<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick response.<br />
<br />
Tried all that, haven't got a repair button on Computer/Drive icon/right click.<br />
<br />
By The way, I checked the stick on wife's computer - Vista likes the stick and opens the files on it without any trouble.<br />
<br />
I am tempted to try to format an unused stick using Windows7 just to see whether Windows7 will accept a couple of files put onto the newly formatted stick by my Vista computer.<br />
<br />
But I would still like to hear of a proper solution if you have one!<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Larry

            <p>Hello Amith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, it sounds straightforward and I'll give it a try BUT before I do, can I present you with a few additional facts that might be relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows7 frequently 'hangs' so that nothing works except that sometimes the cursor can be moved about but nothing can be clicked and no keys seem to function.&nbsp; I power off and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; I presented Win7 with an empty but good stick and I got the "you need to format.." message.&nbsp; So I pressed the format button and got a "Windows is unable to complete the format" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Every other stick and SDS card that I have tried to present to Win7 is rejected with the "you need to format.." &nbsp;message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the solution you propose only going to work for a particular stick and will I have to repeat it for every stick/SDS that I wish Win7 to read?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my ignorance, it seems that the problem is Win7 whereas the solution you propose appears to be making a particular stick acceptable when it seems that Win7 won't read anything at all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would I be better off re-installing Win7?&nbsp; And, how big a job would that be?&nbsp; I assume that there is guidance on how to do it and the implications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, before I do anything, I would copy the files on the stick to another stick&nbsp;using my other computer just in case it all went pear-shaped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Larry</p>

            Larry,
<div><br />
<div>As you know, that earlier were discussing in regards to the USB stick issue only and I was unaware of the other issues you were facing with Windows 7.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As per the issues you have mentioned, I am assuming that the issue is with the Windows 7 operating system and Windows re installation would be a much better option.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As you mentioned that you presented Win7 with an empty but good stick and got the "you need to format, which indicates that the issue is with the operating system but not with the memory sticks.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>While re installing Windows 7 please be informed that all the data on the computer will be lost. You will need to backup all your data and then initiate the Windows 7 re installation using a disk. If you purchased the computer from a manufacturer, then
 ask the manufacturer for the disk, or steps to perform a Factory image restore. This will bring back the operating system to state when you first purchased it. Either way, you will loose data. as performing a clean installation would be a better option. Below
 mentioned link will guide you in performing a Windows re installation.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello Amith</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your helpful response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This looks like a BIG JOB, but I suppose I'll have to bite the bullet and do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am getting by using my wife's computer to read files from sticks which are then emailed to me!&nbsp; I'll keep on doing that for a bit until I've thought through exactly what I've got to do to preserve my data, and presumably software packages as well - the
 more I think about it the more daunting it becomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for now I'm satisfied that I know a sensible course of action, I'll go carefully and will certainly let you know if I need more help although I think you've set me in the right direction - Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Gears of War 4 download issues</h2>
                    I have been unable to get Gears of War 4 to download fully since release. I have gotten a hold of the techs and they are adamant that it is m ISP that is the problem. I'm running a constant 50MB/s down and anywhere from 5 to 7MB/s up. It's not my internet.
 The download will get through maybe 10GB before stalling out and after logging in and then logging out I'll get maybe another GB. I am wondering if anyone has found a work around for this yet or not. I have tried troubleshooting some of the error codes others
 are having to verify that it won't be those issues and it's getting pretty ridiculous at this point since I am having no issues downloading any games through other digital service providers like Steam or even Origin.

            <p>I am having the same issue as are thousands of others. This is the biggest games release farce in the history of gaming yet Microsoft seems to be doing nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be an alternative way for us to get the game installed as Store is not working and when does it is so glitchy.<br />
Sort this out Microsoft as I for one will be looking to take legal action against you for the amount of time I have spent trying to install this game on a decent PC with excellent download speeds.</p>

            <p>Stuck at 30Gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is time for an official complaint.<br />
<br />
Anyone know who I should address my complaint to and to who should I serve papers should I seek legal redress against Microsoft for, what is obviously a Windows Store issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see this as an issue my end given I get 50Mbps download speed and my PC specs are:</p>
<p><strong>Carbide 240</strong>/Asus Z170M plus/I5 6600K /Avexir Core Blue Series 16GB /AXP 200 Muscle /Gigabyte FE 1080/256GB Crucial m4/1x1TB &amp; 2TB HDD/ SST-ST60F-P PSU/Dell U3415/CM TK White (browns)/Logitech G400s/.</p>
<p>With a fresh totally updated Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course not forgetting thousands of others are having similar issues.</p>
