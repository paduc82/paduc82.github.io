<h2>            Microsoft ac windows 10 sign in and win 10 re-install M</h2>
                    Microsoft ac windows 10 sign in and win 10 re-install - I seem to have every issue others bring up. Not knowing ( ie windows) that my Microsoft ac is my outlook ac. Do I need to completely wipe my computer and start over? Double up folders / files / installs
 EVERYWHERE ! But not where "computer" is searching&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Maynak</p>
<p>thank you for replying. Yes I have multiple issues!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive had a Microsoft account for quite some time, which I have always considered the same as my outlook ac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However when attempting to "sign into" my Microsoft ac ie as my computers " user" , basically it doesn't acknowledge that profile and asks for my " local" password before I can proceed to sign onto my own computer. To my knowledge I've never possessed a
 " local" password and even if left blank, I can't sign on. Consequently every action I try to perform utilising my local ac I have to give permissions every single time.</p>
<p>i can't restore as I get error codes that files can't be found ...where ever they've been reallocated !&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im going round and round in circles and now just wish to "wipe it" and reinstall win 10. But unable to create usable reboot download " media creation tool"&nbsp;</p>
<p>so considering rebooting and resetting back to factory settings.. Which takes me back to win 8. So it's a real mess!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Just built new Windows 7 64bit machine, Somtimes powers on and does not get to POST, does not always return from sleep or reset</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, as in my title. I've just built a new windows 7 64bit home prem. machine for use as an HTPC, the problems I am having are as follow:-</p>
<p>Firstly, I should mention that one of the sticks of RAM I put in the PC was corrupted which caused all sorts of issues but on removing that a lot cleared up but I am still left with the following issues. (windows memory diagnostic also confirmed this stick
 has errors). Also with the bad stick of RAM out I have run the Hload (Heavy Load) stress testing program for in excess of 4 hours with no problems.</p>
<p>Also when I first powered on the system I had an old copy of windows XP on the HDD which started to load up, could this have somehow corrupted the motherboard as it is specifically designed for Win7/Vista?</p>
<p>Problems remaining:-</p>
<p>1. Powering on the system from a cold start results in a blank screen (No BIOS/POST Screen) then on powering down and trying again it works and proceeds to load windows.</p>
<p>2. When returning from sleep I get similar issues as above, the system hangs before the post screen, but sometimes it works.</p>
<p>3. Using windows reset or the motherboard reset button also makes it hang before the POST screen 50% of the time.</p>
<p>The system specification is as follows:-</p>
<p>CPU Intel E7500 Core2Duo 2.93 GHz</p>
<p>Mobo ASUS P5G41T-M LX</p>
<p>RAM OCZ Gold 4GB (2x2GB) DDR3 PC3-10666C9 1333MHz (of which I am only using one stick as one is faulty according to windows memory diagnostic)</p>
<p>Graphics card EVGA GeForce GT 430 1024MB GDDR3 PCI-Express</p>
<p>TV Card Hauppauge HVR1700 PCI-E</p>
<p>HDD Western Digital 2500YS 250GB SATA</p>
<p>PSU Antec 350Watt ATX</p>
<p>DVD Drive Pioneer OEM Writer</p>
<p>This looks to be a hardware fault, although I could be wrong.</p>
<p>My question is, which piece of hardware is it, could it be a bad motherboard or PSU, or would doing somthing like reflashing the BIOS work, or reformatting windows?</p>
<p>Thankyou for reading my post and any advice you can give!</p>
<p>Tom.</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk, thanks for your response,</p>
<p>Yes I tried the "bad stick" in the motherboard on its own, in the first slot where the "good stick" has been working fine, and as soon as I powered on I started getting things like, a flashing cursor in the top left of the screen and no POST, or freezing
 at any point on the POST or blue screens in windows.</p>
<p>I have posted on another forum and someone has told me my PSU is not up to powering the graphics card as my PSU does not have a 22A 12V Rail, so im going to look into getting somthing more powerfull.</p>
<p>Do you think that could be the problem?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

PSU's can give various problems if they are not up to the task, Your PSU is a little light on pwr</p>

                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'v recently Wiped my hard drives of all data using Dban. I re installed windows but when I download and try to install the driver for my chipset It says " This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify this is
 a valid installer package". I installed the other drivers from the site fine. I looked up threads trying to figure out the problem like going to the cmd and typing REGIT and changing the numbers to 0. I can not figure this out and now I have this most annoying
 black line around my screen. I thought it could be from the video so i proceeded to install that, but to no avail. Next I installed all the windows updates. Nothing. I have even gone as far as installing the motherboard drivers from the disk. Iv paid alot
 to make this gaming desktop but im afraid Im not getting the most out of my system.</div>

<p>Good system information, but its missing two key pieces:&nbsp; the MB revision number (Gigabyte lists 4 different models), and the Bit depth of your OS (I'd presume 64 Bit, but I wouldn't want to recommend something without knowing for sure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question for you:&nbsp; have you run any antivirus / antimalware applications? If not, I'd recommend you do the following:</p>

            I gather you used the drivers off the disk in frustration, but from your post I'm not sure where<br />
you stand just now.&nbsp; Which driver are you still having problems with ?<br />
<br />
What was the purpose for - <i>" going to the cmd and typing REGIT and changing the numbers to 0.</i>" ?<br />
<br />
You do need to download the latest motherboard drivers from Gigabyte for your motherboard
<br />
model and relevant Win7 version.<br />
- Download the graphics drivers from Nvidia -<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a>
<br />
<br />
Note that many people have been having problem with the most recent Nvidia drivers, so<br />
for now try using the 310.90, or 314.22 versions ( I can verify the 310.90 are stable and trouble free).<br />

<i>"now I have this most annoying black line around my screen."</i><br />
Monitor or TV ? In games or&nbsp; with the desktop ?<br />
<br />
<i>"Next I installed all the windows updates."</i><br />
Don't allow Windows update to install the optional updates - graphics drivers, <br />
or&nbsp; KB 2670838 ( required for IE10, but causes various problems with games) .<br />
Also KB 2803821 will cause only half screen in FMV with those few games that use <br />
Windows Media Video codec (vs the far more common&nbsp; .bik or bink video ), but this update<br />
protects against a malware&nbsp; exploit of WMV (something which you would have to download<br />
from specific sites or via email attachments).<br />

 I have gotten that error. Windows for some odd reason would not let me open the msi file to update my chipset drivers. Yes in frustration I used the disk that came with the board. The " annoying black line " is on my desktop. Its like a black border. I have
 a HD running from my comp to my 32in vizio. I would probably think it was the tv but thats the thing. I have used this same exact desktop on this tv with no problems. Same res. everything. No borders. The only variable I can think of is that my chipset drivers
 are not right. But now you say that people are having problems with the latest video drivers maybe ill try that. any knowledge on how to fix the error for the msi file for the chipset drivers would be helpful. Also when I first tried to install the chipset
 it was a clean install. no windows updates, video, nothing<br />

thanks for the help </blockquote>

            <p>Hello Ricky,</p>
<p>The driver site I found had .exe files, not .msi files. So maybe its a different download. Why not check it out, here:
<a href="http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4397#dl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4397#dl</a>&nbsp;. They also say at that site that if you have problems, download the drivers from the "Asia" site, so you might want to
 consider that approach, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back here with your results and let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            ok ill be as specific as possible. When i download the drivers from the gigabyte website, I make sure I have the right rev.(3) and the right operating system(windows x64). after Iv downloaded the drivers I go to the file "Config" and then click the file
 "Chipset". It is a windows installer file. It then gives me the error&nbsp;&nbsp;" This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify this is a valid installer package". Is there anyway to bypass this error so I can install the latest
 chipset drivers? I still have the black border around my screen. The only thing i can think of is that the chipset wasn't installed.

            <p>Hello Ricky,</p>
<p>OK, lets take this from a different approach. The freeware app I use to extract files is called Universal Extractor, download from here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Universal-Extractor/3000-2250_4-75449770.html?tag=mncol;2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Universal-Extractor/3000-2250_4-75449770.html?tag=mncol;2</a>&nbsp; (use the Direct Download Link only). Once installed you bypass Windows and right-click on the .msi file to extract it to a subdirectory, you can then double-click the actual
 installer file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try that and see if it fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

 I'm using a OEM windows I bought from newegg. could that be the problem? Iv used it once already and then wiped my drives and reinstalled it

            No, OEM is not a problem. You can reinstall as many time as you like, but are limited to the one<br />
machine. Your activation key is linked to the motherboard.<br />
<br />
Are the rest of the motherboard drivers installing ? Only the chipset causing problems ?<br />
Is your only problem the black bars ?<br />
- The black border should have to do more with the graphics drivers than chipset.<br />
I don't know how well Windows generic VGA drivers function on TV. There could be a scanning problem.<br />
Have you reinstalled the earlier Nvidia graphics drivers successfully ?<br />
Have you checked the cable to the TV ? HDMI or VGA ?<br />
<br />

                    My PC has become very slow. When i start my all goes well but<br />
when desktop appears i have to wait at least 7-8 minutes before refreshing it the first time.<br />
If i do not wait and refresh just after the start up then it responses very slow after clicking then after<br />
some time the windows explorer stops working and i have to restart my PC.<br />
<br />
I am unaware why this this problem is ocurring. I thought before formatting my PC and curing it<br />
i ask all of you if you have any solution.<br />
<br />
<span>I have tried all possible measures like :- 1. using system configuration to stop unneccessary programs from startup.<br />

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />See if disabling Controlled Folder Access temporarily resolves this problem.
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />in later versions
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Ransomware protection
<br />Toggle off Controlled folder access
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />
<br />Do this from the command line:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />TAKEOWN /F C:\ /R /D Y
<br />
<br />Once you have taken ownership, then you have to set the permissions; for this, you use ICACLS:
<br />
<br />ICACLS "C:\" /reset /T

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps to disable permissions related notifications: 
<br />Turn off User Account Control (UAC) in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Type UAC in the search field on your taskbar. (If the search field isn't visible, right-click the Start button and choose Search.)
<br />Click Change User Account Control settings in the search results.
<br />Then do one of the following:
<br />To turn UAC off, drag the slider down to Never notify and click OK.
<br />To turn UAC on, drag the slider up to the desired level of security and click OK.
<br />You may be prompted to confirm your selection or enter an administrator password.

</blockquote>
<p>From the "TAKEOWN" command, where one of the files something like this?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The files in :&nbsp; C:\Users\Default.migrated\Documents&nbsp; or C:\Users\&lt;Users account&gt;\My Documents or C:\Users\&lt;Users account&gt;\Cookies&nbsp; ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, then the problem is actually obviously due to the fact that those files are no longer on the computer.&nbsp; Those files are now displayed as a shortcut.&nbsp; The reason why they are there, was when your device upgraded to windows 10 from 7 or
 8, the default names for default user document location, was changed.&nbsp; My Documents became Documents, website cookies are located now in a different location, Application Data has been renamed to a shorter name called AppData.&nbsp; The content of those folders
 were copied over to the new named folders during the upgrade.&nbsp; However the old folders stayed in case the user wanted to roll back or if there was a error during the copying process.&nbsp; Thus those folders were like a backup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However though just like "Windows.old", after a certain amount of time, the original document folders from the old OS would be removed from the computer.&nbsp; At some point in time during the installation or removal (I do not remember exactly what was the process
 of the upgrade), there will be a shortcut replacing where the folders were located and the old folders were moved.&nbsp; During the deletion of the old folders, it has been known to occur that the shortcuts were not delted even though the folders were.&nbsp;

    <title>Problem with Windows DVD Player app on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with Windows DVD Player app on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Windows DVD Player </p>
<p>I can not get Windows DVD player to work. I can load file to burn to CD but the player will not start. Occasionally I will get a notice to insert a CD or DVD. Although I had one inserted, I removed and insert again. Again, I get a notice to insert a CD.
 Again the player will not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10, I thought. Control panel/system shows I am running Windows 10.</p>
<p>System/about shows I am running Windows 10. I tried to get the Windows DVD player app, but it shows I am running Windows 7 still. Do I need the app to make the DVD player work? If so, how do I get it.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Tumble,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say Windows DVD Player, are you referring to Windows DVD Player app?</p>
<p>Are you concerned about Player device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows DVD Player app is available free for a limited time for people running Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate,
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> with Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that Windows Media Center isn't included in <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> and will be removed when you upgrade to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>. After the upgrade completes, Windows DVD Player will download automatically to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be eligible for the free DVD Player app, you must upgrade your Windows&nbsp;7, <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> PC rather than perform a clean installation. If you’re running an edition of Windows&nbsp;7 or
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span> that doesn’t include Media Center and you upgrade to <span>
Windows&nbsp;10</span>, go to Windows Store to buy Windows DVD Player or another app that plays DVDs. Provided your PC has an optical disc drive, Windows DVD Player will play DVD movies (but not Blu‑ray Discs).</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If not that case, then you can buy <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows-dvd-player/9nblggh2j19w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows DVD Player app from Microsoft store</a>.</p>

            <p>Yashwanth, I understand your reply. I think the problem lies in my second paragraph. Media Center and DVD player are in my programs list, but will not run. Under control panel it shows that I am running windows 10, but in Microsoft support pages it says
 I am running Windows 7. My backup software says I am still running Windows 7. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes websites up to 30 seconds to open and then will freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a clean boot of my computer and uninstalled and installed my browser (Firefox) and ran all the troubleshooting programs offered by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that I have only gotten partial activation of Windows 10 and need to revert back to Windows 7 and try to install Windows 10 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you upgrade to Windows 10 from previous version of Windows, there is a folder named Windows.old created under C: Drive that remains for 30 days from the time of upgrade to Windows 10. This folder gets deleted automatically post 30 days. Unfortunately,
 you are unable to revert to previous version of Windows post 30 days. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In case, if you still want to install Windows 7 back, it would be a clean installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
This could also be caused by malware.&nbsp; <span>
While in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Safe Mode</span> with networking (click repeatedly on F8 during the boot process) try to run anti-malware programs.&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp; install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). Reboot after completing all the scans.
</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<p>
<span>Hi debra_p,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p>
<span>How long have you been experiencing this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Have you recently installed or uninstalled any software or hardware?
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to boot computer in Safe mode and check if the issue still persist,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent
<span>Windows</span> from starting correctly.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Click the
<span><strong>Start</strong></span> button, click the arrow next to the
<span><strong>Shut Down</strong></span> button, and then click <span>
<strong>Restart</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do one of the following:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the
<span>Windows</span> logo appears. If the <span>
Windows</span> logo appears, you'll need to try again by waiting until the <span>
Windows</span></span><span> logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the <span>
<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong></span> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press Enter.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words
<span><strong>Safe Mode</strong></span> in the corners of your monitor. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let
<span>Windows</span> start normally.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>For further information, visit the below mentioned link:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to find which non Microsoft program is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
Start,</strong> <span>Collapse this imageExpand this im</span>type <strong>
msconfig.exe</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Collapse this imageExpand</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password,
 or click <strong>Continue</strong>. </span></li></ul>
</li><li>
<span>On the <strong>
General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box. (The <strong>Use Original Boot.ini</strong> check box is unavailable.)
</span></li><li>
<span>On the <strong>
Services </strong>tab, click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>
OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steps for Normal startup:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <strong>
Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Run</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>Type <strong>
msconfig</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
The <strong>System Configuration Utility</strong> dialog box is displayed. </span>
</li><li>
<span>Click the <strong>
General</strong> tab, click <strong>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li>
<span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong> to restart the computer.</span> </li></ol>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Critical Error, Blue Screen of Death, and Reboot upon waking from sleep, 0x8000200000000002</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 several weeks ago. Since upgrading I have experienced two persistent problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 10 will wake from sleep after only a few minutes for no reason. It seems like it has something to do with TeamViewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Upon intentionally waking the computer from sleep I will get a BSOD and the computer will reboot.</p>
<p>

            Hello, the problem might be that during the installation, there was an error, or the installation file itself was corrupt. I would suggest you to re-download the setup from the web, and install from there. 
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

            Hi. 
<br />
<br />If you navigate the garbage on this site &gt; <a href="https://www.dll-files.com/msvcr71.dll.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dll-files.com/msvcr71.dll.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the .dll and just drop it into the folder C:WindowsSystem32 (for 32-bit Windows),  and  C:WindowsSysWOW64
<br />
<br />you will need to download version 7.10.7031.4
<br />
<br />Hope this helps

            Hi Sharon.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The best way to fix the error is if you know the program that's trying to run that's generating the error in order to reinstall it at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.
<br />
<br />Then the other fixes that work are here:

<p>Don't know why everyone is hung up on an "installation" thing, I have not installed anything, only tried to use the dvd for the first time and that's when I get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that sounds weird, first time using the dvd, but since I've been a Hulu customer for movies I haven't purchased any new movies. Last night I wanted to watch one of my older movies and used the dvd, but the dvd doesn't work giving me that dll error

            Could be the player itself, since it's usually a problem with an installed program that is being called on.  You can go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps and change the Video Player from Movies and TV app to Windows Media Player, or vice versa.  
<br />
<br />You can also install VLC Media Player to try it to compare:  <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>

<p>3. Yes it actually appears with 3 drive letters.&nbsp; A "G: System" shows up first.&nbsp; When you click on it, it says the file is empty.&nbsp; When you right click on it you can get to the properties box.&nbsp; It shows there is stuff on it but not very much.&nbsp; It shows 99.9
 MB total, it is a 1.5 TB drive.&nbsp; After this, "F: Local Disk" shows up.&nbsp; When I click on it&nbsp;I get a message that reads, "F: is not accessible.&nbsp; The parrameter is incorrect."&nbsp; I click on OK and when I click on this drive again I get a message that says, "You
 need to format the disk in drive F: before you can use it.&nbsp; Do you want to format it?"&nbsp; After this, "H: HP_Recovery" shows up.&nbsp; It has one text file on it.</p>
<p>4. The old computer is a HP Pavillion Slimline S5560F, the new computer is a Cyberpower PC GUA 880.</p>
<p>5. I connected the hard drive by installing it in an external drive case and connecting it through a USB port.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; My old computer would not boot up.&nbsp; I think I heard the hard drive spin, but the HDD light would not come on.&nbsp; I tried putting another hard drive in the computer just to see if the light would come on, and it did not.&nbsp; I also tried to put my recovery
 cd's in and see if it would try to boot form the dvd with no luck.&nbsp; I also tried to remove all power and reconnect it (this worked in the past), nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for the reply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try these steps and check:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run Disk checking on the hard drive in question to check for errors such as lost sectors, bad sectors and corruption.</div>
<div>Follow these steps:<br />
a. Click on Start and then click on All programs.<br />
b. Now click on Accessories.<br />
c. Right click on the Command Prompt and then select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
d. Enter the following command and press enter.<br />
<strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong></div>
<div>Refer:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</font></strong></a></div>
<div><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may take the ownership of the drive and check.<br />
a. Right click on C drive and select “Properties”. Select the Security tab<br />
b. Click on Edit in Properties Click ok to confirm UAC elevation request.<br />
c. Select user/group from permission windows or click add to add another user or group.<br />

            <p>I had to do exactly this for a computer which would not boot or run the recovery partition. Removing the drive from the computer and plugging it in to another produced this message when I tried to access it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to get to read the disk and recover files before making any changes. In the end I found Testdisk from CGSecurity
<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_6.9_Release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. It is free for non commercial use and although command line based and a little cryptic once I had found how to navigate through the menus I could select folders and copy them to another
 drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever the error was it was completely transparent to the program and all files and folders copied without fail.</p>

            <p>This did not work.&nbsp; Method 1 I got a message that read that F cannot be checked because it is in use.&nbsp; Do you want to schedule check next time system starts.&nbsp; I clicked yes and restarted the computer.&nbsp; It checked C first and then F.&nbsp; My computer shut down
 after that so I don't know if it finished or not, but I still cannot access the drive.&nbsp; Same error messages.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try&nbsp;to connect the hard drive on the old computer, perform a startup repair, also try to boot to safe mode, perform system restore. and check if&nbsp;you are&nbsp;able to boot. If you are able to boot then&nbsp;you may create a network and transfer your
 files on the new comuter.&nbsp;You can create an adhoc network.<br />
<br />
In the second computer assign a new drive letter and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
Your drive might just need to be assigning a letter in the disk management if that is the case please follows the steps.<br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Log on as Administrator or as a member of the Administrators group.</li><li>Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>Control Panel</b>, and then click<b>Performance and Maintenance</b>.
<br />
<b>Note</b> If you do not see <b>Performance and Maintenance</b>, go to step 3.<b>Performance and Maintenance</b> appears in
<b>Control Panel</b> only if you use Category view. If you use Classic view,<b>Performance and Maintenance</b> does not appear.
</li><li>Click <b>Administrative Tools</b>, double-click <b>Computer Management</b>, and then click
<b>Disk Management</b> in the left pane.</li><li>Right-click the drive, the partition, the logical drive, or the volume that you want to assign a drive letter to, and then click<b>Change Drive Letter and Paths</b>.
</li><li>Click <b>Add</b>. </li><li>Click <b>Assign the following drive letter</b> if it is not already selected, and then either accept the default drive letter or click the drive letter that you want to use.</li><li>Click <b>OK</b>. </li></ol>
</li></ul>
The drive letter is assigned to the drive, to the partition, or to the volume that you specified, and then that drive letter appears in the appropriate drive, partition, or volume in the Disk Management tool<br />
<br />
If it does not work then&nbsp;you may have to contact the hardware manufacture.

<h3> madisonwright  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get my computer to recognize my Apple iPhone 3GS as a digital still camera when plugged in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop from Dell&nbsp;last week and it has a current version of Windows 7 Proffesional. When I plug my iPhone into it, iTunes recognizes the phone and I can get a personal hotspot going but I cannot connect it to the Camera wizard at all. My partner
 has also tried connecting his phone to the computer (He has the same model phone as myself) but the computer will not recognize it at all. Neither of our phones have problems with other computers but since both of our other computers have gone to heaven this
 is the only one we have available to us. If anyone has any information on how to fix either of these problems, it would be muchly appreciated!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            TES4&#58; Oblivion Xbox 360 startup screen freezes</h2>
                    <p>At random, when I click on Oblivion to start up it'll get to the startup screen used by Xbox 360 (normal for backwards compatible obviously), but then it sometimes freezes at the end of the startup scene. And nothing happens. All I can do is quit the game and re-open it. So far it hasn't caused other issues [except wasting my time] but it's annoying. Is there any way to fix this? Has anyone else experienced this with this game or other games?</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear that you're unable to connect to a buddy in Minecraft. Its possible that you're unable to connect with your other friend due to a NAT type issue on their end, since you've successfully
 been able to connect with others on your end. However, you did say that there are already 4 others in there with you and with Minecraft: Windows 10 edition, you'd be limited to playing with 4 others online (or locally) unless you are subscribers of Minecraft
 Realms (this allows up to 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a bit more info regarding that, I recommend the following articles:</p>

<h2>            My Start Menu tiles have disappeared...but still work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 8 with the funky Start Menu meant to help people with touchscreens but frustrate those of us still using a mouse. Anyway, I don't know what happened but the tiles, apps, whatever from that screen have completely disappeared. Here's the kicker
 though-they still work. I can't see them, but if I click randomly on the screen a program launches. How do I make them reappear???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help!</p>

            J W Stuart is right: you want to do a REFRESH.&nbsp; Press Shift while you click the Restart button and yo will get to the window you need to get to.&nbsp; You could also go into Change PC Settings and go to the General tab and click the Restart Now button under
 Advanced Startup.&nbsp; Each PC manufacturer has a shortcut that you can use while booting.&nbsp; HP's is f11, Dell's is f8, I do not know any others yet.&nbsp; The easiest method is to just hold the Shift key while you click the Restart button.&nbsp; There is no need to hold
 it once the button is pressed.

<h2>            Mouse randomly starts clicking</h2>
                    Recently my mouse has started acting like I am holding&nbsp; the left click button down and rapid fire clicking.&nbsp; I opened Chrome just now and the mouse stayed on the quick start icon at the bottom of the screen, next thing I know, with my hand off the mouse,
 I had over 20 windows open.<br />
I have deleted and re-installed the drivers, checked to make sure they are up to date, it happens on either my Logitec&nbsp;wireless or my corded gaming mouse.&nbsp; Happens randomly.

<p>I haven't made any changes intentionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Initially I was using a wired gaming mouse (grim gaming mouse bought at wal mart), I've had it for about a year with no problems until a few days ago, when the problem started.&nbsp; I unplugged it and swapped it out with a Logitec wireless mouse.&nbsp; Whenever the
 problem starts I swap back and forth between them and it seems to affect both the same way at the same time, but not all the time.<br />
Yes, tried them both on my Macbook and no problems<br />
</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Lock Screen Bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawn peters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Lock Screen Bugs</h2>
                    <p>After my computer goes to sleep and I move the mouse or whatever to get the screen back on, the Lock Screen picture is missing. Instead, it's just a solid blue color. The picture will show up fine if I restart, or if I log in, and then switch user back to
 Lock Screen. This is very annoying. Anyone know how to fix it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on another note, when I first got my computer the picture on my Surface Book would change periodically. Now it's stuck at this red chair picture, and if I go into my settings, that's the only picture that is shown under Lock Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: This is on build 14393.5.</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the lock screen picture is missing, the issue could be due to some file corruptions. In order to fix the corruptions I would request you to perform SFC scan and then check if it helps.
</p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps to perform an SFC scan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X key</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select <strong>command prompt(admin).</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Type the below command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if the lock screen picture is still missing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>
        </p>

            I've done the scannow, and there are no issues detected. Also, it isn't missing all the time. Just occasionally after resuming from sleep. Once I log in and switch back to Lock Screen, it reappears just fine. Same with restarting.<br />

            <p>Hi Shawn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to perform DISM command and then check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management </strong>(DISM) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a
<strong>Windows PE image.</strong> The DISM tool replaces the <strong>Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe), PEimg, and Intlcfg tools.
</strong>DISM consolidates the functionality found in those three tools, as well as delivers new functionality to improve the experience of offline servicing.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the given steps to run a DISM scan:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Press <strong>Windows + x </strong>on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Select <strong>Command prompt (Admin) </strong>to open <strong>
Administrator Command prompt.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>3) In the Administrator: <strong>Command Prompt window</strong>, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </span></strong></p>

            This did not help at all. Other people seem to be having the same problem according to Feedback Hub and reddit.com/r/surface and reddit.com/r/windows10, FYI.

    <title>Windows 10 Dual Monitors Resolution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willzyy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Dual Monitors Resolution</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I literally just upgraded to Windows 10 and am having a little trouble with my monitors. It's not greatly significant, but it is irritating me a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, my second monitor is quite old and doesn't have a wide resolution, it is 1024 x 768 I think. In my resolution settings, the scale doesn't go below 1280 x 720 for some reason so the picture on that screen is quite blurry and cut off around the
 edges. Already played around with the settings in the resolution settings area and I can't get it to work :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>
