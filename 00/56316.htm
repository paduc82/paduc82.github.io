            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<h2>            Restoring to factory settings</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there anyway of restoring my computers system, which runes off Window Vista, to the factory settings (the way it was when i first turned my computer on when i bought it)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if there is would this solve problems like missing system files and removing a few viruses?</p>

<p>Restoring it to Factory settings would remove everything and you will start again with a clean machine.</p>
<p>Try to remove Malware, or reinstall; the choice is yours:</p>
<p>Scan with these Programs;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If necessary</span></span><span>, do all the work in<strong>Safe Mode with Networking.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get into<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>, tap F8 right at Power On / Startup, and use UP arrow key to get to<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> from list of options,
 then hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Read all info below before starting</span></span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If neccesary, also scan with this Program</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.spybot.info/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.spybot.info/en/index.html</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 1.6.2 is a very good, FREE Anti-Spyware Program.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install and update it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Once installed &gt; Right-click on its Desktop Icon &gt; Run as Admin</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Then SCAN with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Update it, and scan your System once a fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important re: Safe Mode</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you happen to find a problem that you can’t uninstall / delete, reboot the computer, and go into Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>To get into Safe Mode, tap F8 right at Power On / Startup, and use UP arrow key to get to Safe Mode from list of options, then hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>RESCAN your computer with your Anti-Virus, Malwarebytes and Spybot S &amp; D while in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If unable to install above Programs in Normal Mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes Trojans, Viruses, Malware, etc stop you installing and/or updating Programs to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span>If that happens, reboot into Safe Mode with Networking (from F8 list of Startup Options), and install, update and scan from there</span><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your Computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

<h2>            BSOD Acer Aspire 5733-6621 ntkrnlmp.exe</h2>
                    <div>Have windows 10 running on an Acer Aspire 5733-6621.&nbsp; It has been running fine for over a year but is now rebooting every 15min or so with a BSOD.</div>
<div>I have the crash dump and have looked at it.&nbsp; It shows that ntkrnlmp.exe is most likely the problem but can't nail it down.&nbsp; The issue happens on multiple accounts on the same notebook. BSOD says "<span>Unable to write readonly memory"</span></div>
<div><br />
I have:</div>
<div><br />
1. Booted to CD with Memtst86 to verify physical RAM is not the issue.&nbsp; It passed</div>
<div>2. Removed the most recent software</div>
<div>3. sfc /scannow comes up clean</div>
<div>4. No drivers have exclamation point in the device manager</div>
<div>5. Analyzed the crash dump and as stated it really can't get more info than ntkrnlmp.exe</div>
<div>6. I ran driverview and captured the txt file.&nbsp; (minor edit to this one. " MagicISO SCSI Host Controller" has been removed with no difference)</div>
<div>7. I scanned disk for errors (it was clean)</div>
<div>8. I ran malwarebytes latest scan, it was clean</div>
<div>9. I got all of the latest Micorsoft updates, this was painful but done.&nbsp; No difference.</div>
<div>10. I tried to get the latest Intel drivers from intel but they would not run successfully, they may have been modified by acer (I have the latest from acer)</div>
<div>11. I verified I have the latest everything from acer, BIOS, drivers etc,.. the latest is quite old ~2012</div>
<div>12. I have removed (disabled) most of the services that are not from Microsoft</div>
<div>13. I backed up the data</div>
<div>14. I turned off the wifi and used LAN connection</div>
<div><br />
I have a few more things to try but ... come on.. ONE of those usually fixes it... any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
I have not yet, gone to safe mode and tested there.</div>

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted driver is one of the possible reasons why you can't un-mute your laptop after the recent update. Having said that, we suggest installing and updating the hardware drivers in Windows 10. You can follow the instructions posted by Andre Da Costa
 in this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">article</a></strong>.

<h2>            Outlook Express 6 sends but leaves message in outbox with errors but no error message</h2>
                    
<p>OK, I've been getting some funny things happening lately with Outlook Express 6. When I send an email, it sends OK but stays in my outbox and flags up an error which reads "<span><span><span>Some
 errors occurred while processing the requested tasks. Please review the list of errors below for more details.</span></span></span>" When I click on the errors tab it is absolutely empty, no error codes, nothing!</p>
<p>It is really difficult because for ages, I didn't realise that the messages were sending, so kept bombarding people with the same message. It was only when I began cc'ing myself on the messages that I realised they were getting through, even though it was
 giving an error message and the message was still in my outbox.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas as to how I can resolve this, I'd be very grateful, as the support site only deals with errors where there is an error code.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Something keeps corrupting your Outbox, and or, Sent Items.</p>
<p>Move most of your messages out of the Inbox and then create new Outbox and Sent Items folders after you move any messages you wish to save to a local folder you create.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the DBX files for the Outbox &amp; Sent Items and delete them.&nbsp; New ones will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p><strong>General precautions for Outlook Express:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. </strong>&nbsp;Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about
 a 300MB max for less chance of corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program.</span></strong> &nbsp;It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs,
 account setting changes and has even been responsible for loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />

<p>Many thanks for your comprehensive answer, you have given me plenty to be getting on with!</p>
<p>Scanning through your post, the one thing that jumps out at me is your comment about the size of my inbox. I have been a *bit* lax on filing messages in folders, with the result that I have over 10,000 emails in my inbox...suspect that may be upsetting the
 system! Guess I will have to spend a few days deleting and filing the mails in my inbox...</p>

<p>If you feel the need to keep so many messages, there are a couple of options for storing them.</p>
<p>You could create yet another identity for the sole purpose of archiving. Create a number of folders, chronologically perhaps, and store messages in them. Since it is for archiving only and not active use, you still want to back it up but corruption will
 be less likely with messages in user created folders and not being accessed constantly.</p>
<p>Another option is storing the messages out of OE altogether. You can store them any place you want, but I'll use the Desktop as an example.</p>
<p>Right click on the Desktop | New | Folder. Create as many as needed, and for now, put them on the left side of the Desktop.</p>
<p>Open OE and drag the window to the right enough to see the folder you created on the Desktop. Open the folder in OE and click on one message. Ctrl+A will highlight them all. Left click on the messages and drag them to the folder on the Desktop.</p>
<p>You can also be selective by holding the Ctrl key and just highlight certain messages and then drag them to the folder on the Desktop.</p>
<p>Once you confirm they are in these folders, you can delete them from OE if you wish, and follow up with a Compact All Folders.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>You may find that messages with the same subject get appended, probably with (1), (2), etc. One of these programs may be of use to you. Have a look and decide.</p>

            I also had this problem with Outlook Express showing error on sending mail.<br />
Unfortunately, the answers posted so far skirt around the actual cause of the problem.<br />
The problem (error) is due to overloaded "Sent" folder and there is no room left to add more.<br />
I made a new folder "Old Sent mail" and moved everything sent into this folder.<br />
Now empty, the "mail sent" folder works fine... no more errors.<br />

<p><strong>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. </strong>&nbsp;Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about
 a 300MB max for less chance of corruption.</p>

            <p>Hi JimBoult,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try mapping hard disk attached to a wireless router?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How many computers are there on the network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Let's run the network troubleshooter and see if it can detect and fix the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Do the following and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>network and sharing center</b> in the Start search box and hit <b>
Enter</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Change adapter settings</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right-click</b> the connection and select
<b>Enable</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> Let’s
<b>temporarily</b> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">disable antivirus software</a> and
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">firewall</a> on the computer as a test and check if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If disabling the antivirus/firewall fixes the issue, you may have to configure the settings of the antivirus/firewall accordingly. Please contact the software vendor for further
 assistance in this regard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure you enable antivirus software and firewall after the test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Warning</b></p>
<p>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 setup installation files downloaded by get-windows10-app</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i registered for the Windows 10 upgrade and de-registered because i became aware that a download for the creation of an install media is also available (i have three pc's to upgrade so i wanted to save download amount). Now i see that there's already a mysterious
 "$Windows.~BT" Folder on System drive c: with approx. 2,7&nbsp;GB space&nbsp;. </p>
<p>When i start Setup.exe it's telling me that "boot.wim" file is missing.</p>
<p>Is this because i'm in the queue by the Get-Windows10-App and have to wait until it's my turn?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i use the files in this folder to create a installation media (DVD)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Michael</p>

                    I used to be able to press the Xbox button to go back the to home screen at any time, and now I can't! What the hell! Do you have any idea how useful that feature was? Now the Xbox button literally does nothing, you can't double tap it to bring up the
 split menu, take screen shots, record that, nothing. Why break something that was working just fine? I want my old interface back NOW.

<p>Please try and press the Power button on the console for at least 10 seconds until you hear the console powering down, after that wait until the light on the power supply turns and remains orange. When that happens wait at least 30 seconds and then power the console on again.</p>
<p>After that the Home button on the controller should respond again and allow you to return to the Home section, the double tap should also show the options to take a screenshot and record, but options are shown at the top of the screen when double tap is done when a game is running.</p>

<p>The best way is to use the built in "Snipping Tool" to capture the portion of the screen you want, save that as a file, and then print the file using whatever image viewer you like best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start, type Snipping Tool into the Search box, and press Enter.</p>

    <title>BSOD - Kernel Data Inpage Error and More&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psvyxloneaeon  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD - Kernel Data Inpage Error and More&#33;</h2>
                    I recently began experiencing BSODs, and most of the time, each one would identify something else as a problem (From what I remember, "Memory Management" was one, but "Kernel Data Inpage Error" was at the time the most common one, but as of now it is the
 ONLY one that appears). The BSOD's would even result in an issue where upon starting the computer again, it would not recognize my hard drive, whereby I would have to restart the computer again for it to recognize the hard drive. I decided that my old hard
 drive must be getting old, so I decided to swap it out for a new one.<br />
<br />
This hard drive is brand new. I bought it about 8 months ago as a backup. It was still in the package, so I doubt it had anything to do with sitting around for that long. Anyway, I still get BSOD's every hour or so. Every morning when I wake up, it's stuck
 on a BSOD, attemting to initialize a crash dump, but never making one. There are no dumps to upload, because it's not making them. It just stays frozen on the BSOD screen.<br />
<br />
Here are the things I've already done to isolate the problem. I've run Chkdsk, Memtest, Malwarebytes, Avast, and I've monitored temps in Speedfan. I also tried to update windows (which did nothing) and update the drivers for NVIDIA (aso did nothing). None of
 these have yielded any sort of indication as to why this would be happening. All of these tests passed without a problem, scanned without any results, so I'm at a loss here.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reproducing the problem is difficult, as it varies greatly. I was able to write an entire paper over the course of nearly five hours without a BSOD, yet shortly after I stopped, it ended up crashing. Something tells me that it has something to do with my computer/hard
 disk entering an idle state.<br />
I did notice that when I took one of my RAM sticks out to test if it was one of my slots (I only have 1GB total. If you have to know, I'm still saving money to buy more. I used to have 6G but those burned out), the BSOD's seemed to subside. They still happened,
 but not as often.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone have any idea as to what is happening? I am in desperate need of this computer, as it is a source of income for me, and I can't afford to have it in disrepair for as long as I've had it. If it suddenly decides to start making crash dumps, I'll
 post them but I really don't have much to offer besides that. WhoCrashed tells me that crash dumps are enabled, but there are no valid dumps to analyze. So that sucks.<br />
<br />
*Note* I'm currently posting this in Safe Mode, which is operating smoothly without problems or BSOD's, and the computer is running smoothly.<br />

            As I stated earlier, there are no crash dumps to provide. I have enabled all of the folder and file viewing options as you have suggested, made sure dumps are enabled, and there are still no items in the folder. One of the problems with the BSOD I've been
 having is that when it crashes, it freezes on "Initializing crash dump". It never actually makes the dump. I've left the BSOD running overnight and even longer to see if it makes a dump, but it does not.<br />
<br />
As per your requests for the Driver View File and the System Information File, here are the links:<br />

<br />
Also, for the first time I think I've ever seen, the computer BSOD'ed in safe mode as I was writing this.

            I'm in the process of doing these now, and will post a thorough rundown of what occurs, but I do feel compelled to ask if it's really possible that the problem resides with program integrity, considering that these problems are occurring/have occured on
 two separate hard drives that had different software.
<div><br />
<div>To answer your question, I bought it with 6GB RAM, I maxed out at 8 at one point. I don't know that Windows Update is malfunctioning as much as it's just not rectifying the problem. It might be because the update is rarely successful because it's always
 interrupted with a BSOD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, are you saying that you want me to upload a more recent version of the System Information file after I run all of these cleanup tools?</div>

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer - Details &#38; Huge Icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irish texan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer - Details &#38; Huge Icon</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 File Explorer - when using the details option - uses 1/3 of the screen to display a useless icon.&nbsp; The icon says something like "26 Files".&nbsp; I have to change the detail mode to thumbnail mode to look at some long named file extensions.&nbsp; The screen
 does not allow the ability to increase the size of the right-most field to eliminate the icon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can the icon to the right of the screen in Windows 10 File Explorer in detail option be eliminated?&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the direction and info on the SNIP tool.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You asked for 2 things and I'll provide you 4.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Your first request was my resolution setting.&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>My second image is my scaling setting.&nbsp; Default is 250.&nbsp; I use 300.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/452bd83b-261b-40bf-b931-9415416fdedf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You asked for a screen shot of my issue.&nbsp; I'll provide 2.&nbsp; The first shows the space being taken up by the icon is huge.&nbsp; I would prefer to have this space variable so I can squeeze it to the right to make room for my detail view of files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76ac7153-1316-46d8-8e1b-f2eea229092c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In those cases where detailed information (basically the files PROPERTIES) is shown to the right, I would still like to be able to squeeze it to the right at my discretion and return it to its former size AS AND WHEN NEEDED.&nbsp; Or I can look at the PROPERTIES
 option for those files I need such detail.&nbsp; </p>

<h3> prettyyounglooking  say:</h3>
<h2>            jewel quest 3</h2>
                    Recently my Jewel Quest 3 download stopped working.&nbsp; I have update my java, flash player, and active x but it will not work.&nbsp; I have even unistalled the game and reinstalled it but still no luck.&nbsp; I am now getting an error that windows has detected a problem
 and needs to close the program but there has been no solution yet.&nbsp; I did the compatability test and it just says to test in windows 8 mode, does that mean I need to use windows 8 instead of 10? Any help??

<p>Thank you for keeping us updated. To further troubleshoot your concern, here are the solutions that your can perform on your computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong><span>Solution 1</span></strong><span>. Perform a clean boot&nbsp;to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.

You can go to this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">link&nbsp;</span></a><span>and
 follow the steps perform a clean boot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Solution 2.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Reset the game from the Settings menu. This process can help restore corrupted game installation
 files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

You may be able to perform a Startup Repair.</span></p>
<p><span>Startup Repair is a Windows Vista recovery tool that can fix certain problems, such as missing or damaged system files,
 that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. When you run Startup Repair, it scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>Startup Repair is located on the System Recovery Options menu, which is on the Windows Vista installation disc. If your
 computer manufacturer has preinstalled recovery options, Startup Repair might also be installed on your hard disk. If your computer does not include Startup Repair, your computer manufacturer might have customized or replaced the tool. Check the information
 that came with your computer or go to the manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Please see the following site for detailed information on using Startup Repair:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-us/Help/5c59f8c1-b0d1-4f1a-af55-74f3922f3f351033.mspx#EX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-us/Help/5c59f8c1-b0d1-4f1a-af55-74f3922f3f351033.mspx#EX</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert the installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer.
 You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary,
 it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
If Startup Repair is a preinstalled recovery option on your computer:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Start button , click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Do one of the following:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows
 logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold
 F8.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press ENTER. (If Repair your
 computer is not listed as an option, then your computer does not include Startup Repair as a preinstalled recovery option.)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Select a user name and enter the password, and then click OK.</span></p>

<br />
</span><span>From your issue description, I understand that
<b>“You are not able to find and install drivers for hp designjet 250c ".
</b>Please let me know if you are not facing this issue.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Since Windows 8 is a new release there may not be drivers designed for Windows. You can download the drivers designed for Windows Vista and install it on the Windows
 8 using the compatibility mode. Follow the steps. Some drivers are very specific about the operating system version, so you might have to wait until the manufacturer releases Windows 8 drivers.<br />

<br />
If HP does not support the device under a given OS (or later than a given OS) then you may be 'out of luck' when it comes to full featured drivers/interactions with said device.&nbsp; It is (always has been) up to the manufacturer to provide the drivers and other
 software&nbsp;- even any that come 'pre-installed' with an operating system.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
A quick glance at the web page (HP's) and it looks like the last *listed* OS for that printer in the Windows line was Windows Vista.&nbsp; Going further down that path shows that the 250c was not even actually supported by HP under Vista - looks like Windows XP
 was the last supported OS in the Windows line.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Where's that leave you?&nbsp; Truthfully - given that the last drivers were released in March of 2004 - likely out-of-luck with that device under anything newer than Windows XP.&nbsp; Even shared devices have to provide drivers for the OS the printout is actually being
 sent from and in this case - those drivers seemingly do not exist beyond XP.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Likely not what you wanted to hear - but HP abandoned that plotter a while back, I'd say.

            Earlier special phones used to come for Skype but with advent of mobile phones, the business case for these phones became weak with almost no buyers. On Amazon you can by used phones for this. ( <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-SPH200W-WiFi-Phone-Skype/dp/B001492T5U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-SPH200W-WiFi-Pho...</a> )
<br />
<br />You better buy a cheap Android mobile phone, install Skype on that and use that to communicate (if you don't want to use your existing mobile phone)

<p>I do not recommend wasting time or money on older, discontinued devices. Be aware that no dedicated standalone Skype phone devices are currently compatible with the Skype network. Older client-tethered devices that exist, if functional, may operate in a
 very deprecated capacity and only function with Classic Skype (7.x). Any current device that meets the current system requirements for Apple, Amazon, Android, and Windows OSes, etc., are potential phone replacements.</p>

<h2>            Edimax ew-7811un Wireless adapter not working on windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I am having a problem using a new Edimax ew-7811Un USB wireless adapter I brought today for my Win 7 64 bit desktop. The adapter will not pick up and display any wireless networks of any kind and I am out of ideas of how to resolve this issue,
 I also tried the adapter with default setup on my Win 7 64 bit laptop and it picked up my house network straight away in the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my desktop however the adapter will not pick up my house network or any others I've tried. I have also tried the alternate method of installing the provided drivers manually instead of using the installation and still same problem. I have also used the
 drivers provided by Realtek I found in reply to another post here&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/w8-problem-with-edimax-ew-7811un-nano-adapter/f0f59c0b-5376-4ac8-91d4-2c15e9ec8bb4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/w8-problem-with-edimax-ew-7811un-nano-adapter/f0f59c0b-5376-4ac8-91d4-2c15e9ec8bb4</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Accessing the driver properties of '150Mbps Wireless 802 11b/g/n Nano USB Adaptor' windows states that the device is working properly, If I go to diagnose the connection however it states there might be a problem with the driver, when I look at the detailed
 information it says Windows couldn't automatically bind the IP protocol stack to the network adapter. (No idea what that means tbh XD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be extremely grateful for some help with this as I have spent ages look for a solution and tried all the other things I know of that could be making it not work (Turned off firewalls, moved the computer around :S) I don't understand why it isn't
 working when it's fine on the same OS on my laptop unless I'm missing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
