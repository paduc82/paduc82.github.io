<h2>            Burning a data disk multiple times</h2>
                    <p>I need to make more than one copy of a data disk I created from files on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There used to be an option called "burn to disk" and in that process, a box would come up asking if I wanted to make more than one copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does not have a "burn to disk" option...the only way I can find to burn the files onto the cd is to "eject" and it automatically burns the disk, but does not give me the option of making multiple copies. So, each time, I have to go find the files
 and put them back on the next disk. It is taking forever (I want to make 100 copies).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year I could do this easily. Now it's suddenly impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what happened to the "burn to disk" function?</p>

            <p>The action 'Burn to disk' has been abandoned, you will need to use a third party app to carry out the actions as you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not make copy of all the folders/files you wish to burn in a separate folder some where on your HDD and then use the 'Send to' option, it still does not solve your capability to burn multiple disks.</p>

<h2>            repair or reload XP Pro</h2>
                    if you need to repair or reload microsoft XP Pro, do you have to use the original XP Pro disk, or can you use any XP Pro disk as long as you have the serial number of the original disk?

    <title>Windows 10 Critical Error Issues - Critical Error&#58; Start menu and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Critical Error Issues - Critical Error&#58; Start menu and Cortana aren&#39;t working.</h2>
                    <p>I shutdown my computer (a HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC) that until last Tuesday was running Windows 7 Home Premium and that evening I upgraded to Windows 10 Home. For almost a week now, Windows 10 Home was working great until after this recent restart
 after shutting down the computer about 2 hours ago. On starting Windows 10 Home and getting to my desktop I am met with this error:</p>
<p>"Critical Error: Start menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've resigned in three times using the "Sign out now" button to no prevail. I've tried all fixes suggested online for this other than creating a new "Administrator" account because I don't want to do that when everything I actually need access to is on this
 account. Microsoft really needs to fix this issue and NOW; after all it appears that some Windows 10 users have been plagued with this problem/issue since day one of Windows 10's release. This is a bad start for Microsoft and Windows with all the hype and
 advertising they've put into Windows 10 to get people to quickly upgrade to their new "so called pristine and best Windows yet". In no way is this the best Windows yet if you can't turn on your computer and do any thing that you wanted to do!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft really needs to get on their game and fix this issue since its plaguing many users of Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This by far isn't my only started thread on Windows 10 and problems with it and none of those problems and inquiries have all gone unanswered and unreplied to by Microsoft and/or anyone here that can offer any helpful information whatsoever. But for this
 reported error, it's the first time getting this error (and it better be the last time as well for surely if it doesn't go away and isn't fixed by Microsoft/Windows soon I totally will not be recommending Windows 10 to anyone and I'll warn anyone who's already
 upgraded and suggest they go back to their old OS before they're stuck with this issue and can't even do that!</p>

            <p>Hi Just wondering that many of the solutions are for the pre release versions of Win 10 where bugs are at least tolerated. Many of the recent issues regarding the star menu critical error problem are for the actual version release to the public of which
 I was one. If this error was pick up before the public release then why was it not fixed. I have now had to go back to Win 8.1 until MS fixes the problem</p>
<p>Is it also possible for MS to let people know that this bug has been fixed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>It should of been fixed but they didn't. It isn't right they released it knowing the error existed, its pretty disappointing but there are some easy fixes instead of all the harder ones being offered. I followed one and haven't had the error return since
 then.</p>

</p><p>Rebooting my computer into Safe Mode worked.<br />
<br />
Since I couldn't open Task Manager with the Task Bar inaccessible thanks to the Start Menu not working I had to use "CTRL" "ALT" "DEL" to get there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just follow these steps:</p>
<p>
1. Open Task Manager With "CTRL" "ALT" "DEL"
</p><p>2. Click File &amp; New Task</p>
<p>3. Type: msconfig and run as administrator</p>
<p>4. go to the boot tab and boot the computer in Safe Mode (I did safe mode with networking)</p>
<p>5. "CTRL" "ALT" "DEL" again and use the Power Icon by clicking on it and "Restart"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you want to leave Safe Mode, Windows 10 will reboot into Safe Mode again if you just restart or shutdown. So instead go back to Task Manager (this time you can right click the task bar and its an option there). Just repeat the steps to get to msconfig
 and the boot tab just uncheck Safe Mode and restart.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You might want to try it again and run a Full System Scan using Norton Internet Security, Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 2.5 using its Full System Scan and Rootkit Scans as well as doing a Disk Cleanup. I did all that and it totally worked. Any smart person that
 owns a computer knows that they should run those scans and do all that in Safe Mode to troubleshoot any errors and find any underlying problems that booting in "Normal Mode" can't find.<br />
<br />
This happens to be one of the only true solutions that has worked for many people with the error because none others weren't so good at all and actually harder for those that don't fully know their way around a computer.</p>

<p>Hi youssefezzo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update usually crashes due to software conflicts, driver incompatibilities, or could be that your computer is not connecting to the Microsoft update servers. To sort out what really is causing this problem and how it can be addressed, I recommend
 running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong>. Just click the link and make sure to download the appropriate troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, did you get any error codes when the error messages came up? Please share it on this thread if you have so I can look into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on how to address issues with Windows Update, check out the link,

<p>Thanks for getting back. The error<em> IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</em> that you encountered while upgrading to the latest version of Windows could be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the
 new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help isolate this problem, please use <em>the Driver Verifier tool </em>found in the
<strong>Resolution </strong>part on this <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0xa--irql-not-less-or-equal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Follow also the other options to address
 this problem if the error is caused by a faulty hardware, faulty system service, or by an antivirus software. Look for

<p>Hello, I had the exact same problem as you. I found this on another thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote:</p>
<p>"</p>
<div>I was having a similar problem, and after multiple attempts (over 7 times) trying different solutions like disabling virus protection, disabling startup programs, running update database corruption repair, etc. My computer never got past 81% before freezing
 and not updating.</div>
<div>I stumbled across a forum talking about problems with&nbsp; Anatel&nbsp; PCI-E Wlan cards (wi-fi) and old drivers that would hang up their computers and after removing the card (not just disabling) their machines would update and run fine. Since I was running my
 machine through an Ethernet connection, connected to an access point, I could remove the Anatel card in my computer and still have an internet connection. I tried it, and my computer a Gateway FX6860 updated to Windows 10 Fall Creators version without any
 problems. </div>
<div>
<p>Check to see if you have an Anatel wifi card and remove it and replace it with something newer or an Ethernet or usb connection to the internet and try the update. this worked for me."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took out the Anatel Wi-Fi card and the updates worked on the very first try.!!!!!!! If you are getting you update though Wi-Fi you will need a newer card.</p>

<h2>            Strange white bar when right clicking</h2>
                    <p>A new 'feature' has arrived today on my PC (I installed Window 10 a few days ago but this has only happened today).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I right click an item I don't get the usual options, instead I get a long white vertical bar with occasional arrows which offer in some cases totally different feature options. I have made some screen shots but this page does not seem to allow fro
 these to be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can throw light on what is going on I would be grateful.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do I prevent an app from entering &#34;suspended&#34; status&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Until recently I was able to run the "Client for YouTube" app in the background.&nbsp; Recently, it has started entering a "Suspended" status every time I alt-tab away.&nbsp; I have found that, by either restarting the computer or ending the app process in the Task
 Manager and restarting it, I can get the first video I choose to play in the background.&nbsp; However when I play a second video, the app will again go to "suspended" when I alt-tab or swipe away. Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting the Surface Community regarding videos on the Client for YouTube app stopping playing in the background when you switch screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are in the app, swipe in from the right to left to open Charms, tap Settings, and tap Permissions. Ensure that Sync (Allow this app to sync in the background) toggle is turned on.<br />
</p>
<p>If it is not effective, I would suggest trying uninstalling and re-installing the app. When you first finish installing and launch the app, it should ask you whether to allow "Client for YouTube run in the background" or not. If you choose yes, you should
 be able to run videos in the background. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If neither of the steps above helps, please contact the app developer to see if they are able to provide you with steps on how to prevent videos from pausing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>USB Microphone for Surface RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonedogx  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Microphone for Surface RT</h2>
                    


Has anyone found a decent USB microphone to use with the Surface RT? 


I tried the Cyber Acoustics CVL-1064 Desktop Microphone with the 3.5 jack since the MS compatibility site says it will work and guess what, nope it does not. 



Have had my surface for almost a year now and some days I love and others I **** hate it. 


Guess what today is. 



Any help would be appreciated. 



Thanks

            I too am looking for a USB microphone for a Surface 2 -- just got off the line with support and they made it clear that the 3.5mm jack is for headphones ONLY so the USB port was the only option for an external mic, however, they could not confirm one that
 works.

            Because the GeForce experience is a application made by nvidia that will allow uses to install their driver and update the driver , control panel should come with it as well. Have you already try installing ?

<p>The mind boggles. I've seen a couple of posts on this topic but don't recall the others mentioning DCH, and wasn't aware of DCH.</p>
<p>Looking that up, I wonder why the DCH driver would not have Nvidia Control Panel ?</p>
<p>Is this because, what is supposed to be the superior - <em>'Universal Windows Driver'</em>, - won't allow it ?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it still allow you to install the <em>'Experience</em>', (as suggested by Lee Qicheng) or are you left with no control over you game
</p>
<p>settings from Nvidia&nbsp; at all ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does you machines having&nbsp; this 'special feature' mean your hardware cannot run the 'standard' WHQL Nvidia driver,</p>
<p>and your laptop mfg only offers the DCH driver ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download GeForce Experience | NVIDIA | GeForce</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that MS have been pushing their Store hard, but don't understand why Nvidia would not also have a dedicated</p>
<p>Nvidia Control Panel download option on their site when they have one for the GeForce Experience....
</p>
<p>Oh! That's right. They were going to give the Control Panel the 'A' way back in the early days of developing the 'Experience'.</p>
<p>It looks like the time has come. Control Panel is being given death by a thousand cuts.</p>

<h2>            Music Stutters and Grinds, especially when loading pages on Google Chrome and listening to Spotify</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a really infuriating problem. I think it started since I installed Windows 8.1 Update 1, but in chrome whenever I type (like now) or load a web page, the music coming through the speakers stutters, pops or grinds (The noise that it makes when Windows'
 does a BSOD). I cannot work out why this happens. I have tried restarting the computer and chrome. I usually listen to Spotify. I have tested with internet explorer, and it does not seem to happen in a quick test that I have just done. Is there anything that
 I can do to fix this? I do not want to do a system restore (I am quite windows-savvy), as I do not want the hassle of reinstalling my programs, and having to update again. I have tried
<em>sfc /scannow</em> and that has made no difference really.&nbsp;<strong>READ MY EDIT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to stop my music pausing and grinding away? (I do use speakers plugged into the headphone socket before, if that helps.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: This seems to happen everywhere, but the effect is highlighted in Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does help, I have low disk space (I am 99% full on C:)<br />
<br />
EDIT 2:<br />
I have just run another&nbsp;<em>sfc /scannow</em> It has returned this:</p>

            I have Windows 7, and I could always restore to a previous time, when I needed to , I haven't been able to use restore points for about 3 months, so if I make a mistake, I can't use System Restore, it says files are missing that it needed to restore. What
 can I do, I also have tried different restore points, it is a no everytime.

<p>
</p><p>Try the steps listed below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;<span><br />
</span></strong><span>Let’s disable antivirus software and check if the system restore works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disable antivirus software</a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>When you disable Antivirus:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above method does not work, go to next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><strong><span>:

    <title>Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Connect to Your DHCP Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deuce drizzle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Connect to Your DHCP Server</h2>
                    
<p>A little background on my situation:</p>
<p>I have Comcast Xfinity as my ISP and my original home network setup used a rented modem/wireless router combo from Comcast and an Linksys router that I had purchased as well as a netgear switch.&nbsp; Our home is wired with Cat5 throughout, so I had the modem
 and router hooked up downstairs and ran internet back up to the homerun upstairs where the switch then split it out to every other room in the house.&nbsp; At this point my Xbox One was wired directly out of one of the Cat5 ports and was able to connect without
 issue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Comcast modem/router and my old Linksys router were not doing a very good job of providing a wireless signal to the whole home so I had to make a change.&nbsp; I bought a new Motorola Surfboard SB141 modem and ASUS router and kept the same
 switch.&nbsp; I moved the modem upstairs to the homerun and ran the internet directly from the modem to the switch.&nbsp; The router is downstairs and is basically just set up to provide wireless service to the home.&nbsp; Now, when I fire up my Xbox One for a good gaming
 session I am getting the "Can't connect to your DHCP server" error.&nbsp; I took our Mac and plugged it in directly to the Ethernet cord going to my Xbox One and the internet is working just fine.&nbsp; I have tried resetting the modem and Xbox and it is still not working.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Old setup:&nbsp; Modem -&gt; Router -&gt; Switch -&gt; Xbox</p>
<p>New Setup: Modem -&gt; Switch -&gt; Xbox&nbsp;&nbsp; (router is now out of the loop of the Xbox and is just running our wireless network)</p>
<p>If the internet is up and working at that port, shouldn't the Xbox be able to recognize it?&nbsp; Do I HAVE to have the router between the modem and the Xbox for the DHCP to assign properly? Are there any suggestions as to what I can do to try and get the Xbox
 One to connect to the internet again??</p>

<p>The Problem is. The Modem can only give 1 IP adress to 1 Device. The best would be if your router is this device (you have to restart your modem once if you connect). So your Router can handle the DHCP.</p>
<p>maybe your switch is good enough to do so -it will also be possible. </p>
<p>Use your Router for DHCP. - problem solved</p>

    <title>Where is Windows Explorer in Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mm60613  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is Windows Explorer in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    In old versions of windows it was easy to move files or folders around by clicking "Windows Explorer," which would populate a hierarchy tree of file structure, allowing you to move your folder or file into any other folder. You could do this directly from
 any folder that you happened to be in at the time. Is there anything comparable in Windows 7? Or do I need to open a second folder and then search for the folder that I want to move it to, then go back to the first folder and drag and&nbsp;drop? If the&nbsp;latter,
 this seems like an inferior system to what was in XP.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Solution For UEFI error in Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocky lane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solution For UEFI error in Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Many web sites say the only solution to a UEFI error during Creators Update is to do a CLEAN install so Windows can delete ALL partitions on the system drive and convert from MBR to GPT. They also say the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do a full-system drive image backup.</p>
<p>2) Do your CLEAN install.</p>
<p>3) Do a full restore from the image file created in item 1) and your system will be back to where it was before you started but with the OS at version 1703 instead of 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will item 3) ACTUALLY work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

Clean Install Windows 10</a> which is the gold standard install vastly superior to a factory or Upgrade install which most enthusiasts won't even run.&nbsp; Use the latest media provided to install V.1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What error are you getting exactly?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the present BIOS setting?&nbsp; Type MSINFO in Start Search and report back whether BIOS is installed to UEFI or MBR.&nbsp; There's a chance it already is UEFI but getting a false error based on another setting in the UEFI/BIOS Setup for CSM or Legacy also
 being enabled which allows for MBR installs as well as UEFI.&nbsp; What's important is if Setup is set to UEFI, and that Windows Boot Manager is set first to boot as it must be on a UEFI install.&nbsp; On a Legacy BIOS install the Hard drive should be set first to boot.&nbsp;

<p>

<p>Hi Rocky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basing on the latest error message, we'd like to suggest in exhausting the feature of Windows 10 Media installer to convert your HDD from being MBR to GPT since the system you have is UEFI dependent. Please do note that you can do this when doing a clean
 install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if there's anything else you need.</p>

                    so.. microsoft has screwed the pooch once again. had to use older skype on my tablet, because new version won't display video properly, and auto-answer won't turn on the video automatically.&nbsp; now since they've disabled the old version and forced me to
 update, my tablet might as well be worthless....

            Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: powerpnt
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Does PowerPoint open or not?
<br />
<br />Which version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft PowerPoint is it? 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

            Hi Peggy.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />As long as you saved the file then it should still be there as there's nothing Windows Update would do to delete it.  
<br />
<br />Can you do a search in the Start Search box for a keyword in the title?  That should locate it so you can open it again.  
<br />
<br />If you open PowerPoint it might also be queued in the list there.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>I know before the update, I saved a 40+ power point and after the update, it is not there. I am in the process of doing a system restore that has the date of the update on it. Is that a good idea?</p>

            System Restore doesn't restore files normally, unless File History is turned on for previous versions.  
<br />
<br />What sometimes happens is if the file isn't saved a restart wipes it out, but it's not supposed to restart or shut down without responding to a nag message about the File being opened.  
<br />
<br />If you saved it, then it's likely there but just not found yet.  Do a search for keywords in title.  In  File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; File and Folder Options &gt;Search tab set to search in file contents even non-indexed files.

            Peggy, what happens when you click on the Shortcut?   It is supposed to lead to the file.  
<br />
<br />You said you saved the file during creation, correct?  If so do you remember where you saved it?  It if was saved it should be there.  It's strange there are shortcuts to it but no file found.  When you right click one of the Shortcuts, where does it say the Target file is located?
