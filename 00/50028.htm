<h2>            How do I turn off the internal speaker in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    The new update forced my internal speaker to play music. I have external speakers that are much easier to control and mute. How do I turn off the internal speakers but keep the external speakers under manual control? Using a Dell with Windows 10

            This shuts off EVERY speaker connected to my computer. What I want is to be able to turn off the system speaker inside of the computer. Prior to the new update, this was not an issue - the internal speaker was always off by default.

            <p>I am having the same problem with my HP ENVY 23.&nbsp; It appears that the latest Windows 10 does not distinguish between the external (headphone) jack and internal speaker so you can't turn them off and on separately.&nbsp; You can only disconnect both of them at
 the same time now.&nbsp; This wasn't the case for the previous version of Windows 10.&nbsp;

Same thing with my Asus running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit... since the latest (very large) update a couple of weeks ago I cannot use my external speaker system which plugs into the Asus docking station. Now the external speakers have to plug directly into the headphone
 jack and there is no adjustment to the sound setup (via Control Panel) available as it says the setup is mono and not stereo. This is total BS and not up to Microsoft's usual standards...!

            Why doesn't Microsoft address this issue??? &nbsp;I also noticed that this latest update to Windows 10 activated my (previously turned off) internal PC speakers on my HP Envy 23. &nbsp;As stated - no actions by the user seem to permit turning off ONLY these speakers.
 Like many others, I want to listen only through my attached external speakers.

            <p>I saw a post about using the Realtek application to turn off checking for the headphone jack input, but can't find it again now. When I look for that app on my HP Envy it opens the B&amp;O speaker app and that doesn't have any option offering anything to do
 with headphone jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am, like others unable to use an external speaker - but via Bluetooth, which isn't specified in other posts on this thread, although I am sure it is the same problem. I can use the "test" feature and it will play a test system tone. So the speaker is connected
 and passing output. The system just won't recognize it as a viable playback device for music.</p>

            Problem solved! &nbsp;I'm not certain I could walk anyone through the steps - but a FREE call to Microsoft solved the problem. The Tier 1 guy there I talked to was also befuddled, but they had another tech call me back and she was able to turn off my internal
 speaker, while allowing my external speaker to play. I wish I could repeat the steps here for others to follow, but I suggest making that FREE call to Microsoft.

The last time I made a "free" call to Microsoft I was put on hold and stayed there for over an hour. How much is your time worth...? Why the devil doesn't the tech you talked to post the steps to fix this online so we can all remedy the problem without spending
 many hours (collectively) on hold...?

    <title>How do I remove the &#39;crumbs&#39; of an uninstalled spyware program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gstrumberger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove the &#39;crumbs&#39; of an uninstalled spyware program that&#39;s caused me to lose internet connectability&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This problem is not unique to Vista. I bought a new Dell Studio laptop last year with XP SP3 installed. Everything was running fine; but my former spyware removal software was no longer doing its job. I could tell my internet experience was slowing down
 yet the program wasn't coming up with any spyware/malware to remove. So I went back to a program I used about 5 years ago that seemed to work for us: Stopzilla. I could tell immediately something was wrong because, while the program seemed to work well while
 I was online, when I tried to use it to scan for existing infections it stalled at 1% completion and would never go any farther.<br />
<br />
I attempted an uninstall. The Windows 'uninstall a program' function wouldn't configure Stopzilla for uninstall. Obviously, I was in trouble. Used a different 3rd party program for cleaning up registry problems, etc. but it also uninstalled programs. Apparently,
 not well enough. I then did a 'search' for any files/folder (hidden and otherwise) that had Stopzilla attached to it and deleted the results. Still nothing.<br />
<br />
As I've researched how to remedy this problem I've found many references to losing wireless internet connectivity due to remnants of these kinds of&nbsp;programs attaching themself to the system functions.<br />
<br />
I've done all the basics: checked the&nbsp;connection itself, checked my network settings, checked the router settings, pinged the ip address, renewed the ip address, checked the DNS server address, etc. etc. &nbsp;Even gone beyond that and used the "restack an ip address"
 fix and even tried to hunt things down directly through the registry. Nothing. Still can't connect to the internet using ANY browser and can only use it locally.<br />
<br />
I'm about ready to take the computer to a PC clinic but really do NOT want to be without the laptop for days due to a major project deadline.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do to get my wireless connection working again??<br />
<br />
Thanks - gstrumberger</p>

            Stopzilla states, on its site, that its compatible with win98 through win 7, which would lead me to suspect its validity, and since you were unable to uninstall, well........<br />
I dont suppose you have a restore point for a period before you installed?<br />
And if not how comfortable are you with editing the registry?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue is conflict with some updates or programs installed on your PC. We would like to ask some questions to know the best possible resolution to offer:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried checking if there are available updates for your Windows 7?</li><li>Did you try to run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            S&#228;mtliche Controller mit Verbindungsproblemen</h2>
                    <p>Hallo zusammen,</p><p>das neue Forum ist ja mal wirklich gruselig, aber das nur nebenbei.</p><p>Zum Thema: Ich habe seit ein paar Tagen bei allen vier Standard-Xbox One-Controllern erhebliche Verbindungsprobleme. Das betrifft sowohl Games als auch Apps, es trat allerdings bisher nbicht bei Menüs auf, obwohl das Zufall sein kann. Extrem war es bei Lego Dimenensions Sonic Levelpack, das war fast unspielbar.</p><p>Ein Update aller Controller hat nichts gebracht. bei mir hat sich nichts verändert, alle Controller haben freie "Sicht" auf die Xbox, die Entfernung beträgt zwei bis drei Meter.</p><p>Was kann da los sein?<br /></p>

            <p>Ich hatte zwischendurch auch mal Probleme mit der Controllerverbindung.Durch Testen habe ich es auf schlechte Batterien geschoben. Meine Herangehensweise:</p><p>- Controller via Play&amp;Charge Kit: Zwischendurch Verbindungsabbrüche.&nbsp;</p><p>- Controller via USB an Konsole anschließen (Strom und Datenübertragung via Kabel): Funktionierte einwandfrei</p><p>- USB Kabel an USB Netzteil (Handy Ladegerät) angeschlossen (Strom via Kabel, Datenübertragung drahtlos): Funktionierte einwandfrei.</p><p>Schlussfolgerung: An der Stromversorgung stimmte was nicht. Markenbatterien verwendet: Funktionierte einwandfrei. Akku des Play&amp;Charge Kit getauscht: Läuft jetzt auch einwandfrei.&nbsp;</p><p>Teste also zuhause mal, ob sich bei Dir nicht vielleicht doch der Nachbar ein Babyfon zugelegt hat, was die Funkübertragung des Controllers stört, oder ob nicht doch die Batterien schlapp machen. <br /></p>

<h2>            Skype Accounts being Blocked and unable to recover</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a Skype Manager account for my organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got employees to create accounts with a specific naming convention and added them to the Manager account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now had two brand new accounts that have been blocked. We've been unable to recover the one as there were no emails sent/received from the account, and this has caused us to be unsuccessful in recovering the account. While creating a brand new account
 is a solution, there is now no way for me to recover the Skype credit that I've allocated the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like a clear indication as to why this is happening, and if possible a resolution, as I cannot afford to lose more accounts/credit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            SCANNING TO LAPTOP USING KYOCERA ECOSYS M6535cidn&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How to scan with KYOCERA ECOSYS M6535cidn printer into the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully connected the multipurpose printer to my laptop both wirelessly and with cable; and are able to print colourful documents with it. When it comes to scanning documents, it is a bizarre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer app on my computer ask me to type in an IPV4 address which I assume is the default one (0.0.0.0). The&nbsp; error message comes in and reports that the device can't be added, even if I replace it with the wifi IP address. It's all in vain. What's
 the glitch?</p>

<p>That depends on your home connection. If it's password protected, just use the same password that you use when signing in on a PC. Here are some other tips you can try: Restart your router and/or Xbox. Sometimes this will clear everything, even if you have
 your password correct.<br />

What exactly is the problem? What errors are you getting?</p>

<p><span>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing many problems, and
<em>the order and timing of the steps is important to success</em>:</span><br />
<span>1) turn off the Xbox then</span><br />
<span>2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).</span><br />
<span>3) unplug power from the modem.</span><br />
<span>4) Wait at least 30 secs then replug the modem/gateway power.</span><br />
<span>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router
 or a modem with no router, then when that light says it's ready, skip to step 7.</span><br />
<span>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.
</span><br />
<span>7) Turn on the Xbox.&nbsp; For more background on Ports, see

<h2>            Unresponsive keys with ALL keyboards -</h2>
                    <p>So, hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(75, 79, 86, 1)">I was typing one day when all of a sudden my keyboard became unresponsive. I was doing normal, everyday activities on my PC - it was very unprecedented. My immediate thought
 was that somehow I'd put in dud batteries (wireless keyboard). I exchanged them, but with no joy. Next I restarted my computer, incase there was a software hiccup. Again, no fix. The wireless mouse that connects with the same receiver was working just fine.
 I was getting extremely frustrated by this point, and decided to take the back of my keyboard to investigate the hardware for any faults. This turned up nothing, except when I turned it over for the last time, I noticed that SOME of the keys were still working
 - precisely, the Home, Calc, Forward and Backward buttons etc. I was completely at a loss. I tried searching for others who'd encountered the same issue, and can't find ANY solution. I decided to give up in the end, and borrowed a wired keyboard from a friend.
 We saw that this wasn't working either and assumed it was because of the USB 2.0/3.0 incompatibility. So, I bought myself a brand spanking new wireless keyboard and mouse. Guess what? The exact same problem as before - no keys on the keyboard function with
 the exception of the home, Calc etc etc buttons. The problem is rooted in the PC, not in the devices. Please help - I've exhausted everything that I know.</span></p>

</span>As I try to select something to go to another subject that is provided in the email message the left click will not work, sometimes.&nbsp;Also my online city newspaper and some financial sites also cannot be accessed-when I click on the button there is no
 response so I cannot read my newspaper or conduct certain financial tasks.&nbsp; I have to use my old computer instead of this new one I recently built.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have Windows 7-64bit and a Kensington "Expert Mouse."<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I started using this mouse after another mouse could not be updated because of Win7-64bit I believe.<span>&nbsp;</span>Yet with this new mouse purchased just a week ago there is no

<p>Hi Frank</p>
<p>There is a bit of history&nbsp;on the subject&nbsp;of the Kensington Expert Mouse and Windows 7.</p>
<p>Initially, Kensington did not have any plans to support the Expert Mouse on Windows 7 and this had a lot of people very upset. I have used the Expert Mouse for many, many years and was discouraged when I heard this news.</p>
<p>Anyway to make a long story short, on June 2, 2010 Kensington came through for us and released a new universal driver/software for the Expert Mouse. It supports both Windows 7 32bit and 64bit and works very well on both.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the download.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://us.kensington.com/html/1466.html#trackballworks_win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Kensington TrackballWorks for Windows 1.01</span></a></span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

<p>OK, thanks, I did the download but the problem still remains.&nbsp; The left mouse click works fine, except on a few items-sometimes when I'm reading a newsletter one of the highlighted items may not work, when I'm on a webpage like my financial institution everything
 works I am able to sign in, but then I cannot get to the next screen to pay bills, etc.&nbsp; The newspaper does not deliver each day to your home so I&nbsp;have to read certain days on the internet.&nbsp; Everything works here, I can sign in but then when I select the newspaper
 icon the page pops down a few lines but otherwise nothing happens, it does not go on to the next page.</p>
<p>(1.) For the financial institution web page I can sign in but then the left click does not work afterward, to the next page before I go to my bill pay stuff.&nbsp; When the left click is used I get this error messge on the bottom address bar right above the Start
 Globe:A yellow triangle appears, indicating an error on the page with the message-<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Java Script:open LoginWidows.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can left click 20-30 other highlighted items on this webpage, all respond except&nbsp;the highlighted
 item&nbsp;to go to my check writing settings-this is the only item that will not respond to the left click.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2.) For my newspaper I also get to sign in but then I cannot go on to the page with the newspaper showing.&nbsp; This page error is different:The yellow triangle with the black exclamation mark appears with this message:<a href="http://www.ganweb01.gannett.com/server?WEBEVENT+rO255448932748501D7AD081+LV3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.ganweb01.gannett.com/server?WEBEVENT+rO255448932748501D7AD081+LV3</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, although I selected <strong>Alert me</strong> when someone responds to this post."&nbsp; I have not received an email to alert me when someone has answered my question.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partial success in finding something of a fix.</p>
<p>Just a little while ago as I clicked on the Start Globe and saw my programs I noticed an icon for Internet Explorer near the top of the list and in parenthesis the wording by this icon said "64 bit."&nbsp; So I clicked on it and went to my financial institution
 website and was able to get into any web page including the web pages I was not able to get into before.&nbsp; I then clicked on the IE (taskbar) icon and tried entering&nbsp;my financial institution the same way-it did not work.&nbsp; So only using IE(64bit) works.&nbsp; So
 if this is a fix for this problem and the Internet Explorer in my taskbar is a different IE than in my Start Menu I want to change.&nbsp; So can I delete the IE in my taskbar then chose the IE (64 bit) in my Start panel and put it in my taskbar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK so one soulution (partially) so far.&nbsp; I then went to my email MS Outlook 2007 and brought up my newspaper email then went to the newspaper site.&nbsp; This problem still remains.&nbsp; I can sign into this site but then I cannot get into reading the newspaper because
 there is no response to my left click when I click on my newspaper icon.&nbsp;</p>

            hi.&nbsp; i have similar issues.&nbsp; i have the kensington expert mouse with trackballworks 1.0.4 installed.&nbsp; when my computer with windows 7 boots up from off-mode or sleep-mode certain buttons won't work like they should.&nbsp; i noticed that when i click on the
 windows taskbar there are several instances of kensington trackballworks running.&nbsp; when i exit out of all but 1 then my buttons go back to normal.&nbsp; so, obviously the problem is too many trackballworks are running in the taskbar!&nbsp; however, whose to blame for
 this?&nbsp; or, more importantly...how do i prevent this from happening?&nbsp; if i had to guess i'd say that this is a windows 7 problem; however, considering i don't have this problem with any other programs i can't say for certain.&nbsp; IDEAS?

<p>I am very angry at this point, I cannot cancel the recurring membership on my account because it will not let me log in without waiting a month when it will recur on my credit card, I put my cell # in and got this after entering the security code:</p>
<p>"</p>
<div>
<div>We have a waiting period for the updates to take effect. On 12/26/2013, we'll delete your old security info:</div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Once this is deleted, you'll be able to verify your account with info you have access to. If you didn't make the updates, or if you still have access to the above info,&nbsp;<a href="https://login.live.com/pp1500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">cancel
 the updates</a>.</div>
<div>"</div>
<div>I also paid $15 for a prepaid card unknowing that it would not work to pay for xbox live gold, was angry about that as well. I do not want to pay for the recurring membership as I do not need it, I do not have my backup email address ready

<p>Although you cannot remove your payment method or cancel auto-renew on your own at this time, you can still call into Xbox LIVE Support (1-800-4-MY-XBOX) to have them cancel the auto-renew for you. &nbsp;However, you will be responsible for renewing your Xbox
 LIVE Gold subscription at the end of your billing cycle, otherwise, you will be downgraded to Silver at the beginning of the next billing cycle. &nbsp;If you do have a valid pre-paid card, you may use it for additional LIVE Gold time.</p>

            <p>Hi, Kenneth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and we will try to assist you the best way we can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest that you try the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Left click at Start button &gt; select Settings &gt; select Devices &gt; click Add a printer or scanner &gt; the system will start looking for it and if found, it will start adding your sanner to your Printers &amp; Scanners list below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run Hardware Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on&nbsp;the Start button, and type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>”&nbsp;on the search bar.</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;troubleshooting, then click on “<strong>Hardware&nbsp;and soun</strong>d”.</span></li><li><span>Under&nbsp;Hardware and sound, click on “<strong>hardware and devices</strong>”.</span></li><li><span>A pop-up&nbsp;will appear, click on the “<strong>Next</strong>”button and your hardware troubleshooting will start</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> I would like to suggest that you check in&nbsp;Device Manager and check if the&nbsp;driver for the scanner is available. To open Device Manager right click on the Start Menu and locate click on it.</p>
<p>
If the Driver is not available in Device manager then I would recommend that you visit the manufacturer of the scanner and download and install the latest driver. If not then install it in Compatibility mode
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

    <title>GFWL will not update and cannot uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratchetlombax12  say:</h3>
<h2>            GFWL will not update and cannot uninstall</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having a serious problem with Games for Windows LIVE, and it's starting to **** me off, because now I can't play any GFWL game because of it.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I recently got back my H2V and installed it. I found the fix for myself on Windows 7, where you have to open up GFWL Marketplace before opening H2V. I did this patch successfully on my desktop, but my laptop is not so successful, thanks to
 this. I opened up my GFWL marketplace application, and it was checking for updates. I waited a few minutes, and bam, new update. I clicked the link it gave me and started to install. Then, out of nowhere, "Newer version is already installed." This made no
 sense to me, because my desktop overlay was black, mine was white. I tried to uninstall the older version, but then I got the following errors for both uninstallers on GFWL:</p>
<p>Missing GFWLClient.msi.</p>
<p>Missing XLive[something].msi</p>

<p>I would try to download both these files, but I can't find them online. I used the suggested Revo Uninstaller, but that was no help and I had to use the system restore point Revo makes. Any ideas? Because I wanna play Game Room and Tinker again too :(</p>

<p>Bump. Even though it's been a day since I posted this, I'm getting quite disappointed. I don't have the money for an Xbox 360, and the only thing for me to play right now is all of my Steam games. However, I recently downloaded the DiRT 2 demo on Steam,
 and the last time I downloaded a GFWL demo on Steam was Bulletstorm and that did the trick.</p>

    <title>Screen resolution stuck at 1024x768 on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen resolution stuck at 1024x768 on Windows 10</h2>
                    So after Windows 10 updated to version 1803 my screen resolution got stuck at 1024x768.<br />
Tried every single solution on the internet for 3 days straight now including installing different older/newer drivers, uninstalling drivers, changing things in regedit and every other "solution" on both fortums and Youtube. Of course nothing worked so came
 to the conclusion I'd have to reinstall my entire computer. So I did and here I'm sitting with a clean Windows 1709 that STILL has the resolution stuck at f*cking 1024x768 and I've once again tried every single solution with drivers/edits/repairs. I'm so close
 to throwing the entire computer out the window right now and buying a Mac instead it's not even funny.<br />
<br />
Is there seriously any other option in this observable universe that can get my resolution back to 1920x1080?

            Hi Muck.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br /> If these all fail then try installing the latest driver in Compatibility Mode:  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/set-compatibility-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/set-compatib...</a>
<br />
<br />If the driver previously worked in 1709 then something must have been carried over from 1803 that is blocking it.  Did you properly delete all partitions off the hard drive during the Clean Install?  See the steps here which  compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I can understsand your frustration as we see it every day, compared to being in forums during the whole Windows 7 run which was a celebration by comparison. 
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hey Greg nice to meet you.<br />
<br />
You mention the "<span>PC's Support Downloads web page"<br />
Where can I find that? Is it a specific place on the computer like in the control panel or a website?&nbsp;<br />
I built the computer myself (desktop) from scratch so didn't buy it from a manufacturer of any kind.&nbsp;<br />
Would I have to somehow search the internet for every specific thing like the graphic card I have, motherboard, CPU?&nbsp;</span>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            In that case you'd start with the Display card maker's Support Downloads webpage:
<br />
<br />
<br />Try the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>

<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />Check also that you have the latest motherboard chipset drivers installed and any other devices you installed that weren't part of the motherboard.

            Ok great thanks.<br />
<br />
Will try everything you've mentioned and if that doesn't work I'll do another clean install of Windows 10, format the main drive with all other HD's and USB devices unplugged.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work I'll most likely reinstall Windows 7 and forever block Windows update until they can come up with a stable working OS.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High
<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.
<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.
<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on
<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the
<br />
</strong><strong>reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot
<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi Hansen
<br />
<br />Please do not update at this time . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft have pulled that update, it is no longer available on the download page and has been removed from Windows Update, a bug was found in that update, where for some users, all the users files were deleted and were not recoverable. 
<br />
<br />So, until this bug is resolved, do not update until Microsoft resolves this bug . . .
<br />
<br />Keep an eye on the link below, when that reports that the October 2018 Update is available, click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1809
<br />

            I presume you are talking about updating to 1809.
<br />
<br />Don't worry. You are not missing something. This is a simple matter of 1809 being not available for anybody as of now.
<br />
<br />It was rolled out earlier but had few bugs. Windows feature update 1809 has been paused by Microsoft and currently it is being tested by Windows Insiders community. 
<br />
<br />You should not try to install 1809 at this juncture unless Microsoft re-releases it. Keep an eye on Windows Blogs to know when it will be released.

<p>Hi Swee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you are seeing are some&nbsp;Pen interaction improvements that were made in the Fall Creators update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(95, 94, 94, 1)"><strong>Scrolling with pen.
</strong>In the effort to create a more intuitive pen interaction on Windows, we are emphasizing natural and direct manipulation of content with pen. You don’t have to “hunt and peck” for scrollbars or frequently switch between pen and touch when navigating;
 now you can scroll content directly and fluently as you would with your finger.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(95, 94, 94, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(95, 94, 94, 1)"><strong>Selection with pen.
</strong>We also revised selection with pen by giving it more control over the selection process. Not only are we showing selection grippers whenever text is selected via pen, but also are allowing for a consistent and fast selection of content – text, objects,
 or ink—by dragging the pen while the barrel button is pressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you are in Edge or a Store app you can now select text by quickly double tapping a word and then dragging the selection grippers to adjust the words highlighted OR you can press and hold the pen's barrel button while you highlight the desired
 text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Greg</p>
        </p>

</p><p>You could perform a direct clean install:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

            Hi Theodore,<br />
<br />
If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Store, you have a digital license for your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a digital license for without entering
 a product key. During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, you can skip this step. Windows 10 will automatically activate online after the installation is complete. You can follow the steps in this

            Do you have Dell Webcam Central or any similar software installed? If so, did you try with the software?

<div>If webcam is not working with any of the software, try the following steps:
<div>Go to start-&gt;type <b>devmgmt.msc</b>-&gt;press enter. If UAC prompts, click Yes. Expand Imaging Devices and you should see Integrated Webcam. If not, click Action-&gt;<i>Scan for hardware changes</i> (from menubar). Still, if the webcam is not available, contact
 Dell Support for further assistance.</div>

            Hi, thank you for your reply. I am still having problems cannot get webcam to work. I recently had my computer upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7, since then it has not worked before that it was fine.<br />
<br />
When i go into the integrated webcam folder to open it opens the properties folder instead of opening the camera.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Aman<br />

<div>Where exactly did you see this "integrated webcam folder"? In device manager, if you double click on it, it will show properties only.</div>
