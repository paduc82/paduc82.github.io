<h2>            Windows media player keeps crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>about 5 days ago, windows media player started to crash every time it was opened. It would open and start to update the media library, then crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tired to open a song directly from windows explorer, it would play for a short time, then the media player would crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled amazon music player which I though might be the issue (recently installed) but this has not made&nbsp;a difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run some of the recommended fixes I.e. sfc/scannow and the image thing but no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I reinstall windows 8.1? The machine came installed with this, I have no disc, just the windows licence key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get any error message when the Windows Media Player crashes?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You might be facing this issue due to some changes in the Windows media player settings or some software conflicts. I suggest you to try the following settings and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to perform the Media Player troubleshooter and check if it helps. If your computer is having problems playing video or audio files in Windows Media Player, try using the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to fix the problem. The troubleshooter
 checks the configuration and network settings for Windows Media Player to make sure that you can play content you've downloaded and saved to your computer, or content streaming over a network or the Internet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows key + C” on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Troubleshooting and click Troubleshooting under Settings.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select Programs in the search option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Media Player, select Windows Media Player DVD and Windows Media Player Settings respectively to run the troubleshooters.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable and then enable Windows media Player from the Windows Features and see if the issue persists.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.Press Windows key + X and select Control Panel.<br />
2.Select Programs and Features.<br />
3. click Turn Windows features on or off. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
4.Click on Media Features.<br />
5. To turn Windows Media Player off, clear the check box. Click OK and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>To Turn Windows Media Player ON, click on the checkbox once again and click OK. And then restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, I suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot and check. Clean boot eliminates software conflicts.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the instructions (Step 1 for Windows 8) given in this link to perform a clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow these steps to return the computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click ok.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

            Hey Len.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's bypassing the media to try to start Windows which doesn't exist yet.  Pay close attention to the steps here for how to properly boot the media and wipe the drive - which is what makes a Clean install clean.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            99-100&#37; Disk for Hours from Failed Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>All yesterday Modern Setup Host tied up my computer downloading 4 GB of data. When I allowed Windows to update, I got "No Operating System Error 1962" or something like that. It was locked in 1962 when I hit any key to reboot as instructed. I manually rebooted
 and it is trying to restore my prior Windows version, I think. The system has been running for hours at 99% or 100% of disk capacity. Update Orchestrator Service, Windows 10 Setup, System and Windows Update are using all system resources. I went to System
 - About to see what version of Windows is trying to run and that is grayed out and it won't tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft failing? I have not had a decent operating system since Windows 7. I have to use my Windows 7 laptop because Windows Updates steal all computer resources regularly from my Windows 10 desktop and server. When is this going to stop and allow me
 to use my computer?</p>

<p>Look this is serious. I cannot lose two days of productive time regularly to Microsoft for updates that I do not want. I don't want Microsoft Search, Edge, Cortana, Xbox Networking, Creator Update features and the like. I just want a small efficient Windows
 7 type system that is updated for necessary security changes but without major "improvement" changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system has run at 100% for the past 36 hours with an unwanted update to Windows version 1803 from 1709. The wear and tear on my computer for Microsoft updates almost equals my productive use. I do not know why the system updated from 1709 to 1803 and
 then backed it out to 1709 and updated it again to 1803, but there was no power surge from the electric company; my microwave clock which is very sensitive stayed in operation and my computer has a UPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe how Microsoft thinks it can change my permissions whenever it changes versions. This time it made all my contacts visible to all LAN hardware and possibly others. Worse yet, Microsoft Compatibility Assistant just informed me that my "Homegroup
 was removed from Windows". If I have to set up all my peer-to-peer networking again, I am done with Microsoft forever. Tell me how to fix it easily please. I don't want to spend the next month purchasing a new computer and moving to Apple. This desktop now
 spends over half its time in Linux acting as a file server and only converts to Windows to support Microsoft Office Access, Presentation software and legacy audio, picture and video editing software. Most of my browsing, newsreading and word processing is
 now done under Linux with non-Microsoft products.</p>

            I hope someone replies. How do I get back my peer-to-peer networking without having to start over with all networking? If this system cannot support my desktop file serving needs, then this computer will only function under Linux in the future. If I get
 no response, goodbye Microsoft. I started with Microsoft with MS-DOS 0.99 the pre-release version of DOS while I was living close to the Yamatto Road IBM plant and was active with the BUGs (Boca Raton User Group). Windows 3.11 and Windows 95 were break-through
 products but since Windows 7 Microsoft for marketing reasons, I think, has moved beyond operating system provision to AI, Cortana, Edge, Creator Updates, etc. Microsoft should not be like Google, trying to capture my data and sell it.<br />

<p>I expect and deserve answers to my questions. If no MVP feels able to answer these questions, please forward this thread to a Microsoft software engineering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to restore my system to the manual checkpoint I created before I allowed this update to take place, but Microsoft has deleted 100%, all, of my prior checkpoints. Don’t give me the standard answer you give to make customers go away – delete the
 system, reload all your software, and restore from the last Windows 7 backup and subsequent file history. That would take over 100 hours of my time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last update (1) deleted all my checkpoints, (2) ran, backed out, ran again and subsequently gives me 1964 operating system not found error messages daily, (3) Microsoft Compatibility Assistant deleted my file sharing saying it was incompatible, (4) turned
 off my audio and when I try to plug-in my BCM20702A0 USB hardware that supports Bluetooth and my MM100 wireless headset or change the driver for the BCM20702A0, gives me a System Thread Exception and throws me back into the endless loop of 1964 operating system
 not found error messages.</p>

</p><p>This Microsoft documents your failure to properly test new releases which users cannot opt out of and back out of. As I asked before, why is Microsoft failing its customers? I have over 50 years of software and programming experience plus an MIT degree that
 taught me how to do this stuff. If I have to go to Reddit, elsewhere and raise havoc I will. I would think that Microsoft would learn from Facebook and other tech companies that it must support and protect its customers or face a billion dollars in governmental
 fines and class action lawsuits.</p>

<p>Hi Atlanta Southsider,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you are experiencing such issues after a failed Windows update. It could be due to corrupted system files, software conflicts or a hardware failure. We'll need additional information in order to further isolate your concern. Kindly
 answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Do you have a 3rd party anti-virus installed on your computer?</li><li>Have you tried performing a clean boot?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try running a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">system file check</a></strong>
 (<strong>SFC</strong>) to fix corrupted system components (If you haven't tried this yet).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

            I just tried deleting the Satechi BCM20702A0 USB hardware from the Resource Manager and letting Windows add it back when I plugged it in again. The same system thread exception sent me back into the endless 1962 operating system not found loop. I responding
 again because I guessed improperly at 1964 rather than 1962 operating system not found.<br />

<p>This is a crime. Does Microsoft provide no free support when their update screws up? I just found out that my printer does not work as well. Device Manager says the HP Deskjet 970Cse is working properly, but all programs like Word or Notepad give an error
 when a print is requested. When I click on Find Printer, it says "Active Directory Domain Services is currently unavailable". The loss of the printer is not related to Microsoft's deletion of my network. The printer is hard wired to the Windows 10 desktop's
 USB port. Setting the HP as the default printer does no good. It just continues with the printer error messages.</p>
<p>
<strong>HOW DO YOU GET SUPPORT!! MICROSOFT IS CLEARLY AT FAULT HERE AND OFFERS NO HELP. WITHOUT A PRINTER AND THE ABILITY TO HEAR ANY AUDIO HELP FILES, THE COMPUTER IS VIRTUALLY USELESS.<br />

            I can't do that, because "My Documents" doesn't actually show up under my Users folder. It's just not there. Had it been, I would have tried your original suggestions.

            <p>That's odd, because under normal circumstances, even after you move it using the Location tab, a redirect remains in that folder (also called a junction point or symlink).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the junction is missing, my best recommendation is <a href="http://skeene.net/answers/posts/Restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
option #1 from this page</a>, which&nbsp;will bring back the junction point and let you either try again or take other steps.&nbsp;

            Heh, I wish I could do a system restore, but it doesn't work either! Windows 8 is knocking me for a loop. I wanted to do a system restore awhile ago because of other reasons that came up, and my computer tells me that the restore was unsuccessful because
 of my antivirus system. I disabled it, tried again, same error. I uninstalled it, tried the restore again-- same error. I would have restored before I posted this were it an option.&nbsp;

            <p>What antivirus system are you using?&nbsp; Unrelated to your Documents concern, but honestly I would recommend removing it and using the free one that is built-in to Windows 8, it's perfect, updates daily, and obviously won't cause problems like the one you're
 using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here's how you can get back your Documents folder.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+<strong>E</strong> to open Explorer and go to C:\Users\Kelly and create a new folder&nbsp;called "Documents" (important, it must be spelled exactly as such, no space at the beginning or end).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Go to this <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=2813C6E4993C726F&amp;id=2813C6E4993C726F%21227827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore Documents Shell Folder</a> registry file, choose Download at the top of the page, and then run the file.&nbsp; It will restore the special relationship of that folder to your Documents.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Restart your computer normally.</li></ol>
<p>After you do this, you can go back to the Documents folder, right-click, and move the location.&nbsp;
<strong>And here's the critical part: </strong>if you move it, make sure that you keep the \Documents at the very end of the new location.&nbsp; In other words, make sure the new location is still inside a folder named "Documents".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To continue on that thought, assume you want your Documents to be stored on your E: drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
 folder is on your E: drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, I use AVG. I even did a system restore from safe mode, and that didn't work. This is something I'd really, REALLY want to get taken care of. If I could just do a restore, my problem would probably be solved.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this happen once... the problem is that you need to create a "My Documents" folder on D:\ before moving it... Too late for that now though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Shawn says is the right idea, but after the manner in which you moved your "My Documents" it will no longer be there... as you have noticed....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been awhile, and I can't find my notes or a link to a previous reply for this issue, so I will do the best I can from memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your "My Documents" folder has been replaced with a folder, link, or whatever, with something like</p>
<p>C:\Users, just C:\, or something weird like that in your USER folder where "My Documents" used to be...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on it and do the change location, and restore default on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line, you will be asked if you want to move your files back also.... Select
<strong>NO...</strong></p>
<p>If you select YES, the process will fail... You can manually copy the files back manually after you have restored your "My Documents" folder...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do this again, be sure to manually create a folder in the new location, or instruct Windows to create one when you do the move... if it will let you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps...</p>

<p>I did that, and it now shows Documents under "This PC" which is good, but when I go to Users\Kelley, it's just not there. It exists on my computer, but it just doesn't show up anymore under that folder. I tried to do the show files procedure, but that didn't
 change anything.</p>

            <p>Hi ToeKnee182, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my research. voice search option&nbsp;in Bing is only available in Mobiles right now. I am not able to find an app related to it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks! </p>

            <p>The more I am using this tablet, the more I feel that Win8 RT is half baked.&nbsp; I can get the Voice Search in iOS and Android but not&nbsp;on MS's own OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hate to return it and wait for the Pro, but I guess that is what I am contemplating now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in this.</p>

            I don't think pro can help you either, or if pro can at that time, then rt can as well. I think the reason is all the native APIs related to voice are missing for Store Apps at current stage, for whatever version.

            Google app has voice search now. Doesn't seem to be as good as a nexus phone voice search though. Voice input is obviously the future so I expect Microsoft to make improvements in this area.

            <p>not sure I understand at all why MS did not make voice search available on the Win8 Pro tablet.
</p>
<p><br />
they have the tech, the&nbsp;voice search&nbsp;works great on windows phone, voice regoc. is amazing actually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and they missed the outward camera BIG TIME&nbsp; 720p?? What were they thinking...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>otherwise I love the surface pro...</p>

            <p>I'm really disappointed by this missing feature, which I use all the time on my Lumia 920. And on my Nexus 7. You can't have a "mobile" product without it these days. I may have to return my Surface.</p>

            If you want ... and if it's not too late, the Google search app supports voice search.&nbsp; It's only Microsoft that does doesn't support Microsoft. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Where does it show pictures of where your computer has been on the Internet?</p>
<p>Try the following method and advance to the next one, if it does not fix the issue.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>To remove a picture from showing up in the screensaver list, follow these steps.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click an empty space on your desktop.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click "Personalize" in the menu.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on the third item in the window, which reads "Screen Saver." A new smaller window will open.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>From the drop down menu select “Photos.”</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “Settings.”</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the new window, click on “Browse.”</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Make a note of the location to which it is pointing.</p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to that location and delete the picture.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Perform a disk cleanup and check.</p>

<strong><span>compatibility mode</span></strong>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>

                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 8GB Kingston USB Pendrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>First when I inserted the drive into my PC, it showed capacity of 7.26 GB</p>
<p>But after formatting, the capacity shows 7.21 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting the partition and creating a new partition using diskpart, but no luck</p>
<p>Why is this so ?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>And a 8GB pendrive should actually be having 7.45 GB storage capacity , right ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone pl help ?</p>

            Hi Farazz, this is normal, it is because of the difference in the way PC manufacturers and hard drive manufacturers calculate a GB
<br />
<br />Windows uses 1000 as the multiplier, hard drive manufacturers use 1024 (which is correct)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b471a51d-f5b0-4cb8-927a-6950952a6d85?upload=true" />

            Hi FaraazMalak,
<br />
<br />This is normal. HowToGeek's article discusses this: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/233391/how-can-there-be-used-space-on-an-empty-and-freshly-formatted-flash-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/233391/how-can-there-...</a>
<br />
<br />Basically, when you format a drive into NTFS, it'll have an amount of internal files. This includes the volume descriptor file ($Volume), master file table, and the log used for file system recovery ("$LogFile").
<br />
<br />Hope that helps.

            Hi FaraazMalak, 
<br />My name is Fernando. I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to guide you with a recommendation on the information you are seeking. 
<br />
<br />On average, about 5% of a devices storage capacity is reserved for this operating firmware. Unfortunately, as the size of the data capacity increases, so does the size of the space needed for the firmware. For a point of reference, a 1GB USB flash drive requires about 72Mb of space for firmware; where as a 32GB flash drive requires about 2.2GB worth of space for firmware.
<br />
<br />So taking a look back at the original question, how much space does a USB flash drive really have? Well it depends on the size of the USB drive, but on average it is a safe bet to take off 5% of the advertised capacity and that is the realistic data capacity size.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this information helps.
<br />
<br />Thank you, 
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            That 240 MB are so crucial that whenever you delete a file accidently, you might able to recover it due to that :)

            FaraazMalak,
<br />
<br />You must have formatted it with a different cluster size, and the original drive must've had a cluster size that made it read as 7.26 before. The cluster size is the smallest space you can use to store a file. 
<br />
<br />Experiment with the cluster sizes, as well as varying file systems, and see what result you want out of it. Typical overhead allocated by essential files stored by NTFS or FAT32 (in your case) will vary greatly on what cluster size you choose when formatting your drive. Microsoft has an article for this: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/140365/default-cluster-size-for-ntfs-fat-and-exfat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/140365...</a>

<h2>            games wont launch</h2>
                    
<p>i have had my xbox 360 slim for years now and it has worked perfectly fine, but today i got on hoping to play a game, and it wont launch any of my games. instead the game just freezes with a black screen, and when i click on "go to xbox home" my whole console
 will freeze up forcing me to restart it. i already tried deleting the system cache, but that didn't work. but i did remove my 120 gigabyte hard drive and the game would load fine, minus not having any of my saved data. Do i need a new hard drive or is something
 else the problem?</p>

            Hi Domkol
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience of having to suggest the re-route, but Technet has a lot of experts there that know the ins and outs of enterprise issues; especially domain configurations for clients. So, they will be better able to diagnose and determine whats causing the freezing.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your corporation.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ul>
<li>I would like to inform you that Sony will not have drivers available for your specific models however you still can upgrade to Windows 10 for free.</li></ul>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft / Windows Update will try to install most of the drivers however some software may not function correctly. (Example: preinstall Software does not work, Video card driver may not function correctly, function key may not work, etc.)</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Many basic system functionalities should be enabled with the drivers included within the Windows 10 operating system.
</li><li>If your computer meets the system requirements to run the Windows 10 operating system, you should be able to install Windows 10 on it.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of programs that ran on Windows 7 and Windows 8 will continue to work on Windows 10, with the exception of Windows Media Center, which is being dropped completely. Some programs written for even older versions of Windows may work on Windows
 10 without an issue. For other pieces of software, it may take some additional work to get it up and running.</li><li>The software which&nbsp;integrated for Windows XP may not work as expected on Windows 10.
</li></ul>
