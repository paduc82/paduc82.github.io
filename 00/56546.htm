Snappy Fax enables you to send and receive faxes from your computer. You can either use your scanner to scan documents and then fax them to any fax machine, or use the Print command from other applications to use the virtual Fax printer, which allows you to
 send faxes directly from most Windows applications. In addition, the program also supports sending faxes via the internet, filtering of junk faxes and forwarding of incoming faxes to other fax machines or email addresses. Additional features include address
 book import, faxes by email (with zip support for images), OCR, spell checking and much more.<br />

<p>Thanks for the suggestion of obtaining a free version. But I would rather not take advantage of such side-door approaches to obtaining software that I use heavily every day. I would prefer obtaining the OS in an upfront and forthright manner, with no question
 as to my using it, and being able to easily keep it up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already purchased the retail version of Windows 10 Pro on a USB drive, and was looking for some pointers about installing it over Windows 7 Pro. Which would be the best step to do?</p>

<h2>            Win 10 MBR failure.</h2>
                    <p>After several weeks, I am still no further with recovering my Windows 10 hard drive. As I have indicated before, I get an MBR failure message. I have downloaded a so called ISO image several times and tried to install it. After several minutes, I get the
 message that some files are missing. How can that be if it is an ISO disk ??? Can someone give me a link to an ISO file download that is COMPLETE....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 64 bit system that was a Win 7 upgraded to Win 10 by Microsoft. All has worked well .... for several months. And now I have a boot failure. I am hoping that when this ISO eventually works, it will pick up the activation code from what remains on
 my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way..... my data files seem to be safe as I can see them with an UBUNTU recovery disk. But I have no idea how to use UBUNTU.</p>

            The Master Boot Record is not part of Windows. It's placed on the hard drive by the drive manufacturer. Contact the hard drive manufacturer's technical support. They have the tools to repair the MBR.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have found this picture on a website. The caption of the picture was "Windows XP Service Pack 4" I think that a modern Windows XP would be cool and be a huge hit! It could run IE11 Win Media player 12, Office 2013 and other modern day apps. This new XP
 should somewhat have the looks of Windows 8 while at the same time look like XP in a modern sort of way. Please comment if you agree with me and think XP SP4 would be awesome too.</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

What you are really saying ,is to have XP, function with modern equipment</p>
<p>like Win.8 is supposed to do .</p>
<p>The hardware that related to XP. has also moved on .</p>
<p>And patching&nbsp; XP. To fit&nbsp; is not cost effective .</p>
<p>An example&nbsp; would be Intel cpu chips and the related software .</p>
<p>Cpu chips : 4 bit , 8 bit, 16 bit,32 bit, 64 bit and&nbsp; coming 128 bit or higher .</p>
<p>Op. sys. : ms.dos ..... 3.1.....95...98,98se ......2000 ,mill......vista, 7 , 8 ..... and ?</p>
<p>The jump from 98 to 98se was sort of what you are talking about with XP.</p>
<p>But that did not last long either .</p>
<p>Would anyone want to drive a model t Ford (no mater how nice it looks ) on todays</p>
<p>super highways ?&nbsp; Not me ,too slow and too&nbsp; much&nbsp; danger .</p>
<p>How about using a rotary&nbsp; cell phone instead of&nbsp; a&nbsp; modern touch screen one .</p>
<p>Both take one finger to use .</p>
<p>SP.4 for XP would have been a good idea before Vista came out. But Vista too is obsolete and
</p>
<p>even Win 7 is showing its age .</p>
<p>And all that is just my two bits .</p>

<h2>            FreeCell - Get Win 7 version for Win 10</h2>
                    <p>After using many versions of Windows for decades, I just ended 7 years with Windows 7. I now have Windows 10 on my PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an uber-compulsive FreeCell player, but the Win10 version sucks. It takes 5 clicks to get into it (I refuse to register or upgrade). The graphics are difficult on the eyes. The whole experience is a drag.<br />
<br />
I want the Windows 7 FreeCell on my Windows 10 machines. How can I get it? How can I get it for free?</p>

            Hi Len
<br />
<br />That will be no problem, you can download the installer for all the Windows 7 games form the link below, they work perfectly on Windows 10, don't worry, those are totally free . . .
<br />
<br />When you download the installer, keep it, because it may not be available in the future . . .

</p><p>i cant turn on my task scheduler, which means i cant update nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>Have tried various fixes: sfc scan, rebooting, creating a new acount and other.</p>
<p>Whenever i try start the service it says: "<strong>Task scheduler service on Local Computer&nbsp;</strong><strong>started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs"</strong></p>
<p>P.s. windows is in my native language but that doesnt change anything:(&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)"><b>This challenge can be a pain, but its doable. The easiest way to complete this challenge if you aren't too familiar with Shang Tsung's combos, is to back up to a corner, and spam his
 projectile attack (Back, Back, X). This will get Baraka and Sindel out of the way pretty quickly. The only issue is that sometimes Baraka will shoot a projectile, and it may hit you. If this happens, move in quick and do the Soul Steal move (Forward, Down,
 Forward, A.) doing that will restore a portion of your health, which is important for fighting Shao Khan.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)"><b>Once you make it to Shao Khan, you can do the same thing as above, spamming Shang Tsung's projectile attack. When Shao Kahn throws his hammer, jump over it, and when he throws his spears
 block them. If you spam him quick enough, he will not have a chance to charge you. If he does, jump kick over him, and make your way to the next corner and begin spamming him again.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)"><b>That's the way a lot of people have been doing it, it would be better to learn Shang Tsung's combos, and pick which combos suit you best, but, using the projectile method, you should
 come out on top.<br />

<p><span>I went at this challenge for a long time. honestly +- 8 Hours of FAIL in total, &nbsp;and only realized I could skip levels when a got to level 300 :|<br />
so if you're not great at combos and have the worst luck too, maybe this can help:<br />
<br />
<strong><span><span style="color: rgba(117, 180, 54, 1)">BARRAKA:<br />
don't jump towards him, he'll just do his spin blade thing.<br />
</span></span></span></strong><span>stay close, block and throw if possible. (throwing opponent heals you by like 7%, not much but helps :P)<br />
</span><span>then fire balls when hes at a distance. he usually fires as you do, so this does'nt really help, better to get close and trow constantly.<br />
</span><strong><br />
SINDEL:<br />
</strong><span><br />
When I played, she was always cornering me with combos, sweep attacks usualy help when you can get them in.<br />
</span><span>I can never land a throw on her not sure why.<br />
</span><span>jump attacks to combos like Back +X,Y,X,B - Back ,Back X (fire ball) have helped a lot.<br />
</span><strong><br />
SHAO KAHN:<br />
</strong><span><br />
As he appears after dodging the first attack, try successfully X-ray him. he almost always bocks it.<br />
</span><span>Don't let him corner you... spam fire balls from a distance.<br />
</span><span>When he does get close, make sure to jump over him and try the combo mentioned above.<br />
</span><span>blocking his attacks help, for that split second you need to attack while he recovers...<br />
</span><span><br />
Level 251 was the hardest one for me, second hardest was fighting the Goro army - level 275... all levels after are lame in comparison. GL

<p>In my opinion, this was the hardest Challenge in the Tower.&nbsp; Took me well over 50 tries and really helped me learn some elegant ways to swear rather loudly.</p>
<p>Follow the tips above and keep trying.&nbsp; Mainly spamming Skulls and Enhanced Skulls whenever you can will eventually get you through.</p>

<p>challenge 300 is pissin me off can't get past kintaro who is after that anyway shao khan??</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I actually found Challenge 300 to be rather simple, surprisingly.&nbsp; I used Scorpion and you fight Goro, Kintaro, Mileena, and Shao Khan.&nbsp; You can watch videos for tips, but mostly it's learning the AI's patterns.</p>
<p>You should be able to jump over Goro and to a three hit combo.&nbsp; Wash, rinse, repeat with some Spears for fun, and you'll likely be able to top him with at least one Flawless Victory.</p>
<p>Kintaro was even easier.&nbsp; You can try the same patter or keep your distance trying to bait him into doing his Teleport Stomp.&nbsp; As soon as he jumps for the stomp, count to 1 and then jump backwards and kick.&nbsp; If you time it right, you'll knock him right out
 of the air.</p>
<p>Many people have said that Mileena is the hardest of the four opponents; I never lost to hear once.&nbsp; Turtle down and counter what she does; Spears and combos with creative use of Teleports will wreck her.</p>
<p>Shao Khan was the hardest for me.&nbsp; Keep your distance using Hell Fire and Teleports to get close when he's vulnerable.&nbsp; Spear him and combo or Spear him and press Front Punch, Front Punch, and then another Spear followed by another combo or Uppercut.&nbsp; Save
 an X-Ray for him too.</p>
<p>Keep trying, and if you have to restart the match about 5 times or so, you'll start getting health back before a new opponent or so.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>God I hated this one. Pretty sure this one took me longer to beat than it did for 300. You can try using a quick basic combo but I found it was best to just spam fireballs. I know it is cheap and unsophisticated but it is the way to go. With Shao Kahn just
 make sure to avoid his hammer throw as that move will mess you up. If you can land the soul steal because it boosts your damage and replenishes a small amount of health which can mean the world in &nbsp;the fight with Shao Kahn.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 kernel memory leak&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Windows 10 the system process (kernel) memory usage starts at 50M and after 2-3 days reaches 700M and then system starts to become unstable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it the kernel itself or some driver or 3rd party module? How can I determine the cause (if there is a method)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I observed that suddenly after 2-3 days my PC goes to sleeps and wakes up every 3-5 minutes. This might or might not be related to the kernel problem though.</p>

    <title>Unable to print to network printer with Windows Firewall blocking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to print to network printer with Windows Firewall blocking outbound connection by default</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I just installed a network printer.&nbsp; The PC is on a private network.&nbsp; The printer is Brother printer and it connects to the router via wireless LAN.<br />
<br />
With Windows Firewall allowing outbound connection by default, I can print to the printer.<br />
<br />
However, if I change it to block outbound connection by default, I can no longer print to it.&nbsp; I've already enabled everything in the predefined group of Core Networking, and File and Printer Sharing.<br />
<br />
In the task manager, only one exe is from Brother's installed folder.&nbsp; I've already enabled one special rule for it and Brother status monitor now shows the correct status of the this printer.
<br />
<br />
How can I find out what rule do I need to set?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Answer appears to be simple.&nbsp; The print spooler service (C:\Windows\System32\spoolsv.exe) needs to be added to the outbound exception.&nbsp; I am just surprised this is not in the File and Printer Sharing group.<br />

            Hi Steve.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting traffic.dll file is missing while playing Flight Simulator 2002. This issue can be caused due to any of the following issues:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You may be using an outdated or corrupted video driver </li><li>System files on your PC may be corrupt or mismatched with other files </li><li>You may have a Virus or Malware infection on your PC </li><li>Some applications or services running on your PC may be causing Windows Explorer to stop working&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Try the methods provided below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Occasionally, malware will attempt to masquerade as </span></span></span>kernelbase.dll<span><span><span>. I strongly recommend you run an scan on your computer to see if there are any threats on your computer that are potentially corrupting
</span></span></span>kernelbase.dll<span><span><span>. </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to run a full scan using <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> (MSS) to make sure that the Computer is virus free.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(46, 116, 181, 1)"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The issue, generally arise due to .DLL file corruption in Windows settings. So, in order to scan your system health, I would suggest you to run a System File Checker tool (SFC) scan to check for any files corruption:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows 8.</span></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Account Password in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcthoma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account Password in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hallo,</p>
<p>I upgraded from Win8.1 to Win10 and from office 2010 to 2013. Therefore a Microsoft account was created automatically with an Hotmail email address.</p>
<p>I want to change the password but Windows 10 asks a security code. To get this code I must indicate an email address starting with "ei".</p>
<p>
</p><div>--&gt; Before you can access sensitive info, you need to verify your identity with a security code. How would you like to receive your code?
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>To verify that this is your email address, complete the hidden part and click "Send code" to receive your code.</div>
<div>

</div>
<div><span>@pt.lu</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I introduce ma own email address I get this error message:</span></p>
<p><span>That doesn't match the alternative email address associated with your account. The correct email address starts with "ei".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also tried&nbsp; the answer of Tyler Carlson (04.08.2015) to the question of DB003(30.07.2015) in order to delete the password startup. But that didn't work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can someone help.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Can someone please help.</span>Marc Thoma</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>But it did not really work. In order to reset the password I was asked for a security code, that I don't have.</p>
<p>To get one I hat to introduce an alternate email address starting with "ei".</p>
<p>It's the same problem that I had before.</p>
<p>I marked 'I don't have this' and submitted a request (with a lot of details) to MS.</p>

</p><p>Everything was fine last night but one of the computers did windows updates this morning and is now not visible on the network. I've checked that network discovery is on, I've tried disabling the firewalls on the private network. I honestly have no idea
 what else to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            Hi Tomas.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Lots of networking problems following Version 1803 Update recently.  
<br /> 
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
