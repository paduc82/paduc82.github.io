<h2>            Excel Pivot Table&#58; Default Sum in Pivot Table Value</h2>
                    I do multiple Pivot Tables every day and always Sum the numbers. &nbsp;It would be helpful if it defaults to Sum when bringing in a Value.

<h3> bsh53  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add existing mailing label formats to Word 2010  list&#63;</h2>
                    I have a set of label templates (Word 2003) which I use several times a year in different contexts. They are provided by the label manufacturer Esselte-Dataline and do not appear on the list of label options offered by Word 2010. Where can I store these
 templates (converted to 2010 format if necessary) so that they appear on the standard list?<br />

            <p>Yes, as it turns out, to my surprise, Cancel does exactly what you want:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document based on the template. </li><li>On the Mailings tab, in the Start Mail Merge group, click Start Mail Merge and choose Labels.
</li><li>The Labels dialog will open, but don't choose anything, just click Cancel; miraculously, this will change the merge type to Labels using your existing document (if you use the Mail Merge Wizard, I believe there is an explicit option to "Use current document").
</li><li>You can then select&nbsp; your data source and&nbsp;insert merge fields in the first label as needed, and the Update Labels button will be available for propagating the fields to the other labels.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Lynne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not receiving an email from a specific email provider may be caused by either your email account settings or the sender's email account setting. Another possibility is the method you're using to access your email account. To resolve your concern, kindly
 answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you still able to receive emails from other senders?</li><li>Have you tried to send a test email to your account and verify if the same issue occurs?</li><li>Have you tested your friend's email account if they can send emails to anyone else?</li></ul>

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My response in order to your questions are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am able to receive emails from other senders. Am also able to receive one contact who uses Yahoo.</p>
<p>Test mail comes through since I use Outlook with Road Runner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tech support yesterday and entered email addresses to approve Junk File list. Ask contacts to send me an email to see if it would come though from her Yahoo account. I have not received a&nbsp; message from her and assuming it did not come through.</p>

<p>The one person has consulted their support for Yahoo and they tested her Yahoo program and couldn't find any problems. Had her email directly to Road Runner and it didn't go through. I'm suspecting the problem may be with Road Runner even though I have these
 people listed as approved senders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate everyone's help. I have gotten more emails from a couple of other people who use Yahoo. As a note, my cousin from whom I get her emails with her using Yahoo, uses the older version of Yahoo and hasn't upgraded her account. Don't know if this
 helps. Just thought I would mention it.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing the current status of your concern. Since we were able to isolate the issue further and other Yahoo email account users are able to send you emails, we recommend that you further test if the main cause of the concern is with road runner.
 Also, you can contact the support of road runner to further get suggestions on how you may resolve your concern since on our end everything checks out.</p>

    <title>Archive file exceeds maximum size - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graham_f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Archive file exceeds maximum size - </h2>
                    
<p>I running Office 2007 under Windows 7.&nbsp; I was archiving e-mails when a message appeared that the archive file exceeded the maximum allowed and recommending I delete entries but as the file is no longer capable of being opened from outlook I can't do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 File size is shown in explorer as 2,627,081 KB.&nbsp; Sadly the archive operation didn't cancel / backup first or give any warnings before it failed (OK so I'm an optimist).</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have tried scanpst.exe but this fails in the repair stage however I am able to open and view the content of the 'too large' file with an PST Viewer 'Kernel Outlook PST Viewer.exe'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to temporarily increase the max size to allow me try and
 open this in Outlook and clear some of it down?&nbsp; Any other suggestions would be most welcome.</p>

<p>Was this archive file created in Outlook 2002 or older and simply brought forward? Older versions of Outlook have a PST size limit of 2 GB.</p>
<p>Ideally you would have wanted to create a new archive file when you upgraded and simply copied everything in from the old file.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>

            I ran this and the the /scanos found the install location, fixMBR was fine, the fixBoot &amp; rebuildBCD otoh returned Element not found.&nbsp; Will try to do an install instead and see what happens.. Now attempting a custom install to see what happens.. Hopefully
 KrazyCats is right and I won't need to use a product key later (repair and upgrade options didn't work)&nbsp;

<h2>            Missing &#34;Everyone except External&#34; or &#34;External&#34; user&#47;profile from sharing option in SharePoint Online sites</h2>

<p>Now, I'm unable to add again. When I type "Everyone" in the share user name, it returns an error message as shown in the screenshot. Am I missing something obvious?</p>

<p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my tests, I couldn't reproduce the same behavior by following your description. I would appreciate it if you could provide me more details about how this happened, so that we could do further tests and investigation for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, to check whether this has affected other site collections and for further assistance, please also try checking other site collections and see if the "Everyone except external users" group still exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back if there is any update and let us further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

            Hi Tom,
<br />Do you have Outlook desktop software? The easiest way to move the mail is to add both accounts to Outlook, exporting from Hotmail to a pst then import to the new account.  If you are only moving some mail, you can drag and drop between accounts or use the Move to folder command and select a folder in the godaddy mailbox.

            The only export method is for the entire mailbox (In Settings, General)- to a pst file, which can only be opened by outlook. It's been a while since i tested godaddy's offerings, so i don't know if they offer pst import.

<p>If so, why isn't there rich presence messaging built in, to support collaboration between Windows users?</p>
<p>MacOS has this in iMessage. Surely it can't be that difficult for Microsoft to at least match this.</p>
<p>How much money do you really make from Lync? </p>

<p>It would offer business a real reason to upgrade from Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Out of office on 1 year. How do I set OOO to every email recieved</h2>
                    <p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if this has been solved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At our office, workers go on extended leaves, to get educated, on maternity leave, sick leave etc and are not able to set their email accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We receive hundreds of email and it is really caused us a lot of problems that each sender only receives an out of office reply once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-They do not remember 3 months down the line that the person is on leave for a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I arrange an Out of office reply for ever single email received, regardless if the sender has sent multiple times before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Birgitta</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When had the issue first occurred?</li><li>What is the name displayed when the recipient received your email messages?</li><li>Does the issue occur on a specific recipient?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes before you encounter the issue?</li></ul>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is only from the past 2 days.</p>
<p>I had the name as a person name upon signing up for the account, since then I have changed this to the name peachy produce (which is what I want recipients to see when receiving mail) .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after editing name and saving, it now displays peachy produce, but mail to all recipients are still showing email is from the person's name which I changed it from 2 days ago.</p>
<p>I assumed it may have took a while to update but still today it is not showing peachy produce in recipient email..</p>
<p>This happens to all known recipients ivr sent mqil to and no changes other than editing the name have been made on the account..</p>
<p>

                    <p>Since "Finance.Yahoo" no longer provides the option to pull their data, has anybody come up with a 'free' way of importing stock prices?&nbsp; (i.e. current price w/ auto-updates at some defined period; or even the prior day's close at

I have only ever contacted nokia help on 2 occassions and both times I have felt fobbed off. Now why cant you answer if the phone is compatable to Trutones, and what does this SUBSCRIBE TO PACKET DATA FIRST mean. I am getting nowhere with this and it is driving
 me to distraction, o2 have been of little help and now I feel let down by you, surely it cant be that difficult a question. Can it?????<br />

            Hi Technoman!<br />
<br />
Petrib is correct, I can also confirm for you that the 6030 does not support truetones. This phone only supports Polyphonic(MIDI) and Monophonic (.nrt) ringtones.<br />
<br />
A truetone is an .awb file, which unfortunately is not supported on the 6030.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            Thanks Karim for the additional info and the good news is i can now download polytones. Bonjourno, tone provider for 02 say that some 6030s can download Truetones (could this be a software upgrade issue so brand new phones , not older stock may work?)
 i dont know but thanks to all those who have contributed to this query.<br />

<h2>            Imported dates through sql not recognized as dates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm importing data to Excel through a sql query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dates are not being recognized as such (when I filter the column I don't get the year/month grouping) at the moment of import but if I select a cell and click "Enter" then the date format is recognized. This is happening regardless of the date format in
 the query (e.g. 2015-09-20 or 09/20/2015)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Excel will automatically format dates depending upon the data type it is given in the result set of the SQL query. it appears that in this case the date is being delivered to Excel as text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easy thing to do is to make <a href="http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/2011Relational22Queries.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
calculated columns </a>do the work of converting the text into Excel Dates. If your date comes through formatted as text&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">09/20/2015 you can use the DATEVALUE worksheet function in a calculated field to turn
 the text into a date number that can be formatted as a date.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t watch YouTube anymore&#63;</h2>
                    I recently got a Windows Phone for Christmas and it worked splendidly - up until now.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever I try to open up a YouTube file to play a video, it simply gives me "Sorry, we can't play this file on your phone." I haven't touched the phone or played around with it during the time this happens and it only seems to fix itself about 3 hours
 after the problem starts. I really do not want to have to wait 3 hours in order to enjoy YouTube so how can I remedy this?</div>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I am frequently coming across this problem. To short it out I removed all extra applications installed and started afresh. I did update (Windows Update). It was all fine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Then I installed Chrome Browser. Then also it was downloading unto 11% and due to power cut ,the download did not continue. Now when I started windows update it failed and it is showing error code 0x80246017/.Even Uninstall Chrome
 did not help, It is an update from Technical preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
