<h2>            File History Windows 10</h2>
                    I just discovered that File History only records closed files and not ones that have only been saved.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm used to working on a file for some time saving it regularly but not closing it.&nbsp; Is there a practical way to have windows close and reopen screens
 on some kind of a schedule in place of remembering to close files and then looking for them to reopen, especially if other files are worked on in the interim?

            Hi Steve.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />File History and Windows file and image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  I suggest using a better backup like the experts's choice free Macrium for both file and System image backups to external, then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.
<br />
<br />  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:

<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <pre>File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Details:
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time. If you still want something a bit more user-friendly, then check out EaseUS Todo Backup Free.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Not able to preview all pictures in Windows Explorer.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 on a new Surface Pro 6, i7, 16GB, 512GB<br />
When I open File Explorer Pictures folders, it takes, sometimes hours, before Thumbnails display in preview.&nbsp; In some folders none display, in others only some display.&nbsp; I've noticed when I select a folder some preview thumbnails actually flash on the real
 image just for an instant then instantly revert to the file type icon.&nbsp; I may open that same folder hours or days later and more of the thumbnails are displayed.&nbsp; All files seem to open properly.&nbsp; I have tried different combinations with no solution.&nbsp; This
 problem might be related to OneDrive, which is new to me?</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Ran DISM (reported no errors) and Scannow finished and required a reboot which loaded an update.&nbsp; Funny thing now, more Picture Images show in some of the folders than did before, but there are still holes and some folders only are showing icons, not thumbnails.&nbsp;
 I also noticed if I drag one of the ones that was displayed with an icon instead of a thumbnail, while I am dragging it I get the thumbnail image.&nbsp; Also if I drag one to my desktop it displays with the thumbnail.&nbsp; Also if I click-click-click-click rapidly
 on the folder on the left, the icon images in the preview area flash with the thumbnail.<br />
<br />
I drug one icon to my desktop and it stayed an icon.&nbsp; When I drug it back to it's folder it displayed as a thumbnail.&nbsp; Sample:</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<p>I realize this would be a way to confirm an issue.&nbsp; I'll live with the problem until I have the time to do a complete repair, too many programs to replace.&nbsp; I've also found that if I open every other picture and close it again, nothing happens until I leave
 the folder and return.&nbsp; When I return those that I opened have the thumbnails now.&nbsp; And it seems more folders are updating by themselves with the thumbnails.&nbsp; I still think it is related to OneDrive somehow.&nbsp; I may just shut that down later just to see.&nbsp; Thanks

            Its kinda hard to tell, especially with Windows 10 since MSDN keys themselves are identified as full retail keys. Microsoft doesn't really provide keys any more as part of purchase, what you get now is a digital license. 
<br />
<br />No third party apart from Amazon is permitted to sell licenses with a key. So, any online merchant claiming to sell keys, is likely selling an MSDN key. Also, OEM System Builder licenses are not sold as digital downloads. Your best course of action is to purchase directly from Microsoft to be safe always.

            Well, one way you might be able to tell is by testing the key on Microsoft's Software Download page. The Software Download Page doesn't accept MSDN keys for download. 
<br />
<br />But thats after you have the key:
<br />

<p>I was called a cheater on a Bad Company board for wanting to boost achievements via boosting methods. Is boosting cheating or not? &nbsp;I know people defend it. &nbsp;Please give a case where it is not cheating or cheating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't understand, you consider playing a game online with friends boosting? just having fun messing around playing with your close personal friends is a "cheap tactic"?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i suppose if you meant a group of friends were organized and dominating the session, as in they filled the most player spots, and killing each other in some kind of pattern or organized fashion, then yeah, that could easily be considered boosting and perhaps
 even cheating in a way.</p>

<h2>            Access denied when backing up over my home network</h2>
                    I have only one computer running Windows 7 Professional. I'm trying to&nbsp;preform weekly backups over my home network using Windows backup feature. I have an external&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;plugged up to my Linksys E3200 router via the USB port.&nbsp;I was able to network
 map the ex. hard drive so I can access it through the My Computer folder without any problems. It didn't prompt me for any&nbsp;credential when I was mapping the drive and I have no problems transferring music, pictures, etc. without any problem but when use the
 Windows backup feature, I get an access denied. When setting up the Windows backup feature, I can see the hard drive in the "Save on a network" &nbsp;option and it allow me to pick it for my backup location. It ask me for network credential and I put in my user
 name and my password and click OK. I pick what I want backed up from my computer&nbsp;and click save/exit. The backup start running and after like 5 minutes or so, it pops an error saying "Access is Deni

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Is User Account Control (UAC)&nbsp;enabled when backing up?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>To disable UAC, try the steps in the link provided.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Turn User Account Control on or off</span></b></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Then try again to back up and see if you can now backup or if you are still getting an access denied.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable security software and check if the issue persists, refer the links.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Note: Re-enable it after the troubleshooting is performed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            I disabled my UAC and I still got the same error message and I disable my AVG's firewall and I still got the same error. AVG Internet Security 2011 doesn't&nbsp;interfere with my online backup; so I know it isn't AVG. What can cause the "Access is&nbsp;Denied"&nbsp;error?
 What else could be used as the network credential? Windows said use your computer's account username and password and I only have one user account on my Windows machine with a very simple password.

            Okay, I did a clean clean boot meaning that nothing was running. All the services and start-up items were disabled, even my AVG Internet Security 2012. Ran the backup and I still got the same "Access is Denied". I know somebody out there had this problem
 and know a fix for it.

<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on&nbsp;<b>Owner tab in Advance Security Settings</b>&nbsp;for User windows</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;<b>Edit Button and select user</b>&nbsp;from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list then, click on other users or groups.
 Enter name of user/group and click ok. You can even click on administrator here, if you are logged in as an administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select User/group and click apply and ok. (Check “Replace owner on sub containers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder)</span></p>
<p><span>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed</span></p>
<p><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span> Now Owner name must have changed</span></p>
<p><span>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click&nbsp;<b>Ok to exist from Properties</b>&nbsp;windows</span></p>
<p><span>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have&nbsp;<b>taken the ownership of file or folder</b></span></p>
<p><span><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span>Grant Permissions to everyone (or your user account) -<br />
a. Go to C: and then click&nbsp;<b>right click</b>&nbsp;on folder and choose&nbsp;<b>properties<br />
</b>b. Then go to&nbsp;<b>security</b>&nbsp;tab and click&nbsp;<b>Edit</b>&nbsp;then click&nbsp;<b>Add</b>&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;<b>Advanced<br />

            It didn't work but I'm not going to worry about it anymore; I signed up for Carbonite online backup service. You get unlimited storage for one computer for $59.99 a year. That solves my backup problem.

            Thanks for the information.&nbsp; I know how to change the font on outgoing messages as I compose them but what I want to do is change my default Tools &gt; Options &gt; IM so that I don't have to change it every time&nbsp;I compose a message.&nbsp; There is no way to add
<em>Italics</em> in the options; my question is can it be done through changing a registry key?&nbsp; If so, what do I need to change?

            Thank you for the update; I've been MS certified and worked with the various technologies long enough to know that you can do almost anything you want in the registry.&nbsp; So while I have no choice but to accept the answer I don't believe it!&nbsp; They may not
 want to release that information, but I'm sure it is possible.

Thanks for the reply 10crackers, but I've tried renaming the installshield file to installshieldold. There's no change, and the folder is created again in the same location during install, and it gives error.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another solution I came across was to download an installshield version. I tried the 2010 sp1 version (my system is sp2).But again no change. Will such a thing solve the error (if I try with the sp2 version if any)<br />
<br />
Also, I tried renaming the installshield information folder, but this too dodn't help. Any idea how to solve it?

Thanks Nirmal, but the problem is I run on Win XP SP2, and can't afford to change to SP3. A version of this is available for SP2? :(

<h2>            Keyboard problems when upgrading to DELL Studio 1735 to Windows 8.1 Enterprise</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DELL Studio 1735 laptop and I have upgraded OS to Windows 8.1 Enterprise edition (64 bits).</p>
<p>Now integrated keyboard is not working properly.&nbsp;Alt Gr key doesn't work combined with other keys (for example Alt Gr + 2 for @ key). Previously was working fine with Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell doesn't have drivers for Windows 8/Windows 8.1 for this laptop model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Alfonso,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may face this issue if drivers are not compatibility with Windows 8.1. For the system model Dell Studio 1737. Dell only provides Windows 7 and Windows Vista compatible drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/studio-1737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/studio-1737</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> You can try installing the Windows 7 Keyboard drivers in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would suggest you to follow these steps and try to update the inbox drivers which comes with Windows 8.1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.)</p>
<p>b. Enter “<strong>Device manger</strong>” without quotes in the search box.</p>
<p>c. Tap on <strong>Device manager</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Right Click on the device &amp; Select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</p>
<p>e. Select <strong>Browse my computer for a driver software</strong>.</p>
<p>f. Select <strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong>.</p>
<p>g. Select the driver option according to your device model and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists you need to contact the computer manufacture website for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions in order to understand the issue better. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you able to find Calendar and People app?</li><li>How many user account have you configured on the computer?</li><li>Do you remember making and changes on the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may face this issue due to recent changes made on the computer. If you are unable to locate the Mail app in Windows 8/Windows 8.1, the chances are that you might have accidentally unpinned its icon from the Start screen. If this is the case, you can
 hover mouse to the bottom left corner of the window while you are on the Start screen and click on down arrow and see if you can find Mail app. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Since your computer was working fine yesterday. I would suggest you to perform a system restore to an earlier date when you and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press <strong>‘Windows key + R’</strong> key to open <strong>‘Run’.</strong></p>
<p>b) In the ‘<strong>Run</strong>’ type ‘<strong>rstrui</strong>’. Click ‘<strong>OK</strong>’ to bring the ‘<strong>System Restore’</strong> interface.</p>
<p>c) Following the steps as mentioned in the interface to restore the computer to a previous point.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: If issue persist, Here is how you can reinstall the Mail app if it has been uninstalled from the Windows 8/Windows 8.1 computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; Log on to the Windows 8/Windows 8.1 computer with the administrator account.<br />
b.&nbsp; On the Start screen, click the Store tile.<br />
c.&nbsp; On the opened Store interface, in the search bar in the right, type Mail. <br />
d.&nbsp; From the displayed list of related apps that are available in the Store, click Mail, Calendar and People. On the opened Store interface, in the search bar in the right, type Mail.
<br />
e.&nbsp; From the displayed list of related apps that are available in the Store, click Mail, Calendar and People.<br />
f.&nbsp; On the Mail, Calendar, and People window, click the Install button from the left, and follow on-screen instructions to reinstall the Mail app on Windows 8/Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Also refer to the link: </strong>Why can't I find or install an app from the Windows Store?<br />

<li>Open the Windows Store.</li><li>Left click or swipe from the top, and click/touch Your Apps.</li><li>In the top left change Apps Not Installed On This PC to Apps Installed On &lt;Name Of Device&gt;.&nbsp; This is because the store

<h2>            IMPORTANT&#58; How to Contact Xbox Support or Have Them Call You&#33;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>UPDATED!</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello there, A LOT of people find themselves having issues that may only be fixed by Microsoft Support, so with that being said I would like to share a step by step tutorial on how to Contact Microsoft or setup a Call Back</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>To start&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click Here</a></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Click the category related to your problem</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Click "See Contact Options"</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Click on the related problem from the selection</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>This will show you an approximate fix for your problem, alternatively, click "Show Contact Options"</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Once clicked you may choose between "Chat with Xbox Support" and "Request a Call from Support"</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Fill in required information and you'll be on your way to fixing your issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>With this method not ALL issue are&nbsp;able to be solved this way in ALL regions. Some issues may give you the option to "Message with an Xbox Gamer" (which will pair you with another gamer), in cases where your issue leads you to the
 forums it will hopefully be solved by either an <em><strong>Ambassador</strong></em> or a
<em><strong>Microsoft Agent | Moderator</strong></em>. In cases that your issue leads you to "Chat with Xbox Support" or "Request a Call from Support",
<em><strong>Xbox Support</strong></em> will do their best to ensure your issue is solved.</p>

            <p>A file that is necessary for the uninstall routine to work appears to be missing.&nbsp; There are 3 ways to deal with this problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Reinstall the program (this is what the error message means by "obtain a new copy").&nbsp; This should replace all the files needed for an uninstall.&nbsp; Then uninstall the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Use Revo Uninstaller:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>&nbsp; The free version -- at the bottom of the page -- should be sufficient.&nbsp; If the free version is unable to remove the program, you can try the more aggressive options available in the free
 trial of the "Pro" version.&nbsp; I have not recently downloaded/installed Revo; as with all free software, pay attention during the installation process and UNcheck any pre-checked options to install unwanted "tag along" products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Just ignore the program.&nbsp; Unless you are in dire need of disk space (in which case, you're probably in the market for a larger hard drive), don't worry about it.&nbsp; If you like, delete the shortcuts to the program from your Desktop and/or Start Menu.</p>

<h3> blakebit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backwards compatibility</h2>
                    <p>why isnt mechassault backwards compatible yet? If im correctmicrosoft still owns the rights to distribute that game franchise. Much like adding the original star wars battlefronts to the xbox store as backwards compatible, why not add mechassault 1 and 2?
 This series is very important to me, and it would be amazing to see it return, many others would agree that they would be happy to be abke to play mechassault again.&nbsp;<br />

<p>This video on youtube probably explains it the best and how hard it actually is to emulate the 360/OG xbox games&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not make this video it was one that I actually found and thought it was a good understanding of why not all 360 games are backwards compatible.</p>

            As far as I understand the backward compatibiulty will rely on the developer and not the distributor even if this is a Xbox exclusive, also as I understand PGI has the license for this franchise until 2020 as Mechwarriors, correct me if I'm wrong

<p>Device Pairing Error: Windows cannot complete the current operation.&nbsp; The following error code occured [80004002].</p>
<p>Hello, I am running Windows Vista Ultimate and cannot initiate a search for bluetooth wireless devices.&nbsp; I have tried multiple bluetooth dongles from different manufactures and always get the same result.&nbsp; The drivers and sofware seem to install correctly
 and I can access bluetooth settings and the bluetooth icon is in the system tray, but every time i click "add a bluetooth device", I recieve the above error and windows will not look for new devices.&nbsp; I have no issues on my other win 7 64-bit machine.&nbsp; It
 appears to be a Vista issue as i use the same usb dongle on both machines.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me resolve this issue.</p>

<p>Divya R,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, but niether of these&nbsp;was able to resolve my issue.&nbsp; The fix it tool ran, but nothing was changed, and the article above did not address my specific problem.</p>
<p>Windows sees my bluetooth adapter, and it&nbsp;can be turned on and off.&nbsp; It is turned on.&nbsp; I can access bluetooth settings and "allow bluetooth devices to connect to this computer" is checked.&nbsp; The problem is when I click "add a device" within "bluetooth devices"
 or from the bluetooth&nbsp;icon in the sys tray.&nbsp; My understanding is that Windows should start a search for available bluetooth devices, but instead of searching, it only gives me the above described error.</p>
<p>Thank you for any additional help</p>
<p>JCameronIII</p>

<p>Hi JCameron,</p>
<p>The 0x80004002 error reffers to a missing interface, such as an inability to contact the Bluetooth dongle.</p>
<p>I suggest temporarily disabling your firewall software to see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>You may also want to&nbsp;disable&nbsp;your anti-virus software temporarily to see if this has an effect.</p>
<p>What is your computer brand and model?</p>
<p>If your computer came with a integrated bluetooth adapter (as most laptops do) you will want to disable it in the BIOS.</p>
<p>You may&nbsp;have&nbsp;to refer to paperwork that came with your computer to learn more about this action.</p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
 any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can e solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions.&nbsp; I tried turning off both the firewall and the Anti virus&nbsp;but it did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I use Microsoft Security Essentials for&nbsp;Anti-Virus and Window Firewall.&nbsp; I also have all updates that Windows update can find.</p>
<p>I have an HP Pavilion a1510n Desktop which came preloaded with Win XP Media Center Edition and 512MB of ram.&nbsp; I have wiped the system and done a clean install to Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit and now have 2GB of ram. There is no onboard or factory installed
 bluetooth&nbsp;adapter that I am aware of.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>Hey JC,</p>
<p>I would check to see if the dongles are Win7 compatible, just to make sure:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/</a></p>
<p>I also suggest performing a clean boot to see if a startup program is conflicting with the Bluetooth dongle/stack:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>When I plug my BT dongle in here, sometimes a device or two will show up before I search the area with the software.</p>
<p>Are you able to see any devices in the area without searching?</p>
<p>I'm curious if it's getting the error when the software tries to contact the hardware (dongle).</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is my hard drive troubleshooter and I would recommend using&nbsp;the <strong>Manufacturer's
<br />
Diagnostic Utilities </strong>and/or the <strong>Trials</strong>.<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and
<br />
be sure to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
From within Windows 8/8.1 :<br />
<br />
File Explorer (formerly Windows Explorer)<br />
<br />
Right Click the C: drive - Properties - Tools tab - Error Checking - Check
<p><br />
Windows 8/8.1 - Improve performance by optimizing your hard drive - see "To repair a drive:<br />

How to Check a Drive for Errors with "chkdsk" in Windows 8 and 8.1<br />

<br />
Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
WinKey + X (or Right Click in lower left hand corner) - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\&gt;<br />
<br />
At the above prompt type in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=c:\windows<br />
(note the spaces after c before / after w before / after \ before / )<br />
<br />
Or&nbsp;&nbsp;SFC /scannow<br />
(There is a space between C and /)<br />
<br />
How to Run the "SFC /SCANNOW" Command at Boot or in Windows 8 and 8.1<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>For even better and more efficient checking : (See above for methods to access<br />
System Recovery Options or make a Repair Disk.) &lt;- Advanced Methods</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the System Recovery&nbsp;Options&nbsp;or from a Windows 8/8.1 <br />

<br />
sfc /scannow /offbootdir=c:\ /offwindir=c:\windows<br />

<br />
Or&nbsp;&nbsp;SFC /scannow<br />
(There is a space between C and /)<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
=====================================<br />
<br />
<strong>If CheckDisk fails to complete as above :&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&lt;-- Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities.</strong>

<h2>            E drive won&#39;t recognize disks or burn onto disk</h2>
                    I have files waiting to be burned, but the message says I don't have a disk inserted, which I do. I tried inserting a disk with some files already on it, and the message says there is a problem with the disk, even though it opens and shows the files already
 there.
