<h2>            I am outlook meeting organizer but I didn&#39;t set up the meeting</h2>
                    I and my coworkers have been having this problem for over a year now and it's starting to get really hard to deal with...<br />
<br />
Sometimes when we get an invite to a meeting, we inadvertently end becoming the organizer of the meeting (so I can't accept the invite because it looks like I set it up.&nbsp; Even worse, the meeting updates from the real owner don't reflect on my calendar because
 I'm the "owner"!!).&nbsp; The only way to clear the condition is to cancel the meeting (but first be sure to delete the attendees, otherwise I end up cancelling it for everyone); then have the actual owner re-send me the invite.&nbsp; Usually this clears the condition.&nbsp;
 But often as the meeting gets updated by the originator later, I end up "owning" it again!<br />
<br />
I have tried updating my client PC from Office 2007 to 2010; but it still happens.&nbsp; The only other thing I can think of that might be impacting this is that I run the Webex Productivity Tools plugin for Office (allows me to set up webex meetings from within
 outlook).&nbsp; But it doesn't seem to matter if the meeting I'm sending has a webex in it or not.<br />
<br />
One more thing...the meeting invites are all correct on the Office web interface.&nbsp; It appears to be local to my Windows 7 client where the meeting gets corrupted in this manner.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

Windows defender <span>is for the <b>spyware and other unwanted software.</b><br />
</span><span>Security essential is&nbsp; viruses, spyware, and other malicious software</span>.<br />
<br />
Defender is <u><b>inbuilt </b></u>to windows 7&nbsp; and cecurity essential is <u><b>free for genuine windows users</b></u> and you can download it here..
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a><br />
<br />
Upon installing Microsoft security essential, Defender is turned off by default.. Because Microsoft security essential is having the same protection level for
<span><b>spyware and other unwanted software + additional security for </b></span><b><span>viruses, and other malicious software</span>.<br />
<br />
MSE is a good tool and you can check the dection ratio and comparison from </b><a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Independent Tests of Anti-Virus Software</a><b><a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

For windows xp both defender and MSE should be downloaded and installed. </b>To install it on your windows xp you must have

<p>I have a friend who is getting an update for Office 2010 which was replaced by Office 2013 a long time ago.&nbsp; In my own case, a while back, I think I also was getting redundant updates but they went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion to my friend was to do a restart.&nbsp; I see no option to "hide" an update as was available in W8.1.&nbsp; Hope you get a better answer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I am unable to complete step 1 as view all option does not exist. However I ran the troubleshooter for windows update by searching on the net, and it came up with "Service registration is missing or corrupt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing is I had already ran sfc last night as I had terrible trouble getting my machine to re boot after re installing a VPN program which had mysteriously stopped functioning correctly. I was even about to restore an image when all of a sudden after
 about third or fourth boot try it booted up ok. So I thought just to be on the safe side I would check with SFC - found no problems, until I ran it today, when it came up with the message above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I am unable to get the fast ring setting to stick - not entirely sure if windows update is actually functioning ok as it appears working but finds no updates - but maybe there has not been any for 48Hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions from here on?</p>
<p>UPDATE - just checked, windows update is not working, checked history and an update for windows defender failed yesterday. I did suspect that win update was now not working - do we need to re register service for windows update via regsrvr32 etc. Don't understand
 why sfc did not pick this up?</p>

<p>Many thanks for that - the service started ok, but still no dice with windows update etc. Will try a system restore, if not a rollback to previous build. Then hopefully I will be offered the probable new build next week?</p>

<p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>Did this happen to you just recently - last day or so, or since you had this build? Just curious?</p>
<p>Does your windows update still work ok though, as mine now does not.</p>

            <p>Thinking whether to try an over the top install of build 10147 to correct windows errors? Can you still do this as you could with older versions of Windows? I have everything set up so don't really want to do another clean install.</p>

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, can you please try the below [thanks to 	Vijay Verma]
<br />
<br />ADD-INS PROBLEMS
<br />Start in Safe Mode (Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation). 
<br />
<br />Then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in. 
<br />
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; (scroll down below up to Manage: Com Add-in) &gt; Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them 
<br />
<br />OFFICE REPAIR
<br />First try a quick repair install, If it doesn't work, please try Online Repair:
<br />

<br />
<br />FULL OFFICE UNISTALL (DIFFERENT FROM STANDARD ONE)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC and reinstall Office. Restart again and check if it works.
<br />
<br />FIX CORRUPT USER PROFILE OR CREATE A NEW ONE
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /><a href="https://neosmart.net/wiki/corrupt-user-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/wiki/corrupt-user-profile/</a> (Windows 10 and older)
<br />
<br />DEFAULT PRINTER NOT ACCESSIBLE
<br />Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow.

<h2>            32-bit program that doesn&#39;t exist&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install Microsoft Office 2016 on my laptop. The program is provided for free from my college. Everything goes smoothly until I get the pop that says "Are you sure you want the following program to make changes to your computer". I then click
 "Yes" and then I get this pop up.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7adc4957-e35a-4021-884a-a1dfca2ae717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7adc4957-e35a-4021-884a-a1dfca2ae717" /></a></p>
<p>Originally it said "Microsoft 16 Click-to-Run Exstensibility Component", so I uninstalled that, following directions from another post on this website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else do I have to do to get Microsoft office 16 to install?</p>

<p>Hi Clayton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a common issue when installing a Microsoft Office Package. As the message says, you have an existing 32-bit version and what you are trying to install is in 64-bit. It was a right step you have taken when you have uninstalled the existing programs
 that causes the incompatibility. Moving forward, we recommend that you visit the link to an article on our support site, provided on this response. Kindly look for "Install the 64-bit version of Office instead of the 32-bit version" and follow the steps. The
 link is provided here: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Troubleshoot-installing-Office-365-Office-2016-and-Office-2013-35ff2def-e0b2-4dac-9784-4cf212c1f6c2#bkmk_64bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You cannot mix 32 and 64 bit installations in the same Windows session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately that blank message is a 'known feature' in MS Speak <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8f7f3d6-154c-4260-a65c-ce8a9cc1df5b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8f7f3d6-154c-4260-a65c-ce8a9cc1df5b" /></a>("BUG" to the rest of the world). The installer can identify that there is something 32-bit Officish in the installation
 folder, but it just can't figure out what it is. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try looking through the list of programs in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features to see if you can find anything else that belongs to "MS Office". You have to uninstall all of them.&nbsp; Addons, readers Visio etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you going with 64 bit? MS still recommends 32 bit, even on 64 bit Windows. They recommend 64 bit only if you have unusually large files. Files that are approaching the 32 bit size limit, files approaching 2GB in size on the drive, or approaching
 2GB of RAM when they are open.&nbsp; This is most typically large Excel files downloaded from online sources.

    <title>Kindle error 108 on build 10547 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordontwatts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kindle error 108 on build 10547</h2>
                    <p>On my dell venue pro 8 I can no longer run Kindle on the 10547 build. It always fails with a dialog box "The application encountered an unexpected error. Please restart the application [108]."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hunting around on the web I saw a lot of occurrences of this error associated with kindle. A number of them pointed at an app trouble shooter that can be found at this download link:
</p>

<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-update/windows-8-apps-not-working/d6a77c1c-5f80-48fd-8b56-8e2ac1513953</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran it, it reported that one of the diagnostics couldn't run on my version of windows. It further reported that my "service registry" was corrupt (and that it couldn't fix it). This could be because that trouble shooter hasn't been updated to deal
 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it did fix the error. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an updated version of the app trouble shooter out there? I've had lots more problems running apps on this Dell Venue Pro 8 than any of my other win10 machines or my other insider machines. I'd love to know if the service registry is actually corrupt.</p>

<h2>            Windows Remote Assistance&#58; Request Control not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is Request Control working on Insider Previews?</p>
<p>It's not working on Current Branch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technet forums already has complaints about this:<br />
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/6fae57f2-e5f2-4bc0-b155-a1ca2f446310/windows-remote-assistance-request-control-issue-windows-10-enterprise<br />
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/b235a121-3a9c-4c80-8562-3a3fea7f9ae3/issue-with-request-control-function-in-windows-remote-assistance-msra-from-windows-7-pro-to<br />
</p>
<p>The feature is critical for help desk scenarios.</p>
<p>Without it, we can't use a native feature to interactively assist users with desktop issues.</p>

<p>The feature continues to work well on Windows 7 clients in our domain, which is configured to allow helpers to offer unsolicited remote assistance.<br />
Helpers could Request Control, which shows recipients an Approval Dialog they'd accept to allow helpers to interact with recipients' desktops.<br />
However, Request Control doesn't work on Windows 10 clients: no Approval Dialog appears, helpers can't interact with Windows 10 desktops.</p>
<p>Is anyone testing this?</p>

            <p>I recommend replacing the use of this with the new Quick Assist method when possible. Remote Assistance quit working for me when trying to help others. Quick Assist easily connects to remote users needing assistance where Remote Assistance used to always
 fail for me. I suspect that the Teredo IPv6 tunneling used by Remote Assistance is failing for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Quick Assist is only on version 1607 of Windows 10.</p>

            <p>That's bad advice.</p>
<p>Remote Assistance does a lot more than you're considering.</p>
<ul>
<li>It allow helpers to offer unsolicited assistance by making a prompt appear on the user's desktop. This makes it dead simple for a user to accept assistance. It also relieves users from opening a program which may not be easy for them or even possible under
 some troubleshooting scenarios.</li><li>It allows helpers to entirely skip security codes, which don't really make sense in a managed workplace setting where an employee should simply get help from an IT administrator with as little fuss as possible.</li></ul>
<p>Last I checked, and I'd like to be proved wrong, Quick Assist doesn't do either of these.</p>
<p>Remote Assistance should work, and works quite well in our environment on earlier Windows releases.</p>
<p>This really deserves attention.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>It's easier for me, since anyone requesting my assistance is normally separated from me by firewalls, routers and the Internet. Before I had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>get them to e-mail me a file</li><li>after stepping them through how to launch the Remote Assistance request</li><li>save the file</li><li>find the file to attach it</li><li>wait for the e-mail</li><li>launch their request on my end</li><li>and then step them through allowing my access</li><li>and then granting me control.</li></ul>
<p>If you have IPv6 connectivity, Remote Assistance can be much simpler than all that, but many ISPs do not support IPv6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Quick Assist, all I have to tell them is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to type "quick assist" in Cortana</li><li>launch it</li><li>choose <em>Get assistance</em></li><li>I tell them the 6-digit code and I am in, with shared control and access.</li></ul>
<p>I don't see the value of an "unsolicited assistance" prompt, since they are already soliciting my help and just want it with as little frustration and effort on their part as is possible. &nbsp;The 6-digit security code could not be much simpler and expires in
 10 minutes. It gives them the assurance that the person they are speaking with by phone, or other means, is who is connecting to help them. The helper also has no access if a connection is not established within that time, which should also grant some improved
 sense of privacy to the client.</p>

            <p>Unsolicited Remote Assistance is simpler.<br />
All I may have to tell them is</p>
<ul>
<li>Click yes on the prompt that appears.</li></ul>
<p>Done. I'm in.</p>
<p>It works unaided even when explorer fails to run and there's no Start Menu, which I've handled on occasion (the user and I were both astonished).</p>
<p>The lack of explorer and a Start Menu would cause an untrained user considerable difficulty to start Quick Assist, so though it requires less user aid, it still requires some.</p>
<p>Unsolicited Remote Assistance requires none in this regard.</p>
<p>None is hard to beat.</p>
<p>The prompt identifies the helper by name from Active Directory and uses Kerberos security, so there's really no point in a security code other than impeding help to a caller who's clearly asked for it on a workplace computer they don't own that I'm responsible
 for managing.<br />
Though Quick Assist absolutely makes sense in an uncontrolled environment, it's not an improvement in a managed domain configured to make Remote Assistance behave even nicer.</p>
<p>Though I wish Quick Assist could be configured the same way, Group Policies for that don't appear to exist.</p>
<p>My workplace, by the way, lacks IPv6 connectivity.</p>

<h2>            C5-00 No connection with ovi suite possible</h2>
                    
<p>Since 4 weeks I attempt to connect my new purchased mobile with ovi suite. I tried every version to connect but without success of chance to get in to ovi suite.&nbsp; I have Vista SP2 and used last release&nbsp; ovi suite 3.0.0.290</p>
<p>Each time of several installations and new set up of my PC-system I get the message from ovi suite: No device connected.</p>
<p>Also I used the correct USB-cable 101 and cable driver which has been installed on my PC during installation of ovi suite.&nbsp; I set up my C5-00 device for connection USB-PC-Suite.</p>
<p>Does every body have a advise what is to do. Never I had such huge problems with a mobile software. I suppose finally there is a software problem within of ovi suit data.</p>
<p>Would highly appreciate to get advises from Nokia support or other members.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Franz</p>

    <title>Combine or merge 6 tables in a data model for one aggregated view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabrielhaukness  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combine or merge 6 tables in a data model for one aggregated view</h2>
                    <p>I have a data model with 6 tables that are identical in their column structure. The data model uses some RELATED() functions to create calculated columns. I need the same two calculated&nbsp;columns from each of these 6 tables. The output would be in a consolidated
 view. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many things tell me to use a pivot table, but I am not seeing how I can apply that logic here as whenever I add in a column, it gets indented one level down in the 'rows' hierarchy. So this is what happens if I try and use my 6 tables with the same column
 name:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Column X table 1
<ul>
<li>Column X table 2
<ul>
<li>Column X table 3
<ul>
<li>Column X
<ul>
<li>Column X
<ul>
<li>Column X</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The correct representation needs to be a below. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Column X (table 1)</li><li>Column X (table 2)</li><li>Column X (etc.)</li><li>Column X</li><li>Column X</li><li>Column X</li></ul>
<p>What needs to happen is that the 6 tables information can be combined/merged into a single dimension so that I can then query off of that. Does anyone know how to do this within the data model?</p>

            <p>Hi Ashish, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the unclear question. Firstly, the calculated columns are occurring in the data model tables, rather than in the pivot table. You are correct in that I need to append these calculated columns from all six tables, rather than them being "nested"
 as they currently are. By nested, I mean to say that any items which are added get added in below the values of the previous column, and thereby create a collapsible +- box. Rather than being nested, I need them to be all appended on the same layer/level of
 the pivot table. </p>

            I actually found out what I needed to do was to combine and merge the 6 tables into the one they feed from using the look up function. This approach is posing a differing problem which I am posting in a new query. Thank you for your help!

 too weird. I log into my game servers and check my email, but I don't go anywhere bad except this one time I clicked a youtube link that told me to update my Adobe flash player plugin, and later found out from a friend that I shouldn't have done that and&nbsp;I
 should always go to the Adobe sight direclty. If it didn't come from there I have no clue. &nbsp;I make sure I do regular scans and keep the definitions updated. I have even gone online to the safety scanner at Microsoft, went to trend-micro and&nbsp;ran a scan with

<p><span>Yes, the malware might have disabled MSE.</span></p>
<p><span>Try these “free” on demand scanners which will not interfere with your resident AV program -
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>you might need to run them in Safe Mode or Safe Mode With Networking:</span></p>

<p><span>Go to
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.malwarebytes.org</span></span></a><span>
 and download, install, update and run the free version – just follow the prompts.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span>The prompt<span>&nbsp; </span>asks if you want to <em><span>Start&nbsp;trial</span></em> or
<em><span>Decline</span></em>.&nbsp; To get the free version (without real-time scanning or web site blocking features) you need to choose
<em><span>Decline.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></em><span>You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>

<p><span>SuperAntiSpyware

            Thanks PA for such a quick response. Lets begin.<br />
<br />
I am confirming with you that the OS is Win7 Pro SP1 64bit.<br />
<br />
1a. I scratch built this machine around April of 2009<br />
<br />
1b. I performed a clean install of the OS (OEM) bought with my HDD, but the OS currently on here is re-install #2 which was redone in July of 2010 when I installed my new M4 SSD<br />
<br />
2a + 3. I remember seeing MSE offered in the updates on my second time around&nbsp; but I had already installed Norton 360,&nbsp; so I hid the update. When that software license ran out I bought Norton Internet Security 2011. 1 month ago I removed all of the Norton Internet
 Security first and went directly to the Microsoft site and downloaded MSE. The Norton License was going to expire on May 24, 2012.&nbsp; I removed MSE&nbsp; yesterday and re-installed it thinking maybe it was corrupt but it made no difference so the install date for
 MSE is June 10, 2012<br />
<br />
2c. The current version of MSE that is installed as of yesterday is:<br />
Security Essentials Version 4.0.1526.0<br />
Anti-malware Client Version 4.0.1526.0<br />
I went to the site directly to download it. I didn't use the version I got before<br />
<br />
4a.&nbsp; Other than Norton360 and Norton Internet Security 2011, McAfee scanner was downloaded directly from Adobe by accident and then removed right away. I forgot to UN-check the box. that was around the beginning of the Norton Internet security install.<br />
<br />
5a. Yes, all 9 of those updates were installed May 12, 2012<br />
<br />
5b. Yes, all 3 of those updates were installed Apr 13, 2012<br />
<br />
5c. Yes, both of those updates were installed Mar 14, 2012<br />
<br />
5d. Yes, the first 2 were installed Feb 16, 2012<br />
&nbsp;the 3rd one was installed Jan 12, 2012<br />
and the 4th one was installed on Aug 16, 2011<br />
<br />
5e. There is no KB2544521.&nbsp; I installed IE9 on Aug 16, 2011 because Adobe Flash was unsupported at that time for IE8<br />
<br />
6. I have firefox 13.0 installed also but nothing else.<br />
<br />
7. I tested IE9 and I have version 7 update 4<br />
<br />
8. I use CCleaner from Pirform from time to time. its current version is: 3.19.1721 (64bit) and I have used driver cleaner when swapping out video cards but none of the others on your list.<br />
<br />
I hope I have answered your questions correctly.&nbsp; I thought the response back once I posted the question would take a while so I upgraded Malwarebytes from free to the trial full version thinking it might help, and I have tried a host of online scanners just
 in case such as Kaspersky TDSS Killer and the ESET Online scanner. I also used Trend-Micro Housecall Online scanner too and spybot S&amp;D 1.6<br />
<br />
Thanks PA<br />
<br />

            <p><em>Oh, my...!</em></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;After you "scratch built" the computer&nbsp;around April 2009, what Windows version did you install? [Note that Win7 was still in beta then.]</p>
<p>2. After you completed the clean install of Win7 64-bit in July 2010, how long was the computer connected to the internet
<em>or any networks </em>(i.e., other computers) before you got Norton 360 installed?</p>
<p>[<strong>Comment:</strong> Windows Update will only offered MSE to a computer as an
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2267621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Optional update</a>&nbsp;if the update engine cannot detect&nbsp;the presence of a&nbsp;<em>functional</em> anti-virus/anti-malware application (e.g., N360) on said computer. The fact that MSE
<em>was offered</em>&nbsp;very strongly suggests that (a) the computer was <em>already-infected</em> by the time you installed&nbsp;N360
<em>and/or</em> (b) N360 did not install &amp; wasn't working&nbsp;<em>properly</em> for some other reason.]</p>
<p>3a. Had your N360 subscription <em>already expired </em>by the time you replaced it with NIS?</p>
<p>[Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly.]</p>
<p>3b. Did you (a) uninstall&nbsp;N360 <em>AND THEN</em> (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool [1] &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed NIS?</p>
<p>4. Did you (a) uninstall&nbsp;NIS <em>AND THEN</em> (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool again &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed MSE?</p>
<p>5. <em>Repost: </em>In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder
</em></p>
<p>6a. Is Firefox or IE9 your default Browser?</p>
<p>6b. Are both Firefox &amp; IE9 still "hijacked" or...?</p>
<p>7. What version of Flash Player is currently installed?&nbsp; Test here using IE9 (only!) =&gt;
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/about/</a></p>
<p>8. Is Spybot Resident Tea Timer enabled?</p>
<p>9. Has Spybot and/or MBAM and/or TDSSKiller and/or any of the online scans <em>
ever</em> detected &amp; removed <em>anything </em>(<em>other than</em> <strong>Trojan.Win32.Generic!BT</strong>&nbsp;&amp; third-party tracking cookies)
<em>since you installed Win7 64-bit in July 2010?&nbsp; </em>[2]</p>
<p>10. Finally, do you have backups of ALL changes that CCleaner <em>Registry Cleaner
</em>has EVER made to your computer? [3] [4]</p>
<p>==================================================================<br />
[1] 
ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</p>
<p>[2] MBAM PRO's realtime protection is <em>NOT</em> compatible with MSE! Ditto for any other applications' realtime protections (e.g., Spybot Tea Timer).</p>
<p>[3] Your injudicious use of Registry cleaners may be playing a role here as well. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't), read

            Hey PA thanks for getting back to me so quick again,<br />
<br />
1. I think I may have my dates incorrect. I thought it was 09. I have only used this version of Windows on this computer, so It may have been early 2010.
<br />
<br />
2. I had the computer working on a wireless network with my kids computer so I could use the&nbsp; printer for both. I'm not sure how long I had it connected before I&nbsp; put on Norton 360. Maybe a week. Just a guess though<br />
<br />
3a. I uninstalled Norton 360 a few days after it expired. I also used it on my kids computer which was built a while before, so I don't think I had it on that long. I was having problems with 360 interfering with full screen games and contacted their chat service
 a few times to try and rectify it without it really making any difference, so I was not sad to see it go. I liked the silent mode on NIS2011 a whole lot better.<br />
<br />
3b. I uninstalled 360 then rebooted because it told me to, then installed NIS2011 but I was not aware of any removal tool until you just mentioned it.<br />
<br />
4. I definitely didn't know about any removal tool, so I had uninstalled NIS2011, restarted&nbsp; then installed MSE. Should I run the removal tool? or is it too late because MSE is now on the computer?<br />
<br />
5. I don't understand the re post. What am I looking at in the Microsoft Security Client folder.<br />
<br />
6a. Firefox is my default browser<br />
<br />
6b. Neither appear to be hijacked at the moment.<br />
<br />
7. I have Flashplayer version 11.3.300.257 installed on IE9<br />
<br />
8. Spy-bot Resident Tea timer is not enabled. That was not that easy to figure out, but I found it<br />
<br />
9. TDSSKiller found "Variant of Win32.Adware.Yontoo.B Application LNK/URL.B Trojan and "Variant of Win32/Adware.RegGenie" earlier today. None of the others I ran found these two weirdos<br />
<br />
10. I do not have the backups that CCleaner. I never kept any....I guess that was stupid.<br />
<br />
Note: I disabled MBAM's realtime protection and made sure it was disabled in the services.MSC also. I was unaware of the incompatibility with these different software suites as I always thought they complimented each other to offer better protection. I then
 tried to re-activate windows Defender service and Microsoft Anti-malware service in the services.MSC and they both turned on. The little green icon for MSE came back<span style="font-weight: bold">
 manually.&nbsp; I will try and use the MSE scanner and see if it picks anything up. <br />
<br />
I read the links you posted offering more information on the compatibility and registry issues for CCleaner and made sure that the MBAM and CCleaner were set to use on demand and made sure any of the administrative folders are not touched. I understand it more
 now.<br />
<br />
I guess my excessive use of alcohol in college was injudicious...I like this new word.
<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your thoroughness in solving my issue. I haven't had to think this hard in a while.
<br />
<br />
Thanks PA<br />

            <p>Hi PA,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I printed off all your instructions and I studied them thoroughly before beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed them exactly as instructed rebooting when required and so forth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When&nbsp;I got to 13. and ran the scan, MSE found nothing</p>
<p>I manually checked for updates and there were 13 important updates that I&nbsp; installed and rebooted when prompted.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate all your help so far.&nbsp; Never have I experienced someone so patient and thorough with me regarding this stuff. I have a new appreciation for people who know all aspects of this software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately everything works except I still cannot start the windows Security Center Service. The same Error pops up when I manually start it. MSE and Defender both work now and just to make sure I uninstalled CCleaner and Spybot S&amp;D. I uninstalled MBAM
 as well in case it is interfering. In the future I will only use the disk Cleanup built into Windows.
</p>
<p>If there is anything else you might be able to suggest I try, I will certainly try it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks PA</p>

<p>If MSE is installed &amp; working <em>properly</em>, Defender should be disabled. IOW you shouldn't even be able to open Defender, let alone run a scan with it.</p>
<p>Care to comment on this?</p>
<p>PS: I simply don't have time to help you check &amp; see if all of the updates the computer needs have, in fact, installed. Maybe later...</p>

            <p>My guess is that MSE and Defender are co-existing, which they should *not* be doing, as the Security Center Service which handles the communication to you via the interface and to programs requesting this status is not functioning.</p>

<h2>            Changing default text font&#47;colour for a table in an office template&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling to change the default text font/colour when a user inserts a table into a powerpoint template. The font is set correctly when inserting text boxes and when using the large text areas that powerpoint provides in it's basic slides, however when
 a user inserts a table it uses normal black font instead of the font/colour that text boxes are using. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge you can't change the default font/colour in PPT tables. If you are comfortable changing the XML, it can be done.</p>

    <title>After Upgrading to Windows 10.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hope faith  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Upgrading to Windows 10..</h2>
                    Phone is new but when i upgraded it to windows 10, the apps are working then all of a sudden, they crash. When i go back to open a certain app again,there just appears the term "Resuming..." But it never worked. My screen timeout will appear where there
 is just only a time on the screen and as I try to wake up the screen, it wouldn't. I thought it would manage itself just as my old phones do even to restart itself but it won't. I let the whole night passed hoping it would fix but it didn't. And so I ended
 up forceably removing the battery without shutting it down cause it wouldn't allow me to do so. And the same thing happens when i get to start using my phone again and i'm afraid of getting used to it because my phone might&nbsp;be damaged. What should I do to
 stop this from happening?

                    <p>I have a list box in a user form that needs to display 10 columns from a worksheet. The settings are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boundcolumn: 1</p>
<p>ColumnCount: 10</p>
<p>ColumnHeads: True</p>
<p>ColumnWidths: 45pt; 60pt;180 pt;75 pt;55 pt;55 pt;60 pt;0 pt;55 pt;45 pt;45 pt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One column needs to be hidden, so it is set to 0 pt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is no matter what I do, only 9 columns appear in the listbox.</p>

                    Silverlight corrupted. I tried to uninstall and then reinstall the program but that didn;t work. I tried using the fixme button for it, but my computoer didn;t know how to open the program. I follwed the instructions to fix it myself but it still does
 not work. Now it appears in my list of programs but is empty of data. If I try and install silverlight it says I already have that version. but under the program list it is empty and will not allow me to uninstall it. what do I do?&nbsp;

<h2>            Word screws up my screen.</h2>
                    <p>Every time I open Word, it causes a black screen across the top of my browser. I can fix that by going to and from full screen mode. However, it also affects things like Settings. (see picture) I don't even want to open Word anymore because the only thing
 I can do is restart my computer to get it to go away. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Word to no avail. What to do?</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us optimize the internet explorer and check.</p>
<p>a. I would recommend you&nbsp; to optimize the internet explorer.<br />
Refer to the article below for steps to optimize the internet explorer.<br />
<strong>How to optimize internet explorer?<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. If nothing works in resolving the issue try resetting the Internet Explorer.<br />
<strong>How to reset internet explorer?<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a><br />
Reset IE disclaimer:<br />
Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and Zone settings. Also this will clear
 browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</p>
<p>If the issue persists I would ask you to uninstall and re-install the Internet Explorer 8 and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>Hi Deshan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, are you trying to delete all of your files on your phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can perform a hard reset to clear all of your phone's content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the step:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn the phone off.<br />
2. Press and hold the power button.<br />
3. When you see the exclamation mark on the screen, press this sequence of keys:<br />
-&gt; Volume Up.<br />
-&gt; Volume Down.<br />
-&gt; Power button.<br />
-&gt; Volume Down.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Phone 8 Calendar Not Working</h2>
                    <p>The calendar app does not have the navigation buttons/icons on the bottom row. I cannot add meetings or change views.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar is currently on week view. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The live tile on the start screen is showing the meetings synced from Office 365, however, when I open the calendar app it contains no events on any day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone is a Nokia Lumia 928. The Carrier is Verizon. The software is 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions are appreciated. </p>
                </div>
