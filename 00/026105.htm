            <p>No, but are you actually having issues downloading the software or issues with activating it? Also, is this part of an MSI-based installation (one-time purchase) or an Office 365 subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case of activation issues with the first, you'll need to contact Microsoft or use the Phone Activation option. In case of activation issues with the second, you can de-activate a previous license via the Office 365 portal.</p>

            <p>Where did you get Pro Plus from?&nbsp; It is a very limited distribution bundle. But it is also a commonly bootlegged (illegally resold) bundle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most likely legal way for you to get it is through the HUP, Home Use Program.&nbsp; If your employer has a specific type of site license, then it gives you the right to buy a Pro Plus license for use at home, through the HUP. It typically costs around US$10
 (or your local equivalent). In this case, there is no limit to the number of times you can re-install and re-activate on your computer.&nbsp; Even after "upgrades" like installing a new HD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought it from an online reseller, then it is almost certainly a bootleg copy. In that case it is possible for you to "use up" your downloads. And in that case you will have to buy a new license.

<h3> naomiwolfvayne  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Server Issue - Constantly Getting &#34;No Sections in Notebook&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My online notebooks are only sporadically and intermittently loading/syncing. Sometimes I can get them to load, but then randomly they will vanish, and I'll get the message "There are no sections open in this notebook or section group."<br />
<br />
When I go to open a notebook from the web, I have the following error message<strong> "Our server is having a problem. We're working to fix it as soon as we can, so try again in a few minutes."</strong><br />
<br />
This has been going on now for several days, and it doesn't matter which computer I use (tried this on 3 different ones now, including both Windows 10 and Windows 7 and on OneNote 2010 and 2013). I don't see any server outages according to the website.&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem
 to not have any issues opening the notebooks via my iPhone app, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the notebook via the online OneDrive website, it'll work, but when I tell it to "Open in Desktop" I get error messages about the link. However, if I try enough times, it'll open, but only to vanish again moments later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help; I am immensely frustrated that I can't access my notes. Thanks!</p>

<p>Having this issue as well. Win 7 with OneNote 2010, auto-sync turned on for the notebooks.&nbsp; Exactly same behaviour as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been happening for a few days... and never seen it before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annoying as all the notebook sections automatically close, and trying to re-open says "Microsoft OneDrive: Our server is having a problem.&nbsp; We're working to fix it as soon as we can, so try again in a few minutes."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it eventually comes back, the notes do re-appear.</p>

<h3> michael nesom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access Binding Form field to table field</h2>
                    <p>I have a form which uses a calculation to produce a total the report prints out which becomes the customer receipt. The source for the table is the formula in the form to produce the total. I want the total to record in a table field but when I try to bind
 the table field to the form field there is no data source for the table and the data source for the form is the math formula to provide the calculation. I don't want the table to perform a calculation just record the end number of the total of the form</p>

            <p>Ummm...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No. You DON'T want the table to record the end number of the total.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storing a total just leaves you open to data anomalies. If one of the underlying values in the table is changed, your total will now be WRONG, with no obvious way to detect that it is wrong, or what would be right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put the same expression in the control source of a textbox on the Report and redo the calculation. Computers are good at doing calculations; that's what they're FOR. Store the underlying data and do the calculation when you need it. If the form will
 always be open to the same data when the report is printed, you could also just use =[Forms]![YourForm]![YourCalculatedControl] as the Control Source of a textbox on the Report; but it's just about as easy to copy and paste the expression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one exception would be if you have a&nbsp;<em>demonstrated</em> - not assumed! - major performance problem doing the calculation (e.g. if it's a complex multirecord total requiring a lot of disk thrashing to get the values to sum). Even then, storing the
 total should be a last resort.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You are right, I don't, which is why I designed the data base to not calculate anything in the tables but rather to do all calculations in the forms, however, Revenue Canada does need me to be able to store the totals in a table so I can calculate how much
 money I have grossed. Which is why I want the table to store the NUMBER not as a calculation but just as a number</p>

            <p>Well, you&nbsp;<em>can</em> calculate your gross from the raw data stored in your table at tax time. But I agree, it may not be practical!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, you can use a suitable Form event (such as the AfterUpdate event of a control which fills the last control needed in the calculation. Have a textbox (which can be invisible, if you wish) bound to the table field, txtStored let's say, and "push"
 the calculated value into it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub controlname_AfterUpdate()</p>
<p>Me!txtStored = Me!txtTotal</p>
<p>End Sub</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Really? Can you show me where Revenue Canada says you need to actually store the total amount of each customer receipt? I doubt if you can do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At tax time, you can easily create a query that lists the totals for each receipt and you can use that query to calculate your gross income for reporting purposes. As John said, if you store the value and the components change, then you have inaccurate data
 that will mean your tax reporting will be inaccurate.</p>

    <title>PPT 2016 - &#34;keep source formatting&#34; not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slidesorter  say:</h3>
<h2>            PPT 2016 - &#34;keep source formatting&#34; not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I've been using PPT 2016 for Windows for a few months. Recently I've encountered trouble when combining presentations. Often I get decks that are from various sources and do not use the same template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally I use "keep source formatting" when pasting. On several computers running 2016, I've pasted slides in this manner, and had white text turn black. This is hugely problematic as I work in live conference settings and receive tons of "new" slides
 at the very last minute with no time to manually fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've determined that it has nothing to do with the source or destination templates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

            <p>I can confirm this bug. I was able to duplicate this effect. It appears that the variable that is tripping up PowerPoint is not using white in a text box. It's using the
<strong>Text/Background - Light 1</strong>&nbsp;theme color in a text box. By default, that color patch is white on most themes, but if you change it to any other color it will still have the same effect: the text turns black when pasted with Keep Source Formatting.
 In the XML, this has been added to the text box text formatting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;a:solidFill&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;a:sysClr val="windowText" lastClr="000000" /&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/solidFill&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's just plain wrong for this operation. sysClr is a Windows system color and windowText is black by default on most Windows systems. That color spec can't have anything to do with either the source or destination formatting.</p>

<h2>            Subtract percentage from value</h2>
                    I need help with a formula. I'm looking to subtract a certain percentage from a number, this number varies. I would like to have the formula reference another cell, so I could change the percentage and update totals.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Example</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CellA1 = 10%</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CellB1 = 11000</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CellB2 = 1000</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My current formula in CellC1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=b1-b2</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>CellC1 = 10000</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In cell C1, how do I also subtract CellA1 to show the total as 9000 or if I decide to change CellA1 to 5% it should equal 9,500</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope this make sense.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>There is a possiblity of two warnings: </p>
<p>When you close outlook with unsent messages. This does not work well in Outlook 2010.
</p>
<p>When there is a send/receive failure. Click Show progress on the Send/Receive tab then untick the 'don't show this dialog box' option.&nbsp; The dialog will come up with each send/receive and if there is an error, you'll see it on the error tab.
</p>
<p>You will not get a dialog that says 'hey, something is wrong and the message didn't send' - you need to check the Error tab in S/R dialog or look at the Outbox message count to know if a message didn't send.

            There is no way for Outlook to alert you that items are stuck in the Outbox.&nbsp; However, Outlook is by default configured to put the number of items in the Outbox in brackets after the folder name in the Navigation Pane.&nbsp; You can easily tell there are stuck
 items if you see a value after a send/receive completes.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like you want to import the G-mail contacts into Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the section 'Import your contacts from Google Gmail to Outlook' from the following link to export the contacts from Gmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/transfer-contacts-between-outlook-and-google-gmail-HA010222048.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/transfer-contacts-between-outlook-and-google-gmail-HA010222048.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have the contacts saved in the .CSV format, import it into Outlook 365.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to import the data:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Outlook &gt; Select the Contact folder &gt; Go to File &gt; Open and Export &gt; Import &gt; Import from another program or file&nbsp; &gt; Comma sepated values (Windows or as exported)&nbsp; &gt; Browse the location of the file &gt; Select the contact folder and import the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should help you in getting the contacts into Outlook.</p>

<h2>            not displaying all messages older than 24 months</h2>
                    <p>Dear Office 365</p>
<p>I have noticed that a message at the bottom of the email folder in outlook which says, ' currently displaying messages newer than 12 months', therefore its not displaying all messages older than&nbsp;24 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>How do I change it so that the mailbox would display all the email messages that are older than 12 months, i.e. since the beginning when the email account was set up initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebuilt profile and made sure All was in cache. I need to state the mailbox is large&nbsp; 21 GB with about 450 folders. Everything can be seen on O365 but only goes backs a couple of years in Outlook desktop.</p>

            Hello. Have you tried to change the cached settings in Outlook to display messages older than 12 months?
<br />
<br />In Outlook 2016, Click File, then Account Settings, and then click Account Settings again.
<br />.
<br />Select your Exchange account, and then click Change.
<br />
<br />Move the slider for the Mail to keep offline setting to the time that you want.
<br />
<br />Note Move the slider to the All setting if you prefer to keep all of your email cached on your local computer.
<br />
<br />Click Next.
<br />
<br />In the message window that appears and states that this operation will not finish until you exit and restart Outlook, click OK.
<br />Click Finish, and then click Close.
<br />Exit and then restart Outlook.

<p>Apparently you cannot clear browsing history (e.g. Cookies) without losing your setting.&nbsp; A supposed workaround is to put such sites into Favorites, e.g. perhaps a dummy for that host name only.&nbsp; So, it sounds like you are clearing browsing history automatically
 somehow and only a couple of your entries are associated with Favorites.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I use the free version of OneNote every day, but I have noticed now that every time I were to turn on my computer, it will always ask me to sign in, even though my notebooks are already synced. After I sign in everything's fine, expect for the fact that
 all of my existing notes have this weird purple strip down the right side of it, and a "N." at the top; some of the text is highlighted, some not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I am offline, and try to open OneNote it'll simply say "Check your Internet connection and try again".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried re-syncing my notes, it has made no difference.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Natalie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your notebook is stored in the OneDrive and you can always work offline if offline. This is possible because you have a locally cached copy on your computer. Changes you make offline get automatically synched to OneDrive at the time of the next connection
 to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it sounds that you call it offline if you store your notebook only on your computer, not in the cloud. You can store notebooks locally with OneNote 2016 as in 2013, but only in a paid version, not in the free one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you have any queries.</p>

<h3> nelsonbibby  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop or cancel word or excel 2010 auto-save that is in progress&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to stop/cancel an auto-save that is already in progress? This is applicable to Word 2010 or Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not asking how to stop auto-saves from occurring on a regular basis. This is specifically about wanting to interrupt an auto-save that is in progress because it is preventing the application from responding. It is very annoying as the application when
 auto-saving completely stops responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a small red cross present in the auto-save progress bar that is present when an auto-save is in progress but this doesn't respond to being pressed because, yes you guessed it, the application isn't responding. It's as about as frustrating as the
 application presenting the "Not responding" messaging in the application window title, several seconds after it's stopped responding. Nice one developers tying up more system resources to display a message about an application not responding when I'm already
 aware of that fact BECAUSE the application isn't responding. Seriously??</p>

            Hi <strong>Nelson</strong>,<br />
<br />
Your application may not respond properly if there were software conflicts that trigger the system and causes the error. Have you made any recent changes prior to getting this issue?
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'd suggest running the Office repair tool to help determine the issue. To do this, please follow the steps listed on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Repair an Office application">link</a></strong> specifically for your
<strong>Windows</strong> version. Once done with the repair, try to check again if the issue was resolved.
<br />
<br />
For any results, just send us a reply.

<p>Hi Eileen, unfortunately unable to run the Office repair tool, I can access the change option in programs in control manager but get prompted for local admin credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think is at the root of this issue is that the offline saves folder is a local folder that is actually an offline folder sync'ed to network folder. Unfortunately I don't have sufficient access to create an actual local (C:\) folder so this is a little
 speculative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My speculation is based on the fact that the amount of time the application is unresponsive and the timing during the day when it's unresponsive during auto-saves coincides with the apparent speed of accessing/using network resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that the auto-save operations of the app are clashing with the underlying sync'ing operations related to the auto-save folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any further recommendations or suggestions that I could try that would optimise auto-saving to network folders that are paired/synced with a local offline folder copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desire to cancel the auto-save is only a crude, brute force approach to working around what appear to be network resource speed issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your assistance so far.</p>

<p>Because you're a "captive" of the corporate setup, you should take your problem to the corporate IT department. At the very least, a technician with access to the administrator password should be able to create a local folder for storing AutoRecover files.
 That should relieve the interference of network slowdowns. It's clearly in the company's interest to make sure you can do your work efficiently.</p>

            Yes that's my experience too, it seems that once the actual writing of the temp file has started all other operations are deprioritized over the all important function of writing a file that in the majority of cases won't ever be used. Not quite sure why
 the interruption of the temp file write is not allowed or demands exclusive control of the application resources. Thanks for your advice.

<h2>            Time zone in email</h2>
                    <p>I have just been reading this thread which is now locked.<br />
<br />
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/incorrect-timedate-stamp-on-received-emails-in/bf36c460-4261-43d6-ba92-b45eabc9db0b?auth=1<br />
<br />
I have a friend whose email time is adrift by -1hr - the setting for the time zone is correct within the MS email system - and the time was still adrift on a public computer,so cannot be due to the time zone setting on her own pc. How can the time zone date
 stamp be an hour adrift of the correct time if the time zone is set correctly in both the email and on the pc?</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're going to need more details in order to effectively isolate why your friend's email time zone is delayed by an hour. Kindly verify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to be certain, is it an Outlook.com email account?</li><li>Do you only use the web to access Outlook emails?</li><li>Which version of Windows do you have?</li><li>How was the email account configured as a <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/POP-IMAP-and-SMTP-settings-for-Outlook-com-d088b986-291d-42b8-9564-9c414e2aa040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">POP</a></strong></em>?</li><li>Do you have Daylight Saving Time in your region?</li><li>Does the issue apply only to incoming mails?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye for your response.</p>

            The account is hotmail.com. The access is via the web as far as I know. I am not sure which version of Windows it is - but the problem was apparent both on her laptop and at the library computers which we used,so Windows version does not seem to affect
 it.<br />
I do not know the configuration of the server. There is daylight saving time. Windows normally adjusts for this on my machines to correct the PC clock,there is no option within email to alter this as far as I know. The issue seems to be with incoming mails,as
 a test mail was sent to one of her friends whose mail was received with the correct time.

<p>The browser I think is chrome. The test mails were sent from my account and from the problem account. The user reports that the time is correct,whilst at the library.</p>
<p>I have asked her to do the same on her own machine at home.<br />
We are now both confused as to which mails were -1hr adrift,since outgoing mails to other accounts were ok,and incoming mails were not.&nbsp;<br />
I can only await further info from the user as to a condition arises where the same thing happens again.</p>

<h2>            Account hacked - Security settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account has been recently hacked couple of times, I have now recovered it but when I go to Account Settings - Security &amp; Password, I'm being asked to verify my phone number with a code. The last two digits that appear don't correspond to my mobile number,
 so obviously it has been changed. I choose the option 'I don't have these any more' and click next but it just shows a blank screen with no option to do anything. Can anybody help? I just want to delete/block that number from being used and set mine, as well
 as being able of changing my security settings.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so I was on that 30 day waiting thing to add security info to my account and in that time my account got hacked and I can't get into it now because I haven't entered another email address</p>
<p>
</p><p>I filled out the forms where you give proof that it's you and it still says I can't get in, even though I provided accurate names of my folders and previous email addresses. What am I meant to do now? I have to get into this one to get old information and
 people email addresses, etc, etc</p>

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I bought a Nokia 5800 phone last week. I want to map a remote drive to a shared folder(WEB-DAV server). I tried the same on emulator(S60 5th edition) from settings&gt;connectivity&gt;remote drive and was successful. Please let me know is this feature supported on
 device.

<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply, there is no "remote-drive" under settings &gt; connectivity in my 5800, firmware 20.0.012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it is somewhere else, but I can't find it...&nbsp; so I can not map a WebDav drive at all.</p>

    <title>Excel and OneNote 2013 Color tables mixed up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> md-rh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel and OneNote 2013 Color tables mixed up</h2>
                    <p>So I have an Excel spreedsheet embedded in a Onenote (both 2013 file types). &nbsp;My normal Excel color Table looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1a00e0b-9a49-4339-b841-245b2fc46567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1a00e0b-9a49-4339-b841-245b2fc46567" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to open the excel spreadsheet from OneNote, however, the table (which as far as I can tell) is still opening in Excel 2016 doesn't have the same table color options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ca42a24-2baa-4e11-8298-ae1fb6b45d3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ca42a24-2baa-4e11-8298-ae1fb6b45d3c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the color option I need is specifically red. &nbsp;When I try copying and pasting a table from the first Excel into the second Excel (from the red color scheme) it transposes it into orange! &nbsp;I tried making the table color scheme red manually, but although
 I can select the colors and it shows me a preview of red, when I click Ok or Apply it makes it the shade of orange again!</p>

<p>
</p><p>It should be noted that: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) this problem appears in Google Chrome and other browsers, not just in Edge;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) the page that contains the 'Internet Security Alert Code 055BCCAC9FEC' is a LATER or SECONDARY manifestation of this problem, at least for me.&nbsp; What happens FIRST is that the browser suddenly starts to attempt to rapidly download multiple files - so many
 that it eventually freezes, and then compromises the whole Windows system so that it has to be forcibly shut down.&nbsp; When the browser is subsequently reopened with the same pages as before, THEN the security code page described in the title here appears.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 A short time after that, the rapid succession of download attempts begins again.&nbsp;

    <title>Line spacing in Publisher 2013 text box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgeverrusio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Line spacing in Publisher 2013 text box</h2>
                    <p>Just added Office 2013 and seem to be having some problems with Publisher. The line spacing in the text boxes looks off. I've checked the setting through the style menu and it is set correctly. Yet when I type, I'm still getting double spaced lines. Any
 help or direction would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Try selecting the text in the text box &gt; Home tab &gt; Paragraph group and click the down arrow to see the Paragraph dialog. Note the line spacing settings. Most older versions of Publisher were set at 0 before and after paragraphs and 1 sp between lines. Many
 Pub 2013 templates now have defaults set at 1.14 or 1.19 sp and sometimes 9 pt after paragraphs. Try changing the setting to 1 sp and 0 before and after and see if that makes your spacing look better...or more normal to your eye.</p>
