                    Thanks for the reply :D. Can't find this folder called private. I dragged and dropped. The tracks worked fine till I sent it to nokia care and got the firmware and the chipset replaced. Just because the pin in the charging port broke! Lol time to hire
 people who can solder.

<h2>            Excel 2019 won&#39;t open files from older Excel versions</h2>
                    I just got a new HP Omen laptop with pre-loaded Microsoft Office for Home and Student 2019. None of the 2019 applications (Word, PowePoint, Excel) will open any of my existing files from Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007. What settings can I change
 to fix it? Thanks.

<p>I have Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019, Version 1902, Build 11328.20146 Click-to-Run. I am trying to access my files the normal way by double clicking on the file. I have also tried opening the program and using "Open Other Workbooks."&nbsp; Of course,
 some of my files are not workbooks but standard .xls files. I get various error messages like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel cannot open the file 'genericfile.xlsx' because the file format or file extension is not valid. Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file extension matches the format of the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel - We found a problem with some content in 'genericfile.xlsx.' Do you want us to try to recover as much as we can? If you trust the source of this document, click Yes.&nbsp; (Note: If I click yes, the recovered spreadsheet is still blank.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word found unreadable content in 'genericfile.docx.' Do you want to recover the contents of this document? If you trust the source of this document, click Yes.&nbsp; (Note: If I click yes, it goes on with another error message and a long, drawn out message about
 opening and repairing the file.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint can't open this type of file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried performing the Online Repair of Office by following the steps in the "Repair an Office Application" link but that did not help. I can say all of my files are fine and not corrupted in any way. They were OK on my old HP Pavilion using MS Office 2007.
 I had reservations about getting a new version but thought 2007 was pretty old and MS might not support it in the future. All these kinds of problems happen every time I upgrade software and it takes weeks to solve these issues - the one thing I really hate
 about Microsoft!</p>

</span></li><li><span>Go to <strong>Options </strong>and select <strong>Trust Center</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Trust Center Settings</strong> and click on <strong>File Block Settings</strong>.

</p><p>Thank you. This did work for Word and PowerPoint but not for Excel. I still get the same error messages for that program. Any other ideas? I'm not sure what you mean by "save locally" on my new laptop. That's essentially what I did when I copied the files
 over from my backup hard drive. Since I can't open the files, I can't save them.</p>

<p>We're glad that we sorted out the issue with your Word and PowerPoint files. Let's now focus on resolving your Excel files. Could you elaborate on how you copied the files from your backup hard drive to your computer? Did you do simple
 copying and pasting of your files from your backup hard drive to your computer? It would be more helpful if you could send us a sample Excel file that is in question to isolate the concern further. Please send this information through a private message that
 I sent and also kindly remove any personal information that might be included in it for your security purposes. To get into your inbox, click your profile name on this page and select

</p><p>I tried your suggestions and I do have Excel 2019 Version 1902, Build 11328.20158 Click-to-Run but I still cannot open any Excel files. I obtained my laptop directly from HP so I guess I'll have to contact them. It's very frustrating to have to deal with

<p>I generated an Excel spreadsheet with the 2019 Excel. That went well but when I double clicked on the file, only a blank sheet opened. I could open it by going the long route of "Open With" command but that is too cumbersome. Using Microsoft's troubleshooting
 program, it suggested doing a "Repair" to solve the issue so I started that process. It stopped midway saying something was wrong and now my entire 2019 Office suite is gone from my computer. I am beyond upset!<br />

<p>UPDATE: I reinstalled Office but I still have the same issues with Excel and now I notice that with the settings I used for Word that I can open some files but not others and they all were generated with Microsoft Home and Student 2010. I hate the thought
 of having to reinstall the old 2010 Office after paying for the 2019 version. It's pretty lame on Microsoft's part that the new version is not
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">easily</span></strong> backward compatible with files from that generation. I got my new computer at the end of January 2019 and I am still having these issues. Now I know why people switch to Macs. I will try
 the Microsoft Technical Support link but I don't hold out high hopes.</p>

<p>Firstly, we would like to inform you that&nbsp;Microsoft decided to discontinue the free custom domain service as of April 10th 2014.&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">As part of the decommission process, eventually, listed domains
 in the admin panel will be removed and all users who will log in to domains.live.com will be redirected back to domains.live.com home page.&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p>However, email accounts in the domain can still log in and access it at www.outlook.com with their emails intact. As long as there will be no changes in the MX Record set by the domain administrator, these users will continue to receive emails.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            First song from every album &#61; unknown artist</h2>
                    
<p>I have an older Zune and my husband just got me an HD for Christmas.&nbsp; My collection was stored on a computer that I no longer use.&nbsp; So I hooked up my old Zune device to the new computer and transferred all the songs.</p>
<p>Everything worked fine except that the first song from every single album is now categorized under Unknown Artist.&nbsp; It is the strangest thing.&nbsp; The rest of the album it recognizes the artist and album name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I really don't want to have to manually fix this.</p>

<p>I would suggest you to try and re-sync, otherwise I think you will need to update the album info for each album. Did you get some kind of error message during the synchronization process? Thanks a lot for posting!</p>

            <p>This will be the same email address and password combination that you use for your Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on whether your phone is on WP8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, the exact steps might be slightly different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings, and then go to Email and Accounts.&nbsp; Whatever is listed first as your Microsoft Account is the email address you want to use for your OneDrive (in most cases).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't remember the password for your Microsoft Account, from the web you can go the steps for "I forgot my password" on any Microsoft log in page.&nbsp; If you need help with this, ask below and someone can walk you through it.</p>

            <strong>BitCryptor</strong> ransomware comes from the same creators as CoinVault and is exactly the same other than a user interface change. BitCryptor encrypts files using AES 256 encryption and is
<strong>unbreakable</strong>. At this time there is no fix tool and no way to retrieve the private key that can be used to decrypt your files without paying the ransom. Unfortunately, the Kaspersky site for CoinVault keys will not work with this infection.
 The only other alternative is to save your data as is and wait for possible updates...meaning, what seems like an impossibility at the moment (decryption of your data) there is always hope someday there may be a breakthrough or possible solution so save the

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pleased the information proved so helpful and that you're enjoying the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're quite welcome.&nbsp; It was my pleasure - glad I could help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback - it is most appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; If you found it so helpful and even more than you requested and it seems to have answered your question (or resolved or explained why you aren't under attack), why did you unmark my reply as the answer?&nbsp; If&nbsp;you did so at the time because you weren't
 yet certain but now are, I'd appreciate if you'd mark it as an Answer as it was before you changed it (assuming you believe that to be true).&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for asking. As I understand, you’re unable to use Excel as all the commands seem to be disabled. Let me help you with this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A few more details would help us to better understand the issue:
</span></p>
<p><span>Do you mean that all the options in the ribbon at the top are disabled or grayed out?</span></p>
<p><span>Is this a standalone version of Excel 2007 or is it part of the Office 2007 suite?</span></p>
<p><span>What exactly happens when you open Excel? Do you get any error message? If yes, post the complete error message.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may repair Office 2007 and check if that helps. Refer ‘Method 2’ provided in the link on how to repair Office 2007 from the Control Panel
 using the Detect &amp; Repair feature. You may restart the computer once the repair is done.

<h2>            No Insider Downloads Yet&#63;</h2>
                    I continue in a program which, it seems likes not my MSI laptop. I have been reinstalling Windows 14393, clean. trying to get the newer builds to no avail. I've tried the Command Prompts, the regedit fixes, ect, listed in these forums with frustrating
 results. Any ideas out there? I really want to stay in the program on my main computer, the MSI. My ASUS gets the builds as they roll out, what gives?

I would try clean install public build with ISO file using Rufus tool. Even if you already have one that have used before I would download another public build ISO. Give another ISO file a shot.

<span>Hi, I am an academician, so I often use office programs very often in PowerPoint. Powerpoint design ideas helped me a lot because I did not have the time, and because I often made presentations. Design ideas are not open for a week.
 There is no other problem with my services open on smart services. Even today, I communicated with microsoft via remote control system was uninstalled and reinstalled by technical support team, but I could not figure out where the trouble was. This page was
 suggested by Microsoft technical support. I have office home and student 2016 package for lifetime. I repeat that there is no problem with the photo format or anything like that and it was opening about 1 week ago. Why do not design ideas open? What can I
 do? I am waiting for your reply as soon as possible. Good work..</span><br />

<br />1. Could you also check if File &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Enable Service under Office Intelligent Services is checked
<br />
<br />2. Try logging into the Windows with a new profile
<br />
<br />3. Right click on Powerpoint icon and Run As Administrator
<br />
<br />4. Clear all IE cache / cookies / Temp Internet Folder etc..
<br />
<br />5. Disable Anti-virus temporarily.
<br />
<br />6. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Powerpoint in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Powerpoint icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />7. You can also try registry change

<p>Hi Ahsen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you said you've used it before - but sometimes things changes after updates. Important about using Design is maximum of 4 photos and also use slide layouts that has Title or Title and Content. It might also not work on custom or purchased templates
 - must be original Microsoft PowerPoint template? Hoping you'll get it fixed soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            word section&#47;paragraph headings to repeat automatically in next pages</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to repeat a paragraph heading automatically in subsequent pages , in case the text entered under a paragraph exceeds current page and falls in to the next page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an option in the Word tables to repeat the top row in next pages, but what I need is to repeat a paragraph header in next pages</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Reset computer and cannot activate Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I had to reset my computer. I previously had Office 365. After the reset I went into my Microsoft account and choose install to reinstall office. Install was completed but now I cannot activate the product. I get an error message. "We're sorry something
 went wrong and we can not do this for you right now. Please try again later (0X8004fc12)"</p>

            <p><span>Hello Steve,<br />
<br />
I understand your concern and will assist you with this issue. <br />
<br />
<br />
Let's try running the Office applications as administrator following steps mentioned below and verify the result:<br />
<br />
Right click on Excel.exe and select '<strong>Run as administrator</strong>' Browse to the location:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>C:\Program Files or Programs Files (X86)\Microsoft Office\Office15
</span></strong><span>or<strong> C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\Office15</strong></span></li><li><span>Right click on Excel.exe and select ‘<strong>Run as administrator’</strong></span></li><li><span>Check if the application opens.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Note: Set the following Office applications to run as administrator as well:<br />
<strong>Winword.exe</strong>, <strong>Powerpnt.exe</strong>, <strong>Outlook.exe</strong> and<strong> Onenote.exe</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You may also grant full control to Office 15.0 registry entries following steps mentioned below and see if it helps:<br />
<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Ensure to back up complete registry before editing/deleting any registry entry.<br />
<br />
1) Open Registry<br />
a) Hold <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.<br />
b) Copy and paste, or type the following command in the <strong>Open</strong> box, and then press Enter:<br />
<strong>regedit</strong><br />
<br />
2) Back up the registry following below mentioned instruction:<br />
Click on <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Export</strong>, name the backup and then click on
<strong>Save</strong>.<br />
Note: Ensure that <strong>All</strong> is selected in <strong>Export range</strong>.<br />
<br />
3) Now navigate to <strong><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0 </em>
</strong>&gt; click on the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click <strong>Permissions </strong>
&gt; select <strong>Allow </strong>checkbox for <strong>Full Control &gt; Apply</strong>.<br />
<br />
4) Repeat the above step for <strong><em>HKEY_CURRENT_ USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists I suggest you to follow the steps given by
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">TheZ23</span> </strong>
on 30 September 2015 and check if it helps.</span></p>

</p><p>Having just opened one of my Spreadsheets I&nbsp;now find&nbsp;that I am completely unable to work with Office 365 2016 saying that it is an 'Unlicensed Product'!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is absolutely ludicrous that Microsoft Office 365 2016 will not work properly with Windows 10! I have continued to pay my annual fee to use Office 365 and am being prevented from using the applications because I am unable to register the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also note that I have not had a response since the 26th October!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable and I would like to know what recourse to resolution I have; because if you cannot fix it I want my money back?</p>

<p>Hi Mario, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, you do not want to use OneDrive sync client to sync OneDrive for business files on your system, but you would like to open files in File Explorer without duplicating the files on your system.
<span>&nbsp;</span>In this scenario, you can use <strong>View in File Explorer</strong> feature. For this follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Internet Explorer, navigate to OneDrive for browser</li><li>Click the <strong>View</strong> menu and then click <strong>View in File Explorer.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a56cdc3b-e958-48f8-b639-3fca3e961edb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a56cdc3b-e958-48f8-b639-3fca3e961edb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: <strong>View in File Explorer</strong>/<strong>Open with Explorer</strong> works only in Internet Explorer 10 or 11. For Windows 10, Edge is the default, but Internet Explorer 11 is also installed. View in File Explorer/Open
 with Explorer does not work with Edge, Chrome, or FireFox. You can use Internet Explorer to do your file transfers, and then go back to using your preferred browser (if not IE).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Hi Mario, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Office Desktop Client means Office applications which are installed on your system. In your case, I believe it’s Office 2016.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You mentioned, “</span><em><span>When I right click on the file directly from the browser,

 have the permission to open files from OneDrive for business to Office 2016, then you won’t be able to open Office files from Windows explorer (OneDrive for business&gt;View in Explorer)</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In you were able to open Office files from ODFB before, then please provide the information requested in my last reply along with the error screenshot</span><span>.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Sign In to Marketplace with my Windows Live ID</h2>
                    I have been trying to purchase an app from the Marketplace from my Verizon HTC Imagio. I go to the "Sign In" window in Marketplace, sign in with the same Live ID I use everywhere else (including on the web sites through my phone) and I get the following
 error:<br />
<br />
Error<br />
We encountered an error while signing in to your Windows Live ID account. Check your Windows Live ID and password and try again.<br />
<br />
I've double and triple checked my Live ID and re-entered the password over and over again. I get the same error. On the web, it works fine. Through Opera or PIE. I've spent hours trying to figure this out. I'm about to give up on Marketplace forever.<br />
<br />
I'm in the United States, my phone is in the United States, I've tried doing this through Verizon's data connection, through an Internet connection through Active Sync, and through WiFi directly through my router to the Internet.

<p>I had the exact issue at the top of this thread. &nbsp;I don't know what caused it but I did get mine fixed.</p>
<p>The only thing that finally resolved it for me was that I downloaded the 6.5 ROM again from the HTC web site and reinstalled on my HTC TP2.</p>
<p>If you do this I suggest that you:</p>
<p>1. sync to google for your contacts if you don't already (or your PC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Save your pics and any other files you want to keep</p>
<p>3. List your apps... or save to the card.</p>
<p>4 Install the ROM again... &nbsp;It took 20 minutes... I searched for answers and tried a lot of dead ends for over an hour.</p>
<p>Worked for me.</p>
<p>Since then if I download an app outside the Marketplace I try to go back to the Marketplace to see if it will still sign in and download. ( I'm getting a lot of free games this way) That way I can see if the new app may be interfering with the sign in process.</p>

<h2>            OneNote - &#34;Needs a password to sync this notebook.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was wondering if anyone can offer me a solution. Since about a week ago my OneNote&nbsp;on my laptop keeps saying "OneNote needs a password to sync this notebook," It provides a sign in option which I click, enter my Microsoft email then nothing happens.
 I don't even get a chance to enter my password. None of the new notes I'm making are being synced to the OneNote on my phone now. Any help?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Not sure if this is useful but My windows updated recently (same time as when the problem started to occur) to version 1709... could it be linked with that?</p>

            <p>Hi Shan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To assist you regarding the restart and rebooting concern, check first to see if you have an update available. Go to the App list, tap
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Phone update</strong>, and then tap <strong>Check for updates</strong>. If there is an update available,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><strong>install the update</strong></em></a>. If it doesn't work, please follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Please download the <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/stop-restart-app/9nblggh30xlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Stop Restart App</strong></a></em> to your phone, open it, and then follow the steps in the app. (For best results,
 connect to Wi-Fi.)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The app will display either of two results: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Your phone is OK</strong>. Your phone is fixed, and you don't need to do anything else.</li><li><strong>We need to fix your phone</strong>. Follow the "To fix your phone using a PC" steps in this topic if the app wasn't able to do so.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response. </p>
