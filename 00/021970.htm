<h2>            How to Control Which Monitor Skype Notifications Display on</h2>
                    <p>I want to change which monitor my Skype notifications pop-up onto.&nbsp; I'm not talking about just&nbsp;turning them on/off, but instead specifying (or at least changing) the monitor on which those notifications appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to make this change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/bbc147fa-7c2e-4a70-9dd0-d1490fdb93fe" title="Ed_Carter">
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option in Skype to choose on which monitor the notifications will pop-up. You can try to check if this option is available in your device settings.</p>

<h2>            nokia 6300 copying messages to excel or other programme</h2>
                    
<p>I wish to store a readable copy of all of my txt messages, including who they are from and the date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using the nokia pc suite i can export my messages which saves as an excel spreadsheet, however it does not include the name from my contacts list and doesnt list them in a date order(or in a format that can be sorted by date)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there any other method to copy text messages to store as a readable file??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help with this would be wonderful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank u</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently Nokia OVI Suite 2.0 is in beta which has got a function similar to that of Nokia Lifeblog/Photos {PC application} which will store your messages in an organised way.&nbsp; Unfortunately Nokia Photos {PC application is not compatible with all Nokia Phones}&nbsp;
 So in Nokia OVI Suite 2.0, they have implemented this feature.&nbsp; You can store/sync your messages with Nokia OVI Suite 2.0, which will not only store your messages, you can sort them according to the sender, date, etc., One more added feature is Message conversation
 is enabled in Nokia OVI Suite 2.0 i.e, if you send a message to your friend and if he replies to your message, this conversation can be stored in PC using latest Nokia OVI Suite 2.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Currently Nokia OVI Suite 2.0 is in beta labs.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from storing your sms is excel format through Nokia COmmunication centre, i am not sure if any Nokia PC Software do this, (may be 3rd party applications are available)</p>

<p>use nokia pc suit to select all messages u want to copy to excel and 'Export' it to a folder location of your choice as a CSV file. CSV files are readable in Excel and can be converted to .xml. CSV files also retain the date and time of the message.</p>

    <title>Configuring Office, fetching your files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewpearce2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Configuring Office, fetching your files</h2>
                    <p>I have a Chromebook with Office 365 complimentary as part of my student account.</p>
<p>When I open Word, I can open a recent file.</p>
<p>However the second I select file to save or print or anything file-related, it starts with the raining screen that says fetching your files. It prompts me to log into my university account, then stays frozen on 'Configuring Office: Fetching your files'.
</p>
<p>Last time this occurred I had to completely wipe my Chromebook and lost a large portion of documents I was unable to save due to this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After wiping it, it synced and had not caused more issues before yesterday.</p>
<p>Because of the paid nature of Office 365 I am unable to simply use my personal Microsoft account as it does not give me the facilities that using my Student account does.</p>
<p>This has been incredibly inconvenient and I found a post on here from February detailing the same issue, and a Paid Subscription providing a required service should in no way have such a problem that is not resolved on a larger level in almost a year.</p>
<p>If you need the address of my account or University to help fix this, please ask.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this issue is detrimental to my work and unacceptable to continue this long.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two possibilities that can cause this issue. It could be a problem with the Word app or an issue with the files that you're trying to open. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Where is the file stored (OneDrive or device)?</li><li>Are you experiencing this issue on other Office apps?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to your Office apps that might cause the issue?</li><li>Which Office build and version are you using?</li><li>Have you tried performing any troubleshooting? If yes, please cite the steps you've done.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The questions above are intended to identify if we can troubleshoot alone or you need to contact your School Administrator since we do not have an admin access to the subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.

<p>I also have had this issue for over a year now. The only difference is that it occurs on Android (Samsung Galaxy Note 8) instead of Chromebook, as in the original February 2018 unsolved Help posting Andrew refers to (why is it locked if the problem is clearly
 not at all resolved??). </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Where is the file stored (OneDrive or device)?</strong></li><li><strong>Are you experiencing this issue on other Office apps?</strong><br />
<br />
The problem occurs on Word, Excel and PowerPoint for files stored on cloud. Saving the files locally works, however the constant cycle of automatically redirecting + login prompt + resetting everything just to save locally, is
<strong>extremely </strong>detrimental to product practicality and completely obliterates the cloud/sharing functionality..<br />
</li><li><strong>Have you made any recent changes to your Office apps that might cause the issue?</strong><br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>No need, it literally never worked with my Work or School account.&nbsp;<br />
</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Which Office build and version are you using?</strong></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">??? N/A mobile? Not sure what a "build" is.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Have you tried performing any troubleshooting? If yes, please cite the steps you've done.</strong>
<ul>
<li>If I completely remove the Work or school Office account from my phone, and only have my personal Microsoft account associated with the phone, I am able to use my&nbsp;<em>personal account (Which has an Office&nbsp;</em>365 University
 subscription associated with it) to save to my personal OneDrive. This subscription is expiring really soon so.. I'd really like to figure this out. I<del>t is also useless wtf is 365 university anyway? 1Tb of cloud storage and what? :s&nbsp;</del></li><li>With the Work/School account associated with the device, I can NOT do this: I can't log in to my personal account upon re-prompt without getting the error. It freezes at the fetching files screen. Any network. Even ethernet..</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Really unacceptable indeed, as if University isn't stressful enough... Here are some observations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately assumed the problem may be due to my 365 subscription being from my Work or School account. When I get prompted to re-log in, my student email already filled into the log-in page, not my personal one. The "annoying" thing is that&nbsp;<em>I can
 not use THAT email to log into anything therefore I have no clue where Office is getting it from.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>ie.&nbsp;</em>I log into 365 with <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> to get redirected to my University login page, but the email that it seems to want me to log in with is
<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>&nbsp;which is never used as login, only for mail. (...so on top of all that **** I also have to erase the damn email and write the proper one in! Pft.. ) Anyway, I have no idea why it is auto-filling
<em>the mail </em>version of the&nbsp;email instead of the&nbsp;<em>live</em>, but I figure maybe it might mean something to you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be helpful. Thank you! Keep at it I'm sure you guys will figure it out.</p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unsure if this is the same issue but I found on our corporate instance of MS365 to have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to log into Word/Excel on Android devices but after I input my credentials on our corporation splash page, it got stuck on "Fetching Files" with the raincloud logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bizarrely, and we cannot understand why, but it appears that if you are already logged into Skype then it will block you from logging into Word/Excel.&nbsp; We accidentally hit this solution.&nbsp; If you go into settings/apps/skype and force stop it, then tap on
 Storage and clear the data and cache; then go into Word and Excel and try to log on it might work.&nbsp; Then you can log back into Skype and Word and Excel will still be logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I do not know if this will work for you and why it happens either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I am having the same exact issue. Just lost a 12 page assignment due to this. I checked onedrive, google drive and every place possible on my computer and was not able to find the assignment. I did come across this:</p>

    <title>Cannot change extension association for .MDB from Access 2010 to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barrymarcus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot change extension association for .MDB from Access 2010 to Access 2016</h2>
                    <p>For legacy purposes I have both Access 2010 and Access 2016 installed on my Windows 10 workstation and need to have both versions available in the event that a client who uses 2010 needs support. However, I prefer to *default* to Access 2016. This is, in
 fact, the case for .ACCDB files. This file extension is associated with Access 2016. But .MDB files are associated with Access 2010. I want to change this association to Access 2016, but cannot. Again, this is a Windows 10 machine. I'm going through all the
 steps: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel | Default Programs | Associate a file type ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select .mdb and click Change Program... From the dialog that pops up ("How do you want to open this .MDB file from now on?") I select "More Apps" and scroll down to select "Look for another app on this PC". In the folder selection window that opens I navigate
 to the Access 2016 executable (MSACCESS.EXE) and click Open. And Voila...! IT DOESN'T WORK. &nbsp;The file extension is *still* associated with Access 2010. Sure enough, double-clicking any MDB file launches Access 2010. Grr!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried using "Open With..." when right-clicking an MDB file. That basically takes me through the same steps. In that case, after selecting the Access 2016 executable, not only does that not change the association, but VOILA...! It opens the file
 IN ACCESS 2010!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives?!? How do I change the program default for MDB files to Access 2016 from Access 2010?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the File Association from the Control Panel:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, then perhaps try the new user profile, just to see if the current profile is corrupt.</p>

                    When I open a new Word Document, the actual document in white, opens in a small window at the top left corner. Attached is a snapshot to explain the issue better. How do I resole this and get the documents to open in normal mode. (This happens only with
 MS Word).<br />

            I found the answer to the above mentioned issue. The option is available under 'View'. You need to select 'One Page' and than 100% and it resolved the issue for me.<br />

<h2>            AADC Distribution Group InvalidSoftMatch</h2>
                    <p>we recently started having an issue with azure active directory connect unable to sync several distribution groups. looking in the miisclient you can see a invalidsoftmatch has occurred.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5df6a7f-3878-416f-bd06-0ff0e1bbad4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5df6a7f-3878-416f-bd06-0ff0e1bbad4a" /></a></p>
<p>further the email report shows "unable to update this object because the following attributes associated with this object have values that may already be associated with another object in your local directory services: [proxyaddresses smtp:" &nbsp;however, i
 am virtually 100% certain this is not the case. as a test i moved one of the distribution groups into a filtered ou. it was deleted from our o365 tenant as expected. i then moved the distribution group back and it was created. however, it was also back on
 the error report.</p>
<p>i see a number of references online for users that show you can change the immutableid and force a hard match. that value doesn't exist on groups from what i can tell though. i'd appreciate any pointers on how to correct this issue. thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>According to the error message, the group’s address is used by other object.</p>
<p>First, please check if the duplicate comes from Office 365:</p>
<p>a. Connect PowerShell to Exchange Online: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx</a></p>
<p>b. Run the following 2 commands to check if there is any duplicate:</p>
<p><strong>Get-recipient | where {$_.EmailAddresses -ccontains "SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"}</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get-recipient | where {$_.EmailAddresses -ccontains "smtp:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"}</strong></p>
<p>Note: replace <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> with the correct address.</p>
<p>If only one group is returned in Office 365 PowerShell, the duplicate attributes should be from local AD. Regarding this part, to provide you with a better service, I suggest you post at our local AD forum to find the duplicate:
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/home?forum=winserverDS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/home?forum=winserverDS</a></p>
<p>They are more proficient at local AD configurations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the issue should also be related to the specific mechanism of AAD Connect tool. You can also post at our Azure AD forum:
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=WindowsAzureAD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is just a discussion that I wanted to get started about an idea that had when I saw the Hololense. please feel free to state your opinion about this idea good or bad, I started this for that reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I must say, the Hololens caught me off guard. It is just amazing and I can't wait for it's official release. But, I would like to see it used to help with public service jobs such as Fire Fighting, EMS, Law Enforcement.&nbsp;Also I believe it can be used
 in teaching to promote/create a sort of hands on learning environment in the class rooms. As a Member of the Huntsville Fire Department, a College student at Sam Houston State University, and a Microsoft enthusiast. I truly believe that this new age technology
 is something that needs to be applied in these areas. But is this possible?</p>

            Agree.&nbsp; It's hard to imagine what it will really be, but I like to try.&nbsp; What if we could have a media room (a basement)&nbsp;at home where we could watch a football game in 3-D that simulated standing on the sidelines of the field?&nbsp; There are already lots
 of camera shooting from all angles.&nbsp; Put all of them together -- Is that what hololens is?

            I agree with your assessment and believe holographic tools such as the Hololens will provide an almost limitless learning experience for students.&nbsp; When I first saw the demonstration video my first thoughts were how this tool would aid students to visualize
 operations, fractions and how functions translate to real world applications.&nbsp; Application of the tool with training, simulations and assisting technicians in the field will be significant.&nbsp; Possible, yes.&nbsp; Implementation, support and cultural (institutional)
 change will be required in the public domain.&nbsp; I look forward to developing applications.

            I am very interested about possible medical use of HoloLens. &nbsp;I suffer from severe treatment resistant depression and Mutiple Personality Disorder or Dissociative Identity Disorder as it is now called. &nbsp;I am extremely excited about the possibility of creating
 the space that one of my alters lives in and which I can go to through guided imagery. &nbsp;If HoloLens could do this, let me create my sanctuary, I would be hopefully be able to interact with that environment in solving many issues in my life. &nbsp;

            <p>I like the firefighter idea. Imagine having a firefighter app on the hololens. The firefighter app would allow the hololens to detect where someone's smartphone is, thus aid in finding the person that is in the house because usually people have their smartphone
 with them all the time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you could have a blueprint app that gives you the layout of the house in the hololens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blueprint app and firefighter app could work together to help locate people and save lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also hololens could help in the training process of police, ems and firefighters. In a safe controlled environment.&nbsp;</p>

            Can you imagine using this for use of force training for law enforcement? Taking a scenario, change it up by changing the environment , a house, a building, a field, or even minor nuances to promote an optimal response in a critical incident, decided in
 a fraction of a second.&nbsp;

    <title>Imap bug in HTC HD2 using windows mobile 6.5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mervync  say:</h3>
<h2>            Imap bug in HTC HD2 using windows mobile 6.5</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>We noted there’s a bug when the user's account&nbsp;name are not the same as the email address when try to download the emails via IMAP in HTC HD2.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Actual setup:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>User name: dessoon</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>email:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></span></p>
<p><span>For eg. we have saved the username as dessoon.</span><span>Intermittently HTC HD2 might prompt credential login with “desiree” as user
 account even though we have already saved the username as "dessoon".</span></p>

<p><span><span>This in turn result in user unable to download email via IMAP due to wrong username. Is this a HTC bug or a IMAP bug in windows
 mobile 6.5?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is there anyway to hard code the settings in the windows mobile 6.5 registry so that correct username will remain permanent when
 downloading mails via imap.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Japp,</p>
<p>I am using IMAP&nbsp;to connect to our own&nbsp;exchange 2003 webmail server. The reason is because user has her boss email configured as exchange on HTC phone and she needs to read her own email. In order to do that, we configure her email account as IMAP. It is
 configured to sync the past 3 days mails and set to sync manually.</p>
<p>We also notice that IMAP takes a longer time to download and sometimes, the email just hang at the 18th mail when there is a total of 30 mails to download as compared to emails&nbsp;configure with&nbsp;our webmail&nbsp;exchange. This results in time-out which we notice
 causes the username "dessoon"&nbsp;to change to the email address name "desiree"&nbsp;or it hangs there indefinitely and we have to restart the phone again to redownload the mails again. Is there any settings&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;set at our webmail server to speed up the synchronisation
 process?</p>

<p>Hi Mervyn,</p>
<p>This sounds like a IMAP server issue to me. Does she use a similar setup on her desktop as well (triggering a account conflict when both are running at the smae time)?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jaap,</p>
<p>No, her desktop is configured as exchange on her outlook. We do not have user connected via IMAP on their desktop PCs. She is the only one in my company that is using IMAP on windows mobile. I have no issue with users using IMAP on their blackberry phone
 via the blackberry internet service.</p>
<p>I notice this happens when there is a time-out connection error after&nbsp;her phone fail to&nbsp;establish connection to our&nbsp;webmail server&nbsp;on her IMAP via 3G network&nbsp;and after user keeps retrying&nbsp;to connect the IMAP&nbsp;again. It does not happen if the IMAP is connected
 to our webmail server successfully.</p>
<p>I have just updated her&nbsp;HTC HD2 phone&nbsp;to the latest rom via the HTC website and I am waiting for her to feedback if the same issue recur after the rom upgrade.</p>

<h3> cawolfe39  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page One of Section 3 Prints on Back Side of First Sheet with Duplex Printing</h2>
                    <p>Word&nbsp;2010 and Windows 7 or XP SP3:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section one contains two pages, Section 3 contains about 7 pages of a table of contents.&nbsp; Section 3 contains about 200 pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section Break 3 is (Odd).&nbsp; Headers and Footers for Section 3 do NOT Link to Previous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to print with Mirrored Margins, e.g., Pages: p1s3-p4s3, the front side of the first sheet is blank, and the content that shows as page 1 on the editing screen is printed on the back side of the first sheet, and so forth, which is definitely not
 what I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at the section 3 pages in preview, the wide margin appears on the even numbered pages, and the narrow margin on the odd pages.&nbsp; I have margins configured Inside 1", Outside 0,.5".&nbsp; The blank page that prints on the front of the first sheet does
 not appear in preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at Section 2, the margins are correct, no blank page at first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please suggest a means to get page 1 of section 3 to print on the front side of the first sheet instead of the blank page appearing there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate your help,.</p>

            It sounds like maybe you have an "even number" page break inserted to force the blank page.
<br />
<br />
You can quickly replace the body text (not touching the section breaks) using the
<br />
<br />
=rand() function&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Just type =rand() at the start of a line and hit enter. This will generate random text.&nbsp; Putting a number inside the braces will change the amount of text generated

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion to use the rand() function.&nbsp; I was not aware of it.&nbsp; It did help in paring the file down that had the problem.&nbsp; The problem still exists in the pared down file.&nbsp; I presume that you or someone else would be able to examine this file
 and perhaps determine the problem.&nbsp; How do I make this file available?&nbsp; I don't see a way to attach it to my reply.</p>

            Yes there are a couple of us who are willing to look at it if you still want help with it.<br />
<br />
You have to upload it into the public folder of your Skydrive, then right click on it and select Share. Select an "edit link". Copy the generated link and paste it into a reply posted here so we can download the example.<br />
<br />
Include a text description in the sample file of what you want us to look for and fix. How do we recreate the problem.

            Yes this link is exactly what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
I was able to recreate the problem using a PDF printer driver. So the problem is not with your specific printer / printer driver. It does appear to be a problem with the way that Word is handling your page breaks. I have not yet figured out which one specifically
 is causing the problem.<br />

<h2>            OneNote sync problems for large notebooks &#47; IOS</h2>
                    <p>Dears, </p>
<p>I have been using OneNote over the last years and my Notebooks. The sizes of my Notebooks are between 300MW to 2GB. Reason for the large size is that I am attaching files pdf and ppts to my notebooks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since some weeks I am faced to Sync problems. Neither my Ipad nor my Iphone can finish the sync the latest changes.
</p>
<p>I have already reduced the notebook file size, deleted the apps and re-openend everything. The problem remains the same even with the side effect that the battery is getting drained.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody here who knows how to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance </p>
<p>M. </p>

            <p>Yes, size&nbsp;is a issue on mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Consider breaking up your notebook</p>
<p>2. Consider using a OneDrive folder to store your images and PDF's then just link to them with a hyperlink (not cool but helps)</p>
<p>3. Consider using Office Lens and capture the images to PDF's then store that on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you let your OneNote grow to large it becomes hard to sync on all devices. </p>
<p>the last restort then is to open in the browser only. </p>

            <p>All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the size of each Notebook. The only way to avoid the sync problems is to de-size the notebooks. My gut feeling is that the critical file size is around 500MB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this is a clear limitation because I have been using OneNote every day for notes (laptop, ipad, iphone) including attachments, screenshots and photos. With that the overall idea of "OneNote for business" is gone.
</p>
<p>

<p>What steps have you tried trying to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Do you get this error message with all Word documents which have Excel files embedded or only with particular document?</p>
<p>Do you have SQL Data Mining Add-ins installed,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">as per MS KB 960806</a>?</p>
<p>Try the below mentioned steps:</p>

<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-clicking on the Excel objects.</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Worksheet Object -&gt; Convert.</p>

</span></span></span>Choose Microsoft Office Excel Binary Worksheet
</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click OK </p>
<p><span>After it converts it to a Binary worksheet, you can then repeat the process

            <p>If you don't have the product key then you will not be able to install the Office again. if the system is under warranty (OEM) then you can contact the system manufacturer (like: Dell, HP) possibly they can provide you a recovery media to re image your system
 with installed apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>things to keep in Mind: resetting the PC deletes all the apps on the system, and does give you a warning too before you perform a reset of the machine.</p>

    <title>Linked spreadsheet object from cloud storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mister ottermayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linked spreadsheet object from cloud storage</h2>
                    <p>I have two files. Both are stored in Google Drive (but also locally on computers where Drive is installed). One file is a Power Point presentation; the other is an Excel spreadsheet. The Power Point presentation contains a link to a worksheet object (a chart)
 in the Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the link on my office computer, by using 'Copy' in Excel and then 'Paste Special-&gt;Paste Link-&gt;Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object' in Power Point. Effectively, this created a link to the local copy of the Excel spreadsheet located at C:\Users\[user]\Google
 Drive\[excelfile] on my office computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then switch to my home computer and open the Power Point presentation that was automatically synced to my local Drive. I try to update the link, and it looks for a local file named C:\Users\[user]\Google Drive\[excelfile]. If I happen to have assigned
 the same user name on both computers, the link actually does update, although certain things can go awry (if, say, the same fonts are not installed on both computers, or other Excel display settings are different between the two locations). However, if any
 of my work colleagues try and do the same, they will not update, because their local Drive is stored in a different location (ie, under a different user name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer if I could link to the actual cloud copy of the Excel spreadsheet, so that every user that opens the Power Point presentation can update links without having to worry about reorganizing their local folders. Is this possible, and how? &nbsp;<br />

            <p>This does not help those who have Office 365 on the Small Business plan and not the Premium one. The Small Business Plan does not have a downloadable MS Outlook to the desktop feature. And therefore those on this plan are unable to insert the holidays via
 the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any other way to insert the holidays without having to use MS Outlook?</p>

            <p>I apologize for the disappointing news, but adding holidays to a calendar is not something that Outlook Web App currently supports. I will let the product team know that there are requests for it, and they could already be working on it for all I know. :)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are workarounds that I can gladly suggest that do not require Desktop Outlook, though:</p>
<p>1. Find a trusted resource that publishes an Internet Calendar for public holidays. I use
<a href="http://calendarlabs.com/ical-calendar-holidays.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendarlabs.com/ical-calendar-holidays.php</a>&nbsp;personally.</p>
<p>2. Right click on the Subscribe button for the calendar that you want and copy its shortcut. For example, I want "<strong><font>2013 &amp; 2014 USA Holidays</font></strong>", so I right click on the Subscribe button next to it and choose to Copy Shortcut. If
 you paste this into any text field, you should see that it begins with "webcal://".</p>
<p>3. Go to Outlook Web App (or Outlook 365 as you call it). Enter the Calendar module.</p>
<p>4. In the left pane, you should see your calendar listed under a title called "My Calendars". Right click on "My Calendars" and choose to Open Calendar.</p>
<p>5. In the text field for Internet Calendar, paste the shortcut from before. Once you are done, select "Open".</p>
<p>6. Give your Calendar module a few seconds to populate data, and you should see your holidays showing up in overlay mode. The nice thing about this is that you can add as many different "holiday calendars" as you'd like, and show/hide them as you wish. If
 you have operations in different countries (for example, France), maybe you'd like to have easy access to the holidays for France, but you may not want to see it overlaid over your calendar everyday. You can check and uncheck the checkboxes next to the calendar
 names in the left pane to show/hide them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know if this doesn't work for you! :) Glad to help!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S: [Please note this does not work as of 31 Dec 2013. The engineers are working on it.] If you want a solution that is completely Microsoft, you can find a calendar for the holidays at
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/calendar-holiday-other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/calendar-holiday-other</a>. It is just a slightly longer process. :)</p>

                    <p>I upgraded my desktop to build 10074 from Windows 8.1. There is no network connection, no network adapters are shown in Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network Connections, and there is no ipconfig output except for "Windows IP Configuration".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager shows that all drivers are installed correctly, and there are no errors for any network devices. The network devices that are installed are a Realtek Gigabit Ethernet PCIe adapter, an Atheros 802.11n PCIe adapter and a Realtek 802.11n USB

<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to reinstall the drivers with and without using compatibility mode to no avail.</p>

            <p>Hello, I have a Lenovo Yoga laptop with no Ethernet adapter. I&nbsp;have been&nbsp;using an Anker USB Hub with Ethernet Port as an option to connect to my work network. It worked fine with 8.1, and 10 Technical Preview, UNTIL I installed the latest build, 10074. I
 have gone through the troubleshooting, reinstalled the driver, removed the driver, downloaded a new driver from Anker -- it still does not recognize the adapter. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Did you try uninstalling the driver and also removing the driver files (if you get that option)?&nbsp; That might make it show up as an unrecognized device, forcing a more thorough reinstall and reset of the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with the adapter physically removed, you could try showing hidden devices in Device manager, see if it still shows up and remove the adapter from there as well.&nbsp; Perhaps then redetecting the device&nbsp;and reinstalling the drivers will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On an older laptop, rather than run the install from the device manufacturer I just pointed Device Manager to the directory where the drivers&nbsp;were by choosing Have Disk&nbsp;and let it search for the drivers.&nbsp; This worked when the install program was not compatible,
 as it was too old to recognize Windows 10.</p>

            <p>The laptop is about 6 months old, came loaded with Win 8.1. The odd thing is that the USB Ethernet Converter worked fine with 8.1 and all previous builds of Windows 10 Preview. It wasn't until I downloaded Build 10074 that it quit working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the driver, deleted the device, viewed hidden devices and deleted another entry, reinstalled it and it still does not work. It shows up under the Network Adapter section in Device Manager as a Realtek USB GBE, with a note stating "currently, this
 hardware device is not connected to the computer (code 45). Reconnect the device." When I disconnect and reconnect, it responds with the typical audio denoting a device has been disconnected and reconnected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After unplugging the device and reattaching, the error message now states "Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware device (Code 37). An invalid parameter was passed to a service or function."</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I am a software developer with a Computer Science degree,&nbsp;and quite a lot of experience, but this has me stumped. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>I think the only solution would be if Windows cannot find a driver automatically when it detects the adapter&nbsp;and/or you force it to look for the files needed by choosing "have disk" when it finds new hardware&nbsp;and then browsing to the folder containing the
 driver files and include subdirectories in the search for drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to confirm the device is still working right on another PC or reset the network adapter to defaults on another PC?&nbsp; I recall there being some network card settings that can "stick" in an adapter, even if it is moved to another computer in
 days gone by (such as forced duplex settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I could find on Code 37 is:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310123/#bookmark-37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code 37</a></p>

</p><div>Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37)</div>
<span>The driver returned a failure when it executed the DriverEntry routine. Reinstall the drivers for this device.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Uninstall and reinstall the driver</span><br />
<br />
<span>Uninstall the driver from Device Manager, and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again.</span>

<li>In the device's<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>dialog box, click the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab,

<span>Note</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last
 time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware manufacturer's website.</span>

    <title>Word 2013 Overall Lag and Delayed Response - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linusos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 Overall Lag and Delayed Response</h2>
                    <p>While my system isn't the bleeding edge fast, performance has not been an issue with any other software to date. I can say with near certainty that the sluggishness is not a hardware issue. Needless to say typing and scrolling is not an issue with other
 software just office. I don't use excel as much but its similarly slow main focus is Word here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">With that out of the way I do not have any issues with Word crashing or not opening. The program runs and all function work, just not in a quick and responsive manner. Specifically the typing is slightly delayed and scroll is not
 smooth. When running the software in safe mode using "WinWord /safe" command everything runs much smoother as it should. There is zero delay in typing and Word runs very smooth. I have yet to get Word to run like this while not using safe mode. I have noticed
 that for the very first few seconds that the program is open, it scrolls smoothly. Then almost as if one last part loads its back to choppy scrolls and typing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What I have done already...</span></p>
<p>Toggled the disable hardware acceleration on and off.
<br />
<strong>Result:</strong> It runs really bad checked(disabled) and decently but not perfect when unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">After that I created a DWORD Key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Commom\Graphics "DisableAnimation(s)" I tried both singular and plural but not at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong>Result:</strong> Zero noticeable change</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Deleted the template in Roaming AppData</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong>Result:</strong> No Change</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Check for and disabled all Add-Ins COM and Actions&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><strong>Result:</strong> No Change</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Control Panel, Ease of Access, Use computer with out a display, and checked turn off all unnecessary animations when possible.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Result: </strong>no change<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Signed out of Office and no change again. Graphics card is up to date and long with all updates for 7 and office.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Any troubleshooting help would be great appreciated. Clearly safe mode has disabled some "feature" that is causing this delay. Launching in safe mode is not ideal for daily use... Very much considering going back to a nice and stable
 Office 2007...</p>

            <p>Hi Sukumar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What error message do you get when trying to download file?</p>
<p>2. Have you started facing this issue recently?<br />
3. Have you checked the issue on a different web browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>As you have already tried most of the troubleshooting, I would suggest you to turn off and turn on Internet Explorer and check if that helps.<br />
Follow this article: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/turn-windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/turn-windows-features-on-or-off</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>If that does not help, I would suggest you to check the issue in a new user account.<br />
<font color="#000000"><font><span>Try to create a new user account with administrative privileges and check.</span></font></font></p>
<p><strong><span><font color="#000000">Create a User account: </font></span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</font></span></a><span><font color="#000000"><font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font><br />
If the issue resolves in new user account, here is the link to <strong>fix a corrupted user account:

&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, if you have installed Win 10 10525, then rolled back to 10240 then you have to do this before Windows Updates will download Win 10 10525 again.
<br />
<br />
Right click your Start icon, click on Run type 'regedit', now click on OK, then Yes<br />
<br />
Open these Registry Keys:-<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability<br />
<br />
If you find a key/string called BuiltFrom 10525 you need to delete it, exit regedit, and now run Windows Update, or else Windows Update will assume you are still on 10525, and not offer you an update to it.*john<br />

            Under Applicability there is another folder called Recovery and an item 10525.&nbsp; I deleted that and went to Updates and Check for up dates and 10525 started to download.

            See I don't have that...depends on what's going on in your system...mine is up and running so the values are the way they are supposed to be...if Raaco HAD 10525 then went back to 10240...then the value should be TH1...in order for build 10525 to update
 again....maybe it needs some extra time to absorb the registry change...if he changed the value to TH2 then It will not download that build at all...because the registry thinks 10525 is already or still installed....it's a confusing mess sometimes.*john

            I had done Recovery while on 10525 because I was having sound problems. Fixed that.&nbsp; Used the regedit get back and it is up and running.&nbsp; Did not do any thing else.<br />

    <title>how do you print a full page of mini-cards - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how do you print a full page of mini-cards</h2>
                    It has been ages since I've tried to do this, but I have some small invites to a graduation, and want to include a note inviting the people to an ice cream get-together along with the formal invitation. The invitations are small, so I should be able to
 put several notes on a single page.<br />
<br />
I recall there was a feature that was commonly used for making business cards in Word 97 &amp; 2003, but for the life of me, I can't recall how to use it. I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">thought</span> it was the "envelopes and labels", but when I do "full page of the same label" it only does a couple, when I should be able to fit 6 on a single page. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I just can't remember.<br />
<br />
How do I get it to work so I can print 6 labels at once on a single page in Word 2003? I could set it up manually with a table and/or columns, but I'd like to remember how to use the built-in feature.<br />
<br />
If it's broken in that version, I have 97 and 2007 available.<br />

            The Labels page of the Envelopes and Labels dialog is the right place. The key is to click the Options button and choose the right "product number" in the list. What's right depends on the size and shape of the notes you want to print. An example is to
 choose "Laser and Inkjet", "Avery standard", and product 5164. This makes labels/notes that are 4" wide and 3.33" high, fitting six per page.<br />
<br />
If you can't find a size that's exactly what you want, you can click the New Label button in the Options dialog and define whatever you need.<br />
