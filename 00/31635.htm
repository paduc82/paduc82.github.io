<h2>            Getting a Device Error when connecting my Kindle Fire HD via USB</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HP Pavillion PC running Vista Home Premium with Service Pack 2 installed and all important updates also installed.&nbsp; When I connect my Kindle Fire HD to my PC via USB, I see the pop-up saying that Windows found new hardware and must install new
 driver software&nbsp;for my MTP.&nbsp; I allow it to try and locate a driver and it fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried to skip the install and have it ask again later but either way, my Kindle does not show up on my PC.&nbsp; If I view Device Manager, it shows a new group of "Other devices"
 with an MTP error in the yellow triangle.&nbsp; When I view the driver, it shows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)</p>
<p>There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kindle is not asleep and I've tried powering up while connected and disconnected both with the same results.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connected the Kindle to a laptop with Windows 7 and it works fine.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1803 will not install hangs at 91&#37; and then restarts the whole process</h2>
                    <p>I am unsure of what to do I have changed my wifi setting etc to metered to avoid installing this update. As being a teacher in school term I can risk issues with laptops and pcs</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop acer aspire is trying to install this update - but it always fails and then starts to dl again I have tried 6 times I need it for my study course so i dont want any issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying the fixes however every time a major install version is released something ends up crashing and needing reformatting. Which is not cool</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant toggle the restart options etc. The only option I can do is change to metered. I tried to seek windows assists to hide updates? but it is still trying to dl on 0%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will delete the temp files and ran a disk clean up today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other advice I can take to make this a smooth update for once? As i literally reformatted my pc 4 months ago because 1709 had major issues i do not want to this to occur again as I lost programs and also had to repuchase some.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advice</p>

            Hi Flea.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd save a System Image backup stored externally so   you can restore C in 20 minutes and be up and running:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Then try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that still fails then to avoid interference until you have time to Clean Install or try the additional Steps I would hide the Update using the Metered Connection setting shown here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />One method that always works and also results in a vastly superior install that is more resilient for future Upgrades and Updates, is to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />or
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer. 
<br />You can use any file sharing website to send the files to me.

            Hi Flea17,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<p>Well the laptop is still trying to update - restarting alot been most of the afternoon.Just got into my account it&nbsp; very very slow boot I hope this is not always the case</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy for update to occur however error in the previous upgrades makes me nervous aS the 1709 update cause major issues on my desktop which was build in earl2017 - causing a crash and everything needing to be reformatted and even some programs needing
 repurchasing.&nbsp; I particular dont want that again as my account my be unhappy with me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont think it is fair that we have to also delete our anti virus I am using trend and malware programs like bytes which we use to protect our data. these should really have been taken into account when the update was being created.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use all desktop and laptops for work. I honestly keep nothing on the c drive other than programs all data except email backup for outlook is put on other internal hdd
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for the roll out for my desktop I am not installing manually as 1. i need for studying, 2 for work reporting online lessons and communication with students and 3 reporting and exam marks are on in the next 3 weeks
</p>
<p>

            I am not Microsoft but have spent ten years in Forums daily helping 100,000+ consumers and recommend only Defender which always offers best Windows performance with least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />It's exactly because you said you needed the PC for school that I suggested you manually install the Update to avoid problems with buggy WIndows Update and Update Assistant.  This is always the most stable method to do the Version Upgrade and be in control of it rather than having to take over and often mess up your PC.
<br />
<br />So, again, to do that you'd simply install the Media Creation tool, open the app and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  Less than an hour later it will be done.  If you have any problems see these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />No programs should ever need repurchasing if you do a Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  No software maker would stay in business if they made you buy another copy just to reinstall which users do routinely to keep their PC healthy.
<br />
<br />But the modern way is to save a System Image backup stored externally so if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can restore C in 20 minutes and be up and running:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>

<p>
</p><p>Are you connected to a domain network?</p>
<p>Did you refer to the suggestions by Vanessa sohtun mentioned above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would like to inform you that, when you try to use a program on your computer, you receive an error that includes the User32.dll file in its description.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows stores instructions for graphical elements such as dialog boxes and windows in the User32.dll file. The User32.dll file is necessary to the operation of Windows. If this file is damaged,
 deleted, or removed, the system will no longer work correctly. If a program or a service accesses User32.dll incorrectly, the program or the service will not work correctly.
<br />
<br />
User32.dll errors are typically corrected by repairing the User32.dll file or by reinstalling the program, the hardware component, or the driver that is causing the error.</span></p>

    <title>Black screen problem in in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suvobratanayak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen problem in in Windows 10</h2>
                    I am using <strong>HP notebook 15-bs</strong> series with windows 10. I was getting the black screen issue after login, the black screen stays near about 10 minutes with the cursor and then automatically I used to get the desktop. Before it was working
 fine but after the latest update the problem started.&nbsp; Only disabling the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>AppReadiness.dll</strong></span>" file solved the problem... but this is not the exact solution. I hope Microsoft will take it as a serious
 issue and come out with a solution as soon as possible. Thanks&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Apparently Windows 2016 servers don't know how to work with 2012 remote desktop license servers. It crashes the licensing service on the license server and causes this error to happen. I guess we are going to install a new remote desktop license server on
 a 2016 server.</p>

    <title>XBox One&#58; Really missing couch Co-op - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mkirk89  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One&#58; Really missing couch Co-op</h2>
                    
<p>I feel like the biggest thing missing with this generation of XBox and really this generation of gaming is the couch co-op. Not being able to play COD or Dead Rising 3 campaigns with someone else in my own home is really grinding my gears. I think there
 are plenty of people who are obsessed with online multiplayer that couch co-op doesn't hurt the bottom line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really hoping for more couch co-op; maybe I'll just have to wait for Borderlands 3.</p>

<p>i think couch coop does need to return, however i think there should be modes that allow guests and ranked games that do not. sucks when you're in tdm on ghosts and a guy goes 5-20 giving the other team killstreaks nonstop lol.

<p>Developers have to spend additional time &amp; resources to add extra features like the 1 you're suggesting. Sure, it would be nice, but is it practical, affordable, &amp; will it make them a profit? Besides, why do that when they can force you to purchase an extra
 copy of their game, an extra console, &amp; an extra Live Gold subscription? Even some games that should have it, currently don't (e.g., Peggle 2). Now, I want to be clear though - I don't disagree with you; I miss it too.</p>

<p>Agreed. I miss it too but GG is right. And there are some technical limitations. Like can you imagine having to render 2 separate screens of dr3 on 1 console? I picture it getting very laggy. Again, I miss it too but I think with such high power games, the
 two screen experience could really hinder the power of the console.</p>

<p>I love couch co-op ad well, however I feel the need to point out Dead Rising has never allowed local play. &nbsp;That said, it's really up to the developers to add the feature, if the game can allow for it.</p>

<p>COD does have some modes which support local coop play (Extinction for sure, just did that with a friend over the weekend, was good fun) but yes the campaign missing which has been the case for a while though leads to my following point. I get the split-screen
 rendering argument, but what about sports games like NBA 2k14 where you are playing on the same court with the same camera no additional rendering occurring but you can't play multiplayer in MyGM which replaced The Association, these things are just silly.
 Bottom line is I agree also. </p>

<p>You think graphics are the only thing that slows the game down? With each additional player, the game will use more resources to interpret our inputs as well.</p>

<p>the only limitation to what i said is that they would have to add a single playlist for guests and keep them out of the rest of ranked modes, not exactly what i call costly. &nbsp;it's just developer choices, for example borderlands and halo. sure they could
 push the bar further and not offer 4 player split screen, but it's what keeps players coming back. i understand there are limitations and coding costs money, i really think most single player games aren't coop &nbsp;because they'd have to sacrifice so much from
 the graphics department that people wouldn't be happy with that either. for example call of duty has always lowered there graphics for split screen.

<p>I know its completely different from cod or dr,but lego marvel does a pretty good job,to fill that void for now,and skylander SF,if ya like ya platformers,then both great games,even if aimed at the younger gamer.I have lego xb1,and have played lego 360,xb1

<h2>            Opencanvas 1.1 b72 &#40;Not Responding&#41; on Windows 7 64bit Os, how do I fix this&#63;  &#91;Fixed&#93;</h2>
                    December 20th my Lenovo ideapad Y560 crashed causing part of my hard drive to become corrupted, I ended up going through Lenovo support and had the hard-drive replaced. The only thing different is the new hard-drive everything else is the same including
 the Windows 7, 64-bit operating system. When I open the program OC11b72rv1.exe the main screen loads but the program stops responding and when I try to use trouble shooting programs it detects the application as incompatible. I would like to know why this
 program will not run for me and if there is any possible way to fix the issue.

            <p>Becky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>During upgrades, Windows<span>&nbsp;</span>10 licenses are not tied directly to a product key. Instead, the license status of the system's current installation of Windows is migrated, and a "Digital entitlement" is generated during the activation&nbsp;process,
 which is bound to the hardware information collected during the process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even If Windows<span>&nbsp;</span>10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation (such as a motherboard change), the online activation process will automatically recognize the system's digital
 entitlement if no product key is entered during installations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with previous versions of Windows, significant hardware changes will invalidate the digital entitlement, and require Windows to be re-activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So purchasing windows 7 and upgrading to windows 10 will be free till windows&nbsp;call off upgrade process&nbsp;and after the upgrade your machine id will be migrated to Digital entitlement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even you rollback to windows 7 after upgrading to Windows 10 still your machine will hold the valid license to Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            PDC Suspend&#47;Resume Activator and Mysterious wake from Hibernation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Activator that was shown on the sleepstudy report showed that it had a 47% active time, with 1 hour 53 minutes and 18 seconds. Can anyone explain what PDC Suspend/Resume Activator is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, last night I ran into a problem where I woke up to find my batter drained from about 40% to 5%. The
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/xdJMlas.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Battery Report</a>&nbsp;shown here shows what had happened. Now I know that my Surface Pro 3 has been configured to hibernate after 4 hours of inactivity in the Connected Standby. But what I
 don't understand is what happened today. I woke up to see my Surface was drained. The
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/xdJMlas.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">battery report</a>&nbsp;shows that something woke it up from its hibernation state and from there my battery completely drained. It was in my backpack, so nothing could have pressed the power
 button. So could I get some help on what caused it to wake up from its hibernation state, even without physically touching the device?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my sleepstudy report to help answer both questions:&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C036136EF4BCB49E%211080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sleepstudyreport</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>I blame the Logo button for its "haptic buzz".&nbsp; How can I still be getting "haptic buzz" after Hibernate?&nbsp; In fact, in order to Hibernate (on my Surface 2 Pro) what I have been doing is tapping the Logo button as long as it takes to stop getting "haptic
 buzz" (thinking that that is how long it takes for Hibernate to complete and also somewhat confirmed by seeing my external USB drive light turn off.)&nbsp;&nbsp; However, later when I want to Resume from Hibernation, even though the Power button is required to do that,
 tapping on the Logo button first proves that "haptic buzz" is still happening.&nbsp; So if your screen cover is rubbing constantly on that button, I suspect that could be a cause of a battery drain.&nbsp; Notice that this doesn't even require the screen cover to be
 attached--another suggestion I have seen for avoiding battery drain is to detach the screen cover before Hibernate and then only reattach it after as just the screen cover, which might be OK if you are just leaving the machine inert but not if you have it
 moving with you.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Spring Update creating an OEM partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matteo veludo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Spring Update creating an OEM partition</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>yesterday morning upon the release of Windows 10 Spring Update, I noticed that my computer after the update has created an OEM partition in my local disk that now appears into "My PC" among my other HDDs.</p>
<p>It is basically full and around half a GB. I was wondering what it was created for and if it was safe to delete or if it wasn't necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            Yes, its a new occurrence with the Spring Creators Update:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />
<br />At a command prompt, type: Diskpart.exe.
<br />At the DISKPART prompt, type: Select Disk # - this is the number for the small partition you are seeing.

            Hey Matteo,
<br />
<br />Essentially the recovery partition is used in the event that your Windows installation goes belly up, it's the first thing you see when your Windows installation is corrupt and gives you essential tools to troubleshoot. It has no practical use while Windows is running, so you will need to remove the drive letter and mount point in DiskPart in order to do this (but it won't affect the partition).
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run. Type in the following: diskpart
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the new DiskPart window:
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />select volume NUMBERHERE
<br />...or: select volume LETTERHERE
<br />
<br />remove letter=LETTERHERE
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please do let me know if this fixes it.       
        </p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>There are multiple reasons why you were unable to connect your Bluetooth device to your laptop. To further isolate your concern, we recommend that you
<strong>enable the built-in Administrator</strong> by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Choose
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the elevated command prompt, type the following command:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><strong><em><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
</p><p><span>Once the built-in Administrator is already enabled, <strong>manually download and install the Bluetooth driver</strong> from the Original Manufacturer. If you will still experience the same error, proceed to running the
<strong>DISM command</strong> to fix system file corruption. To run the DISM command, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type the following command in the cmd window:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><strong><em><span>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Wait for the command to finish before closing the cmd window.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Take note that it would take a while for the DISM command to complete, depending on the number and size of files being repaired.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists after the DISM command that means it is a possible hardware issue. It will be best to contact your
<strong>Original Equipment Manufacturer</strong> so they can give you additional troubleshooting steps to resolve your concern.</span></p>

<h2>            Photos app all fouled up&#59; can&#39;t install update 0x80070003</h2>
                    <p>Photos app worked last evening on my Windows 10 Pro x64 November Update desktop..<br />
<br />
This morning it flashed briefly and popped up an error dialog box "The app did not start."<br />
<br />
Tried reregistering using</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this it started and a few seconds later died with "remote procedure call failed"<br />
<br />
Tried the reregister thing again and it bombed out. Didn't capture the error.<br />
<br />
Then I had no "Photos" app in Start, but did have an @{Microsoft.Windows.Photos_15.1118.12010.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource:/Microsoft.Windows/Photos/Resources/AppFriendlyName} app; photos now opening with classic photo viewer desktop app.<br />
<br />
Went to Store, found it had a pending update for Photos. When it tried to install that update, it ends with error 0x8007003.<br />
<br />
Ran App Troubleshooter and it found nothing to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried deleting&nbsp;C:\windows\softwaredistribution\datastore\logs\edb.log and reboot. Still ends 0x80070003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to fix this app?</p>

            <p>No answers to how this happened or how to fix it. I ended up doing a system restore from a restore point several days before this showed up. Took hours to catch up with changes to the system since that restore. Luckily it was only several days worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My residual questions are a) what caused Photos to break so I can avoid doing it again, and b) why is System Restore the only way to recover a horked up Windows Store app? These apps were supposed to be simpler, more stable, and installed in more compartmentalized
 ways. This is as bad as iTunes Control Panel.</p>

    <title>Skype Microphone Garbled Sound - Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danutazaczek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Microphone Garbled Sound - Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 and using Skype, but when I call someone or use the ECHO Test call my voice is very garbled. When using the Windows Voice Recorder, with the same microphone settings, the sound is perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing Realtek audio, enhanced audio drivers, changing the microphone formats quality settings, removing and adding microphone boost, checking and unchecking Enhancement options, etc. I contacted my Asus laptop support and tried their instructions
 but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Voice Recorder works perfectly fine. Using Google Hangouts to make a call works perfectly fine. But when calling from SKYPE, my voice is Garbled - very garbled. It is hard to make out what I am even saying. I get the same voice issue if I call my
 cellphone or if I use the Skype Echo Test service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do - my drivers are all updated, this is a brand new laptop as well, and it is running windows 10. I am using the non-win 10 Skype, but I also tried the Win 10 Skype and have the same exact issue.</p>

<p>yes, Skype is enabled. To be clear, the microphone records me when using the Windows SKYPE application, but it is very very very garbled sound. You can make out some words, but some get very badly garbled. So the microphone is working with the Skype app,
 just that there must be some setting that is causing the garbled effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, when I use the WEB Skype version (running from withing Chrome browser) the microphone works perfectly. Like it does with the Windows Voice Recorder tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the microphone is fine, but something with the standalone windows SKYPE application is causing the issue. Furthermore, if I use Skype from my cell phone, everything is fine too...so the connection is not the issue either.</p>

<p>Does this issue occur as you signed in to your account at the same time on two different platforms: Skype for Web and Skype for Windows desktop application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, try to sign out from Skype for Web and check if the issue will be the same on your Skype for Windows desktop application.</p>
<p>

<p>This is retarded. I updated to the latest CLASSIC skype and tried the Echo Test service. I can hear the person fine and when I record my audio it comes back garbled. I then installed the NEWEST skype for Win10 and tried - Same bad result. I then tried my
 audio recorder on windows and recorded and played back my voice just fine. I then tried the CHROME based skype and did Echo Test Service and is is also fine!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can log out of one and it is the computer one that always has the problem...it is the only one that is logged in. I tried all of the SmartAudio settings on my computer and nothing solves it---well because there is no audio problem with my computer - it
 is something in the Skype application. Can I make this any clearer...IT IS THE SKYPE APPLICATION !!!!! Because as I said now,again, it does not happen when I used the Chrome Browser Skype, not when I use windows recorder...it is ONLY when I use the SKYPE APP.
 And if I call someone they are fine, but I sound very garbled to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck am I supposed to do...I waited for a new update and that still didn't solve crap.</p>

<p>So I got in contact with chat support and the first thing they are having me do is enable logging and send them logs....well how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this link to a site for how to CREATE and SEND logs....it only describes how to CREATE logs....now how do I send them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12321/how-do-i-create-and-send-log-files</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is info that I can find logs in %appdata% under Skype...I checked...nothing got created after using Skype. Btw, this only applies to the LATEST version of skype...the old classic version doesn't even have a logging option anywhere I can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I'm confused...I can't even do step 1 of the process which is to create logs. Any hints?</p>

<p>I have the same issue as Sharon.&nbsp; I don't see that her problem was resolved, so I'll answer the questions for myself.</p>
<p>Have you tried... Yes, Google Chrome and Firefox don't behave this way.</p>
<p>Are there any...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there aren't because the screen is blank below the address and tab bars.</p>
<p>Were you able...&nbsp; Yes, before upgrading to Windows 10 -&nbsp;I could play Pogo games on Internet Explorer.</p>
