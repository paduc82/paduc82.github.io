<h2>            ffxi not working with windows 8</h2>
                    I am trying to play ffxi on windows 8 but the pol (play online) wont run. i tried to run it on a previous version of windows under xp 7 and vista but that didnt work. i also tried to make a partition on my hard drive for windows 7 but it wouldnt install
 correctly. so is there any way i can get it to run? or do i have to format my hard drive to windows 7?

            Would you have to do this with all the programs like expansions? Or just the main game? When I install the game, it installs; Playonline Viewer, Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart, Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia, Final Fantasy
 XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan, and Final Fantasy Wings of the Goddess.

<h2>            WWE app controls needs fixing</h2>
                    
<p>I was watching a live program last night on the WWE Network and had to pause it for about&nbsp;30-40 minutes.&nbsp; Well, when I sat back down to continue and tried to fast forward a little it skipped all the way to the live part.&nbsp; The app does this for a lot of things
 on the network.&nbsp; It will rewind slowly but the fast forward skips ahead at a very fast pace.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 User Accounts Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifer_546  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 User Accounts Problem</h2>
                    We just upgraded to Windows 10 and have nothing but problems with user accounts. The only account that works is the main computer account. The two other administrator accounts log in and freeze with no way to log out unless you use the task manager. All
 child accounts just say welcome and then promptly sign off. This is very frustrating. We have worked on our family safety account. Deleted and re-added accounts, and absolutely nothing is working.

            I cannot get screen shots right now as I am not in front of our computer, but to answer and give specifications, yes there is a line item for each MSA child account, and all was reset setting wise (email invitations accepted, old pre windows 10 device
 child account deleted as the three steps gave, etc.) as it instructed and it says all is ready to go on the windows 10 device. The section for the adult accounts has all adult counts listed as well. &nbsp;When we log into our user accounts on our computer and look
 under family accounts, it says all accounts are good to sign in as well. There are technically three child accounts and then one administrator account, but we have two other accounts that were &nbsp;temporarily opened as administrator just so we could see if they
 worked (both parent accounts), but those two we can log in but then it freezes and there is no way to log out -- no start menu, etc. Our main administrator account works just fine. When we try to log in on a child account, it sa

            It sounds like it may be a glitch. I contacted the support desk for Microsoft, and they were stumped as well. They sent me over to answer tech (they had better not charge me as this is a Microsoft issue), and there are 342 people in line ahead of me.&nbsp;

            <p>After waiting for a few hours, I finally made it to my place in line. It appeared that the Microsoft tech was baffled as well. He never could come up with a solution and then the next thing I knew I got a message that said thank you for contacting us do
 not hesitate to contact us again. So all that time and zero answers. I sure do not want to wait another several hours again. It is a bit ridiculous to be honest. If anyone finds a solution, please share. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the clear steps you provided, Jennifer!&nbsp; There are lots with our name here :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the others that have responded to this thread, are your experiences on account.Microsoft.com/family the same - that the Microsoft Account shows properly for each of your kids, but they aren't able to log into the device?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the child accounts, are they new Microsoft Accounts, or were they newly created when you upgraded to Windows 10?&nbsp; Is there any chance that they were created with just an email and password (rather than the full account setup that for those under 13 would
 require the COPPA flow)?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does removing the account from the PC, rebooting, and re-adding a child account correct the issue?&nbsp; And while it may be a long shot, have you gone into the Settings app and checked for updates on the Update &amp; Security tab?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Ryan, I think that your issue may be a little different, because you're trying to use a local account - those can't be used for child accounts in Windows 10.&nbsp;

            My assumption so far still is that this is a Microsoft glitch/error. Maybe just maybe it will be corrected in the patch I have heard they may release next week. I discovered that even if I try to create a local account (not even a child account), if it
 is a Microsoft account, I actually get a message that says that this service is temporarily unavailable. My guess is that the user accounts (child, etc.) and Microsoft &nbsp;are not communicating at log in (though my kids' names did correct themselves) and that
 is why it quickly signs off. I am very hesitant to try any registry changes when there are messages of temporary unavailability even to create local accounts with established microsoft accounts. My kids' accounts still work just fine on our other devices that
 have not upgraded to 10 yet, so we are not upgrading the other devices until this problem has a solution as we do not want them locked out of all devices.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, I fixed mine by doing a repair. This was my final option. I tried deleting the child account, removing it from child safety, changing it to administrator then adding again all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the repair wiped some of the resident prog s that were pre-installed OEM and some of the profs I'd installed myself but these were quickly reinstalled with the rescue disk.</p>
<p>now the child account logs on fine.</p>

                    we have daily meetings over Skype For Business and record activity using whiteboard. sometimes due to network activity, certificate&nbsp; renewals the whiteboard gets lost. Is there any method to save the whiteboard and content automatically?

<p>Hello Ananth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post in the forum. Based on my tests, it is not feasible to save the whiteboard automatically. As a workaround, it is suggested to record the daily meeting so that the content will be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I think it is a good feature request. You can submit the feedback in
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Business UserVoice forum</a> for feedback. Thanks for your understanding.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> 1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesnâ€™t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesnâ€™t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not say how you "rebuilt" it or what type of License you have, or how you reinstalled Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en-gb/licensing/sblicensing/pages/licensing_faq.aspx#fbid=iePP5a9JaWJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/oem/en-gb/licensing/sblicensing/pages/licensing_faq.aspx#fbid=iePP5a9JaWJ</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>If my customer asks me to upgrade a PC with new hardware components, when is a new operating system needed? When would the PC be considered "new"?</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computerâ€”<strong><em>except</em> the motherboard</strong>â€”and still retain the licence for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the licence of new operating system software is required.</p>
<p>If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC
<strong>as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what Product Key are you using; the one on the COA Sticker, which is the correct one?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>The COA sticker is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fgsPE6.gif" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If OEM License and Motherboard is the same, or if you have a Retail License and did change the Motherboard, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it seems that&nbsp;it does require phone Activation, do not follow the <em>Auto Prompts</em>, but hold on for a real person to explain to as to what&nbsp;has been&nbsp;done for re-installation purposes</p>

            Bill Smithers is correct. &nbsp;All is not lost however. &nbsp;Rather than wasting money on a new Microsoft License you should try installing Linux Mint on your computer. &nbsp;It's an all around superior operating system and you can download it for free.&nbsp;

            <p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The important questions&nbsp;are who built the computer originally and what type of Windows License was installed and that question about the Motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was originally an OEM Windows&nbsp;preinstalled License (Dell, HP, etc), you can't upgrade the Motherboard, except in the circumstances I mentioned in my first reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whereas if you have a Windows Retail License, you can change whatever Hardware you wish to, but be prepared to use Phone Activation then.</p>

<p>Hi, recently i've been wanting to change my unspaced gamertag (p a w s) to just paws. I've done my research and it seems that they are techinacally the same name, but when i go to unspace it on my console, it says it's still taken. I also have "paws" pending
 on my friends list. Any idea on how I can change my name? I would really love to have an OG name C;</p>

<p>The Gamertag of 'paws' already exists <a href="https://account.xbox.com/Profile?gamerTag=paws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Now the two variations should not be able to exist but sadly they do.</p>
<p>All you can do is wait for the unspaced version to be released. Which if I read this forum correctly is unlikely to happen any time soon.</p>

<p>How is it a "glitch"? &nbsp;A space is considered a character, that's why if you look at his profile, it doesn't say xbox.com/p a w s (or paws), since there can't be spaces in a URL address.</p>

<p>Seriously? I'm not an active user of Live and I know this.</p>
<p>Currently Xbox Live does not see spaces as a character if a similar gamertag exists.</p>
<p>For example you can not have a gamertag of 'Egg Nogga' or 'Bong Kaos' because those two accounts exist without the space.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, then please try and register a new account, using your gamertag, with a space placed anywhere in it.</p>

<h2>            Router keeps restarting &#40;like once every minute&#41; as long as I am connected to it wired&#47;wireless with a Windows 7 PC.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
&nbsp;I am using TrendNet router TEW-432BPR. It works fine with my other laptop that runs on Windows Vista. As soon as I connect (wired or wireless) my new PC with Windows 7, it starts restarting itself until I stop using the network with that laptop. I have contacted
 TrendNet customer service and executed all the steps they had asked me to but no improvement. Is there anyone that faced similar issue and fixed it? Please help me.

<p><strong><span>Hi MBREDDY77,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
</span></strong><span><span>A. Do you get any error message or just router restarts?<br />
I would suggest you to see if there is any updated firmware available for your router and update the firmware, I would also suggest you to check if the router is compatible with windows7, and the following link will help you to check the compatibility.<br />
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=TEW-432BPR&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=TEW-432BPR&amp;page=1</span></span></span></a><br />
<br />
<span>I would also suggest you to connect the router to different windows7 computer and see if you are facing the same problem.<br />
</span></span><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:
<br />
</span></strong><em><span>I </span></em></span></span><span><span>would suggest you to disable all antivirus and firewalls and try if that get connected; the following
 steps will help you to disable firewalls.<br />
1. Open Windows Firewall by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Security, and then clicking Windows Firewall.
<br />
2. Click Turn Windows Firewall on or off.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3. Click Off (not recommended), and then click OK.<br />
Additional Information: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers from the manufactures website, the following steps will help you to uninstall
 and re-install drivers.<br />
1. Click Start, type Device Manager in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click Continue. The Device Manager Dialog box is displayed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. In the list of device types, click the kind of device, and then locate the specific device that is not functioning.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Right-click the device and then click Properties.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Click the Driver tab.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6. Click Uninstall.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7. Click OK.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8. In the Device Manager Dialog box, click the Action menu, and then click Scan for hardware changes.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>o You may receive a message that states that Windows has to install driver software for your unknown device. If you receive this message, click Locate and install driver software (recommended).
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>o You may also receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed and that the uninstalled device is now present
 in Device Manager.<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Safe Mode, Windows Update</h2>
                    Hello, Im not real savy at the pc so please be patient.This is Windows 7. When I start my pc it begins the process and just before I'm to sign in on the screen. It gets a dark grey almost black color and that is it. Then I push the reset button on the
 pc and it begins again only this time instead of the grey screen I get the option of starting in safe mode or normal or with networking so on. It will not start from there normally so the only way to the net is safe mode with networking. Then I am in safe
 mode and some of the devices I would like to use like a cam will not function. So I go to windows trouble shooter and it cant do all the things it should as we are in safe mode. Somewhere along the line I decide maybe a driver needs updating. However as I
 am sure you know Windows does not update in safe mode. Can anyone tell me where my problem lies and how to get starting in normal mode once again ? &nbsp;I believe I have said as much as I know. If I need to provide more info just let me

            Ok Sorry about my repost I thought maybe I had the wrong area. I am currently using windows 7 Home premium service pack 1, the 64 bit version. I do not know when the problem began just that its been going on for sometime therefor I don't know when the
 last update was that the pc was still working well. I know that last week it started a couple a times correctly with no problems and a couple a times when it got to the sign in page there was a message that said windows was unable to install updates do not
 turn off your computer until windows is done so when the message was gone I was able to sign in and start but this is after it was dedicated to starting in safe mode. Looking on here now I see we have AVG, McAfee, and 360 total security for virus protection.
 &nbsp;I think I answered what you asked if not ask me again I'm sorry about being so ignorant to this situation so please bear with me so I can get this going correctly

</em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Sony; Lenovo)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade&nbsp;a (e.g., Vista; WinXP)&nbsp;computer to Win7? </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Has Windows 10 ever been installed?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>2a. How long have AVG Free (I assume) and&nbsp;the McAfee application and 360 Total Security Free (I assume) been installed &amp; loading at boot?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Note: Only one (1) anti-virus application or security suite should be installed and loading at boot. There's a very good chance that neither AVG nor McAfee nor 360 Total Security is installed &amp; working properly!</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2b. What's the full name of the McAfee application (e.g., McAfee Internet Security; McAfee Security Center) and when (exact date) does your current subscription expire?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2c. What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a Norton application <em>or any other&nbsp;McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer

                    So I am getting this error when I try to install windows 7 .. I saw there was another post on this problem and the answer was to take out all the drives except the one your installing it on. Well I only have 1 hard drive connected and 1 CD ROM/DVD connected
 via SATA .. So not sure what to do. I've been reading forums and trying different things but nothing is working. Any help would be great.

So would I have to take my internal hard drive out of my comptuer and hook it up to another computer to run that utility?

So I tried formating the "Disk 0 Partition 1" drive, doesn't show C: drive anywhere, and it gave me an error message saying that it failed to format.</p>
<p>The link you gave me says to create a partition on one of the hard drives that not initialized .. how do I do that?</p>

<p>Yep just build the computer a few days ago, the hard drive is brand new and was never in use before. I'm not sure if I have to set up something in BIOS with RAID .. no idea what RAID is (I'm really new to all this). I don't know if I have to somehow install
 the drivers so I can write stuff onto the hard drive?? Haha no idea ...</p>

            <p>now when i fire BIOS up, right before the screen comes up, there are a few sentences that shoot down the screen, one of them being that there is no hard drive detected. Then when it gets into the BIOS main screen, it shows that the hard drive is recognized
 in one of the SATA ports in the "standard CMOS features" menu .. there is a section in the motherboard book for configuring "intel SATA RAID" but I'm not sure how to get into it. It says press ctr+I during POST but that doesn't work. Also does RAID configuration
 require at least two hard drives? Or can you use just one? I'm thinking I have to get up my hard drive in this RAID configuration section so that it gets recognized and then I can finally install windows 7 onto it. Any thoughts would be great, as you can see
 I'm very lost.</p>

Everything is compatible and BIOS does recognize the hard drive&nbsp;but its weird because right before the&nbsp;BIOS main menu comes up, the loading screen&nbsp;before it says that there was no hard drive detected. That message comes up for a&nbsp;brief second.&nbsp;I have been trying
 to keep reinstalling windows but its always stuck on the first screen that says "Copying Windows files (0% ...)" and it never goes past 0%. Then it says the thing about windows couldnt create the partition .. so yeah&nbsp;I guess my next step is to try and just&nbsp;test
 the hard drive on another computer, thanks for the help guys

            <p>Under normal circumstances, all you have to do&nbsp;is plug the drive in and not have to do anything to it.</p>
<p>Windows will take care of the formating and partitioning on it's own.</p>
<p>I would suspect you have a bad hard drive.</p>
<p>If another computer will recognize it, try to format it on the other PC.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is the correct forum, but I'll start here.</p>
<p>When I started up my computer I got the Remind_XP.exe error message.&nbsp; When I start up my Internet Browser, my regular home pages show up in a window, but I also get a second window with six tabs - three showing my C drive file structure and three trying
 to go to &lt;!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:Verdana; panose-1:2 11 6 4 3 5 4 4 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-1593833729 1073750107 16 0 415 0;} /* Style Definitions */

<p><span>Luckily the second window cannot find the server for the funky website address.&nbsp; The second window opens whenever I go to a new web page.&nbsp; I run Trend Micro, and their full scan shows no problems.<br />

<p><strong>Hi, I have been trying to reformat my 16GB flash drive on Windows 7 &nbsp;but after the formatting, it only says there is 950MB available (the other 14GB is unallocated). I have tried reformatting in NTFS, FAT, and FAT32 to no avail. Also, I have gone
 under the device manage and changed the policy option to better performance, but it didn't do anything. What should I do to get my full flash drive storage available again? Thanks!</strong></p>

<p>Hi Justin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your Bluetooth mouse or keyboard may not automatically pair with your Surface devices when not used for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you disable the option to <strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>. To do that, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the<span> </span><strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>In Device Manager, click the arrow next to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Bluetooth</strong>, and select the Bluetooth radio.</li><li>Right-click the Bluetooth radio and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Power Management</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab, and see if there is a check next to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, take note that you may still need to manually disconnect the keyboard or mouse to the Surface where it is paired with, before it can pair with the other Surface device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>
<p>

<p>Hi, you get the following crashes:</p>
<p><strong>VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (116) - Attempt to reset the display driver and recover from timeout failed</strong> . The cause is your nVIDIA graphics driver (nvlddmkm.sys - Sun Sep 06 03:31:30 2009). The version is very old, please make an update to the latest
 version!</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (3b) - An exception happened while executing a system service routine which is also caused by your old nVIDIA driver.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8 after new hard-disk added</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was already running Windows 10 on my laptop which was upgraded from Windows 8.1 (originally Windows 8 shipped by HP);
</p>
<p>Then my hard-disk crashed, I tried to recover using HP recovery and was able to recover to Windows 8.0, however I found that it is regularly giving me blue screen and crashing. When I ran the bios test on HDD it is showing me Fault hence I might have to
 replace my hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP rescue disk - USB - of Windows 8;</p>
<p>I also have created another rescue disk (Windows 10) however it was on SD-CARD which is somehow not bootable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my problem is I am planning to buy new Hard-disk (or SSD), I think I should be able to install Windows 8 from my HP rescue disk on that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, may I know whether it would be possible to upgrade or even freshly install Windows 10 directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Sid</p>
<p>

            <p>Because the computer has already had Windows 10 installed from the upgrade program it has a Digital Entitlement License issued. This allows you to upgrade or install Windows 10 throughout the life of the computer. For Microsoft Licensing puposes the motherboard
 is considered as the "computer". (you cannot do a "triggers broom" on it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not have to do an upgrade as a clean install will call on that DEL. Download the Windows 10 media from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest option is to use the USB option to create a bootable key. When the HP logo shows press the appropriate key for the one time boot menu (I think it is F11) and select the key which needs to be in the computer when switched on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run through setup clearing partitions (the recovery partition probably wont work anyway and you don't need it with this clean boot option available) and create a new one. Windows setup will create extra ones but they will be small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it gets to the point of asking for a key use the "I don't have a key" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once setup completes it will pick up the DEL.</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft

<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,

<h2>            Windows 10 Keeps Locking my Active Directory Account</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and how I am running into a strange issue. Every so often I will get a windows Authentication prompt in the IE window and a windows Alert "Windows needs Your Current Credentials: Please lock this computer, Then unlock it using
 your most recent password or smart card". If I immediatly lock my PC and unlock it I am fine but If I wait then it locks out my Active Directory Account. This did not happen on Windows 7,8 or 8.1. My event viewer under security is only throwing generic errors
 of&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Security:</p>
<p>ID 4673: Sensitive Privilege Use</p>
<p>ID 5152: Filtering Platform Packet Drop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find any one else having this issue on the web. My partner at work is experiencing the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Video transfer from Handycam to PC</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to transfer videos from my Sony Handycam Vision. The model is CCD-TRV108. I have connected the camera to an A/V cable that then connects to an HDMI cable that plugs into the computer. However, the computer does not recognize that the camera
 is connected. What should I look for/ do to fix this problem? Additionally, what should I do after that point? I have read many conflicting and confusing instructions and I am unsure which to follow. Thank you for your response.</p>

            The computer was an Apple MacBook Pro, which was turned on and was fully operational. There were no error messages. The computer recognized that an HDMI cable was plugged in but did not acknowledge any signals coming through it. This has not been a problem
 when other devices are connected to it.&nbsp;When the HDMI cable was connected directly to the TV the same situation happened, where no signal was being sent through to the TV. The TV (which we just bought under a month ago) is a new Samsung model #UN49KS8000F.
 This same problem was also present in our previous TV, a Samsung model #UN46C8000XF. Both TVs were on and working when the cable was plugged in. We tried connecting it (both the TV and the computer) when the Handycam was off, on, paused, or&nbsp;in a different
 setting, and then tried changing the status (off, on, paused, etc) once it was connected but no combination or series of steps led to any signal being recognized. The Handycam is in perfect condition as is still capable of record

            Are you running Windows 10 on the Mac? If so, what happens when you connect the camera using the Mac OS?<br />

Why are you asking this question on a Microsoft Windows 10 forum?<br />

            I thought that it might be a problem with the wires/ hardware part of it rather than the software since the Samsung TV experiences the same problem. I was asking the question here for help with that part of it. Also, no one on the OS forums knew what was
 going on and Sony refuses to respond.

            <p>This is the designed behavior of assert function in the Visual C++ Runtime. As for why it is called by an HP program, we don't know, you have to ask HP for that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very existence of such a call in production software puzzles me. The function is meant for software developers to catch bugs before publishing and&nbsp;<span>Visual C++ made extra effort to optimize assert calls away in
 production code.&nbsp;</span></p>
