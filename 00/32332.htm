<h2>            Can&#39; Log Into Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all.<br />
Acer Aspire 5738Z laptop.<br />
Boots and gets to welcome screen.<br />
Does not show any users so there is no way to log in.<br />
There are 2 users on the laptop, both admins, one password protected one not.<br />
I've tried system restore and repair but no go.<br />
I need to recover data before any clean install but was wondering if there is some way to repair before I go down this route.</p>

<p>Hi Pegasus.</p>
<p>No I can't get to safe mode.</p>
<p>I used the F8 option on boot up.<br />
This takes you to Advanced Boot Options where you can opt for 'Repair Your Computer' along with safe mode etc.<br />
When you choose this option you are taken to 'System Recovery Options' where you can choose from 'Start Up Repair', 'System Restore', etc etc&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the dozens of posts I have dealt with during the past two months yours is the first one that demonstrated good familiarity with with Repair Mode as invoked with F8. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Accounts become invisible at the logon screen because of a certain registry modification. When you perform a System Restore then the registry gets restored to a previous state. Since this did not fix your problem, I wonder whether you have some malware or
 virus infection that has caused further damage somewhere else.</p>
<p>I recommend you create a couple of new accounts, using the process below. The procedure is involved and requires some careful typing but since you appear to be familiar with trouble-shooting processes I think you will have no problem.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tape the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator ppp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to set the Administrator's password to ppp)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Admin2 xxx /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To create an account for Admin2 with a password of xxx)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Admin3 yyy /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators Admin2 Admin3 /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To promote the new accounts to administrator level)<br />
13. Reboot and log on under a new account.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.</p>
<p>Please come back with the results.</p>

<p>Hi Pegasus.</p>
<p>Great reply.<br />
Hope this works.<br />
I've booted using a boot cd you recommended to someone else.<br />
It loads some files and goes to the 'System Recovery Options' window.<br />
I choose the english UK keyboard option and then the Windows 7 OS which tells me it is (C:) ACER.<br />
I click next and&nbsp;choose the 'Command Prompt' option.<br />
I get 'x:\windows\system32&gt;'&nbsp; I type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter.<br />
I get 'Volume in drive C is ACER<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volume Serial Number is ****-****<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directory of C:\</p>
<p>09/25/2010&nbsp;&nbsp; 06:47 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;DIR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 File&lt;s&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 bytes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Dir&lt;s&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 140,361,842,688&nbsp; bytes&nbsp; free</p>
<p>X :\windows\system32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to press the up arrow on the ketboard to get the C:\Win*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prompt then I typed the first command at point 8 in your reply and loads of files flashed by including names such as 'WINSOCK.DLL'&nbsp;&nbsp; 'WINSPOOL.EXE' etc etc etc
 etc.<br />
Is this right??</p>
<p>It then gave me the X :\windows\system32&gt; prompt again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the C:\Win*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prompt again&nbsp;and typed the second command and got</p>
<p>'Volume in drive C is ACER<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volume Serial Number is ****-****<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directory of C:\</p>
<p>File Not Found</p>
<p>&nbsp;Volume in drive X is Boot<br />
Volume serial number is ****-****</p>
<p>Directory of X:\windows\system32</p>
<p>File Not Found</p>
<p>&nbsp;Directory of X:\</p>
<p>07/13/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; 07:04&nbsp; PM&nbsp;&nbsp; and loads more times andtoo much stuff to write.<br />
<br />
Have I missed something??</p>
<p>Just shutting it down for the night and it tells me it is instaling update 1 of 2.<br />
So one of the accounts must be logged on and it is peforming automatic updates.<br />
This is a very strange situation.<br />
You are right about the registry modification and this is how it came about......</p>
<p>I wanted to test a laptop HDD from a Acer Aspire 5738Z running Vista.<br />
My daughters laptop is the same model running Windows 7.<br />
I put the HDD I wanted testing in to my daughters laptop.<br />
It booted fine so I swapped them back.<br />
When I booted my daughters laptop it was showing the user accounts from the other HDD??<br />
I rebooted, it wanted to run a checkdisc but I pressed a key to bypass it.<br />
It booted and all was well, there were the users that should be there.<br />
I switched it off.<br />
My daughter turned it on some time later and it ran a checkdisc showing thousands of files flying by on the screen.<br />
Many mentioned 'orphaned files'.<br />
Since it did this I haven't been able to get into the laptop.<br />
It boots, the welcome screen appears but there are no user names, no way of logging in.<br />
It just has a blue language select icon top left, a icon bottom left to do with options for ease of access, the shut down/restart icon bottom right and the 'Windows 7 Home Premium' logo accross the bottom.<br />
Pegasus, somehow the hdd I was testing left info on the laptop, I reinstalled the original HDD and it all went pear shaped.</p>
<p>Noone I have spoken to has ever heard of this , have you??</p>

<p>You need to re-read Step 7:<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".</p>
<p>From your report it appears that whenever I wrote Q: you must write X:. On the other hand it is not clear from your report what commands you actually typed. When you write<em>I typed the first command at point 8</em> then I do not know if you typed<br />
<em>cd /d C:\windows\System32 {Enter}</em> <br />
or<br />
<em>cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}</em> <br />
or perhaps<br />
<em>cd /d X:\windows\System32 {Enter}</em> <br />
You need to take great care to be specific in your report. Remember that I cannot see your machine.</p>
<p>There is no need for anyone to be logged for updates to be downloaded. They are fetched by a background service.</p>
<p>Installing a Windows 7 disk in another machine and booting from that disk is a bad idea. At best Windows will blue-screen straight away. At worst Windows will try to find its new feet by making all sorts of modifications to the registry and to the system
 files. I fear that your installation is cooked and beyond salvation. If it was my machine then I would back up my personal files (including my EMail files), then reload Windows.</p>

<p>Sorry for any confusion.<br />
I know it is difficult via typed messages. Trying to get across what I have done is hard but as long as you are ok I will keep trying.</p>
<p>I saw the X but you wrote&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:</strong></p>
<p>So when I saw the X I thought it was wrong.<br />
I will try again later, shame I have to go to work, I enjoy the learning curve and by jiminy these things get your brain ticking.</p>
<p>BTW, i'd like to get a few bits of data off it if I can before going further.<br />
I'm ok with a clean install though I would need to get the discs from the manufacturer as they did the usual, pre installed with no actual hard copy.<br />
I've tried viewing the drive using Macrium Reflect (a linux based recovery disc) and I can see that the data is there but there is no provision on the version I have to copy it to disc.<br />
Would it be best to get a S-ATA&nbsp; to&nbsp; IDE adaptor and slave it to my pc or is there something else I could use?</p>

<p>Microsoft requires all PC manufacturers to include one of the following:<br />
- A Windows 7 installation DVD<br />
- A recovery partition<br />
- A factory restore DVD</p>
<p>What it is in your case I do not know. You need to check the manual that you received with your PC. Alternatively you can approach the manufacturer's help desk and ask how to perform a Factory Restore.</p>
<p>You have several options to save your data:<br />
- With console commands while in Repair Mode<br />
- With your linux recovery CD<br />
- With this Ubuntu boot CD. It includes a GUI file manager.<br />
(http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/)<br />
- By slaving it to your PC with a SATA to IDE adapter<br />
- By slaving it to your PC with a SATA PCI card</p>
<p>This would be a good time to review your backup policy. This time your files are probably safe. Next time you might have a corrupted partition from which nothing is retrievable.</p>

<p>I've sent a e-mail to Acer to ask about recovery cds or whatever.<br />
No reply as yet, supposed to be 24hrs.</p>
<p>I can't backup with my Linux disc, like I wrote, there is no provision for backup with the version I have.</p>
<p>I think the best bet may be to use an adaptor and see what I can see.</p>
<p>It's not my backup policy, like I said this is my daughters laptop, i've told her again and again to put photos, music, college work etc etc&nbsp;on a DVD but she is a typical 18 year old and has 'more important things to do' though I think this episode may have
 woke her up.</p>
<p>So regarding the X:, C:, whatever it was, should I have put X or what??<br />
Was it a surprise to you that it was X as you said it wouldn't be??</p>
<p>I understand your reluctance to continue, that isn't a problem and I thank you for your input.</p>

<p>I have a one-year old Acer laptop. When I first set it up it prompted me to burn some CDs/DVDs, namely:<br />
- A driver DVD<br />
- A factory restore DVD<br />
- A Repair CD</p>
<p>I also had a factory recovery partition on the hard disk. When booting the machine with the Repaid CD then I could have invoked the factory restore process.</p>
<p>The Ubuntu disk I mentioned gives you full access to the file system and to external mass storage devices.</p>
<p>When I said that the drive letter could not be X: then I meant that it could not be X:. You must use the drive letter where the folder \Windows is visible. In other words:<strong>Use the command dir ?:\Win* until you find the folder ?:\Windows where ? can
 be any letter between C and U.</strong>I do not know how else I can write this instruction.</p>
<p>In view of the history of your installation I doubt that you can salvage it.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand what should have been done regarding making a recovery cd when the laptop was new.<br />
Unfortunately it wasn't, like I said, it isn't my machine but that is in the past and can't be put right.</p>
<p>The confusion I had regarding the notorious X: is that in your original instructions you wrote</p>
<p><strong>It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:.</strong> <br />
<strong><br />
until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".</strong></p>
<p>So I assumed I shouldn't write X as it would not be X.<br />
Then you wrote</p>
<p><strong>From your report it appears that whenever I wrote Q: you must write X:.</strong></p>
<p>My confusion has arisen as I took it that in the first instance you were telling me not to use X and in the second instance you were telling me I should have used X.<br />
I'm not saying that is what you meant but that is how I read it.</p>

            Hi ramensondiaz
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to       
        </p>

<h3> mike300zxna  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP 12 in Windows 10 won&#39;t convert .flac when syncing to Windows Phone Lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>I have been waiting for Windows 10 for a long time particularly because it was supposed to have native support for .flac.</p>
<p>I had the Win 10 upgrade this week (on my Vostro 3460 running Win 7 Pro) and quite pleased so far.</p>
<p>WMP is at version 12 and, as normal/expected, if I sync lossless .wma files to my Lumia, it converts to a smaller size for use on the device.</p>
<p>However when, from the same Library, I try to sync .flac to the same phone in the same way, there is an error message which says the filetype may not be supported. The same file does play in WMP as normal and with no error.</p>
<p>So it appears .flac support is not yet 100% in WMP 12 under Win 10.</p>
<p>When will this be fixed?&nbsp;I have a large library of both .flac and .wma and would dearly love to have just one Media Player which can sync my music to my Lumia. Thanks</p>
<p>PS I know this is not Groove but I have Win 10 and a question about Music so where else should I post?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having&nbsp;difficulties with an audio files conversion using Windows Media Player&nbsp;on your Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are very much right in understanding that the files will have to be converted in order to be usable on your Windows Phone device, as Flac is not a natively supported audio format on Windows Phone Operating System.<br />
<br />
I have moved your post to a more relevant forum section for better exposure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly hope this will help in finding solution to your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Marek&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you Marek. My point is that WMP has several formats it recognises and uses. With Windows 10, this now includes officially .flac so .flac is supported by WMP natively. Good step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, WMP converted all the formats it read for sync with Windows Phone. For example, lossless .wma is converted during the sync process to a lossy format which is usable on the Windows Phone connected to the PC. This is desired behaviour as it reduces
 the size of the music file to fit on the limited space on the phone. It does the same if you use a USB stick as the sync device (and have set the WMP Device options accordingly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it does not convert the now officially supported .flac in the same way. Why not? it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Windows Phone does not support .flac natively (unless you install .flac player). Which is why WMP should convert it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Win 10, the natively supported format of lossless .wma gets converted by WMP while syncing to Windows Phone into a format usable by the native player on Windows Phone. This is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Win 10, the natively supported format of .flac does NOT get converted by WMP while syncing to Windows Phone into a format usable by the native player on Windows Phone. Why not? This is not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to have two windows music systems on my PC and on my phone - I just want Windows 10, Windows Media Player and Windows Phone to support the same file types in the same way. Why would Microsoft want me to install non-Microsoft apps?</p>

            Ashish, your information is incorrect. Windows 10 native support for flac was announced by Gabriel Aul (Microsoft VP WDG Engineering Systems) last year
<span>
<p>https://twitter.com/GabeAul/status/537376407291056128</p>
<p>If you check Microsoft Supported Audio and Video Codecs </p>
<span>
<p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh986969.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396 you will see flac is listed "<span>*</span> Support introduced in Windows&nbsp;10." The same page also lists the ability to transcode
</p>
<span>
<p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh452806.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</p>
<p>(BTW there has also been a Microsoft official announcement that flac support will be extended to Windows 10 Mobile
</p>
<span>
<p>https://twitter.com/joebelfiore/status/560524791266811904 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, my Win 10 upgrade plays flac both by Groove and by WMP. Maybe you should look at a Win 10 environment before posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at the moment, WMP does not downconvert and transcode FLAC into lossy WMA or MP3 for it's built-in sync from WMP to Windows Phone. It does this for all the lossless other file formats it reads like WAV or lossless WMA(has done for years). So when will
 it fix the native support for FLAC it now has to act the same way?</p>

            <p>I have the same issue.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Media player supports and plays flac (with some tag issues), but when synching to a device that only supports 320kbps it ignores the flac file and fails to sync it.</p>
<p>WMA lossless does convert to WMA 320kbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will WMP work for flac as well?</p>

            <p>As a note related to this, despite the fact that WMP 12 seems to be able to play flac audio, it also is not able to burn flac to an audio CD, which makes little sense since the raw waveform data that goes to an Audio CD is practically the same as what goes
 to your soundcard&nbsp;DAC and on to&nbsp;the speakers in analog form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it comes out of our speakers, we can get from flac&nbsp;to waveform, so why isn't it possible to convert that waveform to CD audio, mp3 or wma?</p>

            <p>Same disappointment over here after I converted my whole collection (+17K tracks) &nbsp;from WMA lossless to FLAC.</p>
<p>I have no clue now how to sync my music with my android phone. Except for manualy converting and copying.&nbsp;<br />
Sad to see that powerhouse applications like WMP are being replaced with apps that can't do anything else but play and let you buy music.</p>
<p>I even had to turn of FLAC native windows support because some things did not work.</p>
<p>My feelings is that WMP is going to be excommunicated because they already made it a disaster to use since last couple windows versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a shame to see that probably the best music app for maintaining and listening music I ever seen over a few decades is falling out of grace by it's makers.</p>
<p>It's really a shame.</p>

<p>Syncing with phone doesn't work and I can't make a CD with track selections.</p>
<p>This means I have to use MP3 copies in addition to FLAC on my PC.</p>
<p>Microsoft is driving customers away from using MediaPlayer by not paying attention to these details that make the experience seamless.</p>
<p>Also the interface in MediaPlayer needs to be made scalable for high resolution PC screens.</p>
<p>I hope they see this as vital to long term customer retention.</p>

            <p>In fact, it's worse than that. I have found a work-round for this using a third party media file manager (won't post the name except the first letter is the one after "I" and the second bit rhymes with river). This will convert flac into many other formats
 on the fly while syncing to your Windows Phone or USB stick etc. Like WMP should. And as a bonus, it will keep the converted copies locally so you don't have to convert again. Plus, a tip from Mike here, if you set this local convert directory to be in your
 OneDrive, you automatically build a OneDrive music library as you copy stuff to your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except you shouldn't have to do this, you should just be able to keep all your music including flac in OneDrive and have it play on any of your devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there isn't an app for this - there is for the iThings and Android but not Windows Phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not only am I encouraged to not use WMP because it doesn't support flac fully but also I am further encouraged to ditch Windows Phone / Mobile because there's no app for the workround...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having supported Windows Mobile since Compaq iPAQ, I am beginning to despair...</p>

            Windows 10 does natively support flac. If you copy and paste a flac file into your phone using Windows Explorer, it would ask you whether you want to convert it or not. Answering yes would convert the file to wma. So I don't understand why WMP is not updated
 to do that too.<br />

    <title>Casting to device locks my PC up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iainpurdie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Casting to device locks my PC up</h2>
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago I could cast to my Samsung TV easily and it was great. Right click on media file "Cast To...", select the only device from the pop-up and the miniature player appeared on my desktop so I could control the volume and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to stream a file this morning and it failed rather spectacularly. When I select the TV from the pop-up I get a message at the top of my TV screen saying it's trying to connect to my PC, which after a while tells me it couldn't connect and that I
 should try streaming from a mobile device instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC I now get a little bar at the top of the screen which was never there before. It randomly says I'm either connected to the TV or not. If it thinks I am then I have access to a "cog" menu where I can select one of three options (desktop, watching
 video, playing games) which seem to do nothing. The old pop-up player no longer appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the video file starts to play on my PC for some reason (using VLC, my default media player). I don't know why. When I streamed before, the file played on the TV, not on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try too many times, my PC locks up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through all the media streaming settings, reset them all and ensured that sharing is as open as possible. I've checked network drivers, reset my router, and run Windows Update so everything's up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume, especially given this screen-top bar, that there's been a change to the software courtesy of an update.</p>

<p>I have - somehow - got it working, although it's still flaky. I think what sorted it was resetting all my network settings (via Control Panel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this I had:</p>
<p>
</p><p>updated all of my drivers (network, sound, graphics)</p>
<p>updated Windows (well, checked - it was already up to date)</p>
<p>removed devices from device manager and re-installed them to ensure no file errors</p>
<p>removed the TV from my external devices and re-added it</p>
<p>scanned the hard drive</p>
<p>scanned the system files</p>
<p>reset the TV</p>
<p>checked TV had up-to-date firmware / software updates</p>
<p>checked that other devices could cast (they can)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now back to a situation I was in some time ago where I can now cast, but I also have two devices to cast to... and both of them are the same TV. If I click on the black one, the TV says it's trying to connect, fails and the video plays on my desktop.
 If I click on the white one, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing crashes at the moment. Touch wood!</p>

<h2>            My Gmail accounts in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>Original title: GMAIL ACCOUNTS AT WINDOWS LIVE</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am maintaining 2 gmail accounts / addresses in my Windows Live 2011 Program, where I can download all my</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incoming messages, send outgoing&nbsp;messages,&nbsp;and transfer incoming/outgoing mails&nbsp;to Storage folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions :&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I switched to Outlook.com Program, will&nbsp;my 2 gmail accounts / addresses be transferred&nbsp;also to this Outlook program&nbsp;??</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I still be able to send / receive e-mail messages on these 2 gmail accounts/addresses ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Storage Folders - I organize my incoming / outgoing e-mails in the Storage Folders for efficient review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I switch to Outlook program, will the contents of these Storage Folders be&nbsp;transferred also to this new Outlook program&nbsp;??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will appreciate your earliest reply.</p>

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. We are experiencing high volume of inquiries. By the way, let me help you with your concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"1. Will this mean that, if I switch to Outlook.com, my 2 G-mail accounts will be lost. However, if I want to retain these 2 G-mail accounts - then all I need to do is set up gain these 2 G-mail accounts under Outlook.com - similar to the set-up I did
 under the Windows Live 2011 program?"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your two Gmail accounts will not be affected by the upgrade. You can still use those email accounts in Windows Live Mail as long as the POP3/SMTP settings are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can send and receive Gmail emails using Outlook.com. Here's how to send and receive emails using your other email account in Outlook.com:</p>
<p><br />
1. Go to <a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> and sign in with your Microsoft account<br />
2. Click the <strong>Gear</strong> icon and select <strong>More mail settings</strong><br />
3. Under <strong>Managing your account</strong> category, click <strong>Your email accounts</strong><br />
4. Click <strong>Add a send-and-receive account</strong></p>
<p>5. Follow the instructions provided on the page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Outlook.com is different from Windows Live Mail. Outlook.com is the new web-based email service of Microsoft, whereas Windows Live Mail is an email client or program which is installed on your&nbsp;computer. Both use the internet to
 read and send mail.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"2. Re Storage Folders - do not understand what you are saying that e-mails stored in the Storage Folders are stored in my PC. Is it not that when you switch to Outlook.com program, the Windows Live Program will be erased ?? If yes, then the e-mails
 I transferred to the Storage Folders under Windows Live Program will be erased too - is this correct ??"</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. When you upgraded your email account to Outlook.com, Windows Live Mail will not be erased as well as its emails. Outlook.com and Windows Live Mail have different set of platforms and works in different ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mail client -&nbsp;a software installed on your computer that you use to read and send emails. The advantage of using an email client is that the emails are stored on your computer and those emails are accessible faster than using a web based email interface.
 You can also read the received emails without being connected to the internet. You can also create a new email while offline. Once you connected again to the Internet, the emails can be sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Webmail - &nbsp;you can read or send email through your internet browser and the web mail interface such as Hotmail and Outlook.com. You can access your email accounts using your email account's website. (<a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hotmail.com</a> or
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a>).</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Direct3D DxDiag Thing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joanne martin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Direct3D DxDiag Thing</h2>
                    Whenever I open games or things that take a while to load, Windows 10 seems to crash the application. I was told to open DxDiag and see what that said and the first time I opened it, it crashed... Second time it said "DxDiag has detected that there might
 have been a problem accessing Direct3D..." I think this has something to do with my applications crashing, is there a solution?

            <p><span>Hi Joanne,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do understand your concern however, you may update the latest graphics card drivers and check:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press “<strong>Windows Logo + X</strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on “<strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>” from that list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Search for the <strong>Graphics Card</strong> device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong>Delete the driver software
 for this device</strong>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the <strong>on-screen</strong> instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the restart, please open the Device Manager again and then click on the “<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>” button. Check if Windows detects the Graphics Card device and installs an appropriate driver automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Run the SFC/SCANNOW&nbsp;</span></strong><span>and check if helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Left click on <strong>Start</strong> button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Admin) option which will let you run
<strong>'Run as administrator</strong>’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Command Prompt Window pops up.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type:&nbsp; SFC&nbsp;/SCANNOW and hit Enter.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the links. The second bytescribe link worked perfectly! I just had to make sure that Yahoo Messenger was shut down before I installed the codec. Then, when I started Messenger again the conference function was working.

Sadly, Yahoo was no help. They know this is an issue and their advice was to contact Microsoft.<br />

<h2>            Change the account from US to Europe &#40;Germany&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys. In the past few days I've had terrible experience with the service and couldn't find any solution.</p>
<p><br />
I have a windows Live ID account that has been made in the past. I live in Germany, but my region is set to US, which I can't recall if it was by default or if I set it on purpose like that (which would be kind of stupid, don't you think?).</p>
<p><strong>I want to change my region to Germany but I can't see how this is possible.</strong></p>
<p>I read everything in the forum (Managing accounts), in the Billing information (billing.microsoft_or_something.com), found out that there is only phone support for Games for Windows Live (which sucks, I don't plan to call the US) and tried everything else
 I could think of and I can't! Now, having an account with this region is fine but I cannot add MSpoints because the minute I click on redeem code I get reverted to the first page (tried with 3 browsers) and when I try to buy points in the conventional way
 it wants my US address.</p>
<p>So, when I choose "migrate accounts" I get a list of countries like Hungary, Russia and China or something but I do not get Germany. I read that 'Xbox live' is not available in Germany'. I decided for the sake of completeness, to change the region down on
 the page and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">then</span> create a new account. On the next step, it is asking me for a land and I choose Germany and everything is
<strong>fine</strong> and <strong>working -</strong>&nbsp;I can buy stuff, redeem code, etc.&nbsp;(that is what happend with my US account probably, as I always choose English as a language and it has probably set it for US by default).</p>

<p>Yet I do not want to start all over again with my game (AOEO, I wanted to buy premium content), so is there a way, to get it to work for Germany, with my original account?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm afraid that it isn't possible at the present time to migrate from the US to Germany, just the new countries that recently became officially supported. Since you have a German account, simply download DLC with that and it'll be available for use under
 your main tag, avatar items excluded of course.</p>

<p>Ohhh, that is a pity! Thanks anyways!</p>
<p>P.s., so you mean, if I buy points with the German account, buy the premium content, install it and then log in with my US account it would work? Because Age of Empires Online requires login to play and when I log with my German account all the progress
 is gone, so I wonder If I get a premium pack wouldn't it be only for this account (it is an online game, I see this perfectly working for a standalone game).</p>

<p>It should work with your US account if you purchase it with your German one. DLC bought, and downloaded, works perfectly well with one account works perfectly for me on another when playing my GFWL games.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have recently updated your driver through Windows Update, you may use system restore to restore Windows to an earlier point in time, called system restore point. Restore points are created when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update. Restoring
 won't affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. You may restore from a system restore point in Windows 10 by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start </strong>button, then type <strong>Control Panel</strong>, then choose it from the search results.</li><li>Search <strong>Control Panel </strong>for <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Open System Restore </strong>&gt; <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next </strong>&gt; <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn't turned on. To check, go to
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for <strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select
<strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Configure System Restore </strong>&gt; <strong>Configure
</strong>and make sure <strong>Turn on system protection </strong>is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you only want the driver to be restored, you can roll back the driver. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click the driver, and then select <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>, and then choose
<strong>Yes</strong>. (Note that some drivers don't provide a rollback option.</li><li>After the rollback is complete, restart your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>

<p>We appreciate the update. If after uninstalling the driver and Windows does not find a new driver for your device, you may look for the drivers on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions from there. After installing the drivers, restart
 your computer. After restarting, see if the issue persists.</p>

<h2>            access denied error when disabling indexing</h2>
                    I've tried to disable indexing through the control panel Indexing Options but it won't let me exclude My Documents, Pictures, Start Menu etc. So I went to drive properties and unchecked "Index this drive ..." but when I clicked ok and indicated I want
 it applied to all subfolders and files it returned an access denied error right away. The option is now unchecked in the properties dialog but I have no idea if the disable has been implemented. Also Vista won't let me stop Windows Search Service... they didn't
 mention this in the Mojave ads ;)

<div>HI Michael,<br />
The indexing error is normal as some files cannot be stopped because Windows is using them.<br />
It shouldn’t hurt anything and as long as you skipped the file and let the process continue the indexing was undone or is that the De-indexing finished? Either way… it ought to have finished.<br />
<br />
I am going to “split” your post as disabling the Windows Search Service is a different question and we want everyone to easily find just what they need.<br />
<br />
I've already posted this once but it went away. Excuse me if this double posts. :-)</div>

<h2>            What would happen if I merged my Program File x86 Folders on a different hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    I have three Hard drives in my PC and want to combine the Program Files x86 folders from the following locations into one folder on the third Hard drive.
<br />
Total Sizes<br />
C: Drive is a 128 Gb SSD drive with Windows 7 64bit Installed . Drives D: (With Windows XP Installed) and F: are each 500 Gb 7200 rpm HDD Drives.<br />
<br />
Old Locations<br />
C:\windows.old\Program Files (x86) : From a Windows XP install previously<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : From Windows 7 <br />
D:\Program Files (x86)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Windows XP Hard drive<br />
<br />
Location to move to<br />
F:\Program Files (x86)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Backup Drive to consolidate/merge files to<br />
<br />
My question is, what would happen if i merged all the folders together into one and deleted the folders from their current location, other than broken shortcuts maybe?<br />

            <p>Only C:\Program Files(x86) is actually active, unless since the last installation of Windows you have actually told a programs installer to use one of the other locations they are irrelevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relocating the C:\Program Files(x86) folder is not simple and unsupported as it is defined in the registry. If you want to reduce the size of the folder you have to reinstall the applications and where they provide a custom install option use that to set
 an alternative location.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Xbox Game DVR Background Recording picking up all computer audio regardless of settings</h2>
                    No matter what I try, background recorded captures contain audio from programs other than the game I'm playing. The only relevant setting I can find: a checkbox that states "Record game audio only", has no effect on this. I haven't been able to find any
 information about this particular issue online, so I'm hoping that someone on here is able to help me out with this.

            Hi  HibbleJibble 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Turn the Game Bar on or off in Windows 10:
<br />1. Navigate to the Xbox app within Windows 10.
<br />
<br />2. Select Settings and then Game DVR.
<br />
<br />3. Turn ‘Record game clips and screenshots using Game DVR’ to off.
<br />
<br />Turn the Game Bar on or off in Windows 10 using the registry:
<br />
<br />1. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\GameDVR.
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Change the AppCaptureEnabled DWORD value to 0 to turn it off. Change it to 1 to turn it back on.
<br />
<br />3. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\GameConfigStore.
<br />
<br />
<br />4. Change the GameDVR_Enabled DWORD value to 0 to turn it off. Change it to 1 to turn it back on.
<br />
<br />To remove the Game Bar altogether:
<br />If you would like to remove the Xbox app altogether, try this.
<br />
<br />1. Open a Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Type or paste Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />
<br />3. Let the process complete.
<br />
<br />Let us know how it turns out.

            <p>More information would be helpful.&nbsp; Windows XP did not support the WPA2 wireless encryption suite until SP3, so if you don't have SP3 installed and are trying to authenticate on a WPA2-protected network, it may not work.<br />
<br />
Assuming you do have SP3 installed, try going into your wireless network configuration / setup screen.&nbsp; (There are several different wireless configurations, including ZeroConfig,&nbsp;but we don't know which one you're using).&nbsp; Most all of them save previous wireless
 connections in a "profile" so that when it encounters that wireless connection again, it knows how to configure itself.&nbsp; Find the profile section of your configuration screen, look for the SSID of the router you are trying to connect to, and if you see it,
 then delelete that profile.&nbsp; This will then allow your machine to reconnect to the wireless router with an open mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

<h3> gkensatterfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resume with Login screen that says locked.</h2>
                    <p>On a few occasions -- a drained battery, shutting the lid for too long -- my laptop running Windows 7 will resume with a logon screen that says LOCKED. It will let me type for about 5 seconds to enter password, but even if successful, the computer is still
 locked. (If not, I cannot type anything.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can do a manual reboot. That is what I always have to do. But I have looked for a better solution. It is not in the screen saver settings or power settings, which I've tried.

            No this did not help. The troubleshooter changes makes the screen sleep faster. Now if it is asleep for a while when the screen wakes up it is locked on whatever screen had shown, rather than the login screen being locked.

            <p>This in fact did not help. Running troubleshooter made the screen go into sleep mode sooner, but it also caused the screen to lock when revived (without being on the login page).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that was a step backwards. </p>

                    <p><span>I have a boot problem where when I turn on my computer, it goes to a blue recovery screen with an error code: 0xc000000e, tho I have figured a way around this problem by turning my pc off, then unpluging the D:\ drive from the motherboard, then turning
 on the pc (it goes to EFI Shell), then turning off the PC and then i power it back up and now it sudenly works. This method works for only one boot, you turn off the PC and try to turn it on again, same problem and the same fix works but this is pretty time
 consuming but the biggest problem is that I can't install any new updates. The problem started occuring after instaling either the aniversery update or the first creators update.</span>Does anyone know how to fix this properely?</p>

            Hi Cadriene,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Method 1: Restart the computer by force&nbsp;shut down.</strong><br />
Once the computer restarts check if you are getting the same error message. If the error message exists, perform Method 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Perform Startup repair</strong><br />
I would suggest you to perform a startup repair using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps.<br />
a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
b) In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.<br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’.&nbsp;<br />
d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>Method 3: System restore</span></b></font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If automatic repair didn’t help, then I would suggest you to perform a System restore with the same Windows 8 disc and check. Refer to this steps:</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>b) Restart the computer, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>c) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>d) Select the correct time and Keyboard type.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>e) Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>f) Click on Troubleshooting, advanced option and then click System repair and follow the prompts.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved or if you have any further queries related to Windows, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</font></font></font></span></p>

    <title>Xbox One S und Kinect Adapter Probleme - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raikenpm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S und Kinect Adapter Probleme</h2>
                    <p>Hallo alle zusammen,</p>
<p>ich weiß nicht ob es dazu schon was im Forum gibt, da ich ne weile nicht mehr hier war und im neuen Forum nicht mehr durchblicke. Die Suche hat jedenfalls nix ausgespuckt.</p>
<p>Zu meinem Problem:</p>
<p>Ich habe kürzlich meine Day One Xbox One gegen eine Xbox One S eingetauscht und mir den kostenlosen Kinect Adapter von Microsoft bestellt. Jetzt ist alles angeschlossen und funktioniert soweit wenn die Xbox One S an ist.</p>
<p>Aber ich kann die Xbox überhaupt nicht mit Sprachbefehl starten obwohl das nötige Häckchen dazu in den Einstellungen gesetzt ist sowie der Stanby Modus aktiv ist. Ich habe es mit aktiven Cortana probiert: "Hey Cortana Xbox einschalten" und mit deaktiviertem Cortana: " Xbox einschalten". Wenn die Konsole läuft funktioniert Kinect bestens. Ich weiß jetzt nicht wo das Problem ist. liegts vllt. am neuen Update? An der Xbox One S oder am Adapter.
</p>
<p>Ein Support sagt ich solle meine Konsole Komplett austecken, alle Kabel raus und vom Strom entfernen. Sowie meinen Account neu anmelden. Danach ging es für 2 Tage und jetzt geht's wieder nicht.</p>
<p>Hat hier jemand einen Tip für mich?</p>

            <p>Ich weiß nicht, ob Du einfach länger warten musst, oder ob es daran liegt, dass ich noch die "alte" Day One Xbox habe, aber wenn ich "Hey Cortana, Xbox Anschalten" sage, dauert es einen kleinen Moment, dann geht das Xbox Lämpchen am Kinect an, dann dauert es nochmal einen Moment, und dann geht erst die Konsole an und spielt den Startsound.&nbsp;</p><p>Der Vorgang dauert also gefühlt länger als früher, als ich im Wohnzimmer "Xbox Anschalten" gesagt habe, und die Konsole hat direkt das Einschalt-Düdelüt gespielt.</p><p>Oder geht es rein garnicht?<br /></p>

<p><span>Nobody is "hacking" you, hence there is no such thing on Xbox LIVE. So you don't have to worry about that.</span></p>

<p>You could also log into your account on here then check the status box under your bio while you're away from your console. If it says you were playing while at work or are currently playing something then you know someone's playing it.

<p><span><span>The link is for an English (USA) language copy. Say if you need a different language version.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will need first to create a new partition (call it J partition) taking 50gb disk space from your C partition. I suggest you use Easeus Partition Master (freeware)
 to resize your C partition and create J partition.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first step is to reduce the size of C by 50gb to create unallocated space after C of 50gb. This enables you to create your new partition in the unallocated space.
 When you have done the above apply the changes. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This page from the Easeus web site explains visually how to reduce the size of your C partition:

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When the new partition has been created, you can download and run set up from within J partition to repair your existing Windows installation. It doesn’t work if you
 try to run set up from your C partition. The alternative is to burn a DVD. The instructions to follow are at 4. Repair Installed Windows 7 SP1 using Windows 7 with SP1 ISO
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you have completed the instructions in Step 4 you move to Step 7 and then work down the list. The process takes several hours so if you choose to try it make
 sure you set aside sufficient time to complete the Upgrade. When it has completed you will need to activate and then run Windows Update to bring the system completely up to date. To safeguard against something going wrong I recommend you create a system image
 using Windows BackUp and Restore before you start.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should also back up your data files to external media before starting on the In Place Upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An In Place Upgrade leaves all your installed programmes, settings and data files undisturbed. This has considerable advantages over a restore to factory settings,
 where everything has to be rebuilt from scratch. The only things you will need to do are to activate Windows 7 using your product key and reinstall all windows updates post the Windows 7 SP1 update. When you have finished you can leave J partition as it is
 or delete the partition and return the space to C partition.</span></span></p>
