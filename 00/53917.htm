<h2>            Windows 7 Professional &#34;Recovered&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with my system and did a recovery that created a virtual G: drive called System Reserved. Now when my computer boots up it asks me if I want to boot-up to the normal C" drive or to the Windows 7 Professional "Recovered" version. If I try
 to bot to the normal Windows 7 on the C: drive it fails but it does boot-up to the virtual G: drive but it won't update correctly and I really don't want 2 versions running.</p>
<p>How can I get that recovered version over to the normal C: drive and make the system whole again ?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method &nbsp;1</strong> : Perform Startup repair and check if the issue is resolved or not.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method &nbsp;2</strong> : Boot into Windows and then&nbsp;check to see what partition Windows is installed on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type %systemroot% </li><li>Press Enter on your keyboard</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The address that is displayed in the Address bar will be similar to C:\Windows (the partition may be different if Windows has&nbsp;truly been installed onto another partition)</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p>

            <p>No, I wish that it had helped.</p>
<p>Method 1 I've done several times but it doesn't help any.</p>
<p>Method 2 only brings me into the Windows root directory but doesn't do anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I keep having to boot up into a virtual drive G: called System Reserved. What I need is the instructions on how to take that recovered version of Windows on the G: drive and use it to fix the non-working copy on my C: drive.</p>

            Hi bmxRob 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hello bmxRob,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try this procedure.
<br />Shutdown/restart three times via power button.
<br />Then Windows recovery environment will open.
<br />
<br />And you will be able to repair, reset or restore in this environment.

            Apple includes Bonjour with other things they make, but yes it's safe to remove if you don't use any apple tools, services, or devices (like iPod, iPhone, AirPort, Apple TV, Apple Watch, etc).

            The games use more resources so create heat, the fan will get louder and work harder to compensate for this, and keep the console cool.

            You can also try to use Pressed Air and "clean" it. But I think this is natural behaviour of console to compensate the heating and keep stable temperatures of console.&nbsp;

            There are multiple causes, could be a dirty xbox for one. On the other hand, each game does require more power as could be understood when you think about the differences between games.

            Yes but the temperature is the same because the system is working harder to cool it. That's why it makes more noise.&nbsp;

            Choppy is 100% correct (as always ;). On the dev side, they are cranking things up so it causes the cooling system to run a bit more compared to other levels of games or games in general. I wouldn't be concerned by it unless it is happening ALL the time
 and you are seeing other weird signs of internal issues.&nbsp;

            I also have the same problem. I've been using the Facebook Voice Messages feature for a long time now. And they've only stopped working for me today. But it does not work for me in google chrome either.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When I click play, the voice note only shows a loading icon, but it does not play.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have you found a solution to this problem? I have the latest Java and Flash Player. The feature has not been working for me since the morning. It works on my tablet, it just won't work on my pc.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Is the problem with my PC, my browser, or facebook?</div>

Does Google Chrome work for you? It doesn't work for me. I thought it was just an issue with facebook. Is it an issue with the browser or the computer?

<p><b><span>Method 2: Perform clean boot and check.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the
<b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click
<b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the <b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one service is selected in the
<b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one startup item is selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is possible that the driver of her old camera is not compatible with the latest version of Skype. Since it is the latest version, it requires to have the latest drivers of the camera, audio and video align with the new updates to the system.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the troubleshooter resulted that there are root causes for your user account, this means that your user profile is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to create a test user account, convert the local account to Microsoft account,, move all the files and data to new user account and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Create a test user account.</p>
<p><span><span>Follow:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> keys from the keyboard, click on
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>User Accounts</strong>, click on <strong>Manage another account</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>Add a new user in PC settings</strong>, click on <strong>
Add someone else to this PC </strong>and follow onscreen instructions.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span><span>Refer to: </span></span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)"><span>Create a local user account

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 2: To convert the Microsoft account to local account, you can do the following:</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Sign in to your Microsoft account on Windows 10.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Accounts&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>Sign in&nbsp;with a local account instead</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Enter your Microsoft account's password, and click on&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type in a Username, Password, and Password Hint that you want to set for your Local account and click

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 4: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once the newly created local account is converted to Microsoft account, you can log-in with this account, try to access
<strong>This PC&nbsp;</strong>and copy the contents from the old user account to a newly created user account.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Steps: </span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press</span><span> <strong>Windows + E</strong>, click on

    <title>Snap Pointer to default button in dialog box not working - Microsoft Community</title>

                    <p>Hi Gang:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Believe since the last update my cursor does not automatically go to the default button in a dialog box. It may not have anything to do with an update. I have checked and unchecked the box in settings for this but still not working. Is it just me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. However my problem is not only on my desktop, but also on my laptop as well as my wife's laptop, so I do not think it has anything to do with the mouse driver. Would you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other idea?</p>

<p>So when you click on Family Settings from the My Xbox row, that very next window should have Console Safety but it should also show the Avatars of your children accounts. If you don't see any Avatars here, then that account has no directly linked children.
 They could be attached to a different parent account, or maybe they were promoted to adults.

            <p>I think that is an elderly computer.&nbsp; Is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the network adapter itself has failed.&nbsp; You are likely using one that is part of the mainboard of your computer.&nbsp; In that case, you can buy a board that fits in one of the main board slots that can replace your failed network adapter.&nbsp; They
 are not expensive.&nbsp; Usually under $20 and very easy to install.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>This usually means that your Wireless card sees the signal and attempts to connect but cannot obtain a valid IP.</p>
<p>Sometimes Rebooting a busy Wireless Router can help.</p>
<p>Check your Firewall and other security application to male sure that nothing changed and it block the capacity to connect locally on the Network.</p>
<p>Assuming that the signal is strong at your computer’s location, that there is No electrical noise around (like 2.4GHz telephone), the Wireless Router Broadcast its SSID, and the DHCP has enough IPs to assign to all computers.</p>
<p>Use a computer that can connect to the Router, temporarily disable the Wireless encryption, and see if you can connect.</p>
<p>If it does Not work well without security, borrow a PCMCIA or USB card and try it. If it works OK you, might have “quirky” Wireless card.</p>
<p>If it does work well without security, uninstall the card and reinstall it with the newest drivers that you can find on the vendors support site.</p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Something is wrong, you cannot assume that every thing is OK according to the past.</p>
<p>The fact that you did not change anything does not mean that something is is Not changed, the computer is a dynamic device.</p>

            &nbsp;I work for a large ISP, and we have the same issue with Vista machines, and occasionally Win 7 machines doing this often. I have found that Windows does not always ask you, when connecting to a new network with WiFi, for the location. Home, Office or
 Public.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;When I find a customer who has troubles with Vista and can see the wifi SSID's but is not given a valid IP (169.254.x.x), the Location settings are always set to Public. Changing to home or Private, allows the wifi connection to pull an IP from the router
 as it should. Something in the FW settings used in a Public network is blocking the DHCP connection from working correctly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm your wifi adapter. To check your wifi adapter follow the below steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on start and then type Device manager in search bar.</p>
<p>2. Go to network adapters and expand network adapter. &nbsp;Below is the picture of what you should be looking at.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b733e0b-7989-409d-a0ec-08c84ff8006a" /></p>
<p>What is adapter name adapter. If it Atheros 5007/5006 wireless adapter , then the below mentioned step will work for you. (Ignore adapter in the pic)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Right click on your atheros wireless adapter and select update driver software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Select Browse my computer for driver software.</p>
<p>5. Then select Let me pick from a list of device driver on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Click on Have Disk and then on Browse</p>
<p>7.Now navigate to the location where you saved the network drivers that you have downloaded. Below is the link to the network drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/151535807/atheros.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/151535807/atheros.zip</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Once you selected the folder, click on open and select Atheros 5007 drivers and click on ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. It should say drivers sucessfully installed and then restart your system and try to connect to your network again.</p>

<h2>            Need to Run Windows Update Online</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Please be aware:</strong><br />
I &nbsp;selected the "Windows Vista" forum, but that link leads to this forum.&nbsp; Please move my question to the correct place.&nbsp; Thank you!<br />
========================================<br />
I&nbsp;need to run Windows Update from <a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/vistadefault.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>www.update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/vistadefault.aspx</span></a>&nbsp;instead of from Control Panel.&nbsp; Can I turn the "automatic" version off, or is there another way to get past it?</p>
<span>www.update.microsoft.com/windowsupdate/v6/vistadefault.aspx</span></a>&nbsp;instead of from Control Panel.&nbsp; Can I turn the "automatic" version off, or is there another way to get past it?</p>
<p>The problem is that my ISP restricts the size of the day's downloads, unless I download only during a certain time period overnight.&nbsp; I cannot afford to have my computer slow down to below dial-up speed during the day, and since I do not want to give Windows
 Update blanket approval for downloads and installation, I cannot restrict its timeframe.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>You've got a real mess on your hands.</p>
<p>PS: Despite what you may see at the top of this forum page or in the URL, this forum handles Windows Update issues for Win7, Vista, and WinXP. [<em>What were they thinking?</em>]</p>
