<h2>            VBA CreateObject doesn&#39;t create Excel application object</h2>
                    <p>We have Office 2010. &nbsp;We have several Access 2010 databases that run VBA code that among other things, calls a routine to export data to an Excel spreadsheet. &nbsp;These have been working well for several years. &nbsp;We have several people run these databases locally
 on their Windows 7 machines. &nbsp;Lately, we have 2 users that suddenly are having problems with this export routine. &nbsp;None of the VB code has changed and the other users can still run it successfully. &nbsp;The line of code that is generating the 424 - Object Required
 error is in bold below. &nbsp;Its the&nbsp;<strong>Set objExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application") &nbsp;</strong>line. &nbsp;The CreateObject function is not creating the Excel application object. &nbsp;Excel is on the user's machine and he can launch it manually and has no problems
 with it. &nbsp;These issues started about a month ago and we cannot determine the cause. &nbsp;We assume its some sort of corruption with a DLL or something in amiss in the registry. &nbsp;Like I said, he ran this successfully for almost 2 years before it starting having
 problems and nothing has changed in the code. &nbsp;As you can see, we are using late-binding. &nbsp;We have also converted this to early-binding (using the MS Excel 14.0 Object Library and MS Office 14.0 Object Library) as references and have verified that he has these
 on his machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a Access problem but an Excel problem. &nbsp;I have also created a Word document containing a macro that attempts to create the Excel.Application object using the CreateObject command and it generates the same error. &nbsp;I have even created VBScript
 files that do the same thing and it generates the same error. &nbsp;I also created VBScript files that create a Word.Application object, a Powerpoint.Application object and they work successfully. &nbsp;Its only the Excel.Application object creation that is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our IT department has run repairs on Office which did not correct the error and they have uninstalled and reinstalled Office and that also did not fix the problem. &nbsp;We even had them give one user a new machine and this solved the problem for about 3 weeks
 and then he started getting the error again.</p>

    <title>Files on local hard drive inaccessible after subscription of OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> softmol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files on local hard drive inaccessible after subscription of OneDrive expired</h2>
                    <p>After unsuccessfully trying with all means to get in contact with Microsoft I am trying this way to get an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With our company we had a OneDrive for Business subscription. The subscription was about to end and it was decided not to extend it. So, I downloaded the OneDrive app and synced all files locally to my hard drive to make sure I have a local copy of everything
 before the subscription ended and I would be unable to access the OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time the subscription did end and now it is not possible to access the files on my local hard drive. The files cannot be opened, copied or even deleted because I am not logged in on OneDrive ("The cloud provider is not running"). And off course
 I can't log in because the subscription ended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Syncing OneDrive to my computer locally was not enough, I should have made an extra copy and delete the OneDrive folder before the subscription ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion: I have now a local copy of all files on my hard drive, but cannot access (or even delete) them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does anyone know how to access the local OneDrive files on my hard drive (without renewing the subscription)?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For people with special skills ;-p :&nbsp; I have been trying some stuff myself and found out that the OneDrive files on the hard drive are accessed through a symbolic link. This link opens a reparse point based on deduplication which will check for the OneDrive
 app and see if you are signed in before actually accessing the file itself. Nice security feauture but a pain in the *** for people in my situation. I will now try to put the hard drive in a Linux machine and try to hack my way through this security thing.
 If I find a solution I will post it here, but if anyone is quicker than me, please help me out ;-) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx,</p>
<p>Koen.</p>

<p>Hi Koen,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>If Office 365 for Business subscription ends, your access to the services, applications, and data go through different stages before the subscription is fully turned off. You can refer to the link below.<br />
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/what-if-my-subscription-expires?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What happens to my data and access when my Office 365 for business subscription ends?</a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In your case, since you can't access your files now, it seems that the subscription is already in
<strong>Disabled</strong> state. It means, only the admins can access the files. You can check with your administrator if they can still access your files in OneDrive. Otherwise, once it's in
<strong>Deprovisioned</strong> state, all data will be permanently deleted and unable to be recovered in any way.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>In addition, please keep us posted if ever you found a solution to retrieve your files.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Regards,<br />
Justin</div>

<br />
for some reason my dashboard and now band are showing data from when first<br />
purchased.<br />
My account now has no record of any activity carried out.&nbsp; My band is<br />
linked to run keeper and all activity is recorded, however nothing on my<br />
dashboard.<br />
All sleep and heart data appear to have gone?<br />
Very disappointing as I swapped from a fitbit and never had such an issue.<br />
Can I say, apart from this major loss of data this is a great device.</span><br />

<h2>            Unknown Line on Cover Page</h2>
                    I have set up a cover page, using the "conservative" template.&nbsp; I have changed the style for the "title" content control to remove and unwanted blue line.&nbsp; Now there is another one, and I can't figure out where it is coming from.&nbsp; None of the styles being
 used on the page have a border... Is there a way I can identify where it is coming from?&nbsp; Also, I can't seem to be able to select and delete it.

            I just figured it out.&nbsp; The template for the cover page has an invisible table, and the line was a cell border.&nbsp; I was able to remove it by altering the border formatting of the cell.

<h2>            Outlook for Mac - junk mail folder causes crash</h2>
                    Outlook crashes when I try to click on any message in my Junk Mail folder. It crashes - sends and error message - then tries to rebuild on starting. Is anyone else having this issue? HELP!<br />
<br />
This began with the latest update from Microsoft for Outlook for Mac a little over a week ago.&nbsp; Every time it happens it sends a report to Microsoft.<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>It sounds like you have a corrupted message in your junk folder. Since you have tried rebuilding, you can try going into the Finder to delete the Junk folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Find your Identity folder in Documents.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/your identity&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Quit Outlook&nbsp;</li><li>Inside the Main Identity, you'll see Data Records folder</li><li>Find <b>Folders</b> then drill down OT &gt; OB &gt; OM until you get to a list by size. Inside each folder you'll see something like this&nbsp;"x05_6.olk14Folder"</li><li>Drag this file to TextEdit icon in the Dock. In all the gobbley gook you'll see the name of the folder.</li><li>Delete the file for Junk</li><li>Open Outlook. It should ask you to Rebuild Outlook&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>Hopefully this will give you an empty junk folder. I do urge you to log into your email account with your browser to delete any junk mail you see there.</div>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user who has a Surface Pro 3 running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; He went and put Windows 10 Enterprise Preview on it and now there are certain things not working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start button doesn't work</li><li>Windows button on the type cover doesn't work</li><li>In the Windows Update screen on the left pane, he has&nbsp;no 'Preview Builds' options</li></ul>
<p>How do I upgrade him to the latest build of Windows 10 Enterprise Preview without wiping his system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>So, the problem is fixed.&nbsp; What I did&nbsp;was</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the ISO of the latest build of Windows 10 that you can find, in my case, wasn't the latest build available</li><li>Copy the ISO files to a USB flash drive</li><li>Go to the USB drive, right click on the ISO and choose 'Mount'</li><li>In the mounted USB drive folder, run the 'setup' file</li><li>Follow the on screen instruction to install the latest build keeping personal files, personal and windows settings</li></ul>
<p>Once the latest build was installed, all the problem mentioned above was fixed.&nbsp; Windows Update started to work and then the latest build available, 10130, came down via Update.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 and its problems.</h2>
                    
<p>Dont you think that Microsoft Office 2010 has its downfalls? That Visio has the problem with the doors, how it keeps freezing when you add a door symbol to the workplane? How it keeps configuring and doesn't save it's configuration settings?</p>
<p>This is really a discussion not a question and I would like to hear what people say, and if there are solutions to the 2 problems&nbsp;I listed above. Anything else that people want to share? I love MS Office 2010, but want to know, why did Microsoft have to
 "configure" the program? It should be done at Setup first thing. I hope there are solutions because otherwise, it will be VERY annoying every time I load it up. This isn't just with Visio; Access, PowerPoint, Word, Excel and much more have the config problem.</p>
<p>Is there a way out? Please reply below. Thank you, John.</p>

<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permissions issue, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>Note 1: Also uninstall any older version of Office from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to run the fix-it, then follow the article and uninstall Office manually and install it again.</span></p>

            <p><strong>View&gt; Gridlines</strong> has nothing to do with <em>Tables</em>. It's a bit confusing because the term
<em>gridlines</em> applies to 2 separate features. That command is for toggling display of the
<em>drawing grid</em> used to position graphic elements. That's why the command is active &amp; the grid is visible only in Print Layout View.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see the <strong>Table Gridlines</strong> click in or select the Table, then either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>View Gridlines</strong> button on the <strong>Layout</strong> contextual tab, or</li><li>Go to <strong>Table&gt; Gridlines</strong> in the main menu.</li></ul>

            Perhaps try  doing an online repair of the installation and see if that corrects it for you.

<h2>            Office 365 License not Working with Subscription</h2>
                    I got a subscription to Microsoft Office 365 a day ago, did the download and install without any issues (I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro). But when I open up word, excel, etc. it tells me "unlicensed product" and shows me the activation wizard. I went on my
 account and it says "monthly auto-renew on Oct 6, 2015". Clicked the install again as directed by a technical support, says "Installed on Friday Aug 7, 2015" along with a deactivate install. Called office 365 support, directed me to account support. Account
 support told me to call technical support. Called technical support and they tell me they couldn't help me and redirected me here. Help me with this issue please. I need to use Word and Excel.

<p><span><em>We ran into a problem syncing your notebook. (Error code: 0xE40200A8)</em>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>How to fix this error without creating a new section and copying all the content from the previous section?</p>
<p>It seems that even after deleting the section, it still prevents from syncing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"<em>Can't sync:</em></span><em><span>OneNote_RecycleBin/Phys</span></em></p>
<p><span><em>We ran into a problem syncing your notebook. (Error code: 0xE40200A8</em><em>)</em>"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting permanently the (already deleted) section, the error is completely gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask for an alternative because whenever I have a sync problem, all I need to do is wait and any error is gone. This one was different and very persistent. I needed to actually do something about it and I couldn't find any other case of this error on the
 (Google) internet. I want to make sure that this error is at least reported once.</p>

<p>Hi Said_SC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About this issue, please kindly do following steps to clear the cache and check the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign out of Skype for Business on your laptop and delete your sign-in info.</p>
<p>2. Locating to&nbsp;<em>UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync.</em></p>
<p>3. Delete all sip_profileName folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Delete all files in the Tracing folder but not the folder itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, you may also try the DNS cache: in Command Prompt, run this command: ipconfig /flushdns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer<br />
</p>

<p><span>Hello Said_SC,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am monitoring this thread currently. It seems that your Skype for Business is stuck on “inactive- mobile” status. I suggest you reinstall Skype for Business on your Android, and then sign out, check if the
 status changed. I found some people who have similar problem with you solved by this. You can give it a try and see if it can help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem persists, may I confirm that not only one device shows your status as “inactive- mobile”? Would you mind provide us a screenshot of this symptom for further checking? Please also provide us
 your Skype for Business version at your convenience. See Help &gt; About Skype for Business.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

<p><span>Hello Said_SC,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you coming back to us. I noticed that your SFB version is not the latest one, it is Version 1808 (Build 10730.20264) for Semi-Annual Channel now. For your reference:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update history for Office 365 ProPlus (listed by date)</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you update your Office by opening one of Office app (such as Outlook) and then click File &gt; Office Account &gt; Office Updates &gt; Updates Now to apply the latest version see if it can help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, to identify if it related to the mobile app, may I confirm that does more than one SFB client show such an "Inactive Mobile" status? Moreover, we would be very appreciated if you could provide us
 with a screenshot of this symptom.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

    <title>excel for mac visual basic editor crashes when adding text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            excel for mac visual basic editor crashes when adding text</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>First of all, sincere apologies if this post is in the wrong place. PLEASE HELP! I cannot seem to use the Visual Basic Editor on my MacBook Air 3,2 running OS X 10.8.4. As soon as I try to enter text into a new VBA module, it crashes excel completely. This
 is not an issue with a single corrupt file or anything. It happens on brand new files as well as existing files, and seems to happen after typing a few characters in a macro. My guess is that it's something with the conversion of the text in the editor to
 opcodes or maybe it's just the syntax checker that's crashing. I used the instructions
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> to completely remove my installation of office 2011 to confirm it's not an installation issue.<br />
<br />
I have attached a link to two error reports below (due to character limitations). The first is from a fresh install from the DVD after the full removal of office mentioned above, without performing any updating. The second error report occurs in the same conditions
 but after updating to Excel 14.3.6.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />

            Thanks, Joe.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I wasn't able to resolve the issue using the suggestions in the article you sent. However, I found a file in Library/Preferences called "VBA Cmd Preferences" that did not have a com.microsoft prefix. Deleting that file solved my problem! Hope
 someone else finds this useful.<br />

<h2>            How many workbooks can be open at one time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a user having an issue opening a workbook from Sharepoint and receiving the error "Sorry, we couldn't open [filename]".</p>
<p>The user had 9 or 10 large workbooks open at the time.</p>
<p>Is there a raw number limit on the number of workbooks that Excel will allow being opened at one time or is it dependent on available RAM/CPU/etc.?</p>
<p>

            It will depend on the machine and for SharePoint, the quality of the network connection vs. file size.

            Hi Sourabh,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>When the build reaches the license expiration date, the system will automatically reboot every three hours. Approximately 2 weeks after the license expires, the build will no longer boot at all.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since you are on an older build and getting expiration warnings, it is likely that Windows Update is failing to install the latest build automatically.&nbsp;To resolve the problem, download the latest ISO file from</div>
<div>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After the download is complete, double-click the ISO file to mount it and then launch setup.exe.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If Windows has stopped booting due to an expired license, you’ll need to download the ISO file from another computer and then transfer the ISO file to installation media such as a USB flash drive or DVD. Then boot the PC from the installation media to
 install the latest build of Tech Preview.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer this link for more information about the latest builds.</div>

</p><p>Or you can use the "flash Fill" feature</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter the first next 3 entries, then drag to create the next entries, ie:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Column H is defined as date format, I've set a custom format of DDD MMM DD, YYYY to display the dates that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the first 3 dates, notice the little square in the bottom right corner and the highlighted icon (what ever it is).&nbsp; Click on the square and drag down. Excel autopopulates the rest of the dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat for the other locations. Then you can sort by date to interleave the various entries if want to create a chronological order.

When you’re working with sequential numbers or dates in Excel, typing every single item in every cell for that column or row can be time-consuming. Auto Fill is Excel’s way of doing this for you. I’ll show you a lightning-fast way to fill in sequential (or
 same) values across multiple cells with Auto Fill in this quick tip.<br />
