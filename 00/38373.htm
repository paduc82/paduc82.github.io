            <p><span>Hi Deepak,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are getting .dll error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know some information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Are you connected to a domain network?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section ‚Äú<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>

    <title>System recovery and BIOS nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neon555  say:</h3>
<h2>            System recovery and BIOS nightmare</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working on a laptop this evening. It is windows 8 .</p>
<p>The system in question is an Advent Monza T100.</p>
<p>When booting the system you are met with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The boot configuration data file is mission some required information.<br />
<br />
File: \BCD<br />
Error code: 0xc000000d<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have tried getting the system to fail 3 time to bring up the recovery menu, which was unsuccessful. From here I decided a recovery disk was the way to go so I fetched my Windows 8 recovery disk and loaded it into the CD/DVD drive. I went into the bios
 to change the boot order and upon arriving at the "boot" page of the BIOS I was met with "Boot Configuration. UEFI Boot Drive BBS Priorities". When going into this menu there was only one boot device and the device was "Windows Boot Manager".</p>
<p>The only options are Windows Boot Manage and Disabled, both of which I have tried. I have also tried other solutions such as switching off safe boot etc.</p>
<p>I have tried all the F keys in an attempt to get the laptop to boot from an alternate device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am totally at &nbsp;my wits end with this machine and don't really know where to go from here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>Hi John, </p>
<p>I was installing windows technical preview and I had the same problem. I'm pretty sure now that you have disabled secure boot, you have to disable UEFI and change the boot mode to IPV4 Legacy. After that, you have to change the legacy boot order so it scans
 for DVDs first. Also, then you have to press escape before your system boots up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps...</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your suggestion but most of the options you have mentioned, do not appear.</p>
<p>Secure boot was there, however setting it to off doesn't appear to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've linked to several pictures from the BIOS with the error message, all the BIOS screens including attempting to change to boot order and what happens when you do "change" it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope that someone can make sense of this as I tried it with secure boot both on and off, neither of these options seemed to add any further options to the BIOS to select boot devices.</p>
<p>Also I have no idea what the "windows boot manager" is or does, nor how to edit it for different boot devices.</p>
<p>Many thanks to anyone who sees this and the pictures, and come up with some kind of workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice.</p>
<p>In the pictures of the BIOS I posted, what you see is what you get and there doesn't appear to be a "fast boot" option anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say "try making the boot fail" do you mean switch the machine on, let it get to the error message and then power off?</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by letting the boot fail twice and let it continue the third time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to alter the items within the "Windows boot manager" or force the machine to boot from a certain device?
</p>
<p>Perhaps I can flash the BIOS from a USB stick?</p>
<p>Unfortunately BIOS's are not my specialty.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to flash the BIOS from a USB, but that varies by manufacturer and I have little knowledge about your specific machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I my UEFI machine the FAST BOOT setting is under the BOOT Tab... I didn't see it on your image either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To crash the machine, you want to hold down the power button and try to shut it down at about the moment Windows is starting... Ideally, in between the BIOS Post Screen and the first appearance of Windows... With the newer UEFI machines the POST screen is
 so fast, it is hard to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to the recovery\repair mode on a couple of my machines by hitting Ctrl+Alt+Del just before the first appearance of Windows... Do this twice, and the 3rd time let it try and boot...</p>
<p>One of my machines boots to fast and this isn't possible....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If successful, the machine will enter Automatic Repair, which probably won't be successful...</p>
<p>After it completes you should be able to get to the Advanced Repair options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that your Secure Boot was disabled, but said "STANDARD"... you might explore this and see if it can be set to something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT... BTW... there should be a key to hit at the POST screen to go directly to Boot Options. This setting is a one time thing, and doesn't alter the actual BIOS settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to select CD drive, USB, UEFI, etc... this also varies...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HP Laptop has Boot Options in this window that don't appear in the actual BIOS...</p>
<p>I can't boot from&nbsp;certain flash drives without doing this...&nbsp; F11 or F12 maybe...</p>

            I managed to Boot from an Advent Monza T100 with UEFI, by Disabling Secure Boot, Disabling all UEFI boot options (3 in total) and changing the OS boot from 'Windows 8 64bit' to other. &nbsp;It then booted from CD automatically.

            Hello
<br />
<br />Quick Fix 1. Solve 'Access Denied' error with error checking tool
<br />
<br />Error checking tool is a built-in tool in Windows system for checking and fixing device errors. If you have access problems on your hard drive, USB, SD card or file folders, you can follow below guidelines to fix 'Access Denied' error on your device now:
<br />
<br />1. Connect inaccessible device such as hard drive, external hard drive, USB or SD card with PC;
<br />2. Open This PC/My Computer &gt; Right-click on inaccessible device or file folder and select Properties;
<br />3. Tab on Tools &gt; Click Check/Check Now.
<br />
<br />If this fixes your problem, you can directly open your drive and continue using data on it.
<br />If this doesn‚Äôt work, try Quick Fix 2 to continue fixing 'Access Denied' error on your devices.
<br />
<br />Quick Fix 2. Gain permissions to inaccessible hard drive, USB or file folder
<br />
<br />If you don‚Äôt have permissions to access the protected hard drive or USB, files etc, you would not be able to open the drive and even get 'access denied' error message. 
<br />So your another choice is to gain permissions to inaccessible hard drive, USB or file folders:
<br />
<br />1. Right-click inaccessible hard drive, USB or file folder and select Properties;
<br />2. Go to Security, click Advanced and navigate to the Owner tab;
<br />3. Click on Edit, click your user name under Group or user name
<br />4. Check all boxes under Allow column and click OK, then click Apply to gain permissions to access your inaccessible device.
<br />Get permission to access inaccessible device.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, there are other alternatives like using a linux OS to access the drive and change permissions or us a third party tool

<h2>            Windows 10 Bluetooth Troubleshoot</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my laptop to Windows 10, but I'm now having a problem with my bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I had Windows 8.1 and would connect my cell phone to my laptop via bluetooth, a window would automatically pop up giving me the option of controlling my cell phone with my laptop's keyboard and mouse. The bluetooth connection would also automatically
 broadcast my phone's audio through the laptop. Now there's nothing and I can't find the settings to turn these options on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me understand how to re-establish these controls?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you can add a Bluetooth enabled device to your computer, you must do two things to make sure your computer and the device are ready to connect:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a Bluetooth adapter to your computer if it doesn't already have one. You can do this by plugging the adapter into a USB port.</p>
<p>Some computers come with a built-in Bluetooth adapter, especially laptops. You might have to turn on the adapter, or use a switch on your laptop to turn it on if your laptop has one. This might not be called a Bluetooth switch. It might be
 called a wireless switch, or something similar. If you are unsure about how to turn on the Bluetooth adapter or whether your computer has a built-in Bluetooth adapter, check the manual for your computer or the manufacturer's website.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Set up the Bluetooth enabled device so that your computer can find it.</p>
<p>To do this, you must first:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn the device on.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make it discoverable.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>When a Bluetooth enabled device is in discovery mode, it broadcasts a wireless signal that allows it to be detected by other devices or computers. This is sometimes called
<span>pairing mode</span>. When most devices are discoverable, they are also in pairing mode, ready to be paired with your computer.</p>
<p>To learn how to make a device discoverable, check the information that came with your device or go to the manufacturer‚Äôs website. Methods for making a device discoverable can vary widely from one type of device to the next. Some Bluetooth
 enabled devices are always in discovery mode. Others, such as most mobile phones, need to be placed in discovery mode by selecting discovery from a software menu or pressing a button on the device. Discovery buttons can be very small and hard to spot, often
 placed on the bottom of a mouse, keyboard, or similar device. The button may be labeled with the word "connect," or another similar term; a Bluetooth logo; or it may not be labeled at all.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Please reply with the results. I will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>To answer your first question, I have a Dell Inspiron 15 laptop, 3000 series. (My phone is an LG G3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem pairing these devices with Windows 10, but when I connected these devices with Windows 8.1, I could listen to my phone and control it with my laptop. Now, when I pair the devices with Windows 10, I have yet to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do - once these devices are paired - to listen and control my android with my laptop?</p>

            Hi 80LaHD,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is very different to all previous version of Windows, when you change a users name, that folder name will not change, while there is a complicated way to rename that folder, it can cause difficulty with your Windows system
<br />
<br />Your best option is to create a new user account and delete that old user account
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Family and other People 
<br />
<br />Click 'Add someone else to this PC' 
<br />
<br />Follow the prompts to create a new account 
<br />
<br />Close the settings app 
<br />
<br />Log out of that user account 
<br />
<br />Log into your new account 
<br />
<br />Click the Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, select the old account and click 'Remove' 
<br />
<br />That's It, your new Admin Account will replace the old account

    <title>How To Fix &#34;Format Hard Drive Disk&#34; Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms.kelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Fix &#34;Format Hard Drive Disk&#34; Error</h2>
                    <p>I have two years of my most precious data stored on a Toshiba external hard disk drive (HDD). I turned my laptop on and plugged in my hard drive and to my surprise I got an error message that said that Windows could not read my disk and that I need to format
 it first. If you are receiving this message, <strong>DO NOT FORMAT YOUR DISK!</strong> If you format the disk,
<strong>ALL OF YOUR FILES, PHOTOS, AND DATA STORED ON IT WILL BE DELETED!</strong> I spent two weeks searching the internet for a solution to my problem. I tried every piece of advice I came across. Here is the step by step instructions that fixed my "Format
 Disk" error message.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Attach and power up the external HDD and then click on your Start Button. Type "disk management" in the Search box. Click on "Create and Format Disk Partitions"&nbsp; This will take you to the "Disk Management" program.</li><li>Disk Management will tell you valuable information about your drives. The first thing you want to check is to be sure that the "Status" of all your Drives are labeled as "Healthy."&nbsp;
</li><li>Compare your HDD and your "C" drive. Is your HDD formatted in FAT32 or RAW while the system is formatted in NTFS
</li><li>The external HDD and the system (or "C" drive) must be formatted the same. <em>
(My HDD was reading as RAW while my C: drive was reading NTFS)</em></li><li>I was at a loss as to how to fix this so I took the advice of 2 other people who had posted solutions to this problem. I don't know which one was the one that actually fixed my hard drive error or whether it was a combination of the two so below is both
 solutions in the order I did them.</li></ol>
<p><strong>SOLUTION #1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Connect your hard disk drive to your computer and turn it on.</li><li>Click on "Start" button</li><li>Type "cmd" in the search box and right click on "cmd"</li><li>Select "Run as administrator"</li><li>a command prompt will appear that says C:/windows/system32&gt;</li><li>You are going to need to know what drive letter is assigned to your hard disk drive (HDD). To locate this information, click on the "Disk Management" icon that should be still open in your system tray and located the letter assigned to your HDD. If you
 closed "Disk Management," follow step 1 to reopen it.</li><li>Type: "chkdsk (your hard disk drive letter): /f
<ul>
<li>for example: My hard disk drive was assigned the letter "f". This is what I should have:
<ul>
<li>C:/windows/system32&gt;chkdsk f: /f</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>This is going to check your hard disk drive for any possible errors and attempt to fix them. I then immediately followed solution #2.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>SOLUTION #</strong><strong>2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read earlier about some free software that I could download called EaseUS Data Recovery which is designed to recover and restore lost data on hard disk drives. They have a paid version as well as a free version. I downloaded the free version.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy and paste the following URL into your web browser and click enter:<a href="http://www.easeus.com/data-recovery-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.easeus.com/data-recovery-software/</a></li><li>Download the free version of the software. </li><li>Launch "EaseUS Data Recovery" wizard.</li><li>Follow the on screen instructions.</li></ul>
<p>Note: The free version will only allow a limited amount of data to be recovered. I was at work and had a slow internet connection. After 2 hours, I noticed that my files were only 37% complete. I got tired of waiting for my files to be download so I shut
 down my computer in the middle of having my files transferred. I then restarted my computer with my hard disk drive powered on and connected. To my astonishment, my hard disk drive worked perfectly! No more format disk error message! All my files, photos,
 videos, and data was still in tack. PROBLEM SOLVED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly think that this software restored my hard drive disk from being in a "RAW" format to being in a "NTSF" format before it attempted to download my files and that's what actually fixed my problem. However, I'm not positive that's what happened. All
 I know is my hard disk drive is fixed and my data is safe. Needless to say, I IMMEDIATELY BACKED UP MY HARD DISK DRIVE to my desktop when I got home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will be of help to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>S. Kelly</p>

<p>You should treat this incident as a sharp reminder that you must back up your data
<strong>regularly</strong> (e.g. weekly) to an external medium. Waiting until your disk becomes unreadable is playing a high-risk game.<br />

            <p><span>When a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) system failure occurs for most users there is insufficient time to note down in full what it says; the exact text is important to anyone trying to diagnose what is wrong. You can gain the time needed when the error
 next occurs by following the procedure described below.</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven't done so already disable automatic restart on system failure. This should help by allowing time to write down the Stop Error code and related information properly. Select Start, right click on Computer select Properties, Advanced System
 Settings, Start-Up and Recovery, System Failure and uncheck the box before Automatically Restart. Do not re-enable automatic restart on system failure after getting this information as this setting is best left to not to allow Automatic Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>If the system failure occurs during the booting of the computer you need to try a different approach. You can access the Windows Advanced Options Menu on many computers by constantly pressing the F8 (Function) key during Start-Up and selecting the
 option - Disable automatic restart on system failure. This method is not always easy to use as it can be difficult to depress the F8 at exactly the right time. Try again if it does not work first time. On some computers a different key has to be used.</span></p>

<h2>            How to rename a file in EZ Vinyl&#47;Tape Converter</h2>
                    I am using the program EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter. I record off LPs onto the computer.Once I have manually recorded the names of the tracks, I discover that I have made errors - and wish to rename the tracks (which have now been exported to iTunes) and I
 find no way to rename them!&nbsp; Only once they are in iTunes do I find the fault. How, and at which stage, do I rename them?

<p>I have been having the same problem and went through the three methods. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The error still occurs after the clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The run verifier created a BSOD with scsiport.sys identified.</p>

            I've gone through those steps and more. I have fixed my issue by turning off windows defender and installing my own security panda free 2015 and now I'm getting updates and computer back up to speed. Not sure what is wrong with defender but all is well
 with it off.

<h2>            How do I reinstall the previous version of Windows Live Photo Gallery 2011&#63;____</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Was the previous version called<span>&nbsp;</span>Windows Live Photo Gallery 2010 or 2009? I have looked for it as a download in the MS Web Sites ‚Äì I cannot find
 it!</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>My computer recently upgraded automatically to Windows Live Photo Gallery 2011 (a module of Windows Live Essentials 2011).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Live Photo Gallery is a useful set of Free photo-edit tools (which incorporates the new standard ‚ÄòRibbon‚Äô user interface).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Trouble is, this program is not as useful as the previous version of Windows Live Photo Gallery!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, the ‚ÄòStraighten‚Äô Tool has changed.<span>&nbsp;</span>Now there is no user-adjustment to ‚ÄòStraighten‚Äô:<span>&nbsp;</span>you either accept the Auto
 result or not.<span>&nbsp; </span>The problem is that the Auto Straightening often makes mistakes ‚Äì sometimes making the horizon tilt much worse than before!<span>&nbsp;</span>So it‚Äôs not much good in practice.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The previous version of Windows Live Photo Gallery had a great set of editing tools, which I learnt to use and gave great results.<span>&nbsp;</span>One could manually
 adjust the ‚Äòamount‚Äô of Straightening to the horizon - to get it right when then Automatic setting gets it wrong.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(This ability to adjust the amount of Straightening is particularly relevant for compact cameras with ‚Äòwide angle‚Äô lenses.<span>&nbsp;</span>These usually produce
 pronounced ‚Äòbarrelling‚Äô and other distortions of perspective in their photos taken at 'wide angle'.<span>&nbsp;</span>The Automatic result does not strike a fair balance of the opposite tilting to the left and right of the photo.)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>So please can I get the previous version of Windows Live Photo Gallery back again please?<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Where is it?<span>&nbsp;</span>Or how do I get my old version back?</span></span></p>

<h2>            32 bit software won&#39;t run on windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;a bunch of&nbsp;32 bit software that worked great with xp, but won't work with windows 7, 64 bit. I thought 7 was supposed to be backwards compatible. Some of these programs cannot be replaced. Does this mean that I just wasted 140.00 on an operating
 system I can't use because it won't run most of my current software?

<p><span>ÔªøDo you have the newest version of the software? Some older programs/versions may not work in Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If not check with the program maker if they have any updates or patches for the software.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
Windows 7 Compatibility Center to check program compatibility:</span></p>

<p>
</span></p>
<p>
Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<p>STOP! Contact Microsoft, you're eligible for a new Xbox 360S for free! I'm not joking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update released yesterday allowed for developers to store more memory on their game discs. The update was for the disc reader to be able to read the newest type of game disc. They said that a small amount of Xbox 360's would be negatively affected by
 not supporting the new update, mainly due to old hardware. They said whoever this was the case for, they'd send you a FREE 250 GB Xbox 360S for the inconvenience. CONTACT MICROSOFT SUPPORT!</p>

<p>i'm just surprised that the new xbox 360 slims that came out last june are even affected by this problem. you would think that the new dvd drives that they have in them would not be affected by this update, but just goes to show you how wrong i am...and
 it WAS a firmware update to the dvd drives too. so that makes sense...i guess</p>

<p>Oh so you already have a new 360S? I got the last one of the first shipment to my town (and at least a 100 mile radius around my town) last summer. Mine wasn't affected though. I figured it would've only been old models. Odd. But yeah. I don't think it matters
 whether it's under warranty or not. I read somewhere they're going to give you a free year of XBL too. I can't find that article for the life of me though.</p>

<p>Hi Ben, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know about your concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to get 4K resolution on your monitor when connected to your Surface Pro, we suggest that you check the refresh rate on your device. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Display</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced display settings link</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Display adapter properties</strong> for the external display.</li><li>Click the <strong>Monitor </strong>tab.</li><li>Under "Monitor Settings," use the drop-down menu to select different refresh rates until you get your desired resolution.</li></ol>
<p>

<h2>            activation of windows 10</h2>
                    I have a PC bought from a large company that I cant activate the windows for. 2 yrs ago I bought a new gaming system, but the mother board died in a week, so they gave me a replacement 1 week later the same thing the mother board died so they gave me a
 3rd tower but a different brand the 3rd time. The tech set it all up, salvaged and transferred my files etc. for 1.5 years now MS will not activate the windows, they say I have "fake windows" and I need to go to the MS store and buy a genuine copy or I need
 to respond to the verification email they sent me but they closed my email account over a decade ago so it is impossible to answer from that email. They wont let me change my email, and have just been really rude to me. Large chain stores do not sell fake
 windows and the point of purchase manager told me its got to be malware of some sort but why would a scammer send me to give money to the windows store? It makes no sense and I have done nothing wrong I bought legit windows 10. I have

 press enter.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm wondering if there will be any Tinnitus audio settings for CoD Ghosts and other games? I have tinnitus and the last thing I need to hear is a high pitch ring from a flash bang :P I wanna contact Infinity ward about this and see if they can implement
 it in their game but their forums are down and it wont let me post on the CoD Ghosts forums? But maybe will someone will see this post and spread the word! Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you need assistance for checking system compatibility with Windows 10. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 devices, so your device is most likely compatible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the <strong>Get Windows 10 app</strong> to do a compatibility check.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get Windows 10 is an app that‚Äôs designed to make the upgrade process easy. It checks to make sure your device is compatible, and it reserves your free upgrade; it also has information to help you learn about the features in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For devices running Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update with Windows Update enabled, the app shows up automatically as a Windows icon in your system tray at the bottom right-hand side of your screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click the <strong>menu</strong> in the upper left of the app, and select ‚Äú<strong>Check your PC‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour PC is good to go</strong>.‚Äù This displays any compatibility issues we find and recommends a resolution; while we don‚Äôt have info on every app
 or device in existence, it provides a comprehensive list of all known potential compatibility issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some Windows 10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market. For instance, Cortana is not available in all markets.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For information, please refer to the below Microsoft articles:</span></p>

            <p>To <em>definitively</em> know, you must make a list of all the hardware on your computer and then, for each piece of hardware, go to the hardware manufacturer's website to see if your exact model number is supported on Windows 10. There are no shortcuts.
 I spent many hours doing this, but by the time I was done there were no doubts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your job will be a little easier because laptops have mostly proprietary hardware. The laptop manufacturer can tell you whether the proprietary hardware is supported. For third-party hardware you have to go to the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have to make a list of all the software on your computer and go to the developers' websites to find out if they are supporting Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the manufacturer of your "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1-click external back up" knows if it's supported on Windows 10. Hardware manufacturers and software developers choose whether to support Windows, not the other way around.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Installing a new operating system is one of the most technically demanding things you can do to a computer. If you know "NADA" about computers, why in&nbsp;heaven's&nbsp;name would you want to
 do this? Most sane&nbsp;people wait to buy a computer with the new operating system already installed.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Lol....I DON'T want to do this but am being hounded into it. I never said I was sane, by the way. I managed, through wizards and friends to upgrade from my wonderful XP to 8.1, with no more than a few mental scars. I even managed to install Windows on my
 very first P.C. I may need directions, but I'm not totally incompetent, thank you......just old and handicapped and far more interested in getting through life than what makes my computer go. MS has made many promises about the ease of&nbsp; installation, but no
 commitment to preserving my whole system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly appreciate your advice, since you know the technical things I am lacking knowledge about. In return I could, perhaps, counsel you a little on people skills???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerest thanks.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Camileo X200 Camcorder image is totally blurry.</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I just bought this camcorder, and I have a problem with webcam feature. The image is totally&nbsp;blurry. There are no drivers, and it should work&nbsp;automatically. Otherwise camera works perfect. Anyone has the same problem?</div>
<div>thanks<br />

            <p>Hi DarkoBlagojevic,<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!<br />
</p>
<span>I would suggest you to try adjusting the settings in Toshiba camcorder. If you are not comfortable in adjusting the settings, I would suggest you to contact Toshiba support.<br />

<h3> kev8654  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add music to Windows media player 12 library</h2>
                    I am not able to delete any of the sample music that came pre installed on windows 7.I deleted the files from the my music folder/my videos but I cant delete them from windows media player 12 or windows media center.I would like to know how to do this.When
 I hit delete on them nothing happens same thing if I drag them to the trash.<br />
That's not close to the big problem though.I am not able to add any music to the library without it all getting deleted once I close wmp 12.How can I get around this?<br />
It is a brand new computer I just bought it.It came installed with windows 7 home premium 64 bit.It has no virus or anything like that wrong with it.<br />
Microsoft sure did mess up with wmp 12,wmp 11 was great but they dont have it for windows 7 that im aware of.I also tried to redownload wmp 12 but I couldn't find the link to download it.They kept trying to make me download a plug in for it instead of the player
 itself.<br />
Since there's such little problems with this operating system like this im already regretting not going with a mac

            Ed, I suggest that you try resetting the media library by following these steps:<br />
<br />
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type <span style="font-weight: bold">services.msc</span> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the
- Go to Start, type <span style="font-weight: bold">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</span> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, delete the <span style="font-weight: bold">Media Player</span> folder. If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt.<br />

            <blockquote>if the laptop is brand new, why are there all corrupt files??!!<br />
did best buys "geek squad" screw something up when they had it or is this a common problem in windows 7?<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Meghann: I would say that it's a pretty common problem, especially if you had deleted the files in Explorer first before trying to remove them from the library.<br />
