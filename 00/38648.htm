<h2>            Metro Redux Achievements not showing up alone with other BS</h2>
                    
<p>Well, this has just been my worst gaming experience ever and I'm about 20 seconds away from getting a PS4 and just blowing this POS Xbox One up. I know about the delay with achievement unlocks, but for some reason the idiots on the Xbox support chat can't
 seem to understand my issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put the Metro game in and play. I go to view the achievements and I cannot. It's not they aren't unlocking, but I cannot view them at all, as if the game is not being played. It has been 2 days now and nothing. I got half way threw the game and nothing.
 My wife put it in her Xbox One and she is able to view the games achievements in the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done all the troubleshooting and nothing. The Xbox chat tech said she could see 8 achievements were unlocked, but that was for my 360 version of the Metro Last Night game. Not the game I am talking about and on top of all this my Diablo 3 items are
 disappearing and having constant issues trying to connect.</p>

<p>WTF IS GOING ON MICROSOFT! Way to ruin gaming.</p>

<p>I've had some similar issues, first it was just the usual not showing the achievements displaying after you got them, but today I wasn't able to snap achievements (or even check them) while I was playing. I have tried checking my achievements using xbox.com,
 xbox one smartglass, and of course my xbox one, so yeah, something is definitely going on here.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t start in safe mode windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t start in safe mode windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I upgraded to windows 10 a few months ago. I have got blue screen of death WDF_VIOLATION and the PC was in a continuous circle of trying and failing to reboot and repair itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From researching forums etc I understand, it looks like I need to re-start in safe mode with networking and then address what might be a driver issue. When I re-boot from a DVD of the OS I get to set
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Language and a keyboard input method and then 'Repair my Computer. From&nbsp;</span>Troubleshoot &nbsp;I go to Advanced options. I don't get the option of Start-up settings. I do get 5 others (System
 Restore, System image recovery Start-up Repair [tried, did not work], Command Prompt).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another way that I can get the PC to start in safe mode with networking?</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help that you can give</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 10 CPU constantly at 100&#37; usage</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>System:<br />
-------------</p>
<p>I'm running an MSI GE62MVR laptop with Windows 10 64 Home, fully updated. [ updated to Creators Edition yesterday]</p>
<p>Latest BIOS installed.</p>
<p>All drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting the Power Profile to Power Saving the CPU usage responded and could ramp down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Problem:</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>I reset all the Power Profiles and they all run the CPU at 100% now, even after trying to change the Advanced Power Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Advanced Power settings I can change the max CPU frequency to 1600Mhz but no lower, that reduced the CPU load to 56% constant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Task Manager it is just System Idle Process taking up the bulk of CPU time.</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows a fix I would really appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Thanks for the reply Commander Keen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU info : i7 7700HQ - 3.8Ghz Max Turbo boost.</p>
<p>I was not running anything and the only process taking up the entire CPU was System Idle Process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solve:</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p>I did a system restore to yesterday. </p>
<p>CPU was at normal levels at boot-up. Then I went to make my own Power Plan, just to trace my process to the stuff-up.<br />
</p>
<p>After entering different Min and Max CPU states and Frequencies in my custom Power Plan the CPU would ramp up to maximum frequency and state again. Crap, then I selected the Balanced State and it quiet down again to normal levels.<br />
</p>
<p>I was going through all the Power Plans whilst running CPUID Hardware monitor, to check frequencies and Cinebench to test the Max boost frequency of each Power Plan.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>What I noticed:</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>If you make changes to ANY Power Plan profile regarding Processor Power States, Save and then Reset to Default, it runs the CPU at MAX state and frequency from then on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to System Restore I reset all the Power Profiles in a hope to get the CPU out of MAX state, that just made it irreversible and I had to Sys Restore to properly reset those Power Profiles.</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that my system board and windows don't gel all that well. Or that the new Windows 10 Creators Update has a power bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways , I am now running with Balanced for normal PC use and noticed High Performance gives me MAX Boost frequencies and settles down if not pressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone else down the road somehow.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Urban Assault Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;Hello there, I have a video-game I got many years ago called Urban Assault that I enjoyed playing on earlier windows operating
 systems/machines. Sadly, in Windows 8/8.1 there is a graphical bug that makes nearly all the colors turn a horrid shade of reddish purple and I cannot seem to make it go away. Sadly, this renders the game unplayable to me. I have tried many solutions to this
 problem, including compatibility modes, yet none have helped.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">I hope there is something you can do!</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Also, I do not know who to ask about this but whom would I talk to in order to request that this great old game be re-released
 on a Digital Store like Steam or GoodOldGames? I would love to be able to play it through digital means and I'm sure many more people would appreciate and buy it.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Thank you!</span></p>

            <p>I finally had success executing Urban assault in Windows 8 properly the game. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- UA.exe must be executed as administrador and windows XP (SP3)</p>
<p>- once inside the game, go to options and change the Video display to SOFTWARE instead of Primary.</p>

            Due to expired licences Goldeneye, Sega Rally Revo, and Burnout 3 Can't become BC games. The first two games have been de-listed, While burnout probably has expired music Licences.

            The best thing to do is contact the publisher/developer, and see if they have any plans to renew the licenses and allow them on the back compat library.

    <title>Cannot Initialize External USB drive in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredhornigold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Initialize External USB drive in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Iomega external 1tb drive will not initialize in windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I plug it into my NAS drive I can then see it over the network. So no issue with drive USB or cable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried 3rd party tools but none of these initialize the drive either, obviously a windows 8 issue as 2 pc's both running windows 8 and neither can see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was able to connect when running Vista before upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be a common problem when searching for solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asking to initialize in disk manager get message DATA ERROR (CYCLIC REDUNDANCY CHECK)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also seem a common issue, anyone had this and fixed it yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you check connecting in the previous versions of Windows computers?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps given below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I can click on any device but as soon as i click Razer Seiren X (or move down to it with arrow keys), it instantly crashes.<br />
Although when i click on 'Razer Seiren X' in the Playback tab its completely fine.<br />
I checked the threads on 'Recording Tab Freezes' and tried all the fixes and they just don't work for my issue.<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated, If not then an alternative would be if you can change communication devices from the cmd?<br />
Either would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Windows 10 Update disabled touch screen and USB ports....MS and Lenovo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnyturner3294  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update disabled touch screen and USB ports....MS and Lenovo hold PC hostage</h2>
                    <p>Anybody else having this problem????&nbsp; Purchased new Lenovo Flex 3 - 1570 Laptop in August.&nbsp; Upon purchase immediately upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 based on manufacturer recommendation.&nbsp; System is Windows 10 compatible based on information from
 both Lenovo and Microsoft.&nbsp; Windows 10 has done an automatic update and now my touch screen and three USB ports no longer function.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve the problem, I started with Lenovo and after 3 days, 15 hours on the phone and 3 123Rescue sessions&nbsp;with them it was concluded there was a software issue (Lenovo Ref #8006052239).&nbsp; I was told by the good folks at Lenovo the only way for them to
 fix the problem was to a) send computer back to them so they could wipe clean and fix taking upwards of 10 business days, b) uninstall Windows 10 and revert to Windows 8.1 meaning all of my loaded Windows 10 software would have to be replaced with Windows
 8.1 compatible, or c) pay for service plan at $199 so they could fix.&nbsp; None of the free options&nbsp;are good options for me as I depend on my computer for work.&nbsp; Not sure why I have to pay to fix a computer bought directly from them&nbsp;less then&nbsp; 3 months ago and
 is still under warranty.&nbsp; All of these benefit Lenovo not the customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then called Microsoft and after over 3 hours on the phone with the folks in the Philippines&nbsp;they&nbsp;advised they could solve&nbsp;by escalating to a level 2 call (Microsoft Case #1314026417).&nbsp; Of course, this escalation can only happen with a paid subscription.&nbsp;
 I requested to speak to either a supervisor or a manager and was told there were none available.&nbsp; I requested to be transferred back to the US and was told they cannot do this.&nbsp; Trying to clarify the various contradictory stances the third representative,
 Luz, was sharing with me she suggested I take my brand new computer to a local technician and have it fixed.&nbsp; Needless to say, I was a bit taken aback by this suggestion.&nbsp; I again requested a supervisor and she then hung up on me.&nbsp; Nice customer support from&nbsp;Microsoft.&nbsp;
 Probably need to train the folks in the Philippines a bit better to teach them that hanging up on their customers is not good customer service.&nbsp; To quote Chris Christie....."Even in New Jersey what she did is called rude!"&nbsp; Not sure she cares though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short, I bought a laptop from Lenovo (one of the largest computer manufacturers in the world) preloaded with Microsoft Windows (one of the largest software companies in the world) and now my touch screen and USB ports do not work and my computer is
 a lame duck.&nbsp; The answer I get from the two companies involved is to point their fingers at each other&nbsp;and leave the customer hanging with the problem.&nbsp; They then tell me I need to pay one or both of them to fix a problem they created on a computer barley
 90 days old.&nbsp; And to think we worry about the ransomware threats from overseas.&nbsp; We have two of the largest ransomware threats right here in the US disguised as&nbsp;customer oriented companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no more than wolves in sheep's clothing!&nbsp; Not sure why I
 am even wasting my time posting this as I am sure it will go nowhere and do nothing.&nbsp; I have learned my lesson....never again will I deal with Lenovo or Microsoft.&nbsp; I am going to shop for a Mac....they seem to work without these problems.</p>

<p>I have the same problem with my Lenovo Miix 2 10. Touchscreen and usb do not work without plugged power supply on the 16299 build of Windows 10. This is the rason I'm not be able to update licensed copy of Windows on my tablet.
<br />
</p>
I have written to russian Lenovo support (i'm from Belarus) and I have been "sent" to the polish support, because my tablet has been realized in Poland. I have described that it is not the sense. But, I was sent to the polish support. Again. Ufffff.... This
 is awesome.

            <p>Hi Shivramgunner, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the model number of HP Windows 8 computer? </p>
<p>2. Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue normally occurs when the audio driver is not updated to the latest or the driver installation might be corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: <br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Let's make sure that audio drivers are updated to the latest by visiting computer Manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer the steps mentioned in the article. You may run the audio troubleshooter and also update the drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>No sound in Windows</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<br />
<strong>Step 2: Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</strong><br />
<br />
a. <strong>Download </strong>the <strong>Audio drivers </strong>from the <strong>
manufacturer’s website.<br />
</strong>b. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the driver and click on ‘<strong>properties’</strong>.<br />

            <p>I have Windows 8.0 on a HP Envy computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>After security updates from Microsoft the sound would stop working much of the time.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I spent maybe 50 hours trying to fix it with no effect.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trying to get support from Microsoft anymore is a worthless endeavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see there are hundreds or thousands of people having the same problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that I would try and play a You Tube video and the video would stop because I surmise the sound is required other videos would just not have any sound and I was thinking about taking my laptop outside and letting it talk to Mr. Sledge Hammer
 since it is so aggravating to have to deal with this for a long time but I didn’t!<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that <span>when I put the computer in sleep mode it will wake up and the sound will work for a while but then it fails after a time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here is what one can do for trouble shooing the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the speaker icon on the bottom right of the screen</li><li>Click on the image of the speaker above the volume control</li><li>This will bring up the “Speaker Properties” box. Select the Advanced Tab and click on the TEST icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will either allow the speaker to generate a tone or a box will pop up saying “DEVICE IN USE-- This Device is being used by another application….”.</li><li>So if the sound doesn’t work or works intermittently then there is a conflict with some other programs and from my research it is a flash player security update.</li><li>Go to the right top of the screen and select the charms SETTING icon.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Then select the “control panel”. Find the “Programs and Features” click that and then on the top LEFT there is “Windows Updates” and click on that.</li><li>Look for the main heading of MICROSOFT WINDOWS, which on my computer is about half way down.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One will see all the security updates that are listed by the KB numbers.<span>&nbsp;
</span></li><li>Print this list out on paper so you can refer to it for when you uninstall the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One can always go back (maybe?) and reinstall the update.<span>&nbsp; </span></li><li>The security updates are listed by KB# and I had read that KB2962407 was the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One puts the mouse curser on the KB# and selects UNINSTALL, it will uninstall that particular update and then restart the computer.</li><li>I uninstalled KB 2962407, this had no effect.<span>&nbsp; </span>The sound test still says that “, This [Sound] Device is Being Used by another Application” and it didn’t help me at all after I tried to use the sound for two days.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I really hate Windows 8 anymore to tell you the truth.</li><li>So I reinstalled it after I did a COLD RESTART (shut the computer down) and proceeded down the list. [Just put the KB# in Google search and it will show where one can get the Stand-alone version that one needs for their particular computer –have to know
 if you have the 64 bit Windows 8 or not to select the correct file to reinstall.]</li><li>I uninstalled KB 2966072.<span>&nbsp; </span>The sound worked perfectly for 8 days with no problems.
</li><li>I wanted to check to see if I reinstalled KB2966072 would cause the sound to fail again either the -x64 or the –x86m version but it won’t reinstall now that a few more updates have been installed. It says “this update is not applicable to your computer”.
 So who knows what’s going on.</li><li>So if that KB# didn’t help your sound, then just go down the list uninstalling the updates until you find the one that is causing the problem.</li><li>Probably Microsoft is aware if this and has fixed it in Windows 8.1 but I don’t know for sure.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I am going to update the other 26 items now and then make a backup copy of my operating system with a 32 Gb flash drive and then install Windows 8.1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The HP technician told me NOT to install 8.1 because it has more problems than 8.0 but I have no alternative since there is no support that I can get from Microsoft for problems with their security updates anymore.
</li><li>Record the problem KB# your printed list and IF the faulty update ever comes up to be installed again, then HIDE it if it causes the same problems.
</li></ol>
<p>Good luck,</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 not updating album info &#34;WMP is not configured for the internet&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having problems finding a solution to this problem. Everytime I right click and select Find Album Info All I get is the" WMP is not configured for the internet" message. I have tried reinstalling WMP11 and has not fixed it and I've used the Microsoft
 WMP troubleshooter to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I want is for the track title and artist to populate like previous versions I have had on previous PC's I have owned.</p>
<p>Strange thing is the Album Title has populated itself just not the rest of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>And just to add If I rated my PC abilities I would rate it as novice at best so any answers are going to have to be well presented please!!! lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft forums where you can find answers for all your Windows related queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that when you try to set a photo as the photo app background or as tile picture, you get the error message “Can't set this photo as the / Make sure the file isn't corrupt and try again”. You have also mentioned that you are able to open
 these files and set them as desktop background without any problem, but you get this error only while trying to set that picture as photo app background or as a tile picture. We’ll help you with this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What steps did you follow to set the picture as an app background or tile picture?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Which format pictures did you use? (like JPEG, GIF, etc,.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set an image as the photo app background, the image should be available in the Photo app. Photo app displays images from your picture library, Facebook pictures, Skydrive Pictures, Flickr pictures and pictures from devices. I would suggest you to try
 these steps to set an image as photo app background or as a tile picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open photo app and locate the picture that want to set as photo app background or as tile picture</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Double click that image to view it in full view and right click to get the app bar</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the “set as” option in the app bar and select app background \ app tile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already tried the above steps and it didn’t work, then I would suggest you to run a security check. You can run a full scan of your computer using the Windows defender to check if there is any virus or other online threats causing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you have any further queries, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</p>

 Facebook photos even though I connected it (I checked on Facebook to make sure it connected and it has).<br />

            <p>I've been having same problem when trying to set&nbsp;certain picture as tile photo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only solution that worked for me was to replace saved images in the directory. As you may or may not be aware photo app doesn't update images on a daily basis (not sure whether it's the original idea or an actual bug) but here is what I did; I replaced
 the saved titles manually. </p>
<p>So far the best solution I found to set your desired photos as tile pictures, here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Computer</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;C: (or whatever your hard drive is labelled as)</p>
<p>3. Click on "Users"</p>
<p>4. Click on your user profile</p>
<p>5. Click "View"</p>
<p>6. Check "Hidden Items"</p>
<p>7. Click on "AppData"</p>
<p>8. Click on "Local"</p>
<p>9. Click on "Packages"</p>
<p>10. Click on "<span>Microsoft.windowsphotos_[random characters]</span></p>
<p><span>11. Click on "Local State"</span></p>
<p><span>12. Now you see set of 5 pictures labelled as "LargeTile1, 2, 3, 4, 5" and other 5 labelled as "SmallTile1, 2, 3, 4, 5". Replace those images with the ones you want to be displayed. Remember to name them "LargeTile1", "LargeTile2" etc. and keep in
 mind the resolution&nbsp; 558x270 for a large one, and 270x270 for a small one. </span>

                    <p>Need help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For several days now, my Windows 10 Mail app has been crashing upon launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used PowerShell to remove the app and then reinstalled it from the Store as instructed
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/windows-10-mail-app/14388ac5-fcd9-4100-827e-7c653cd2b82f?auth=1">
here</a>, however now the app would simply give error "<strong>0x80040154" or "</strong><strong>0x80c8043e</strong>"&nbsp;when trying to re-add my Microsoft Account email. It gives the same error when trying to add another Outlook.com address or Gmail:</p>

<p>Didn't find&nbsp;any solution for this yet, a lot of people get this problem after first cumulative update for win10&nbsp;and it was not solved in second update too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best advice is to forget about this app for the time, and&nbsp;check your mail in browser&nbsp;like old times&nbsp;'cause no information was found about when this problem will be solved by MS or what causes this errors.</p>

            <p>Still same for me too, tried reinstalling app and some other things but nothing changed so far, will try to refresh the system today, will tell if it helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I far as I know a lot of people get problems with mail and calendar app and for last week no 100% solution was found, hope Microsoft will fix it soon enough or at least we will get some information about when this situation will be resolved.</p>

            <p>So I've tried to do system refresh and it failed, don't know why. Looks like two last updates for win10 messed something in system and it is deeper than mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far all I can say and recommend is to&nbsp;touch nothing and to do nothing and just wait for new update, fix or any possible solution from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it possible to downgrade from system now to win7 or 8.1 'cause I got a feeling that this feature will not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it sucks but all we can do is wait. It really hurts, I was placing high expectations on win10 but now I don't think I will recommend this OS yet, too buggy.</p>

            Resolved. Not running the application "Mail" and "People.<br />
<br />
Update Rollup for Windows 10 (KB3081438) crashes, error code or 0x80c8043e 0h80040154. The result is that the application does not work "Mail" and "People."<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Remove update (KB3081436) (KB3081438) job application to recover. The problem is that the update will automatically be downloaded and installed later when checking for updates.<br />
<br />
0h80040154<br />
<br />
Avoid it will help the utility "Show or hide updates", by downloading it from the Download Center Microsoft.<br />
<br />
First remove the update.<br />
<br />
Programs and Features -&gt; View installed updates -Removes (KB3081438) (KB3081436). Your computer restarts.<br />
After rebooting the system to check for updates<br />
Run the downloaded utility. Hit "Hide updates" put a tick in front KB3081438.<br />
Reboot<br />
Check the journal update (KB3081436) (KB3081438) if there is simply remove it again.<br />
&nbsp;Errors 0x80040154 and 0h80s8043e fixed - application "Mail" and "People" work.

<p><strong>The surest and correct way. Thanks for the help, now everything works!</strong><br />
<strong>My actions:</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Entered into account Microsoft - https://account.microsoft.com/ - and removed from your account this computer.</em><br />
<em><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Switch to a local account and made sure that the computer does not appear again in the account Microsoft.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ATTENTION!!!</strong><br />
<strong>Do not enter your account Microsoft !!! (from 3rd to 6th step).</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;(!!! a local account) to perform a clean installation of Windows 10 with a USB-stick.</em><br />
<em><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;(!!! a local account) Set everything that can pull an update.</em><br />
<em><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;(!!! a local account) install all updates from Windows Update.&nbsp;</em><em>(I check out a few times, so certainly all on this time).</em><br />
<em><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;(!!! a local account) install all updates from Microsoft Store.</em><br />
<em><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Entered into my existing account Microsoft from Microsoft Store ;)</em><br />
<br />
<strong><em>ALL IS READY! Mail and everything works!</em></strong><br />
<em><strong>Evgenii S.</strong>&nbsp;- a special thank you ;)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>that is, if briefly:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You must install the updates that correct the problem before the first authentication of the computer account Microsoft.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Самый верный и правильный способ. Спасибо за помощь, теперь всё работает!</strong><br />
<strong>Мои действия:</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Вошёл в учётную запись Microsoft - https://account.microsoft.com/ - и удалил из своего аккаунта этот компьютер.</em><br />
<em><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Переключился на локальную учётную запись и удостоверился что этот компьютер не появился снова в учётной записи Microsoft.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ВНИМАНИЕ!!!&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Пока не входим в учётную запись Microsoft!!! (с 3-его по 6-ой шаг).</strong><br />
<br />
<em><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;(!!! с локальной учётной записью) Выполнил чистую установку Windows 10 с USB-флешки.</em><br />
<strong><em>4.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;(!!! с локальной учётной записью) Установил всё, что может тянуть за собой обновления.</em><br />
<strong><em>5.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;(!!! с локальной учётной записью) Установил все обновления. (Проверил несколько раз, чтоб уж точно все).</em><br />
<em><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;(!!! с локальной учётной записью) Установил все обновления из Microsoft Store.</em><br />
<strong><em>7.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Запустил Microsoft Store и вошёл в учётную запись Microsoft через него.</em><br />
<em>(на всякий случай ;) ).</em><br />
<br />
<strong><em>ВСЁ ГОТОВО! Почта и всё остальное работает!</em></strong><br />
<em><strong>Evgenii S.</strong>&nbsp;- отдельное спасибо ;)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>p.s. то есть, если коротко:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Необходимо устанавливать обновления, исправляющие эту проблему, до первой аутентификации данного компьютера в учётной записи Майкрософт.</em></p>

            The idea is that your method might work, but:<br />
<br />
I prefer (and it faster and easier for me) reinstall the system, than to, after the create a new local account, clean out the remnants of the old account in the system =)<br />
<br />
And I do not want to use a different local name instead of his.<br />
<br />
To each his own ;)

<h3> joewatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed wrong version of windows 7</h2>
                    I was running a legitimate copy of Windows 7 that I downloaded from Microsoft when my hard disk crashed and wouldn't boot. I installed a new hard drive and installed Windows 7 on it and copied all my data from the unbootable disk and reinstalled my programs.
 The problem is that when I was installing Windows again I didn't have the activation code that Microsoft gave me so I used the code from a copy I bought earlier on ebay, which turns out to have been an OEM copy. Naturally, Windows in now telling me my code
 is not valid and I have 27 days to activate.<br />
<br />
What I would like best is for Microsoft to give me the code they originally gave me when I purchased Windows 7 from them, so I can enter it.<br />

The problem is that when I was installing Windows again I didn't have the activation code that Microsoft gave me so I used the code from a copy I bought earlier on ebay, which turns out to have been an OEM copy.

<p>Разумеется пароль никому давать не нужно. Человек получивший доступ к акку может тут же сменить пароль, а потом просто сделает трансфер лицензий контента и уведёт у тебя таким образом всё, что ты приобрёл в цифровом виде (GoD, DLC, Аркады, вещи аватара,
 темы, наборы картинок - всё что в Live ты покупал).</p>

<p><span>Hi sweetpink,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>AutoRunGUI.dll (AutoRun GUI) is a component from the software AutoRun GUI version 1.1.294 by Electronic Arts Inc. If the game is not able to find
 AutoRunGUI.dll, then the file might be corrupted or the CD might have some scratches which might be preventing the game to load.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, make sure the Discs are good and then try to load.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below to see if that help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Try copying the files off the CD to your hard drive and try installing from there&nbsp;</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start and click on Computer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 drive C.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on New Folder option to create a folder&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Name
 the folder as Disk Images (it is important that the name has a space in it).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 the Disk Images folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Create
 one more folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Name
 this folder Disk1.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 steps 6 and 7 while substituting Disk1 for Disk2 and so on until there are 4 'Disk' folders followed by a number 1 through 4. it is important to note there must not be a space between "Disk" and the number.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Insert
 Disk 1 of The Sims 2 into your CD-Rom drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>10.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start and click on Computer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>11.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 on the CD-ROM Drive and choose Open.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>12.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you see the contents of the disk in the Window, press CTRL + A to Select All.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>13.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 all the contents of the disk are highlighted press CTRL + C to Copy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>14.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 the Disk1 folder you created under C:\Disk Images; press CTRL + V to Paste. This will copy the contents of the CD into the Disk1 folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>15.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 steps 9 through 14 for the remaining disks until you have copied each disk into its appropriate folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>16.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 all the disks have been copied, remove ALL CDs from any drives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>17.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 the Disk1 folder under Disk Images and right click on autorun.exe and choose to “Run as administrator” to start the installation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>18.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To
 save disk space, you can delete the Disk Images folders after the installation is complete.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why would Microsoft call and ask me to press the Microsoft flag key and then the letter R on my computer. When I asked for details they dropped off.</h2>
                    Just had a call from a lady saying she was calling from Microsoft. She said there was a problem with my computer and asked me&nbsp;to press the Microsoft flag key and then the letter&nbsp;R on my computer. When I questioned why and asked for details the person dropped
 off the call.&nbsp;I'm now trying to find out if this was a genuine call to fix a problem I didn't even know I had - any ideas?

            <p>This is almost certainly a type of phony telephone support <u><strong>scam</strong></u> involving the Microsoft name. Do
<u><strong>not</strong></u> give them any info, do <u><strong>not</strong></u> give them access to your PC and do

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to login to the PC after installing the Windows 10 1903 update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try restarting the PC into safe mode and check if you are able to login to the PC. Refer the section
<strong>From the sign-in screen</strong> in the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to login to the PC in safe mode, try enabling the default administrator and then login to the PC. Follow the
 steps mentioned below to enable default administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open
<strong>Start Menu</strong> and type <strong>CMD</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Now right click on it and click on
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Type the following command to enable hidden administrator:
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Restart the PC and then try logging in to the
<strong>Administrator</strong> account.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you login to the Administrator account, create a new user account and try to login. Refer the article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to do that, using computer management and safe mode, although the Admin account still would not log in.&nbsp; It showed active but wasn't.&nbsp; I then used computer management to add my old log in to the Administrators group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other Issue that I had, and with the install was it would not allow me to save my apps or files.&nbsp; Not a major issue since my files are all backed up to the cloud as well as stored on different drives, but the option wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I get the above message, I can not access my control panel at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background info. I tried to change my user account type in user accounts my using the windows key + R, typed in netplwiz, and then selected properties, clicked group membership tab, then hit OK and apply. Then when I tried to gain access to control

<p><span><span>Hi Arcadiazone,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Was it working fine before?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you remember any recent changes made on your computer after which you are facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To narrow down the on the issue, we will start with booting the computer in
<strong>clean boot</strong> and check if the issue still persist. Below link will help you in booting the computer in clean boot:
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></strong></a><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue does not persist you may continue with
<strong>step 2</strong> from the above link.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Make sure you reset the computer to normal mode from step 7 after the troubleshooting.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For media center to crash, Media Center data store corruption might also be a reason. Try the steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Make sure ‘Show hidden files, folders and drives option is enabled.This will allow to show the hidden ProgramData under %SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Double click on it to open.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively in Start Search box type in:-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome and hit the Enter Key.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Double click on Microsoft folder and locate eHome.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Double click on eHome and locate mcepg data base (.db) file (eg.mcpeg2-0/mcepg1-5-0 etc).</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on mcpeg.db file and Delete it.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Restart the System and restart the Media Center as well.</span></span></p>

            already tried these options looks like i have to reinstall Windows 7 x64 to get media centre back working which is a bit annoying, there should have been a way to uninstall it then reinstall intstead of having to reinstall the whole operating system, this
 is a boo bbo on microsoft part

<p><span>Hello
<span>Arcadiazone</span><span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Site.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, please relay the error message you receive after following the steps provided by Samhrutha G in the above reply.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>In addition to Samhrutha G's reply, y</span><span>ou may also try using the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)
 to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>To do this, click Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories, right-click Command Prompt and then click Run as administrator.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with the correct Microsoft versions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information on using the System File Checker tool, you may also view the link below:
