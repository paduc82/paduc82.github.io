<h2>            Incoming Video is Zoomed in.</h2>
                    The incoming video calls that I receive, the picture is very zoomed in. I have to zoom out of full screen to see the persons entire face. Is there any way I can change this? There is nothing in settings that seems to work

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does solve the issue of the value of 0 not being included on the graph, but I didn't do a good job of explaining that I don't want the category/label to show up at all if the value is 0.</p>
<p>So in the example below only Finance and HR would show up on the graph.</p>
<p>Customer Service =&nbsp; 0%</p>
<p>Design&nbsp; = 0%</p>
<p>Finance&nbsp;&nbsp; =2%</p>
<p>HR&nbsp; = 3%</p>
<p>Retail = 0%</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Marilyn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While not a valid error code (I suspect it's 0x80070003), and while that typically relates to updates, the following thread about a similar error code may be helpful:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Update-error-80070002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Windows-Update-error-80070002</a> to see if that helps (but I don't think it will and what follows avoids WU problems by not upgrading with WU or in any other way - but it may be worth a shot since it provided
 a simlar error code). If that doesn't resolve things, let's move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where you are so lets start from the beginning, check a few things, and make sure everything is done correctly. And we're going to forget upgrading and install MSE fresh to remove upgrade problems from the equation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version after being upgraded is behind this (though if not the
 case, these articles still provide instructions to uninstall and going manual often does a more complete job), so you may need to focus more on the manual procedures in the first link or&nbsp;the second link with the Mr Fixit in aggressive mode&nbsp;AND manual procedures
 to be sure it is completely removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs - you MUST also use the removal tool - even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn't use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the assisted support or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn't know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem.

<h2>            Lost all my old emails</h2>

            Hey stephymarie,
<div><br />
<div>Your error message shows that you've moved the Word application from your <b>
Applications</b> folder to the <b>Desktop</b>. That's almost&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;causing your crash.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Inside your Applications folder, you should have another folder called <b>Microsoft Office 2011.
</b>All of your Office applications (including Word) belong in this folder. Moving the Word app back to this folder should resolve your issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>If you'd like a shortcut on your Desktop for Word after you've moved it back to the Applications folder, right-click (or Control-Click) the Word application and choose
<b>Make Alias</b>. This will create a shortcut to Word. You can drag this shortcut to your Desktop without affecting your application file.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Also, once Word opens correctly again, <i><b>please</b>&nbsp;</i>update your copy of Office. You're currently running a completely vanilla copy of Office.&nbsp;You can get the latest updates by choosing
<b>Help &gt; Check for Updates</b> from within any Office application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<h2>            How to delete less secure way of logging in to Skype and only use Microsoft login</h2>
                    <p>I recently found that spam messages were sent from my Skype account to all of my Skype contacts.&nbsp; I had implemented two-factor security and have notifications on my Microsoft account that I use to log in to Skype, but I just found out that the old way of
 logging into Skype directly with my Skype Name and old (weak) password still works.&nbsp; I would like to eliminate this less secure way of logging in so that spammers cannot access my account.&nbsp; How do I delete this way of logging in?<br />

<p>Hi Karen_01,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I use the Skype latest version on iOS 11.3 on my iPad.&nbsp; However, I also can access my account on web.skype.com on my PC Windows 10 or the Win 10 app, latest version.&nbsp; Whatever is easiest to change the login issue is fine by me.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Skype remembers your Skype name automatically to help you sign in easily, unfortunately there's no option to remove it. I can only suggest to clear the Skype's data and cache on your iPad and make sure to manually sign out.</p>

            Thanks Karen.&nbsp; I guess that will allow me to log in with Microsoft but it seems there is no way to ensure that there is only ONE way to log in.&nbsp; In the meantime I changed the Skype password to a very long complex, unique one so no hackers should be able
 to find their way into the account that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Can I switch back to classic outlook&#47;hotmail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft</p>
<p>My "NEW" outlook email is so slow. How slow is it? It takes me 45 minutes to an hour to get past my "PINNED" emails to get to my newest emails. When it was in the "Classic" style as you call it I could get to my newest emails in 20 seconds. My newest emails
 are the emails that appear just after the last "PINNED" email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Classic style barely moving the scroll bar could change the dates of the emails you are viewing by 30 days. The scroll bar was only about a third of an inch long. I could put my mouse pointer anywhere below the scroll bar and just click and count
 to 20 and I would be at the end of my "PINNED" emails.</p>
<p>The New outlook's scroll bar is very long and it will bottom out at the bottom of the page after about 20 seconds and then struggle to to reset itself in a tiny area and you click and you click and the scroll bar bottoms out and you have to wait to try to
 click again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is unusable.</p>
<p>Please switch me back to the Classic Outlook server so that I can access my emails.</p>
<p>And since I can't get to my newest emails because it would take more than an hour to reach the end of the pinned emails Please send notifications to "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" Otherwise I won't know when to read any feedback advice you might have for me. I can't
 read my outlook email because of your changes from "Classic Outlook" to "New Outlook"</p>
<p>I really need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unchecked the box "Notify me when someone responds to this post. I can't get to my outlook email. Please contact me using my gmail email.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is no "classic". If you don't have the Beta slider in the upper right then you are on the permanent new and improved front end.</p>
<p>With all these improvements have you cleared your browser's cache so you have the latest and greatest code?</p>
<p>Also, you do have some config options in the Settings menu that might help you adjust to the new front end.</p>

    <title>Generic icons shown for exe files in Cortana. Also settings results - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Generic icons shown for exe files in Cortana. Also settings results show no icons.</h2>
                    <p>First issue I've run in to is that when using Cortana to launch system executables, like regedit or cleanmgr, cortana shows a generic icon. If I rebuild the icon cache it works temporarily, but then goes back to using a generic icon. Also once I search for
 an executable after rebuilding the icon cache, it's icon is displayed for all executables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: </p>
<p>1. Search for regedit, get generic icon</p>
<p>2. Delete icon cache, reboot</p>
<p>3. Search for regedit, icon displays properly</p>
<p>4. Search for cleanmgr, icon is now regedit icon</p>
<p>5. Reboot, icons go back to generic ones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when searching for control panel items, I'll often expand the results under settings, at which point the gears are all replaced with blank pieces of paper.</p>

</p><p>Third small issue, Hey Cortana registers Cortana twice, so all my searches are "cortana &lt;insert rest of what I said here&gt;"</p>

<h2>            N97... is there a way to find out if it&#39;s network locked&#63; and if it&#39;s genuine&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I know, not the best idea to buy these products on ebay, but I'm afraid I've done it and now looking for any advice anybody can give!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all the seller told me it was unlocked and had his location down as Ireland, which is where I'm based. &nbsp;I therefore presumed it had been checked on Irish networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However when the phone arrived it had come from Poland and was made in China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I insert my sim and switch it on it just says "insert sim". &nbsp;I'm wondering if this is because it's locked or a fault in the phone. &nbsp;The seller insists he had tried it and it was unlocked. &nbsp;Of course, I now realise he would have tried it in Poland, not
 a whole lot of use to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way of finding out which network it is locked to? &nbsp;Or even if the phone is a genuine nokia product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated! :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>What's your product code mate?<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the handset is locked it would recognise the sim card but say "sim not valid" or something along those longs (usually anyway). So it looks like it's a faulty unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, start the handset up without a SIM card and type *#0000#, does it come up with the software version etc?</p>
<p>If that does work, try *#7370#, does it come up asking to reset your handset or something similar? If so, then you can be fairly sure it's a genuine Nokia device.</p>

            you're definitely correct, not the best idea to stay away from ebay...too many fake/counterfeit stuffs especially phone. i.e. majority of the 8800 are fake on ebay...

<p>When I type in *#0000#,&nbsp; It does come up with the software version etc.&nbsp; Also the seriel number coming up on the handset matches the one printed under the battery cover.&nbsp; Phone at home and I'm at work so haven't managed to check *#7370#,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some new information though... When I put in my 3 Ireland sim it just says "Insert Sim" but when I tried somebody's O2 Sim it looked for a Pin number and then said "Invalid Sim".&nbsp; I'm just wondering now maybe it's that it doesn't recognise the 3 Ireland
 sims... would they be different?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also the phone looks in every way to be a genuine nokia, However it was made in China and the games etc on it are all in chinese script (!).&nbsp; i'm afraid to reset it to factory settings in case the whole phone reverts to chinese script and I can't change
 it back!&nbsp; Also the time zone city was set to Beijing.</p>

<p>There is a simple test for this: type *#92702689#, this should bring up details about the phone. Most chinese fakes use a dodgy OS on the phone. If you could provide some pictures of the actual screen then I'm sure I could easily spot if its a fake.</p>

<p>Don't assume it's a fake just because the handset was made in China.&nbsp; Nokia don't assemble all their phones in Finland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did you pay for the transaction on eBay?&nbsp; I am hoping through PayPay.&nbsp; If it turns out to be a fake, you could always try and instigate a refund request through PayPal.&nbsp; I've always found them superb on the extremely rare occasion I've had a purchase
 problem on eBay.&nbsp; That said, I've got my fingers crossed for you that it works out OK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Insert SIM" message is nothing to do with locking on Nokia phones, if it was locked and you put in a different network's SIM it would ask you for a restriction code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you plug the phone into a PC and it gives options like: PC Suite, mass sotrage, image transfer and media transfer then you should have a real S60 Nokia. If it gives options like Camera and COM port, you've got a fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have doubts, call Nokia's customer support and ask them to check the IMEI number - that way you can be 100% sure either way.</p>

<p>Thanks Mccbleue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I plug it into the PC it gives 3 options, one is mass storage and another is pictbridge and can't remember the 3rd. &nbsp;However I downloaded Ovi suite (no CD rom came with it) and Ovi doesn't recognise the phone at all. &nbsp;I thought it might have been to
 do with the fact that it's a chinese model, or currently has no sim in it so wasn't sure if this was an indication if it was fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However spent some time on the phone to my network tech support and they were trying to talk me through the menus. &nbsp;The menu on this phone seems very different to what they expected, and also what's in the manual. &nbsp;For example under settings there's no option
 for connectivity. &nbsp;Again I wasn't sure if this was because it was made in china. &nbsp;Should the made in china phones be exactly the same as the european models?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>The N97 wheather made in China or Finland should be exactly the same. One possibility is that the phone has been reported stolen therefore has been blocked.</p>
<p>You could try and check the IMEI if you can access it on this web site <a href="http://www.checkmend.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Hi AlineVida,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your question, I’d like to tell you it’s hard to avoid because DLP policy looks for a sensitive information type is defined and detected by using a combination of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Keywords</span></li><li><span>Internal functions to validate checksums or composition</span></li><li><span>Evaluation of regular expressions to find pattern matches</span></li><li><span>Other content examination</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is an article about DLP sensitive information types for your reference:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for-fd505979-76be-4d9f-b459-abef3fc9e86b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for-fd505979-76be-4d9f-b459-abef3fc9e86b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After people create and turn on their DLP policies, there will be some content that is not sensitive information matches the rules – in other words, there will be some false positives.
</span></p>

    <title>Text losing quality when sent as e-mail &#40;Publisher 2010&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbply  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text losing quality when sent as e-mail &#40;Publisher 2010&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I send my publication as a single page via e-mail (in the body, not as an attachment), the font changes and severely loses quality. I've done everything: changed the font to several different Web-acceptable varieties, checked to make sure no text
 box is converted to an image, and checked to make sure the e-mail isn't being sent as a JPEG. Nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>In Publisher: http://puu.sh/7k1sA.png ; In e-mail:&nbsp;http://puu.sh/7k1tS.png</p>
<p>In Publisher:&nbsp;http://puu.sh/7k1yC.png ; In e-mail:&nbsp;http://puu.sh/7k1z6.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please explain why this is happening and provide a solution? One of my requirements for sending this document is that it be sent in the body of the e-mail and not as an attachment, so converting it to PDF isn't an option. Also, I can't send the
 whole thing as a high-quality image because it has hyperlinks. Thank you.</p>

<p>If that does not resolve your issue then deconstruct your email message and start with only the text box. Once you get the base email to work then add one design element at a time testing as you go. This will help you find what you can and cannot do and
 why your original email formatting broke. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Then realize that chances are even though you have managed to tweak the content of this particular email message so that it works with your particular version of Outlook, that chances are it will not work with one of the many other email clients that are
 used by the recipients of your email. So test with all other email clients that might be used to view your email. Then realize that if the recipient has their email client set to 'plain text only' they won't be able to view your message as you formatted it,
 or view any pictures that you might have included. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that you don't want to hear it but IMHO the&nbsp;<strong><em>only</em></strong> way to get consistent results using Publisher is to convert to a pdf and attach it.&nbsp; If you write a simple but effective introduction in the body of your email message and
 your message is of interest and wanted by the recipient they will open the pdf. If it is spam, then it won't matter whether it is in the message body or a pdf...it will be deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to send a html formatted message body and cannot get the results you want with Publisher then consider using specialty software such as:

<h2>            Can I dismiss past due &#47; expired reminders in Outlook for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Outlook for Mac 16.16.4&nbsp;and would like for notifications for past meetings to automatically be dismissed since they have not use. I cannot travel into the past to attend a previous meeting, so it doesn't make sense to remind me about that meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there way to do this on macOS? I'm not an Exchange admin so I am limited to client-side solutions .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>POWERPNT.EXE Process not Ending - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bberheim  say:</h3>
<h2>            POWERPNT.EXE Process not Ending</h2>
                    I have seen some questions out here that seem to be asking the same thing, but not quite...
<br />
<br />
I am using a Windows7 operating system, PowerPoint 2010 and also am using Articulate Studio 09, which I think is causing the issue - but I am not sure...&nbsp; I have reached out to Articulate as well, but they are pointing to the PowerPoint end...<br />
<br />
What happens is this:<br />
<br />
I work on an Articulate presentation (in PowerPoint), and when I save and close PowerPoint, and then try to open a different presentation to work on, the system will freeze when I am trying to publish the Articulate presentation.&nbsp; This freezing can also be
 seen if I try to move PPT files once I have opened and closed them...<br />
<br />
The consistent thing I note is that when I look at Task Manager, there is no PowerPoint application running, however, there is a POWERPNT.EXE process running - and that has a variable size - normally 45 KB or so.&nbsp; I thought perhaps that size matched the presentation
 I had been in, but no luck there.<br />
<br />
I try to end the process, and it does nothing - no message that it can't end, but it doesn't end.<br />
<br />
The only way I have been able to continue is to power down - which also often kicks out an error until sometimes I have to just hard reboot by holding the power button down.&nbsp; Once the machine is repowered, I can move files, etc etc until I open PowerPoint again.<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            <p><b>Powerpnt.exe</b> is the process name for

<p>Is the issue with a specific presentation created using Articulate Studio 9.0 or even with the presentations created without the 3

<p>Were you able to create and open the presentations earlier using the Articulate Studio software?</p>
<p>Open a new presentation in safe mode and then open the presentation by going to File -&gt; Open and check if it freezes. Follow the steps:</p>
<p>1. Click on

2. Go to <b>Accessories</b> -&gt; Click on <b>RUN</b>.<br />
3. Type <b>powerpnt /safe</b> (Leave a space after powerpnt) -&gt; Click on

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got some results from the Nokia Battery Monitor, that I hope you can help me with...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2:20am of the 20th of Nov, that I haven't touched my N8 (except after a few hours to check the Nokia Battery Monitor).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just now, I went to the statistics tab of the Monitor, and realised that it says that 100% of my battery was spent on "other".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, if I haven't touched the phone, no apps&nbsp;have been&nbsp;running, with exception to NBM, and the phones was all the time at the homescreen, how come that the statistics say 100% "other" instead of 100% "Homescreen"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
        </p>

    <title>In Windows Update, Microsoft Office 2010 32Bit Update &#35; KB2553347 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitchellxp  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows Update, Microsoft Office 2010 32Bit Update &#35; KB2553347 will not Install, Error Code 0x80070693</h2>
                    <p>I am being directed to an answer to the problem "Security Essential Updates will not Install error code 0x80070693" my problem is not with "Security Essential Updates" my problem is with "Microsoft Office 2010, 32 Bit Update KB2553347" not successfully installing.
 I have had the problem since Sept 30 this year. The windows Update Instruction is "Try Again" but each time it fails to install. My Operating System is Window 10 Pro 64 Bit. Can this discrepancy be fixed or is there a work-around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>17 December 2016,<br />
I am editing this request, because I don't think, that as it is written, it really exposes the real problem. I have added a more detailed description of the problem.</p>

<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span style="color: rgba(54, 95, 145, 1)">Installation Problems</span></span></span>

<p><span><span>On 09/22/2016 the Microsoft Office 2010 32
 bit KB2553347 (on that one single day), downloaded and apparently successfully installed 18 times. The 18 installations are confirmed by entries on the List of Installed Updates. There is definitely something wrong with the multiple installations; once an
 Update is successfully installed, it is never installed again.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>On 10/13/2016 the Microsoft Office 2010 32 bit KB2553347, twice downloaded and twice but failed to install. Since 10/13/2016, every day, until the current date, that
 this computer has been online, there have been at least 2 to 3 failed attempts to install the Microsoft Office 2010 32 bit Update KB2553347. These failed attempts are documented by entries in my Update History List. If nothing is done to fix Windows Update,
 I can visualize thousands of “Failed to install” entries on the Update History List. There is something very wrong with Windows Update.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Update Status page
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always displays</span> one Update (the KB2553347) that has been downloaded and failed to install. The error code displayed is #0x80070693, and the “Try Again” button is also displayed. I guess a work-around of disabling
 the automatic features of Windows Update, however, all of the discrepancies mentioned above as soon as the application is enabled.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter several times and each time it indicated that it found and fixed problem, however, if after 2 minutes the troubleshooter was
 run again, it tells you that it has found and fixed those same problems. Running the Windows Update Troubleshooter has no effect on the renegade Update KB2553347; it still remains as a permanent downloaded Update that will not install, and each time it fails
 to install, another “Failed to install” entry is added to my Update History List.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Other Information:</span></span></strong><span> My OS is Windows 10 64 bit,
 version 1607. </span></span></p>

<h2>            How to get individual Google Calender events into Outlook Desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have one client who uses the Google suite. I'm trying to figure out how I can just copy calendar events from Google into Outlook. When someone sends a Google one to my main email, the invite can be opened and added, but I haven't found a way do do that
 in the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a way to export/import the entire calendar, but that's not something I want to do for every event.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found a way to share the calendar in Outlook, through the "Internet Calendars" tab, but that requires I make my Google calendar public, opening it not just to people but to their search engine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple way to copy individual events from GC to Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi ithinktfiam,
<br />The only way to save one event is if google gives you the option to save it as an ics.  You can send it as an invitation, which includes an ics attachment. 
<br />
<br />If you open the google calendar in outlook, you can copy the events you need to your own calendar, then remove the google calendar from outlook.

            There are 3rd party tools that will sync Gmail and Outlook.com calendars. I use one called Outlook4Gmail that you might check into. I'm sure there are others.

            &gt;&gt; the only way to open it in Outlook is to make it public in Google.
<br />Mostly Correct. That is a limitation of google's calendaring system. However, you don't need to make it public - you do need to make a"secret address" link for it. 
<br />
<br />I couldn't find an option to export a single event, which is another limitation from google. :( 
<br />
<br />You could copy it to a new google calendar them export it as an ics.- create the calendar, click on the event, click the 3 dots in the upper right and choose copy the [calendar name] - you can either export it or share it using a private url.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/665f2baa-b37b-4456-827e-5abf7a10b7f3?upload=true" />

            Hi Edward
<br />
<br />You can do it a couple ways.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 performs a clean install again
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience (OOBE)
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience assist with personlizing your Windows experience such as creating a user account, connect to a wireless network and adjust privacy settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />Choose your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone then click Next
<br />
<br />Read and accept the End User License Agreement
<br />
<br />If you want to customize your privacy settings, you can do so now. Please note, you can always do this after setup (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy). For now, lets use Use Express settings
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next
<br />
<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows
<br />
<br />If you are unable to boot to the desktop, do the following at the sign in screen:
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Remove Everything
<br />Fully clean the drive
<br />Click Reset
<br />

<br />
<br />Option 3:
<br />
<br />Create a Surface Pro recovery drive and use it to reinstall Windows 10:

            <p>If you want to display the dates that way, while keeping the underlying data as real dates, simply apply the custom number format yyyymmdd to the cells with the dates.</p>
<p>If you would like a value such as 20121231 as a number, you can use formulas adjacent to the cells with the dates.</p>
<p>Let's say you have dates in A2:A100.</p>
<p>In B2, enter the formula</p>
<p>=10000*YEAR(A2)+100*MONTH(A2)+DAY(A2)</p>
<p>Format B2 as General.</p>
<p>Fill down from B2 to B100 (or as far as needed)</p>

<li>If you have a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">column</span> of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            Hi, JoseSerrano,
<br />
<br />I believe that you have Office 365 pre-installed in your Laptop/PC.
<br />
<br />Please kindly uninstall all versions of office, the pre-installed office 365 &amp; the office 2019 that you may have also installed.
<br />
<br />Reboot your computer, &amp; install the office 2019 that you have downloaded from the URL given to your when you purchased from HUP.
<br />
<br />All office shortcuts in your computer now will then be office 2019 only.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Lee

<p>They already migrated to Modern HUP where all you can purchase is Office 365 subscription . If your company have purchase a total of 2000 licenses your company is still eligible for Lifetime license like Office Pro Plus/ Office Home and Business . You can
 contact Microsoft Support if they can help you place the order on there end for the Office 2019 :

            Hi JoseSerrano,
<br />
<br />This is what I found out.
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/home-use-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/home-use-program</a>
<br />Login to your Microsoft Account from the icon in the top right hand corner. If you don’t have a Microsoft account you will need to create one. Note: This should be with a personal email address, e.g. a Hotmail address.
<br />Once logged in enter your corprate email address into the “work address” box on the screen and click Get Started.
<br />Leave your browser window open and wait for the invitation email from Microsoft.
<br />When you receive the email click on “Login to Start Saving”
<br />This will open a new browser window or tab but you should still be logged into your Microsoft account.
<br />Scroll down past all the advertisements for Office 365 and you should see the link to purchase Office 2019 toward the bottom.
<br />Click on this link and a buy now page should open.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Lee<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e46a9809-cc35-467b-8e37-a06dd84c7d00?upload=true" />

<h2>            How to find Microsoft Office 13 product key&#63;</h2>
                    Several years ago I purchased MS Office 13 for my laptop. The hard drive is failing, so I purchased a new laptop. I want to transfer MS Office 13 to the new laptop. I no longer have the email with the info/product key from the original purchase. I've seen
 videos online that say to uninstall from old laptop and install on new one, but those videos assume I have the product key. Can you help?

            Sorry, you are out of luck. 
<br />
<br />Starting with Office 2013 MS "improved" the way the key was stored on hd. The "product key extraction" tools can only find the last 5 char of the product key. Enough to uniquely match the 5 digits to your copy/record of the full product key.
<br />
<br />There was an option for you to "register" your product key with the MS online site. Very few people took advantage of it.  Try logging in to  
<br />HTTPS://OFFICE.COM/MYACCOUNT  
<br />
<br />check to see if you have an Office license assocaited with it.
<br />
<br />If you don't you will have to buy a new Office license.
<br />
<br />Hint, IF YOU STILL PREFER ONE-TIME PAYMENT LICENSES, FOR NOW GET A 365 PERSONALY SUBSCRIPTION
<br />Although it seems counter-intuitive, for the next few months it is to your advantage to get a Monthly 365 Personal subscription.
<br />
<br />MS has announced that Office 2019 will be released in the second half of this year.  Educated best guesses suggest the release date will be between August and October.  This new release will include many/most of the “new features” that were released to 365/2016 subscribers only. 
<br />
<br />In the past in order to keep sales going during the last few months before the new release, (keep the money coming in) MS has given a “free upgrade” offer. If you buy Office 2016 one-time payment during the offer period, you will be able to get a “free” license to Office 2019 when it is released.  Since they no longer have “upgrade” licenses that replace an older “qualitying” license. So, you end up with 2 for the price of one. That is definitely worth paying for a few months of the 365 subscription.
