    <title>Changed root folder path, permanently lost folders and messages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Changed root folder path, permanently lost folders and messages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a puzzler for the Outlook wizards. I'm wondering if somebody can help me recover my colleague's lost folders and messages. The short version is that I changed the Root Folder Path setting in Outlook 2013 for his IMAP account, resulting in
 the loss of several nested folders and contained messages that were apparently not synced by IMAP. Reverting the setting did not recover the folders/messages!</p>
<p>
</p><p>------- Long version ------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bear with me on the explanation and please please do provide any relevant input that might help with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleague is using Outlook 2013 and had 2 IMAP accounts configured: 1 Gmail account and 1 other account (let's call it "Work"). At first, his issue was that several of his "Work" account folders nested under the Inbox were not syncing to his
 iPhone email client. I attempted to help by configuring IMAP folders in both applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The provider of the Work email specifies that the path for IMAP folders should be configured as "INBOX." Therefore I set this path on his iPhone and changed the Root Folder Path in Outlook 2013 for the Work account to the same, "INBOX".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon the change in Outlook 2013, his nested folders immediately disappeared, including all of the contained messages. I reverted the setting back to the default (blank), which restored only 1 folder with a handful of messages, one that apparently
 had been configured as an IMAP folder, but the rest of the folders were just gone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>!!! I had just eliminated the majority of my colleagues work email!</p>
<p>
</p><p>One important piece of information that I was given after the fact was that the disappeared folders from the Work account had been "dragged and dropped" there from the Gmail account folders that appeared in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where did the other folders and messages go?! Any help recovering the messages and (less importantly) folder structure would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nanovation</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Brian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried logging into the Work provider's web interface, and found no folders or messages corresponding to the folders that were lost (recall, originally generated by "drag-n-drop" from folders in Outlook under the Gmail IMAP account). These folders contained
 a mix of messages that were sent to his Gmail account or his Work account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's puzzling to me is that there remained a folder that clearly was an IMAP folder under his Work account and it was easy to recover and sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it likely that the other folders were somehow local and not IMAP synchronized?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the &lt;Work&gt;.ost file reports a size of ~4 MB when the properties are checked from Outlook, but in Windows Explorer the file size appears as ~16 MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that all the messages and folder structure are hiding in that .ost file and that Outlook just isn't displaying them?</p>

            <p>I set the root folder to Inbox because i was not receiving email. Same result as Nano &amp; you are correct Brian in that no email was actually lost on GMail - it is all there in the webmail, or if you POP it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I found that changing the root folder must have affected the GMail account on the server: I created new IMAP profiles on this &amp; other computers and found that they also lost the folder structure. Moreover, I re-created the folders from backup &amp;
 repeated the procedure with the same results...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I only found this thread after I had confirmed the cause - I was searching for "Outlook IMAP to GMail missing subfolders" and the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, setting the root folder as you, Brian, have prescribed, does not restore the folders - which confirms my theory that the GMail account gets changed somehow. That is my next avenue of investigation.</p>

            Changing the root folder path shouldn't change anything on the server, merely cause Outlook to interpret the folder structure that the server is presenting in a different fashion.

            <p>I completely agree: It <em>SHOULDN'T</em> change anything on the server.</p>
<p>But, if you make the change, then change it back, you do not get your folders back. So, if we agree that there is no change on the server, then it means that those folders never existed on the server - Outlook IMAP is lying &amp; saving permanent data in an
 OST that gets wiped/rebuilt at the metaphorical drop of a hat. If that is true,&nbsp;it completely undermines the purpose of IMAP.</p>

            <p>I think that's what happened, because outlook 2013 hadn't synchronized with the server properly and we were trying to fix it we changed the root folder to Inbox which removed all the folders and messages and I cant seem to get them, back!!
</p>
<p>Is there somewhere you could retrieve them?</p>

            What phone do you have?<br />
<br />
The advice 7thSense recommends only works if you have a windows phone 7 or 8 device.&nbsp; But since you posted your question to the "windows phone 6.5 or earlier" forum, I'm thinking your phone may not run the windows phone 7 or 8 operating system.&nbsp; Instead you
 may have a phone that uses the now discontinued windows <b><i>mobile </i></b>operating system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you have a windows mobile phone, there is no need to register your phone to Microsoft (and there isn't a way to register a windows mobile phone) since there are no Microsoft services available to a windows mobile devices&nbsp; (no marketplace, no "find my phone").&nbsp;
 All Microsoft sponsored services for windows mobile devices were discontinued more than a year ago.

<p>There is no way to connect a windows mobile 6.5 on the windowsphone.com website.&nbsp; The windows mobile OS was discontinued and anything on the windowwphone.com website is not compatible with the windows mobile OS.</p>

            <p>So, I did figure out how to successfully import macros into Word for Mac 2016, from Word for Mac 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does help that you can install the 2016 and not uninstall the 2011 version prior to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the main set of steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Know where your macros are stored, for example, New Macros subfile saved within the Normal.dotm file of Word for Mac 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open up a blank document in Word for Mac 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Select from the top menu area (outside of Word via Finder bar), Tools -&gt; Macros -&gt; Macro</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Select Organizer, in the right area browse to your macro file, within your old Normal.dotm file</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Migrate the file over the the left area, saving it to your new Normal.dotm file (not Document1, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Save the file and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Reopen a new blank document, ensure macros are still there, via Tool -&gt; Macros -&gt; Macro, they should show up right on that front page of the macros [Note: However, they will not work, just yet...]</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. You now need to finalize this via mapping your keyboard commands, they ones you prefer and are already use to by work habit, to the macros. You do this again from the Finder bar menu, Tool -&gt; Customize Keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. In this Customize Keyboard area, left window for Categories, select Macros, then individually re-map keystroke combinations to match your prior habit. (Remove/Assign buttons as needed). Double check your data-entry, save with OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Save the file and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. Open a new file, and verify the macros now are successfully transferred and also are mapped to the keystrokes you are familiar with from your prior work habit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should work, notice it is a two phase process, basically importing the macros, and then reworking the keyboard mapping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someday this may be uploaded to the actual Help file. That would be really useful. :)</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Let's go ahead and check on this. If the live account hasn't been used for a year, it will be deactivated. That's the reason why it was telling you to set up a new account when you were trying to reset the password.

<h2>            A few changes</h2>
                    Using Current build 9926, I can see that windows 10 is continually improving for the better. I do like the new changes including the new xbox app I can see this being useful as I am a pc gamer &amp; and xbox gamer too. Although I would like to see the back
 of the games app as it is totally useless as far as im concerned and the xbox app should replace it. I like the start menu though I would like to see the return of aero effects for the start menu, taskbar and window bars etc. If your pc is powerful enough
 then why not use it? it makes sense. for those pcs that can it can be disabled just like I can be in windows 7.

<blockquote>It has been posted all over the web that the 1st update to WP7 with copy &amp; paste will be released in early February 2011.</blockquote>
<br />
Some websites indicated a January update and&nbsp;others said that it will be February, I am relying on the initial MS statement that it will come in the 1st quarter (Jan, Feb or March).&nbsp; I am convinced that there have been a variety of changes they want to make
 and that the update has to be checked, double checked and then verified again to make sure it will be a flawless process.&nbsp; Because of that, I can only assume we are looking at sometime in March .... but you never know, it may come sooner.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may make the Outlook.com as primary alias. For doing so you may refer the following article:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Use aliases to add email addresses to your account:</p>

<h2>            Change Office H&#38;B 2016 activation account</h2>
                    <p>I was in the process of installing Office Home and Business 2016 for a customer of mine as I am an IT business and somehow the product has been activated under my business Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how I can change the linked account over to my customer's info as he did not have a Microsoft account at the time and since installing the pc and setting up Office again, it shows it is linked to my account and not his.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed some light of this please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling the product from the computer and redownloaded it from MS as it is a retail version with a PKC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that Office could not be installed as a standalone and has to be activated with Microsoft to work, which I seemed to have found also, which has caused this problem.</p>

            <p>OK. I take back some of my rant.&nbsp; After the phone support told me it was not possible to change to the account associated with Office,&nbsp; I went on chat with another tech who was able to change it for me. I gave him both accounts the and he made the switch,
 then sent a "redeem" email to the correct address.&nbsp; After going through the Redeem process Office was then associated with the correct account.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 2013 Drive space</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to Apologize first &nbsp;if i am posting in wrong category. I have simple question regarding Office 2013.&nbsp;<br />
Before Installing Office my drive space was 14 gb Approx. &nbsp;After Office 11 gb Approx.. It consumed nearly 2.5 to 3 gb space. No problem here. But then i decide to remove Office&nbsp;because&nbsp; only needs Word. So after uninstalling i selected customize Installation
 &amp; picked only Word to install. It worked fine. Now i can only see word in my Laptop,, no more Access, Excel Powerpoint etc. But problem is it still consumed similar amount of space 2 to 3 gb. When i checked Office files in drive location it says 354mb files
 only. So how it is still consuming GBs of space? Plz let me know i need some space :) Thanks in Advance</p>

            <p>Hello Rahul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description provided you would like to know about the computer disk space used after installing Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install Office 2013 suite 3GB of hard disk space is sufficient. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office installation files would be saved in different files and folders in the computer. You may refer to the section
<strong>‚ÄòManual steps for uninstalling Office 2013 or Office 365‚Äô </strong>which provides detailed information about the Office installation files present in the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: Please do not delete any of the files given in the article. It is for your reference to know about the Office files. You need all the files to run Office product.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also clear up the ‚ÄòTemp‚Äô files which would be created during the installation of Office 2013. So delete the temp files by following steps given below.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Open Run (press Windows key + R), type %TEMP% and then press Enter</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press Ctrl + A to select all the files</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press Delete to clear the contents of this folder (select Skip for the files which cannot be deleted)</li></ul>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>For further clarification, reply and we would be happy to assist.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Are you trying to connect through Wifi or through mobile data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's mobile data, you may want to check with your operator for any problems with the service. Same goes for your Wifi internet provider. Also, you may want to try restart the router.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, you are able to access your hotmail account. If you later decide that you want to get back into your Facebook account, you would get better assistance going directly to

<h2>            Powerpoint freezes &#47; hangs when using keyboard short cuts &#40;Mac 2011&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This doesn't happen all of the time, but it's happening more and more frequently. Whenever I try to copy, paste, select all, undo, etc. using keyboard shortcuts, Powerpoint for Mac (2011) freezes for 10 - 30 seconds and I get the rainbow wheel of misery.
 (Which as you can imagine, is really annoying and makes it hard to quickly put a presentation together.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's crazy is the program does NOT freeze or hang when I apply those commands by right clicking or by using the mouse and selecting them from the menu / ribbon within the program. So it's not the command itself, it's the use of the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>

            <p>The Outlook issue was caused by the 14.5.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">0</span> update. The 14.5.1 update which corrected the issue was published 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, your installation of OS X is is behind -- 10.10.3 is current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest that you update the OS first, then update Office. Follow that by running
<strong>Disk Utility</strong> to <em>repair disk permissions</em> then Restart your Mac.</p>

            Purging from Outlook is not working - they are working on fixing it, but I do not have an ETA for a fix. 
<br />
<br />You'll need to go to outlook.com or outlook.office365.com to purge deleted items. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Do not call the phone # the spammer posted as a response - its a tech support scam.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can&nbsp;follow the steps&nbsp;on this link to know&nbsp;how to enabled two-step verification,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a heads up, It is possible that you will be asked to update your Skype accounts to Microsoft before you can complete setting up two-step verification. Updating means, you will connect a Microsoft account to your Skype accounts and&nbsp;in as much as you
 would like to use one email address for these two accounts, note that you can only link one Microsoft account/email address&nbsp;to one Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p>This is the only way you can enable the Two-step verification. You can only update one Microsoft account/email address to one Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you update our Skype account and Microsoft account, you will use your Microsoft password to sign in, even for Skype.</p>

<p>Thank you! The limitation of the current implementation is that I cannot connect (this is the term used&nbsp; on the web site) two Skype accounts to a single Microsoft account. So, I need two Microsoft accounts for my two Skype accounts (private &amp; official).
 How can I create two Microsoft accounts using just one email address (as I said in my original post)? Can I make an account where the primary alias as not an email to solve the problem?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way for us to create two Microsoft accounts using just one email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing, we need to have a primary email address in your profile, because we use it to contact you with important information about your Skype account.</p>
