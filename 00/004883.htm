<p><span>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f846955b-7478-4014-a558-3d50de20ca08" title="PBCInsurancegroup">
<p>
</p><p>This is a common scenario if your account's caller ID is not activated. You can use this link as reference on how to set up caller identification:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?q=caller+ID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What
 is caller identification and how do I set it up?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However if this is still happening even when your caller ID is activated then this might indicate that Caller ID from Skype is not supported by the local carrier that you are calling.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a workaround, we suggest you to contact the local carrier if they are supporting Caller ID from Skype.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I look forward to your reply. </span></p>

                    I forgot my password to my hotmail account, please help me regain access, I don't want a new account. I logged out to let a friend login and the 1 security question being offered is proving to be a brick wall.<br />
<br />
I have tried 6 times. I do not use my hotmail account to send emails so can't answer that part. Nor have I set up any folders, nor do I have an xbox account??? So the form I fill out is empty.
<br />
<br />
I use the account for ebay, paypal, amazon etc so really need it back<br />

    <title>MS Word 2013 Equation Editor - limits of integrals, the vertical bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scrappydeb  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word 2013 Equation Editor - limits of integrals, the vertical bar is so small&#33;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to figure out how to use equation editor to express a definite integral, with the limits of integration following the vertical bar. In the OLD equation editor, I get this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7dbb055f-644b-4732-bf3a-78727dd9017f" /></p>
<p>That looks as it should. But since I've upgraded to Office 2013 and am using the new equation editor - which I generally like, except when I can't figure out how to get it to do what I want it to do! - I can only get this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/107811f9-aaa8-48f8-9930-9a521939cbcd" /></p>
<p>Why is the vertical bar in the template so short??? That doesn't look right at all! Is there a different template that I'm missing?? I'm using the vertical bar under the "brackets", combined with the "script" template that gives both super/sub. I don't see
 any other way to do this. Incidentally, if I include a fraction, it is better:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dda1e10f-e3ec-4fb9-b570-de0ebf3fdb65" /></p>
<p>but... hel-LO... What about when I DON'T have a fraction?? PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ETA: I realize that the integrand above should have "16x", the x is missing... lol.

            <p>Heh... no... I just meant that I realized that without the x, the math was wrong. That wasn't the problem with the teeny little line for the limits of integration, though. I did find a work-around, where I use a 1x3 matrix for the expression, with the top
 and bottom cell empty. But that makes the vertical bar a bit ridiculously TOO large (vs. ridiculously too small), so also isn't ideal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shouldn't be that hard, the vertical bar with the limits of integration is very standard notation, and it should not be so short, even when there are no fractions in the expression!<br />

<h2>            Starships this size are not plotting a new course every morning.</h2>
                    <p>Now MS really has to plot a new course. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And no&nbsp;matter the size of the ship, it'll have to go 180° "around" and fast (less then one year left).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps where annoying using a mouse (or a finger) scroll bars are disappearing in a middle of a scrolling just because you halted a few seconds to read a little. You have to shake your mouse (or finger) to make the scroll bar reappear. Same thing in IE...
 Same thing when you "shop" a new app in Windows Apps store, same thing every where... Annoying ! I even had to get back to my keyboard arrows&nbsp;more often because of this, in a world where keyboards are disappearing ?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tiles where mixed up with programs including all sorts of irrelevant executables underneath the "Start screen". A mess, resulting in hours of search for nothing. And when you want to get back to where you where in that mess, it brings you right at letter
 "A". Bravo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in W10 I&nbsp;reactivate "start screen", I'm &nbsp;back with W8 : Is it enough improvement to really skip #9 and jump to 10 with the idea that there is "a world" between both ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all that "contextual stuff"&nbsp;(right click in apps) that we have to guess how it's working : Each app is showing a different aspect in the "contextual" universe. Are we supposed to memorise all of them ? Is it still going to be considered "user friendly"
 ? We are 3+ years after W8 release and I'm still battling with these contextual aberrations ! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is that "doll" aspect of Windows since it went "2D" to supposedly accommodate small devices...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My god there is a lot of job ahead and so little time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that this post is intended to be positive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely wish good lock to the Windows 10 Team.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 not rendering embedded visio diagrams after online repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stubbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 not rendering embedded visio diagrams after online repair</h2>
                    <p>I have a major (well to me) issue in that I had to run a repair on my Office 2016 / Visio 2016 installations and since doing so when I embed a visio diagram in a word/powerpoint etc. document it no longer renders correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically the gradient fills for visio objects revert to a block fill instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a complete uninstall and reinstall of visio, but it complained then that it could not install as it could not mix 32 and 64 bit applications, which was odd as they were both 32 bit installs before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So next I uninstalled&nbsp;my full office 2016 suite, including project and visio and then I had to reinstall from scratch (all 32 bit versions) which worked and restored the rendering correctly for embedded visio diagrams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However for some reason the styles in visio were not updating, so I ran the online repair tool again to correct that problem, which it did, but then when I tried again to embed the visio diagram it had reverted back to drawing in block colours again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realised that I had run the online auto repair previously which obviously caused my initial problem, and having reinstalled and re-run the online repair again it has repeated the fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this appears to be a repeatable bug with the code being downloaded and updated by the office repair function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I report this so it gets fixed?</p>

            <p>Well I tried to get away with just installing office and visio again from scratch, and everything looked fine for a few days, then I noticed that my diagrams when I either edited them in a word document or pasted new ones from Visio were going back to block
 colouring and losing their fill characteristics again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like office has performed an auto update and applied the bug anyway...argggg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm faced with constant reinstalls of office, or putting up with this bug until it gets fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is nobody else having this issue? Office 2016, Visio 2016, Windows 10......? It's doing my head in!</p>

            <p>Thanks for laying this out... it was driving me crazy as I needed to embed Visio diagrams into a Word document for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one insane work-around:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Insert-&gt;Object (and choose Visio object)</li><li>Paste your diagram (assuming you copied it from an open Visio file) into the Visio instance that pops up</li><li>Copy the diagram from the instance you just pasted into (I know, this is crazy!)</li><li>Close the Visio instance</li><li>Delete the "block" diagram</li><li>Paste in the last copy from the clipboard</li></ol>
<p>Probably will not help anybody, but maybe it contributes to the debugging of the problem.</p>

            <p>Well, that appears to work...but what the heck is going on with the data that makes that happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried pasting that version back into another visio, then cutting and pasting back into word and the block came back.....it makes no sense at all!</p>

            <p>After continuing to suffer from this "issue", I believe the reason... when you embed the object, the theme information is ignored (or not transferred) and Word simply defaults to the basic theme (which is of block coloring and not the more attractive gradients).</p>

            <p>OK, I have found a slightly modified workaround:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Copy your Visio diagram (the one with the proper theme or color palette)</li><li>Paste it into your document (Word, Powerpoint, etc.)</li><li>Assuming the pasted diagram reverted to the default "blockey" theme... double click the newly pasted diagram</li><li>When the Visio editor opens, it should open with the "correct" theme, if not use the
<em>design </em>tab to chose the proper theme (e.g. Whisp theme with the Linear color variant)</li><li>Copy the diagram from the editor (Cntrl-A, Cntrl-C)</li><li>Close the editor (click back on the document)</li><li>Delete the blockey diagram (which should reappear) and paste in the last copied diagram (from the editor)</li></ol>
<p>For some reason, this works for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I still have Visio 2007 on my machine - if I could only get it to work.&nbsp; I did get it to run, but I embed Visio in other files (Frame Maker specifically), and when I print to PDF, it is now a mess.&nbsp; Because it always uses the latest version of Visio to do
 the rendering.&nbsp; I can't find anyway to force it to use the installed Visio 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My documents are&nbsp;over 1000 pages, with 100s of these figures.&nbsp; I can't afford the time to re-engineer them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They used to all multiple different versions (they even had articles to tell you how to do it).&nbsp; But now, they allow only ONE version, and it is BROKEN!&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any to get it to use a different version?</p>

            <p>Hi Harsh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried booting from a recovery USB, made using the "<strong>Create Recovery Drive</strong>' from my desktop PC, also running build
<strong>10166</strong>. Unfortunately I received a "System Drive cannot be found".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following found here:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyBrjDpsXGc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this too did not work. As I haven't used CMD promt for over 15 years, I'm a bit shakey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that bios only recognizes the USB as a bootable drive with no notification of the main
<strong>C:/</strong></p>
<p>Through CMD prompt I have found the primary drive being assigned to <strong>X:/</strong> which contains:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've managed to get through the video until 4:07 where I receive the following error:</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">mkdir b:\EFI\Microsoft</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">b:\EFI\Microsoft&gt;bcdboot c:\Windows /l en-us /s b: /f ALL</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thinking C:\ may not be assigned, with windows files being stored in the X:\.&nbsp;I then tired the following:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Can someone guide me through the last step of booting from the X:\</p>

            <p>Hi Harsh,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that during an update, some core files were not carried across which caused windows to fail to load. After trying many things I had to ultimately wipe my drive and do a fresh install of windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my desktop which was recently running Build 10240, windows update started downloading a critical security update for x64 systems which froze at 5% downloading, causing a warning sound from my motherboard and now windows is failing to boot up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When booting up windows from a backup USB (recovery usb for 10166) I receive an error asking me to Reset the PC, when pursuing the option to keep my files I receive
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Drive where Windows is installed is Locked. Unlock the drive and try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was happy with the builds up to 10133 but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
I'm not happy</span> with these critical issues bricking my PC and Laptop. Forwarding me to a FAQ page was not what I was after. I'm remaining with windows 8.1 until a stable build with stable update delivery is provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are such problems surfacing so late in the development cycle? I understand the push for a Minimum Viable Product with Agile development but the core operating system should be stable, the fluff can be added over time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Text field character limit for join queries.</h2>
                    I'm trying to join records in two different tables. I use about twenty fields to determine if the records are for the same event. Is there a limit to the combined number of characters that can be in the twenty fields? I find that records with substantially
 more characters than average are not being joined, and it will be difficult to truncate long fields.

            <p>How are you doing the join? What is the structure of the tables, and how can you determine that a given record in one table should be joined to some particular record in the other?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to create a JOIN on any Text fields, up to 255 bytes; you cannot join on Memo fields (which could be over a billion bytes!), but you can find dupliates even for memo fields by joining the two tables and using criteria.</p>

            <p>I am tracking how employees spend their time in the tables. Each table has several fields which identify the employee and the project. I have two tables, one of which shows hours worked in each week from January-June, and the other shows hours from July-December.
 This is due to a limitation in our financial software. I have a union query which combines the unique records from each table and copies only one version if the same employee/project pair exists in both tables. This part works correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tie the union records query to the records in the two tables, to pull in the hours for the full year. However, I've found that if the project name,&nbsp;or the employee's name, or&nbsp;any other field,&nbsp;is very long, the join operation doesn't work, and no hours
 are linked into my second query. The vast majority (+99.9%) of records have hours correctly calculated, but a few do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>

            Can you explain why I shouldn't use text fields in joins? My data is all text, aside from the hours worked. Our project IDs are alphanumeric, so they have to be text.

            <p>A Text field just takes up a lot more room in the index used in the join, and is slower to process. I'm not as averse to using them as Scott is, but I would generally use a "surrogate key" such as an Autonumber (joined to a Long Integer foreign key) in queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You certainly should <strong>not</strong> be joining on employee names though! I once worked with Dr. Lawrence David Wise and his colleague, Dr. Lawrence David Wise. Larry was a tall, blond, affable chemist; L. David was a stocky, dark, taciturn biologist.
 Names make LOUSY keys; a key must be unique, should be stable over time, and ideally should be short - names fail on all three counts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also sounds like you have &lt;shudder&gt; twenty-six fields in your table, one for each week in the half-year. This is "committing spreadsheet" in the first degree! Even if the data comes that way from your accounting software, you should append it into a tall-thin
 table with one RECORD (not one field) per pay period. Am I misinterpreting?</p>

<h3> snowfish---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E52 New firmware update</h2>
                    
<p>All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just updated to the latest firmware version 22.009. I am hoping that this resolves many of the problems I have been seeing in this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Nokia: Why are you describing what you have changing in your firmware updates? Pretty much all other companies does this? You really need to significantly improve your customer support...! I do like the E52 due to the battery life time, but there are
 some many problems with this phone that if someone asked me to recomend this, then I would say. purchase an Iphone instead. That's my next move, if this phone is not behaving after this firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>@Kingsimz: cool, i see thansk! <i>😃</i></p>
<p>hehe&nbsp; i was wondering if i do a software update over hte air?</p>
<p>how long would it take? and also, would it swipe/delete everything off my phone?</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not yet done a software update over the air, so I can not say exactly. I suppose the duration would depend on the size of the file and the speed of your connection. If you are using a WLAN connection, that would expedite things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read that the ove-the-air updates leave your phone data intact; however, people still seem to recommend that one still back up his files.</p>

<p>All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok I have now been on this firmware for 24 hours. Here are somethings you need to know:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make sure you follow the instructuctions and do make a backup of your phone. I mean that!!! (You also need a fully charged phone!)</p>
<p>2.Your phone will be reset and you start all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Laptop 1: It refussed to do the upgrade. It just stopped at 13%, then then it asked me to remove the battery, remove cable, insert battery, attach cable and then reconnect. Still the same problem. I did this on all 4 USB ports, rebooted laptop everytime
 I tries new port - just in case.... Hmmm, Thinking at this stage, something wrong with the laptop, even though any other storage devices, etc is working fine with NO issues.</p>
<p>4: Laptop 2: Same procedure as above, Connect to USB, etc. however this laptop did not have Nokia software tools installed at all. I downloaded latest version from Nokia. It installed fine and it installed the firmware with no worries. I was amazed. upgrade
 went smooth once it downloaded from Nokia website. Ok, so far so good. New firmware for the phone done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this stage you might be wondering, so is it worth it???. Well, it seem my bluetooth is more stable, it does not suddenly disconnect. However it still does it with the Nokia BH-900 headset. Sometimes after 20 minutes and times after 30 minutes. But the
 connection to my laptop via Bluetooth is working with no hassle. I have a feeling it is the headset and not the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ohh and a big + sign is that the phone has not yet been hanging on me yet... that in itself is an achievement :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have to say one thing about this phone and that is I<strong><em><span> really like the battery time</span></em></strong> as I am on the phone pretty much 8 hours day constantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in a nutshell:</p>
<p>1. Improvement in Bluetooth connectivity</p>
<p>2. Phone seems much more stable. does not hang... welll so far&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what you are fiinding :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The firmware I am using is:</p>
<p>Software version: 022.009</p>

<p>A couple of words on FOTA, as you guys are interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main difference between NSU and FOTA is the mechanism how the phone, in your case the E52, is updated. In FOTA the update is applied with a differential package, which results in a far smaller update package that you are downloading compared to NSU,
 where package sizes range from tens of megs up to over hundred megs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another difference is the way how the update is applied to the phone: in NSU it is actually the PC that writes the SW into the phone. In FOTA the phone "rewrites" itself. This highlights the importance of a solid cable connection between PC and the phone
 when using NSU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allthough it is recommended to make a backup prior to a FOTA update, it is in practice not necessary as FOTA is not changing any of the user's data. NSU might, depends on the product in question.

            I upgraded my E52 yesterday using the NSU integrated with Ovi Suite 2, on my Vista laptop. It was smooth all along, no issues/errors whatsoever during the update and all user data in the phone were preserved so I didn't have to restore any backups either.
 Most issues with NSU I beleive is due to USB driver conflicts with other devices and/or interference by antivirus/security software during the update

I make the changes, but nothing happens.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I reduce the resolution to a much
 lower number the font size change to, say, 12 pts works.&nbsp; I then resent the screen resolution back and the change the resolution&nbsp;back and it stays at 12 pts for a while.&nbsp; But when I restart, the change is lost.</p>

            I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation to see if that corrects it for you.

            Thanks Diane. I was hoping to sync the other way around if possible. I would like to continue using my Outlook 2010 but have it sync with Outlook.com so that when I make changes in my contact folder or calender they also show up in outlook.com. Is that
 possible?<br />

            <p>It's two way sync, but you need to use the outlook.com folders in outlook.&nbsp; It doesn't sync your current folder to online, it's like any other email account and only syncs the folders within the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can sync just calendar and contacts if you do not use outlook.com for email. See

I too am having great difficulties syncing Outlook 2010 contacts with Outlook.com.<br />
<br />
If I make changes to a contact entry in Outlook 2010 (say changing an e-mail address) the corresponding change does not appear in Outlook.com. If I add a contact it will ultimately appear in Outlook.com. If I delete a contact, it will ultimately delete in Outlook.com.
 But changes in the contact, itself will not show in Outlook.com<br />
<br />
Also, when I open a contact in Outlook.com the page will show the name, email address and physical address. The telephone numbers and the notes do not show unless I click on edit to see them.<br />
<br />
I have two accounts, one linked to Yahoo (POP) and the other to Outlook.com (IMAP). They are both in the same .pst file.
<br />
<br />
The connection between my Outlook and Outlook.com is with Windows Live Hotmail.<br />
<br />
Any help you can give me will be appreciated.

<h3> joeycheunghoyin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is is possible to highlight all duplicate text in Word 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2013, by using the 'Find and Replace', when I type in a word/ phrase, it will highlight all of the occurrences of that word/ phrase throughout the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know is there any way to highlight all of the duplicate text (without having to type in a specific text to search) in Word 2013 (or within a selected range), say by using a macro (or any built-in function)? Just like the function of 'Find
 Duplicate' in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>To find consecutive duplicate words, you could use a <em>wildcard </em>Find, where Find = (&lt;*&gt;) \1</p>
<p>Similarly, for duplicate word pairs, you could use a <em>wildcard </em>Find, where Find = (&lt;*&gt;) (&lt;*&gt;) \1 \2</p>

                    <p>I have a report based off of a query. Right now, when a users open the report it asks them to type in a&nbsp;date range. The problem is&nbsp;that the users have to know the dates&nbsp;to enter. My question is, instead of asking users to type in the date range&nbsp;when opening
 the report is there a way to have this be a drop down menu&nbsp;so they can just choose the specific date??</p>

            Yes, You are using a parameter prompt query. I rarely use them because they are so limiting.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You can have them open a form instead. On the form you can use a combobox that lists all the valid dates. Then, in the query that is the recordsource for the report, use the syntax:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=Forms!formname!controlname</div>
<div><br />
<div>where formname is the name of the form and controlname the name of the combo.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A value in ANY control on an open form can be referenced that. way.</div>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick answer.&nbsp; I tried to create a combobox that list the dates; however, I have so many dates that are the same and the list includes all these dates over and over (same number as my records).&nbsp; How do I make this list only give me a distinct
 list (e.i. the dates only appear once)?&nbsp; Also, when I click on the list and select a different date it gave me the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Value you entered isn't valid for this field</p>
<p>For example, you may have entered text in a numeric field or a number that is larger than the FieldSize setting permits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>This is what my SQL&nbsp;says but the list still has a list long of same dates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>SELECT DISTINCT Summary_2_Tbl.ID, Summary_2_Tbl.[Reporting Date]<br />
FROM Summary_2_Tbl<br />
ORDER BY Summary_2_Tbl.[Reporting Date];</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have this problem when I click on the list and select a different date:</p>
<p><strong><em>The Value you entered isn't valid for this field</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>For example, you may have entered text in a numeric field or a number that is larger than the FieldSize setting permits.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            No that isn't what your SQL says. Since you are including the ID field you are getting each ID field. I said to ONLY have the Date field.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>What you want is to filter on the date, not on the ID field. That's why you are getting the error message.</div>

<p>I modified my SQL and it worked.&nbsp; However, when I open the form the drop-down list is not visible.&nbsp; When I scrolled down the list and just pick at some invisible space, my report returns that date.&nbsp; I checked the property of this field and can't seem to

            The ColumnWidths property of the combo box is probably still set for the two columns you had originally, with the first dimension being zero to hide the first column.&nbsp; As you now only have the one column its width is now zero, so you don't see anything.&nbsp;
 You can simply delete the entry for the ColumnWidths property completely.&nbsp; It only needs a value when you have more than one column in the RowSource.

<p>Looks to me like case is obeyed. However, If I examine the Sent message, I see:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The case has changed. This is not the correct behavior. The RFC for mail addresses says that the username portion (what precedes the @) is system-dependent and can be case-sensitive. Outlook.com should NOT be changing the case of the outgoing address. I'll
 try to bring this up with the Outlook.com team.</p>

<p>Installing 64-bit IE9 Beta will install both 64-bit and 32-bit Internet Explorer.<br />

The 32-bit version *should* be opening by default unless you deliberately open the 64-bit version from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Internet Explorer 64-bit.</p>

If the ghosting problem persisted with add-ons disabled I would try these steps:</p>
<p>1. Reset IE settings.<br />
With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as<br />
passwords and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings button (Internet Options&gt; Advanced.)<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>2. Uninstall/reinstall IE9 Beta. Antivirus programs, antispyware programs, security suites,&nbsp; etc. should be disabled during the installation.</p>
<p>3. See if a third-party program is causing the ghosting problem.<br />

                    <p>Previously, when switching to ProWS from the Store as Microsoft recommends, not all Workstation features were enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: REFS was enabled, but support for 4 physical CPU sockets and 6TB of RAM wasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can report that build 17063 has fixed this issue and switching from the store gives the user a full upgrade to ProWS.</p>
