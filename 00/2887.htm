<h2>            950XL, Deleted messages appears back again</h2>
                    <p>I Have a lumia 950xl with anniversary update installed. This issue is not &nbsp;because of anniversary update i have it for long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever i delete a message (in messaging and skype app) it appears back again after some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my message counts more than 300 in which 99% of them are no more needed for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a confirmation when i delete it and it disappears from the list. After some time it appears back.(when it appears back all the sender's names are changed to lower case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do i have to disable / enable something to stop this? Anywhere i have to navigate through to identify some hidden settings for this?</p>
<p>

            I think you are asking if you can install the Public build of Windows 10 64 bit, without some details my guess is yes, now for activation did you have the 64 version installed before and was it activated?, now for files you would be best to back them up
 to a thumb drive or&nbsp; some other storage device, you will probably have to do a clean install, as Preview is newer build.

</blockquote>
<p>Not probably but definitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only because of Preview build but also and mainly because of architecture change from 32-bit to 64-bit. Architecture change requires clean-install in every instances.</p>

            <p>You may have to use another computer to download the (3) bleepingcomputer (below) tools, and copy them to a USB memory stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider a clean install/reset, if the recommendations, below, do not resolve your issues. &nbsp;If you have a desired 3rd party(non-Microsoft) product, please refer to their support to resolve compatibility issues in win8/10, or other versions of Microsoft Windows.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider reviewing the following, and running the bleepingcomputer tools, and malwarebytes:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>For the protection of what is important (if win8/10):</p>
<p>Make sure your FileHistory backup is up-to-date (right click start, control panel, FileHistory-Turn it On). (it requires a usb external harddrive (Windows 8/10 will, automatically, create the FileHistory folder on the usb drive, when FileHistory is turned
 On); &nbsp;or network harddrive can be used (make a 'FileHistory' folder on the Network Harddrive to connect the app to).... If you keep things in non-standard places, make new Libraries, and add the folders to your custom Libraries. Check to see where quicken
 , printer scan-to folders, or any other user installed software is saving data. &nbsp;(You can backup quicken/intuit programs to a OneDrive folder, but&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;let database files reside in OneDrive; &nbsp;although, they can be included in Libraries (and probably
 already are), they will not backup when open. &nbsp;(some (other) databases can not be restored easily from raw data alone).</p>
<p>see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/libraries-faq#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/libraries-faq#1TC=windows-8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you suspect malicious activity or malware (in any version of windows) use these tools from bleepingcomputer (they are relatively quick): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/</a>&nbsp;(the
 other two (2) suggested tools are on the bottom of that page), like rkill (1), jrt [junkware removal tool] (2), and adwcleaner (3) (run all of them, in that sequence)(i put them on the desktop, and run them from there)(as administrator (right click))(if they
 get hung (10 min) for any reason, close the running tool, go to the next tool, after trying them all, if any are unsuccessful, re-run them again (in sequence) in safe mode; &nbsp;also run Malwarebytes, while in safe mode during this process (if its definitions
 are updated), before adwcleaner. &nbsp;Uninstall adwcleaner, after running it and the system has rebooted, by opening the program, and choosing the uninstall button, or its quarantined files may set off your antivirus. The other tools from bleepingcomputer can
 be safely deleted, after running them; they are updated often, so the old versions are not necessary. After running the tools, if they found anything,&nbsp;<em>you need to reset all your browsers to default</em>, then check for any unfamiliar plugin/addins within
 the browser. then run malwarebytes &nbsp;again.</p>
<p>in a lot of instances, &nbsp;you have to remove the malicious activity one layer at a time, so you may not want to delete the tools after the first run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Malwarebytes (Free):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/</a><br />
</p>
<p>uncheck the box at the end of the install for trial, or convert to free at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebyes is a good addition to your antivirus software.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure in Malwarebytes the 'Scan for rootkits' box is checked-&gt; Settings-Detection and Protection</strong>. &nbsp;Free means manual, so, you have to open it, and run it occasionally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>geek uninstaller can help to uninstall programs that are unusual, it works on 32-bit and x64 programs (and it stays free)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download</a></p>
<p>only get the free version.</p>
<p>right click on the program in geek, will let you force uninstall, without running the apps native uninstaller (only use the force method, if the installed program is malicious, or will not uninstall normally).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try HerdProtect (free), &nbsp;<a href="http://www.herdprotect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.herdprotect.com/</a>&nbsp; ,be watchful of false positives, only remove unchecked items at the end (by putting a check in the box), if they reside in a
 temp type folder or you are sure about them, remember to run it again in a few hrs(per mfg instructions). &nbsp;I, generally, recommend uninstalling HerdProtect, &nbsp;after a few weeks, as it's cache gets large fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Pre-installed or user previously installed antivirus may inhibit the current antivirus (even a current norton installation), use the mfg removal tools to completely remove them, if they were ever on your system.***<br />
</p>
<p>Use the mfg removal tools to completely remove them, after running the uninstall in Programs and features see:</p>

            <p>Hi Rachel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, I need more details:</p>
<p>Does this issue occur with a specific workbook or any workbook in Excel?</p>
<p>Are you able to type in Word, PowerPoint and other Office applications, does the text appear instantly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may open Excel in its application safe following these steps and check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p>Click <font>
Programs,</span> go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">excel /safe </span>(note there is a space between<span style="font-weight: bold"> excel
</span>and<span style="font-weight: bold"> /</span></font>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add-ins.</span>
</li><li><span>Clear all the options.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Let us know the details and results for further assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with Excel 365.</p>
<p>When opening excel with a new blank worksheet, the first cell I type data into the characters appear instantly, any cell after that first entry takes 5 - 10 seconds for the characters to appear. Once they appear any typing in that same cell is instant. Hitting
 enter then completes the data entry immediately (only once the characters appear - otherwise the same delay occurs).</p>
<ul>
<li>OS is Windows 7 - up to date.</li><li>When excel opened in safe mode - works normally</li><li>No add-ins enabled</li><li>Printer default set to Microsoft XPS writer</li><li>Other office 365 programs work normally (word / outlook)</li><li>Tried quick repair and on-line repair - no change.</li></ul>
<p>Any help appreciated!</p>

I had this key on 16232, but I am on 16237 now. It is a whole lot better than the 16232. All I had was nothing but problems with 16232. It would give the "GSOD" Green Screen&nbsp; Of Death about every hour or more and it would not let me install WebRoot SecureAnyWhere
 until I started it in safe mode with networking and then it would work long enough in that mode for me to install it and run a scan and soon as I rebooted it would give the "GSOD" over and over. Thankfully I know something about computers and worked around
 this problem and got my computer back up w/o having to install a prior version than the 16232.

    <title>Duplicate emails in the Gmail sent folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antsalc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate emails in the Gmail sent folder</h2>
                    
<p>All my sent emails in my Gmail sent folder are duplicated. I am using Outlook 2010 on Windows 7 x64 and Gmail IMAP only accounts.</p>
<p>I have been using Outlook 2010 for a month and this did not happen before. I have not changed any settings in Outlook or in Gmail.</p>
<p>I have now selected "Do not save copies of sent items" in Outlook and all seems to work fine.</p>
<p>I have these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Why did this not happen before and it appeared now.</p>
<p>2. Why is copying messages to the server the default option? I would think that this option only makes sense for POP3 accounts.</p>
<p>3. Isn't a duplicate message in Outlook and not in Gmail a bug, anyway?</p>
<p>4. How do I get rid, programmatically,&nbsp;of all duplicated emails in my Outlook?</p>

<p>If you are sending via the SMTP server of Gmail, then Gmail also creates a copy in your Sent Items in addition to Outlook's copy.</p>
<p>To counter this see; <a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Duplicate Sent Items when using Gmail</a></p>
<p>To cleanup duplicate, you can use a duplicates remover tool;<br />

<p>Hi Roady,</p>
<p>I had already seen that information before I posted and knew of a duplicates remover tool, but yours looks better. Thank you.</p>
<p>Do you know the answers to my other questions above?</p>
<p>Importantly, since Outlook knows that I am using an IMAP account and am sending via the SMTP server of Gmail, surely Outlook should be able to avoid the duplication of the messages without us having to tell it "Do not save copies of sent items".</p>
<p>Or what am I missing? In which case is this behaviour of any benefit?</p>
<p>Note that the duplicates are in the Outlook folder. The Gmail folder is fine. So, it looks that it is Outlook who is duplicating them, unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Using the smtp server of my ISP is not an option for me. I travel a lot and do not often know the servers the ISPs use.</p>

<p>It's actually Gmail's SMTP server that is showing abnormal behavior here though. While the feature of storing a copy in my on-line mailbox when sending via their SMTP server is great (especially with POP3 as you pointed out), it certainly is not normal for
 SMTP server to do that. The Gmail web interface is designed to hide these type of duplicates even when they are actually still in your mailbox which is why Outlook shows them.</p>
<p>You may be able to use the SMTP server of your provider on the road as well if they support authentication. To configure see;<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msoutlook.info/question/36</a></p>

Outlook is saving replies with the original message in a folder other than the Inbox.&nbsp; But, a duplicate also appears the Sent Mail folder for Gmail IMAP.&nbsp; How do I stop the duplicate messages?<br />

<h2>            Outlook - Shared inbox - Measuring Service Level</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Customer Service Supervisor. My customer service reps complete tasks out of a shared mailbox and use various categories that describe the type of task and also have their name to show who is working on them.&nbsp;Every morning, we drag the completed emails
 over to a subfolder. &nbsp;Is there a way to measure the service level, in hours,&nbsp;of the tasks coming in? Possibly something that looks at the time that it is&nbsp;flagged or marked complete vs the current time? For example, let's say it is 1:00pm and there are 70 emails
 in the inbox, 40 of them are&nbsp;not flagged or marked complete&nbsp;(no one has start working on), and the oldest email not flagged or marked complete is from 9:00am that morning. The service level of that shared box would be 4 hours. Is there a tool that can monitor
 and record that service level and possible display it live?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Craig</p>

<p>Hello Craig</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting. As far as I know, you can add additional columns when checking followed up emails:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook, I didn‚Äôt find a related column show the time tasks or emails are flagged. About time when marked complete, in Outlook desktop client, navigate to in Mail view, select View tab-&gt;select
 current view settings to Preview; </p>

Thanks Stefan, yes I did, and I can see the XE fields. It's really very odd. Any further thoughts?

            which index field do you mean please? If I place the cursor where I want the index to go, and press Insert Index, nothing happens. So as far as I can see there is no index field.

<div>Anyway I did try pressing F9 in various combinations but nothing worked I'm afraid.&nbsp;</div>

            If you press Alt+F9 you should see {&nbsp;INDEX } at the location where you inserted the index. (Other field codes will also display; press Alt+F9 again to hide them.)<br />
<br />
Note that you can't attach screenshots here. Instead, you will have to upload your screenshot to SkyDrive (for example) and post a link here. It will be more useful if you upload an example document in Word format, though.

            well this is the thing - there is no { INDEX } ! There's just nothing! Even with codes displayed.&nbsp;
<div>The document is a 90k word prepublication book so not easy to share. I'll see what I can do but I can definitely see the individual index entries in the text, just nothing happens when I try to generate an index.</div>

            It's very easy to get the data from Access into Excel so that you can use my MergeTools add-in.

 in the case of Office 2007) or that you have a retail version that has never been activated (also unlikely unless you use&nbsp; it very infrequently). See

<p>
</p><p>Hello readers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have this exact problem! &nbsp;I've done the online update repair, tried removing my PERSONAL.xlsb, and have no add-on's installed. That being said, I'll answer the question proposed above:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is the issue only related to Excel? If you drag other Office applications or non-Microsoft applications, do they have the same issue?
<strong>&nbsp;Only Excel.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is the issue related to all worksheets or some specific one? <strong>Any Excel instance.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When does the issue occur, after a few hours using or just when you start computer and Excel?
<strong>Any time I open Excel and its default to full screen, then try to move drag it.</strong></p>
<p>4. Capture some related screenshots of this issue. <strong>It creates another Excel instance or something, but they are related... if I close the gray sheet it closes the main sheet.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>5. Open Excel&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of all info under Product Information. Click Start button&gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;About&gt;</p>

<p>Hi HonestFellow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the following methods, see if this works: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Excel, on the <strong>File</strong> tab, click <strong>Options.</strong></li><li>In the <strong>Options</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>General</strong>, clear the <strong>Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)</strong> check box.</li><li>Under <strong>Display</strong>, select the <strong>Disable hardware graphics acceleration</strong> check box.</li><li>Click Ok.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the <strong>problem persists, run Excel in safe mode:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the Start button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click Run.</li><li>In the Run box, Type <strong>excel /safe</strong>, and click <strong>OK</strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note</span></em></strong><em><span>: There is a space between
<strong>Excel</strong> and<strong> /</strong>.</span></em></p>

<p>Hello Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response... when my post was split from the original thread I didn't receive any notifications it was, or when you responded to the post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the steps you suggested with no change. &nbsp;I also tried excel in safe mode, and it still does it. (screen shot 1 below). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a way to make the gray screen attach itself back to the original screen; Once I have the screen looking like the screen shot below, I can grab the gray screen and un-snap it from a full screen view. &nbsp;Then take the main sheet and cover it up, and
 it snaps back onto the main sheet and is gone... however, windows still says I have two instance open in the task bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(screen shot 2 below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait to hear back from someone and watch this post more closely!</p>

</p><p><span>To further troubleshoot this, try resetting the file association, see if this makes any difference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open<strong> Control Panel</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click&nbsp;<strong>Default Programs</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Set your default programs</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click&nbsp;<strong>Excel</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Choose default for this program</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the&nbsp;<strong>Set Program Associations</strong>&nbsp;screen, click&nbsp;<strong>Select All</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>.</span></li></ol>

</p><p>If this didn‚Äôt help, I‚Äôll suggest you <strong>Online</strong> <strong>Repair</strong> your Office applications. To do this, follow the steps from the article below:

<p>
</p><p>You can also try creating a local user account, this can helps determine whether the issue is Excel installation:

<p>I've done the full removal and replacement of all office products, I'm fully updated for software and I STILL have this problem. &nbsp;I've just gotten used to not using my sheet maximized. &nbsp;The only thing I can think of is there is a lingering connection to
 an office product on my roaming profile or in the registry that is causing this problem. &nbsp;I do no know how to make sure I remove absolutely ever spec of office info from my computer, but I think that would work. &nbsp;I have other people in my office who have the
 exact same laptop model, and have Win 10 and office 365 upgrades and do not have this issue at all.</p>

<p>I've done the full removal and replacement of all office products, I'm fully updated for software and I STILL have this problem. &nbsp;I've just gotten used to not using my sheet maximized. &nbsp;The only thing I can think of is there is a lingering connection to
 an office product on my roaming profile or in the registry that is causing this problem. &nbsp;I do no know how to make sure I remove absolutely ever spec of office info from my computer, but I think that would work. &nbsp;I have other people in my office who have the

    <title>Microsoft outlook calendar entry deleted from calendar when accepted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew gaule  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft outlook calendar entry deleted from calendar when accepted</h2>
                    <p>I am creating calendar entries on a MacBook calendar which then creates in my Outlook365 Exchange calendar an entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When someone accepts the meeting it disappears from the calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the accepted attachment in the accepting email then the entry is created again, well most of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is not the way it should be and it is a pain as calendar entries are disappearing in my calendar and I will be missing meetings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is an Outlook problem as it does not happen with other calendars and is happening on the online mailbox and calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the event would disappear from Outlook for Mac calendar if someone accept the meeting invitation. And you need to click accept again to let the event display again. The issue only occurs in Outlook for Mac client and it works well on website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, please make it sure Outlook is update to date. The latest version is 16.14.1.180613. Go to Help&gt; check for updates, check if Outlook is in the update list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then right click on the calendar folder &gt; choose "Properties..." &gt; click empty cache under general tag, then re-start Outlook to verify the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists,&nbsp;</span><span>it is recommended that you contact Outlook for mac experts by clicking on</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517"><span>Contact

<p>Hi &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for trying to solve this but not quite the issue or the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Apple Calendar and I have multiple Accounts being connected to this eg gmail, exchange calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I describe when someone accepts it disappears from the Outlook Calendar 365 and the Apple Calendar picks this change up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is my understanding right I do not update Outlook365 as it is on the cloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the clarify. May I confirm the issue again: the events would disappear from your Mac calendar after some one accept the invitation. However, the event still displays in the calendar of Office 365 Outlook Web App. And the event is created from
 Mac calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, please ceating a meeting invitation from website and check if the issue persists. If not, this should be a Mac calendar isssue specifically. You may contact the Apple suppor to move further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

<p>That is the whole point that goes to my account yet it is also saying it has an authorized redirect before going to my account. Screen shot does not even get a quarter of what is showing in address bar. this is what shows up prior to me even putting in my

<p>So you are saying that if you went to Outlook.com straight and log in there's no "redirect"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm at a loss at what your issue is. If that link you posted is doing a "redirect" then don't use the link and go straight to Outlook.com instead.</p>

<h2>            Yammer in CRM - Having to post to group vs just an individual</h2>
                    
<p>when i try to direct message a colleague through Yammer in an account record in CRM, i am forced to include my entire sales group before it will allow me to post the message. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this an issue with the Yammer set up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas how to resolve this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>Thank you for trying that out! The feature that you want is like a private message from Yammer embed in CRM to a user. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you.</p>
<p>Yammer embed at the moment does not support private messaging because the priority of Yammer embed is to promote team collaboration. If you would like to message a user privately, please go to ‚ÄúOnline now‚Äù and send a message to the customer. When you post
 a message in Yammer embed in CRM, this is by design that the app will ask you to enter a group first then specific people to notify. After this, the message will be posted in Yammer. It will not privately be sent to the user.

<h2>            Object icon and captions are not retained after saving - BUG</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Office 2010 under 64bit W7 and have following problem.</p>
<p>Open an Excel document, go to Insert -&gt; Object -&gt; Create from file</p>
<p>Choose some file you want to attach. Check the option "Display as icon", then klick the "Change icon" button. In the Caption field type some caption and click OK. Then click again OK, to confirm. File is now attached and displayed as selected icon with given
 caption. Now save modified Excel sheet.</p>
<p>File icon and caption are gone. Caption is now taken from file name, icon probably from current system icon assignment for given filetype.</p>
<p>This is clearly a bug. Is there already a fix for this or at least some workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for help,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We tried to reproduce the issue with both Excel 2010/2013 and were not able to reproduce the issue with multiple file types.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I need more details to assist you with the issue:</span></p>

</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue occurs with multiple file types, then you may try the steps below and check the result.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Deepa,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply. I will try to be as specific as possible.</p>
<p>I am using 64bit Office 2010 Professional Plus with all currently available updates. I see the exact version is 14.0.7116.5000. My OS is Win 7 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted the computer and started clean instance of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) This issue is not related to some particular filetype. It does with all filetypes.</p>
<p>2) Yes the computer is connected to a network, but is not in a domain.</p>
<p>3) My OS account is administrator-type account, moreover I have disabled the User Account Control, so I always run every application "as Administrator". However I also tried to explicitely run Excel as administrator with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see exact steps how to reproduce this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Start clean instance of Excel</p>
<p>2) Prepare few files with different extensions (I used .jpg, .dll, .exe, .pdf)</p>
<p>3) In Excel click on (1) <strong>Insert</strong>, (2) <strong>Object</strong>, (3) new window will pop up, there click on "<strong>Create from File</strong>" tab, (4) click on
<strong>Browse</strong> and find some file you want to insert, (5) click on "<strong>Display as icon</strong>" check box, (6) click on "<strong>Change icon</strong>" button, (7) Insert some caption and possibly change the icon if you like (I kept the first
 one).</p>
<p>After these steps you should get similar state as displayed on the screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bef3d80e-3657-47f1-ae5d-777cabf3212c" /></p>
<p>4) Click OK in "Change Icon" window and click OK in "Object" window.</p>
<p>5) You should get result as displayed on following screenshot</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf3bf08f-a25c-488f-9934-1f90f29b01ee" /></p>
<p>6) Now save this excel sheet (e.g. by pressing CTRL + S) and you will get following:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38ba6e85-0526-4098-a124-1e9c88128536" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the icon has changed to icon currently used for .jpg files in the OS. Caption I typed before is gone and is replaced by filename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize this, after saving of Excel sheet, the icon of <strong>recently </strong>
embeded object is always changed to the icon <strong>currently</strong> used in the OS for given filetype. Caption is changed to the filename. Words "currently" and "recently" are bolded for purpose. If you would now change your default application for opening
 .jpg files to some other application (I tried IrfanView) system icon for .jpg files will be also changed. Now with the same Excel sheet repeat points 1) - 6) e.g. even with the same file and you will get following result:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30f265b0-76c8-4426-ab2f-34092d08d237" /></p>
<p>You see? Icon of newly inserted object has chaned, icon of old object was retained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            <p>Hi TasosK,</p>
<p>Which version of Excel are you using?.This is interesting workaround, but doesn't work for me.After saving of file, it is reverted to the filename and another icon.</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly you have replaced the filepath with the caption :) This is interesting and reveals more bugs on Microsoft side... Try to replace the filepath of another valid filepath...</p>

<div>The main purpose of resource leveling is to alleviate overallocation, that is, shift tasks and resources such that all or selected resources are not assigned to work more hours than are contained in a normal workday. For example, let's say you assigned
 resource A to work rooms 1 &amp; 2 on Monday. That would mean resource A is overallocated by 8 hours. Depending on the priority assigned (task level), resource leveling will shift the lower priority task to remove the overallocation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is no automated way to set up the schedule you want. It's pretty straightforward to do but you'll have to do it manually. Set up your rooms as tasks and assign all four resources to each room. Then go to the Resource Usage view and set each resource's
 hours to zero for those days and rooms they will not be working. A bit tedious but I can't come up with a quicker way to do it.</div>

<div>I have 2 hotmail account that I have set up on my iPhone and iPad; however, I mostly use these devices to check my email rather than logging into my account using my computer. When I log into outlook.com, I notice that I all the emails that I have READ

 repeat the same steps. Thanks</div>

<p>Please be informed that Outlook.com page's font size or zoom settings can be altered using the instructions provided by the Community Moderator. The feature to independently change the font settings of the mail page, as&nbsp;I said, is not available at this time.
 If you like, you can go to our <a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback</a> page and post it as a suggestion. Your feature request will be reviewed by our product group if it can be considered for future considerations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have clarifications, feel free to post back anytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            This is unacceptable.&nbsp; I have to enlarge text to read emails, shrink text to view inbox, repeat the process over and over.......and strain my eyes badly in the process.<br />
<br />
I've already switched to Gmail.<br />
<br />
How stupid can the people changing Hotmail be ?&nbsp;&nbsp; If we'd wanted something either more complicated or that didn't work........we would have switched from Hotmail on our own.

            Two issues for me My email font in outlook has become so small I can hardly read emails even wearing glasses. And I can not change it.Even when I do choose a larger font size it defaults to the previous tiny size and there is no way to save the change
 I want.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other huge annoyance is not being able to forward emails. I have yet to find a method. I have had to copy paste emails in order to forward them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it time to switch to a Mac? Windows is just so difficult and awkward Why put up with it. My whole family have switched. I am the lone holdout&nbsp; I just see Microsoft going down the drain. They do not seem able to make their OS user friendly<br />

            <p>I have no idea how to fix this problem and it would seem neither does Microsoft as when you follow this thread no one appears to address the problem.</p>
<p>As I see it the problem is the text size particularly of the heading of the emails are to large. It is not possible to alter the size of the text or headings Consequently the onbly way to see the total message is by zooming which is a pita(pain in the axx)
 Nor is it possible to change the box size to accomodate the text size. Therefore frustration is a constant when using this program. Add advertisements and you should purchase another program and get a mac next time you buy a computer.</p>
