<h2>            Windows 10 update causes a problem with Paperport 14, a program that worked perfectly before the last update.</h2>
                    The latest Windows 10 update rendered Paperport 14 unusable. &nbsp;Paperport can no longer find the Epson Perfection V500 Photo scanner profile. &nbsp;I can operate the scanner through the Control Panel screen so I know it's functional but I want to continue to
 use Paperport 14 which worked perfectly up until the Windows update. &nbsp;

    <title>High CPU, Memory &#38; Disk Usage - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High CPU, Memory &#38; Disk Usage</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft! I am new to post here so please don't kill me if I am doing wrong things here. I am in dire need of some tech support. I am becoming upset of what is happening with my laptop now. It responds so slow and often displays "not responding".
 My works were already affected since I cannot use my laptop at it's best. I had noticed that the CPU, memory and disk consumption were too high, even when no app is running. I tried almost every available remedies online but nothing worked. There are too much
 important files stored here and installed programs that I am using in the office, that I can't have it for reformat. By the way, my laptop is Dell Inspiron 15 Core i3, 4GB RAM, Windows 10 which I purchased 1 year ago. Any solution I can do? Thank you in advance!

            Hi Neld
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />We have been noticing this trend with high CPU after a fresh install or upgrade. Normally, Windows Defender is the culprit, in addition, Windows 10 Update applying updates and Defender definitions. Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint what is the exact source of the high CPU usage.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, just giving it a few days to a week, it will eventually settle down - this has worked in most cases. So, please consider that first. 
<br />
<br />I would first check Windows Update and make sure any pending cumulative updates are actually being installed succesfully. 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />Other things you can also check include:
<br />
<br />If you have Chrome installed, uninstall then reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />Disable your audio adapter in the BIOS to see if it helps or check for an updated driver or reinstall the existing one. 
<br />
<br />Look for blank icons on the desktop and delete them.
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Open This PC
<br />Right click your local drive where Windows 10 is install (you will see the Windows logo on it)
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Hardware tab
<br />What is the name of the drive listed?
<br />
<br />Is it an SSD?
<br />If it is, you might need to update the firmware.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Disable all Background apps.
<br />
<br />Disabling Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to Disabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Also, check whats starting up with Windows.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Startup tab
<br />Disable all except Windows Defender.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, 
<br />hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: problem reports
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Delete any failed or pending reports.
<br />
<br />Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications and actions &gt; Turn off "Show me tips about Windows."
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type: powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Exit 
<br />
<br />Create an entirely new account and delete the current one.

<br />——————————————————————
<br />
<br />Disable Telemetry
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Feedback and diagnostics. 
<br />Set it to basic 
<br />
<br />Click Start 
<br />Type: regedit 
<br />Right click regedit 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following key: 
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection. 
<br />
<br />Right click and create a DWORD value named AllowTelemetry then set to 0
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type gpedit.msc then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Expand Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components
<br />
<br />In the Windows Components dialog, find and right-click on Data Collection and Preview Builds
<br />Then double-click Allow Telemetry in the right pane
<br />Choose Disabled and choose 3-Full from the drop-down menu.
<br />Then click OK to save settings

<p>I won't kill you, but first, please note <span><span><span>that t</span>his isn't Microsoft you're addressing here; t</span><span>his is a peer support forum. We are all just users
 of this version of Windows here, helping each other if and when we can. We are not Microsoft employees (not even those of us with "Microsoft MVP" behind our names; that's an honorary title for having provided consistently helpful advice) except for an occasional
 Microsoft contractor or employee.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You say "</span></span><span><span>CPU, memory and disk consumption were too high." Exactly what
 do you mean by "too high"? Please put numbers on each of those, even if approximate.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In particular, how big is your disk drive and much has usage of it grown recently? Unusually high&nbsp; disk usage suggests the possibility of your having a malware infection.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You say "</span></span><span><span>I tried almost every available remedies online but nothing worked." Please be explicit there too. Exactly what did you try? I
 caution you to be very wary </span></span>about what you read online. There is a great deal of misinformation there, and some of what you tried might have made the situation worse, rather than better. In particular avoid any program, whether free or for sale,
 that purports to speed up your computer. They are almost all very dangerous.<br />

<p>Your computer may only be a year old but if you use it in an office depending on the programs you are using it sounds like you need one that has a faster CPU and more RAM. You didn't say what size storage drive you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop that is several years old. It is a Dell Inspiron 5558 with an Intel Core i7 - 5500U, 2.40 GHz processor, 16 GB of RAM and has a One TB hard drive. It does everything I want it to do without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running Windows 10 with the latest updates along with your programs I am sure more RAM would help some.</p>

<p>Hi Ken Blake. The memory usage of my device is at 70-80% and the disk is 80-90%, that is even no app running. I have 416 GB in my drive C, 138 GB is free; and 502 GB in my drive D, 55 GB is free.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what happened. I just noticed the problem two months ago, that my laptop is responding so slow and keeps on freezing and making me sick every time I use it. I am really struggling in finding solutions to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed several methods I found online such as disabling Sysmain, Windows Update and Windows Search in the "services" and had performed changing values under "regedit". (I really just followed those instructions online).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>

            Thank you very much Andre. I tried some of your methods and somehow reduced my device's memory consumption from 80% to 60% when idle. But my disk rises to 100% every time I open Office applications, play a video or a music, but subsides to 10% after a
 few minutes. Also, memory reaches 100% when I uses the internet opening only 3-4 tabs of Mozilla. Any suggestion to fix this?

<p>Hi HoraceWiggins. I have 1TB storage and have MS Office and some Financial Programs installed on my device. Actually, everything in my laptop were fine before. It is just last last month that I noticed the problem. Responding so slow and keeps on freezing
 that I wanted to throw it away. I really don't know what went wrong. I am so careful with this laptop because all of my works are in here. I also have an updated Eset antivirus so it is a very big issue for me experiencing this.</p>

<h2>            Unable to unlock certain achievements in Lego Jurassic world </h2>
                    
<p>I bought Lego Jurassic world today. I finished the first mission and no achievement for completing it (had several other achievements though) then I finished 4 more missions and still nothing. Other achievements are unlocking but not this. On the achievement
 tracker it says that the are achievements are '100%' but it doesn't say done unlocking like it usually does. Anybody know what to do or if anyone can fix it?</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>However the only option is to perform a custom installation without formatting the partition. However you will have to re-install all the application

<h2>            GTA V ON DEMAND</h2>
                    
<p>So the release is at midnight but on the xbox 360 dashboard it says that the launch is 10 hours from now. &nbsp;Its about 7 o clock EST here so that would make the launch at 5 amEST which is about the time that the marketplace updates EST. So does this mean that
 it could possibly be available at 5am????? &nbsp;Is something just screwy????</p>

<p>Na not at all....thats actually what I am wondering since I can only play digital download games. &nbsp;Im just simply saying that my xbox 360 is set to my time and the launch timer on the dashboard says GTA V launches in 10 hours.... Thats 5 am my time which
 is EST. &nbsp;Thats 5 hours after the ACTUAL launch which is midnight. &nbsp;So I am HOPING AND PRAYING that it does become available at 5am but for some reason I feel like I shouldn't get my hopes up.</p>

<p>I also noticed the countdown clock which ends at 3am (my time) tomorrow morning. I also agree that games for digital release normally happen around the time of 3am (my time) which is around the same time as mentioned regarding 5am EST. I also read an article
 today with a Rockstar rep that stated they wanted the customers to have the option for digital release as soon as possible, so it almost confirms it. I don't see a reason for 3am unless it was coming to Games on Demand, I feel like I am a little child waiting
 for Christmas..lol</p>

<p>First, are you sure it is really a .txt&nbsp; file?&nbsp; Try reading some other .txt files and see if the same thing happens - I'd like to know if this happens with All .txt files or just this one (or maybe only a couple).</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the
 box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the
 updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that doesn't work, try opening the file using Wordpad instead and see if you can read it or if you have the same problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Please keep&nbsp; me informed.&nbsp; If Wordpad works, the simplest solution may be to change the file association of .txt files to Wordpad so you can
 read the files (even though it would mean you no longer had Notepad for reading .txt&nbsp; files - but we'll cross that bridge if we come to it</span></span></span><span><span><span>).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Media tool creator</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, I am trying to create a usb file to install a new copy (brand new licence no) of Windows 10 on a new PC.&nbsp; Whenever I run the Win 10 media creation tool, it opens, thinks about it for about 15 seconds and then throws the error "There was a problem
 running this tool......... Error code 0x80072F76 - 0x20017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried it on 2 different computers, I have tried disabling and then completely uninstalling my antivirus software. I have tried moving the file on my PC, and various other fixes (stopping and starting Windows update services, restarting the PC, making
 sure the permissions to run file were ok, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me, the Microsoft chat help and online help has been useless.&nbsp; I have a new PC I am itching to play, but at the momentI can't even install Windows.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.">How

<p>Thanks for the reply Andre - unblocking the file didn't help unfortunately.&nbsp; I am probably going to have to go with the ISO and create bootable USB solution.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>

 would be my guess.</p>

            <p>I had issues as well. I noticed on several programs that there were problems:</p>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong>: after the update i kept getting Adobe Shockwave issues. I updated the plug in, but that did not correct the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Desktop Connection Manager</strong>: I could not connect to a server on our farm. So I tried...</p>
<p><strong>Remote Desktop Connection</strong>: this would not connect either. </p>
<p><strong>Candy Crush</strong> (Jelly, Soda and Saga):... Yeah, I play these. When I tried to load these games, the screens would go to black and never come back.
</p>
<p><strong>Windows Hello</strong>: It was having a hard time seeing me and would flip to asking for a PIN. I hardly have this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I have uninstalled the update, everything went back to normal. Because I am in a network environment, we are going to block this update on WUSIS and I hope my system doesn't get it from some other source.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I am using the Surface Book. </p>

            <p>Further update.&nbsp; So patch KB3176495 seems to have been pushed out.&nbsp; That resolves none of the issues I have/had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, too, have a Surface.&nbsp; The main issue I have noticed there is that my file synch with Cloud seems to have been broken.&nbsp; My laptop is my main work place and I put my documents in Cloud; my Surface was synched so that whenever I put my docs in the cloud,
 it would download specific folders to the Surface so I would work there (if I found myself offline).&nbsp; I have not seen what else was damaged by the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The music player is an older version of Rhapsody that worked just fine until update KB3176929.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, start up on both devices is significantly slower; Cloud synch was broken; music player was broken (it starts but cannot find the files, which have not moved); Edge is painfully slow and sites that I have to log into get "Not Responsive" when
 moving from page-to-page more and more).</p>

            <p>I just wanted to follow up as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pulled a few more updates and they did not correct the issue. I am finding that my issues are related to startup. If I have a bad boot, then I will need to reboot a few times before all of my programs work correctly. Today it was a 15 min endeavor.&nbsp;
 There are times where I use the "ON" button and holding down the Vol up to get it to fully reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if the quick startup/hyper start (or what ever Microsoft is calling it) is the problem. I will look at seeing it this can be turned off and see what happens from that point.

    <title>Security Center can&#39;t turn on Windows Firewall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ontech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Security Center can&#39;t turn on Windows Firewall</h2>
                    I was using BitDefender's firewall, but just uninstalled that product.&nbsp; Now Windows Security Center warns that Windows Firewall is turned off.&nbsp; When I click the "Turn on now" button, I get a UAC permissions window, click contine, and then after maybe 20
 seconds, I get a dialog box saying "Security Center can't turn on Windows Firewall."<br />
<br />
The dialog box has a link that says, "Turn on Windows Firewall manually"; when&nbsp;I click on that link, it takes me to the Windows Firewall configuration page.&nbsp; In the left navbar, the first link is "Turn Windows Firewall on or off"; if I click on that, I get
 a UAC permissions dialog, then a dialog box saying, "Windows Firewall settings cannot be displayed because the associated services is not running.&nbsp; Do you want to start the Windows Firewall service?"&nbsp; When I click the "Yes" button,&nbsp;I get a dialog saying, "Starting
 the Windows Firewall service..." then a dialog saying, "Windows cannot start the Windows Firewall service."&nbsp; I click "OK" and I'm back at the Firewall config screen.&nbsp; None of the other links there help me out.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;opened the Services management consolel.&nbsp; It shows the Windows Firewall service as Startup Type "Automatic," but the service&nbsp;is not started.&nbsp; When I try to start it, I briefly get a dialog box saying Windows is attempting to start the service, then a dialog
 box saying: "Windows could not start the Windows Firewall on Local Computer.&nbsp; For more information, review the System Event Log.&nbsp; If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code 13."<br />
<br />
I opened the Event Viewer, and in the Security log, I find the following entry:<br />
Keywords: Audit Success<br />
Source: Microsoft Windows security auditing.<br />
Event ID: 5025<br />
Task Category: Other System Event<br />
Level: Information<br />
<br />
From the Details tab:<br />
Keywords: 0x8020000000000000<br />
EventRecordID: 89463<br />
Execution:<br />
&nbsp; ProcessID: 708<br />
&nbsp; ThreadID: 2108<br />
Channel: Security<br />
<br />
I don't see anything in the other logs, though when I try to open the Systems log, I get: "Event Viewer cannot open the event log or custom view.&nbsp; Verify that Event Log service is running.&nbsp; The data is invalid (13)"<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to get the firewall running?

                    I just downloaded Windows 10. Prior to the download, I had 4 separate accounts (2 different ones under my name, a guest account and a kids account) and the administrator account was under my name.&nbsp; Now the administrator is under my husband's Hotmail address
 and his name.&nbsp; It has all of my files and information, but is listed under his name.&nbsp; How do I change this back to my name.&nbsp; I don't use an outlook account, I use as sbcglobal email account.

    <title>Multiple Audio Devices &#38; RDC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Audio Devices &#38; RDC</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed a lot of people have asked similar sounding questions as this, but this is not the same question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a computer at my shop connected to analyzer software that grabs audio from an external device, processes it, then passes it to another program (via a virtual audio cable) for further analysis, and finally to the system speakers for playback and recording
 (records default audio out). &nbsp;When using the machine locally, this all works fine. &nbsp;When I connect via RDC however, the external audio device and virtual audio cable are no longer present. &nbsp;I can and have disabled the audio redirection in RDC which partially
 fixes this, but by doing so I can no longer hear the final mixed output going to the recorder (because it's playing on the remote speakers and not via RDC). &nbsp;I've heard leaving the software running before starting RDC allows it to continue to use the physical
 audio i/o, but this is not something I run full time, only when needed (and often with little or no notice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to have all drivers working at the same time (remote system audio i/o AND RDC audio i/o)? &nbsp;I need to be able to select and manage the physical (and virtual) audio i/o on the remote system, but still have the mixed "speaker output" passed
 over RDC when the session is up. &nbsp;It seems silly that an RDC session would completely disable all audio devices like this. &nbsp;It would make more sense to me if it simply "added" its virtual devices and set them as the defaults during a session instead, allowing
 me to manually override as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I should note this is only the first and easiest instance of this. &nbsp;I can certainly use third-party tools right now to pipe the audio over an RTP stream for this setup (don't like doing that, but if I have to). &nbsp;The problem is, I have another system
 that I'll be setting up in the near future with the same loadout, but that system is completely locked down behind firewalls (in and out) and network policies that I wont have access to, only a VMWare Horizons session from which I can RDC to my on-site "technician's"
 machine; a third-party RTP solution wont work here so it has to be RDC audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All computers are running Windows 10.</p>

<h3> levis raju  say:</h3>
<h2>            REALTEK RTL8139&#47;810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC not detected by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My on-board NIC is&nbsp;REALTEK RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installed windows 10 on my computer and it hasn't detected any NICs and then I downloaded a driver from realtek and installed. But when I tried it, the system restarted too. It said that it went out of physical memory and given me a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now the error report I am getting is "This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many things :( &nbsp;<em>[like troubleshooter options and some solutions suggested by you guys for similar problems]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had updated the driver by manual installation by detecting that .sys files etc. It said that drivers was upto date. But I am getting the error code 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have a PCIe GBE Family controller. It says it cannot start. Anyway, that doesn't seems a problem to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I want is my NIC to be working properly. Now the real problem is, when I go to CHANGE ADAPTER SETTINGS in network connections, I cannot see anything there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't say me to change my NIC, my pap won't get me one now :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me buds. Otherwise, I cannot migrate to windows 10 :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you help me so that I could run Windows 10 with network connectivity. And also, I am waiting for Lumia 550, so I could integrate with it if my windows 10 works fine on my pc :D&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to update all the drivers from Device manager manually by uninstalling and reinstalling from the manufacturer website. Drivers may show an updated status
 but it’s recommended to download all the drivers for Windows 10 from the manufacturer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to un-install the drivers:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the search bar type “<strong>Device Manager.</strong>”</span></li><li><span>On the left pane locate “<strong>Network Adapter</strong>” and expand by clicking on it.</span></li><li><span>Right on the “<strong>Network Adapter”</strong> option and click “Uninstall’.</span></li><li><span>Download the latest Network adapter driver setup file from the
<strong>manufacturer’s website</strong> and install it.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update the chipset, graphics as well as USB drivers in the same way. Further if the issue persists you can try disabling the Firewall and antivirus on the system and
 check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R&nbsp;&gt; type <em>msinfo32 </em>in the "Open" box&nbsp; &gt; OK &gt;&nbsp;File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make the resulting .nfo file&nbsp;available via&nbsp;a public folder on OneDrive&nbsp;or similar site.</p>

<h2>            I uninstalled the Windows 10 and now get a blank screen.</h2>
                    <p>Sadly, this is happening on my new laptop because I killed the old one trying to upgrade to Windows 10. It had been on it's last leg for quite a while so I took it as a hint and got a new one. Now I seem to have lost access to two laptops because of the
 upgrade. I followed the prompts to get back to Windows 8.1 after deciding that I didn't care for 10. &nbsp;I get to the sign on screen, type in my password and get a blank screen. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know how did you tried to roll back to Windows 8.1?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For now, you may try simple steps. Try performing start up repair and check if this helps in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do not have media creation disc, you can download and <span>
create installation media for Windows 10</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert the <strong>installation DVD or USB </strong>and boot Windows 10 from it.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>‘Windows setup’ </strong>page, select the<strong> ‘language to install’</strong>, ‘<strong>Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>‘Repair your computer’</strong> and select <strong>‘Troubleshoot’.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’</strong> and select the operating system.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Where are you seeing the blank screen?&nbsp; In Windows 8, or Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you access Safe Mode, and if so, do you have any Display?&nbsp; If you have a workable Display can you access Device Manager and disable the current Display Adapter and reboot the machine into Normal Mode.&nbsp; This will make you have to use the Microsoft Basic
 Display Driver.&nbsp; From there (Normal Mode) check your OEM for your operating system's Display Driver, or check with the Video Card manufacturer.&nbsp; Install the correct Display Driver for your operating system.</p>

</p>
<p><br />
You can access the recovery console/safe mode menu by:<br />
Depressing the Shift Key while clicking on Restart at the Login Screen (Bottom right corner).
</p>
<p><br />
Manually shutting down (forcibly) three times in a row will bring you to the same screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When installing a Driver that you might have downloaded try right-clicking on the actual Driver Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>You might have this option too if the above fail to help..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.

                    In the latest build of windows 10 I can't change whether the text is bold nor able to change size. The entire section is missing in 'Advanced display settings' Has this moved or has the feature been completely removed. We need this for accessibility reasons.

            Hi Matthew, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If preinstalled, you can also&nbsp;contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available (Most don't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also borrow the exact same edition of Windows 7 Retail DVD and use your Product Key on the COA sticker to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive and you can Boot into Windows, you should be able to make and have&nbsp;your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System in case of Hard Drive failure.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use this for preinstalled OEM&nbsp;or Retail Licenses</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i want to use the Remote-Desktop to control my Home PC with my Notebook. So far I get a conection, but the monitor on my Home PC turns to Log-In Screen as I Log In with Remote Control. Is there any way to switch on the monitor on my Home PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>No, by design the desktop on the Remote Desktop [RDC] host machine is locked out when the remote RDC user logs in.</p>

<p>A real nice alternative, and <strong>free for personal use</strong>, is <strong>
<em>TeamViewer</em></strong>. I use it to remotely access my wife's Windows 7 Home Premium wireless desktop for remote support, maintenance, etc and to remotely support two of my sister-in-laws across town. On my home LAN I have TeamViewer setup on my wife's
 desktop to start when the computer starts and I have setup a predetermined secure password so I can log on anytime without her needing to issue an invitation.</p>
