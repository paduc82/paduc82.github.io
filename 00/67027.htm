<h2>            Windows Update error 0x80073712 With KB3011780</h2>
                    <p>I have had repeated unsuccessful attempts trying to download KB3011780 since it was first released&nbsp;on&nbsp;"Update / Super&nbsp;Tuesday" in November 2014.&nbsp;With an&nbsp;excess of&nbsp;one hundred (100)&nbsp;failed attempts since November 19, 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spent over an hour with MS Tech Support in a remote control assistance session. The young woman assisting me supposedly reset my updates. The machine took more than thirty (30) minutes to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the session, I attempted another download of this Update. It seemed to stall at 5%, so I stopped the download. I made another attempt and it failes before even reaching 1% of the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is currently attempting another download, currently running for about 5 minutes or more this time not even reaching 1%, but still downloading in the green.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even at one point, back in November, downloaded it from the "KB site" and installing it independently from the KB download file. Again without any success and also returning this same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this same problem with this same Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you discovered a "FIX' Please pass it on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 task bar failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vegasjoe89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 task bar failure</h2>
                    Windows 10 has taken my computer hostage and I cannot use it.<br />
The "upgrades" to this "flagship" product have rendered my computer useless.<br />
NONE OF THE WINDOWS TASK BAR FIXES WORK.<br />
LET ME REPEAT THAT - NONE OF THE SUGGESTED FIXES WORK.<br />
NONE OF THEM.<br />
I CANNOT USE MY COMPUTER BECAUSE I AM LOCKED OUT OF MY TASK BAR.<br />
Microsoft is a criminal disgrace for foisting a shoddy, useless product on the public.<br />
I simply need a solution to the taskbar issue so that my computer is not rendered useless by windows 10.

            Certainly Microsoft has provided a solution to the taskbar failure?<br />
Seriously, the task bar is a critical part of Windows operation and yet Microsoft acts as if the failure simply doesn't exist despite hundreds of complaints of failure?<br />
I have wasted and entire day screwing around with failed suggestion after failed suggestion.<br />
NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS.<br />
BUT MICROSOFT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THIS COLOSSAL FLOP OF AN OPERATING SYSTEM.<br />
I am going to roll back to Windows 8.<br />
At least I will have a system that works and doesn't hold me hostage to Microsoft indifference.<br />
If only apple supported the software I need, I would dump Microsoft in a hot second.

            <p>Has Microsoft decided to fix the broken Windows 10 taskbar?</p>
<p>Why are there no solutions for this?<br />
Solutions that work, I mean?<br />
I have wasted an entire day with pointless and useless suggestions and yet there is no relief in sight.<br />
why is there no fix for this problem?<br />
Why does every suggestion end with - "I hope that helps" rather than "This IS THE SOLUTION"?<br />
Don't they know if it actually works?<br />

            You are way too late.<br />
I simply rolled back the Windows 10 update that **** over my computer and have blocked any further Microsoft tampering with my machine.<br />
Windows 10 is worthless garbage and Microsoft is a crappy company.<br />
Worthless in their response and/or respect for their customers.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI, Google search Windows 10 task bar issues and you will find hundreds of posts describing what the issue is.<br />
It is pretty damn prevalent from what I found.<br />
Microsoft, in its gross arrogance has refused to even acknowledge the Task bar failure issue.

            <p>totally unacceptable! you must be aware of this problem as there are many many hundreds of complaints! all are the same, when is MS going to offer something concrete for a fix? I have already had to do one system restore, but didnt block future update because
 there may be a critical update my system needs, and now my task bar isnt working again! So that leads me to believe that I need to go back to an earlier version of Windows, or better yet, to a MAC!&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it irritates me to no end that we have to describe to you what the issue is? and tell you what we've done? if you were any help at all we wouldnt have had to go thru ANY self help steps! huge failure on your part.</p>

            <p>The method that I used to solve this was to roll back the updates. There is a method on Microsoft to roll back updates to a previous time, by using Safe Mode. It will delete any software installed since then, but your data will still be safe.</p>
<p>If you are successful in rolling back the ****-up "update" then I would advise that you turn on the automatic set "Roll back" feature that **** - in their infinite wisdom - have set to be OFF as a default.<br />
The better by which to **** you over just for laughs.</p>
<p>Then you must block the MALWARE that **** is trying to install - yes, it is malicious malware, but worse, in that Microshits only intention is to **** you - most malware is there to extract ransom.</p>
<p>**** has no such intention - they just want to **** you over and laugh about it while they ignore the screw job they've inflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with fixing the screw job you have been saddled with.</p>

            <p>One of the sad things about the "help", sincere as it may be, almost always includes actions that involve the frozen task bar such as...."go to your Windows menu and....."</p>
<p>On cannot access the Windows menu because the task bar is completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>You must go to Safe Mode and use the Roll Back feature to reset it to a previous update.<br />
THEN, turn on the RESET point feature that the **** have set as OFF as the default.....</p>
<p>Turn that on and ignore any future upgrades from the idiots.</p>
<p>I wasted a beautiful Fall day screwing around with this stupidity.</p>

            <p>Hello Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still not able to use CD-ROM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upper and lower class filters are used by Windows software that needs an optical drive to function, most common in CD or DVD burning suites. The filters help the software closely integrate and interact with the device. The filters are installed automatically
 with the software and an entry is created for it in the Windows' registry, viewable using the regedit utility. There are a variety of upper and lower class filters available, each used by different companies. The filters work automatically and most users will
 never see, modify or interact with the filter directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this article and check if it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

    <title>20 Second delay when connecting to network PCs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microsoft and me  say:</h3>
<h2>            20 Second delay when connecting to network PCs</h2>
                    
<p>We are&nbsp;experiencing&nbsp;a 20 second delay when we try to connect via Windows Explorer to some of the XP (SP3 and all the latest updates so it excludes&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/899409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/899409</a>)&nbsp;PCs on our network.
 &nbsp;For example, if I type \\10.10.10.7 in the address bar, it takes 20 seconds for the shares to appear. &nbsp;If I type \\10.10.10.7\Scans (a share on that PC), it goes right through instantly. &nbsp;I have checked our Active Directory Windows 2003 DNS Server, and the
 Forward and Reverse zones look okay. &nbsp;I have looked at the IP address the PCs receive from the Windows DHCP server (10.10.10.n, 10.10.11.n, and 10.10.12.n), and there is no correlation. &nbsp;I have tried using different user accounts and checked the share and
 NTFS permissions but that doesn't seem to matter. &nbsp;I have tried ipconfig, ping, pathping, tracert, arp, netsh diag gui and it all passes. &nbsp;We have some PCs that are in workgroups that work and some that don't work. &nbsp;We have some PCs joined to our domain that
 work and some that don't work. &nbsp;We have some PCs that sometimes give us the delay and sometimes do not give us the delay, we have some that always give us the delay, and we have some that never give us the delay. &nbsp;We are in a large high school&nbsp;environment,
 and the delay is causing many problems. &nbsp;So if you have any thoughts on how to&nbsp;isolate&nbsp;the problem that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>So the clue I think lies in the instant connection to a share, but the 20 delay when you try to connect to the PC to see its shares.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<h2>            How to turn off conversations in Windows 10 mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this thread below re the above topic:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/windows-10-mail-turning-off-conversations-grouping/2d096d34-0db8-4cad-b26d-19831e7e58e7</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer given at the bottom of that thread matches this info published by Microsoft:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-do-I-turn-off-arrange-by-conversation-in-Mail-for-Windows-10-1b816093-51af-45b4-8f2f-32c2fb673b58</p>
<p>
</p><p>However:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) The settings mentioned in that thread do not seem available to me in the version of Windows mail on my Win 10 PC. Specifically after I cllick the 'gear' icon to access 'settings', the menu that appears does not match that described in the support article
 mentioned above (nor in the previous thread I pasted in).&nbsp; When I click 'about' within Windows 10 it says I am on Version 17.9226.21295.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) I don't seem able to add a comment to the thread I pasted in above on this topic</p>
<p>
Can someone help please by guiding me on how I switch of conversations in windows mail? Any help is appreciated and my apologies for any oversights I may have made.</p>

<p>Hi Jos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP Universal Print Driver (UPD) is an intelligent print driver that supports a broad range of HP LaserJet printers and Multi-Functional Printers. This advanced print driver has the ability to discover HP printing devices and automatically
 configures itself to the device capabilities. HP Universal Print Driver provides two modes of operation: 1) Dynamic Mode and 2) Traditional Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason why you are getting the prompt to choose which network printer to be used is because; you have opted for the Dynamic Mode of operation while installing the driver. In Dynamic Mode, it automatically discovers, manages and configures
 all the available printers on the network. But, in Traditional Mode of its operation, the universal printer driver is bound to a print queue and behaves like a normal printer driver and functions exactly like the product-specific drivers. In this mode, it
 bypasses the universal printing dialog box (where it asks to choose the printer) and goes directly into the typical print setup dialog box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the Traditional and Dynamic modes can be used on the same PC to support both office and mobile printing and it is also possible to switch easily between them. In Dynamic Mode, a permanent instance of this driver can be created by
 simply clicking the option “<b><i>Add this printer to my Printer and Faxes folder</i></b>”. When you select this, the driver will function in Traditional Mode and users can select print devices from an application’s “Print” menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, you may refer to these articles from HP:</p>

            <p>Sorry, it doesn't work. I don't know what to do first 1. Installing the UPD software or 2. Connect the USB cable from the printer to my computer. There is also a third option besides the static and dynamic choice the USB modus? I tried&nbsp;the static and also
 the USB modes connecting before and afterwards but nothing works. Every time there was data send to the printer but the data light burns permanently. After using the OK button he prints a page with some smileys. Can you show me in detail all the steps and
 screens with witch choice to make? The screens for Step 12 and 13 for the USB mode doesn't show up??? Must I something change in the printer? I cannot enter the service&nbsp;menu, what is the key for entering this menu?</p>
<p>Hopefully you can help me.&nbsp;</p>

            You may want to try a different printer driver.&nbsp; Here is the HP page for the 2420 drivers:<br />

<br />
On Win 8 Pro I am using the "HP LaserJet 2420 PCL5 Class Driver" as the default for my 2420 DN. It allows me to duplex my output.<br />
<br />
I tried the "HP Universal Printing PCL 6" but it did not work well for me.<br />

            <p>Sorry but I quit with trying to use UPD with USB connected Laser printer 2420. I lose a lot of time with trying to understand and installing the UPD.&nbsp;I found between my old devices one print server, one switch and one parallel printer cable. The 4020 has
 also a parallel interface. After installing these hardware and adding a&nbsp;printer&nbsp;with tcp/ip port every thing works perfect within a quarter of one hour.</p>
<p>Every body thanks for trying to help me.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear that your computer has started giving Blue Screen after installing an update for Windows Defender. Though it is unusual that a Defender update would cause such an issue, unless the system was already infected with the virus definition
 installed. Assuming that the system was not infected, the most likely cause of the problem could be another update that might have got installed the same time. The most probable ones are driver updates and software updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps mentioned in the link below to resolve the issue:</p>

    <title>Weird recorded message when trying to call a landline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bea707  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird recorded message when trying to call a landline</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a really weird problem. When I try to call internationally from Skype to a landline (iPhone or iPad) the call says ‘connecting’ and when it changes to ‘ringing’ a recorded message starts. It’s not the other side that answers because I see after
 the message starts the seconds running as if I was already connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message is a female voice reciting, in a very monotone mode, what it appears to be the lyrics of a song called ‘Louie, Louie’.</p>
<p>The person I call never hear the phone ringing but my credit money diminishes each time.</p>
<p>I tried to contact Skype Support but it’s impossible to find a real agent by chat or email.</p>
<p>Have you heard of this problem before?</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</p>

            After Selecting Skype as the product, select 'Payments and Purchases' as the sub-category. You should have a chat box there to proceed with live chat. 
<br />
<br />I'm sorry that you find it frustrating. As soon as you get a hold of a live agent, you should be good to go!

<p>If this is a billing issue try going to <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://billing.microsoft.com</a> Sometime we just happen to find glitches sad but true. Even if your balance says 0 if you add anew cc or update your current cc it will automaticlly pay &nbsp;any past due balances. Make sure you remove the old cc if needed and call
 cx support to turn off the auto renewal. Or else you will be charged every billing cycle for that new subscription you added. Hope this works for you also try to use a different cc or try directly from your xbox.</p>

</p><p>If you're using the <strong>Extend</strong> option of <strong>Project</strong> display selection (<strong>Windows key + P</strong>), you can click and drag the file from Monitor 1 to Monitor 2. You may need to disable

<h3> _saiko  say:</h3>
<h2>            WakeOnLan &#40;WOL&#41; after sleep causes high CPU usage</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I noticed a problem with constant high CPU usage on one of my cores.<br />
As much as 60% was used.<br />
<br />
The problem occures after I put the system to "sleep" (S3 state) and perform a WOL with a "magic packet".<br />
<br />
I discovered that ACPI.sys+0x1af44 thread was responsible (using sysinternals ProcessExplorer) under the System process.</p>
<p>If i perform WOL while the machine was shut down everything works perfectly.</p>
<p>My NIC is&nbsp; "Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller" and I'm using the latest drivers.</p>
<p>I discovered that if I disabled the option in Power Management for the device: "Allow this device to wake the computer", the CPU usage immediately went to normal (without restarting). But enabling it back the high CPU usage resumes. Performing another sleep
 and awaking the system with power button "resets" the CPU usage issue for "good". Until i WOL from sleep again ofcourse..</p>
<p>I contacted the motherboard manufacturer of the problem but so far no real answer.</p>
<p><br />
I'm saddened because I need the WOL feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm hoping somebody who has more insight in the behaviour of ACPI on W7 can answer my questions.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

<p>My account got hacked into and had its MS points drained for that Fifa stuff. It's now in an Xbox Support investigation so the Gold is suspended. But can I still play single player stuff on it and get achievements, just not play multiplayer?</p>

<p>How is only your membership suspended? Your entire account should be locked while they investigate. I don't recommend you use your account while there is a current investigation is going on.</p>

<p>I'm not sure. I gave the guy on the Xbox Support my console's ID and serial # and he said my account would be suspended and the investigation would start and then that ended. I was signed in on my Xbox and sitting on the Dashboard throughout and after the
 call, I still was and nothing changed. I still am now. I went to my Windows Live billing history and my current Gold membership card is suspended so I assume it's in effect. I'm just curious as to if I can still sit on the Dashboard and play single player
 stuff while this is going on.</p>

<p>Hey Daft, you should be able to play on your account offline during the investigation. However, once you recover your account, the achievements earned offline will be lost.

<p>Hello DaftLink I17, If you indeed still have access to your gamertag then you are able to play games offline and earn achievements. Once your UAI is resolved and you are able to sign to Xbox Live your achievements earned while offline will be shown on this
 site as earned, there just won't be a date next to it. </p>
<p>As an example it will look like this, </p>
<p>Seriously 2.0 - Earned</p>
<p>Instead of</p>
<p>Seriously 2.0 - Earned 10/25/11</p>

<p>I figured out what the problem was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an issue with the account I was using to log into the laptop.&nbsp; I had setup to use my Windows Account to log into the laptop.&nbsp; I switched to local account and was able to access the files.&nbsp; I then switched back to Windows Account and I was still
 able to access the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what was wrong with the account and why switching be local and windows account login fixed the issue.</p>

<h2>            Transfer audio file from digital voice recorder into Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a new Vandlion digital voice recorder model v 35. I followed the instructions I found online, namely, to insert the USB cable into both the voice recorder and the microphone port on my ASUS all in one computer. The instructions say once this is
 done, to turn on the voice recorder, which I did. they say at this point I should click start and or My computer. and double click the removable device icon and a window will appear with all the audio files. I followed instructions to there, but no audio files
 appeared.

<h2>            Flight Sim X&#59; Acceleration does not work with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, maybe I can get some help here.</p>
<p>I am on the Insiders program and test flying Windows 10. In the current build (build 10162), my flight sim X and the acceleration expansion pack were removed after the install. This did not happen with prior builds. Do I need to reinstall the program and
 go through all of it again? It also took off my Abacus Flight Deck 5 and 6.</p>
