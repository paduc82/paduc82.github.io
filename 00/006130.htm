<h2>            To Petrib....N93 going crazy&#63;</h2>
                    Hi i know ive addressed this to Petrib but others can respond as well<br />
i did a hard reset on my n93 now when i turn the phone on i get a prompt "installing" when that is over i get the prompt that all applications were not installed check app man to install the rest when i go to app man some of the apps are installed twice and
 some cannot be installed nor deleted the ones that cannot be deleted take a file name like this: aa0000f74c.sis mostly a combination of letters and numbers and i cant get them deleted from app man nor can i see them in the file man they are quite a few of
 them i havent formatted my memory card because i find that when i do this my printer can no longer read the card<br />
any suggestions on how i can delete these files and how to stop the "installing" prompt when i turn my phone on?

I suggest you one thing. Normally it works best. Just re-flash the phone through NSU if you are using version 20.0.058. Else upgrade. This normally fixes most of the problems

            You can delete the offending app files from the memory card using a PC, if you connect with the USB cable using USB mass storage mode.

            When i first got my n80 i installed all my applications and themes on the memory card then when i did a hard reset with *#7370# i thought i would just be able to re install.no such luck. some themes reinstalled when ididn't want them and some applications
 wouldn't reinstall yet the application manager said they had been. After many attempts and some good advice off this site i formatted the memory card and did * green key and 3 when i switched the phone on magically this did the trick. i reinstalled all the
 applications themes on the phone memory and i haven't had many problems since.

            It is very easy.<br />
1. First connect yr N93 as USB Drive to yr PC.<br />
2. Y will see yr N93 as a local drive on yr PC.<br />
3. Open it up.<br />
4. Select search from the top parts of yr PC.<br />
5. Select all files and folders.<br />
6. Type these names like a0000a7c.sis<br />
7. Yr PC will show em and y just delete em.<br />
<br />
Thats it.<br />
<br />
WHY IT OCCURS:<br />
it means somehow one or more of yr installed applications s get corrupted[specially the on memory card installed ones]on the memory card and thus cause this phenomena and it is common in my N91 too!

            <p>Hi David,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you cannot edit documents in Word 2016.&nbsp; I would like to suggest you check the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Activate-Office-365-Office-2016-or-Office-2013-1144e0de-e849-496e-8e33-ed6fb1b34202?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ensure your Office 2016 is activated successfully.</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. If the document is protected with password, you can disable Document Protection. You can check more details about protected view in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-Protected-View-d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653#bm2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Open the document Word 2016.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2) Go to Developer tab (if you don’t have Developer tab, go to File&gt;Options&gt;Customize Ribbon&gt; and select Developer), select Document Protection.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3) Navigate to the bottom of the panel, and click Stop Protection.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4) Enter the password for the document, and click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Use CTRL+A to select all texts, use CTRL+C to copy them to the clipboard. Start a new document and use CTRL+V to paste the texts into that document to check if you can edit it.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, could you please provide the information below?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. A screenshot about the document page when you try to edit it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. A screenshot about product information for your Office: File&gt; Account&gt; Product Information.<br />
<br />

            What you should do is make sure Windows 10 is fully updated.
<br />
<br />You can do that by downloading the latest ISO then perform a repair upgrade:

<br />Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application (e.g., Norton Security Deluxe) or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />
<br />7. Is Office Home and Student 2013 still installed on the old computer?
<br />
<br />8. Did Office Home and Student 2013 come preinstalled on the old computer?

<p>1a. I purchased the computer today (November 24, 2017).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. I purchased the computer from Staples (Canada).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. The computer was sold to me&nbsp;as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer. In fact, it was sealed with what appeared to be the initial manufacture tape.</p>

<p>
</p><p>3. Acer manufactured the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The computer came with Norton Security (does not say Deluxe) installed. Norton Security is still installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I have not run the Norton Removal Tool. I was going to uninstall Norton Security using Control Panel (I actually went up to the point where it was asking me why I wanted to uninstall it), but my brother suggested that I keep it for now (even though he

            Chances are the Norton application is your troublemaker here.
<br />
<br />1. The preinstalled Norton free-trial expires in 30 days (i.e., on 31 December 2017). Do you plan on purchasing Norton Security before the free-trial period expires? [&lt;=that's JUST a question, not a suggestion (at least not yet)!]
<br />
<br />2. At some point, you should be able to install Office Home and Student 2013 (1 PC) on your new computer but you will NOT be able to Activate the install as long as it's still installed on your old computer. Are you prepared to do that?
<br />
<br />3. Has Best Buy's Geek Squad ever done anything to the computer since you bought it?

<p>
</p><p>1. No, I don't plan on purchasing Norton Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, I'm definitely prepared to do that as I would like to transition fully to this new computer I've purchased. I haven't done it yet because I'm currently in school and have assignments requiring the use of Word, so I didn't want uninstall it just for
 it to not work on the new computer anyway. Purchasing the new Office 2016 is possible, but I'd like to avoid that if I can!</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No, the only interaction I've had with Best Buy since 2015 was to purchase my old laptop as well as Office Home and Student 2013.</p>

            Let's prepare the computer for Office 2013 Home &amp; Student to be installed at some point in the future - then make sure everything else if OK with you new computer,
<br />
<br />1. Download (but do not Run) the Norton Remove and Reinstall tool, saving it to your desktop for convenience =&gt; <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v60392881_EndUserProfile_en_us?src=nrnr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/curren...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall Norton Security (Standard) &amp; reboot; follow all prompts.
<br />
<br />3. Make CERTAIN that Windows Defender &amp; Windows Firewall are both enabled &amp; working properly. [Should happen automatically but I want you to double-check.]
<br />
<br />4. Run the Norton utility (#1 above), selecting the REMOVE option then restart the computer. [There shouldn't be a REMOVE AND REINSTALL option - but if there is one, DON'T use it!]
<br />
<br />5. Reset Windows Update [1] using the script (BAT file) in this tutorial =&gt; <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-reset-windows-update-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/24742-reset...</a>
<br />
<br />6. Run a manual check for update and see if any/all updates offered (e.g., KB4048954; KB4048951; KB4049011; KB4048606) will successfully install; follow all prompts.
<br />
<br />HOW TO Run a manual check for updates in Win10
<br /><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4807-windows-update-check-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4807-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />7. Assuming all went well, run another manual check for updates and see if the Fall Creators Update (Windows 10 Version 1709) is offered &amp; successfully installs; again, follow all prompts.
<br />
<br />TIP: Assuming the Fall Creators Update successfully installs, allow 30-45 minutes (or more) for Windows to fully load after rebooting as LOTS of changes are being made - then reboot a second time for good measure.
<br />
<br />8. No rush, take your time - then reply to this post with a status report when all is "done &amp; dusted.".
<br />
<br />GOOD LUCK!
<br />
<br />============================================
<br />[1] FULL DISCLOSURE: Resetting Windows Update will delete your Update History but the not list of Installed Updates. Then again, upgrading to Win10 Version 1709 (Fall Creators Update) will delete both of them.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To resolve this issue we need more information. Let us know the following:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>How are you trying to sign-in to OneNote? What is the sign-in process you follow?
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Is this issue happening in other Office applications also? Check signing in to other applications also and check.
</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To resolve the issue you may try resetting the Internet Explorer (IE) browser and check if it helps to sign-in on OneNote?
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may reset IE settings using the link below and check if you are able to sign-in normally in OneNote 2013.</span></p>

    <title>Access 2016 corrupted link to a single back end table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart bratesman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 corrupted link to a single back end table</h2>
                    <p>Here's an unusual Access 2016 problem:&nbsp; a single corrupted link to a back end table while all the other links to other tables in the same back end database were fine.</p>
<p>I have a multi-user front end mdb database that links to multiple tables in a back end mdb database.&nbsp; Both reside on a network server.&nbsp; When opening a front end form, fed by several back end tables, users saw the following error message, "<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><em>Cannot
 open database ''. It may not be a database your application recognizes, or the file may be corrupt." &nbsp;</em></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Normally, this would mean the back end mdb file was corrupted and needed to be compacted and repaired.&nbsp; However, I was able to open the back end database without any error messages.&nbsp; When I returned
 to the front end, I was able to open each of the linked back end tables, except for one we'll call the "XYZ" table.&nbsp; I tried compacting and repairing both databases, but the problem persisted.&nbsp; Then I found I could open the same suspect XYZ table from a different
 front end database without errors.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When I returned to the original front end database, I first tried using the Linked Table Manager (with "always prompt for new location" set to YES) to replace the bad XYZ link, but when I navigated
 to the back end mdb file and clicked OK, the same error message reappeared.&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then, I went to the External Data ribbon to create a new additional link to the same XYZ table in the back end.&nbsp; Access named the new linked table, XYZ1.&nbsp; The new XYZ1 link worked just fine.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I renamed the problem XYZ link to "XYZ2", and then renamed the good XYZ1 link to the original "XYZ" name.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; All of the front end queries and forms that depended on XYZ worked just
 fine, and after deleting the bad link, and every thing was back to normal.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which leaves us with the question, how did a single link get corrupted without affecting any of the links to all the other tables in the back end database, and would there be a simpler way to fix
 it?</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hard to say why any corruption occurs. Corruption is often caused by an network glitches. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd bet your problem stems from sharing the FrontEnd. Users should never share the same FE. You should make copies of the FE and place a
 copy on each local machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a short batch file that does this automatically, and create a shortcut that calls that batch file. The file can be as simple as this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>COPY "Full Path to your network location" "Full path to local database"</p>
<p>START "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11 \MSACCESS.EXE" "Full Path to local database"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have only one version of Access installed, you can leave off the path to MSACCESS.EXE in the START line above.</p>

<p>The problem is, that typically both the server and the workstation caches the file, and this may fail, so never run a frontend off a shared network folder - copy it to a local folder and launch it from that location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One method, that would have cleared your issue at once, is to use a script and a shortcut to launch the frontend.</p>

            You'll have to go to your nearest Nokia Care Point and explain the situation to them. You can't do the roll-back yourself.<br />
<br />
Under normal circumstances an NCP won't do a firmware rollback. You'll have to convince them that the update has broken things for you and that you really are better off with the old version.

<h2>            Affichage des calendriers dans Outlook for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>Je rencontre un problème d'affichage avec les calendriers de comptes Office 365 sur Outlook 2016 for Mac.</p>
<p>Pour chaque compte Exchange Online que j'ajoute, Outlook me crée le calendrier sous "Mes calendriers", mail il me le créer également plus bas avec le même nom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Le soucis est que je ne peux pas me permettre de juste en décocher un, car les calendriers ne sont pas des doublons, il sont complémentaire, vraiment bizarre.</p>
<p>Par contre quand j'ajoute un autre compte d'un Exchange local, là je n'ai pas le soucis, le calendrier apparaît qu'une seule fois.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comment est-il possible de simplifier tous ça en pouvant tout mettre dans un seul calendrier?</p>
<p>
</p><p>D'avance merci,</p>

<h2>            How to set Internet Explorer &#40;64-bit&#41; as the default browser under Win7 &#40;64-bit&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am running Win7, 64-bit and I want to set the 64-bit version of Internet Explorer to be the default browser, so when any application can start the 64-bit whenever needed
 instead of the 32-bit version.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for any help,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I just got a Gateway DX4831-01e (nice PC) and the 32-bit version of IE is not working anymore (other people have this issue too).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have removed many installed programs, ran the IE (32-bit) without any add-on, ran it without any anti-virus program, reset its settings to default, and still is not working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The IE 32-bit starts fine and starts any web page (either from Favorite or me typing in the link).<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when I right click on any link inside that web page and ask to open it in a new window, nothing happens (no window pops up) and if I ask to open the link in a new tab, then I see a new tab, saying connecting and it never goes to that link.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I know some add-ons don’t work on the IE (64-bit) like Adobe Flash, however, the IE (64-bit) works and starts the web links either in a new window or a new tab.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am open to fixing the 32-bit version if you know how to do it. THANKS </span>

<p>===================================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's a Win7 64-bit computer, you have two (2) versions of Internet Explorer: IE 32-bit (the default) and IE 64-bit (<em>cannot</em> be the default). Shortcuts to both should be listed in your Start menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See this "sticky" for more details &amp; info about IE 32-bit vs. IE 64-bit on a Win7 64-bit computer:

<h2>            Problem with upgradingen to th2_release Professional 10525</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have problem with installing/upgrading th2_release Professional 10525</p>
<p>It hasn't downloading the hole upgrade completely but it still tries to upgrade and wants to reboot the computer.&nbsp;After reboot it says faild to upgrade but no fault code.
</p>
<p>After a while it still wants to upgrade and reboot without&nbsp;completing the downloading of the new th2_release Professional 10525 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This cycle have I done about 5 times now. I have also tried to delete the $Windows.~BT map, 14556 files and 3240 folders, &nbsp;but it's not possible. The size of the map is about 1,53 GB, I also have a folder called $Windows.~WS with a size of 3.06MB, 7 files
 and 2 folders. </p>
<p>During the first faild upgrading atempt it deleted the Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to download the th2_release Professional 10525 as an iso or how should I do to force a new download of the comlete th2_release Professional 10525 build?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the 10240 swedish build. with the lates upgrades KB3081444 and&nbsp;KB3081441 done yesterday 2015.08.19</p>
<p>Should I uninstall one of them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards</p>

<p>if you look in the $Windows.~ folders you might find&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; install.esd in the \sources folder.</p>
<p>There is a popular tool everybody uses to make it into an iso ,, might search it;</p>
<p><em>esd-decrypter-wimlib-4.7z</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>pretty simple... unzip into a temp folder and put a copy of the .esd in same folder</p>
<p>right click run the&nbsp; &nbsp;decrypt.cmd&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;as admin ... select item 1 from the menu...&nbsp; wait a few minutes.</p>

            <p>$Windows.~WS is likely leftover from the upgrade via Media Creation Tool from Windows 7 or 8 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>$Windows.~BT is used by Windows Update to upgrade Windows.&nbsp; If you delete it the upgrade will fail although this folder will be recreated by the next Windows Update upgrade attempt.&nbsp; The download is at least 3GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A file at $Windows.~BT\Sources\install.esd can be used to create an ISO, but this file is only there briefly, after Windows Update has begun preparing the upgrade and before a restart.&nbsp; To make an ISO from it, a copy has to be made and the file needs to
 be converted to an ISO.&nbsp; There are user scripts written that can do this using Microsoft software.&nbsp; If you search for ESD Decrypter in these forums you will see discussions on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your current Windows 10 is activated then upgrading to this new Insider Build should also be auto-activated once complete.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder $Windows.~WS was created 2015-08-02 long after my upgrade to build 10240 from build 10166.</p>
<p>$Windows.~BT\Sources\install.esd doesn't exist.</p>
<p>The folder $Windows.~BT is not complete it's only 1,53 GB. In the folder $Windows.~BT\Sources\ are no files only subfolders. I have to go several subfolders down for finding any files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You havn't read my post completely.</p>
<p>It's not possible to create an iso out of my $Windows.~BT folder. The download of&nbsp; th2_release Professional 10525 build is far from complete and it wouldn't start a new download. The system wants to reboot the computer for completing the upgrade and after
 reboot I got&nbsp;the message "could not complete upgrade" or something similar and after a while it wants to reboot again without having downloaded any futher files and after reboot I get the same message again "failde to upgrade" witn no fault code.</p>
<p>I have done this reboot cycles more then 5 times now with the same result every time, no upgrade an no attempt to do a complete download of th2_release Professional 10525 build. The system says "waiting for installation"&nbsp;and want me to reboot. The system
 wrongly believes that th2_release Professional 10525 build is downloaded completly and is ready for upgrading my system.</p>
<p>I need to force the system to do a new complete download of th2_release Professional 10525. How do I do that?</p>
<p>I have also tried to make a sytem revorey and go back to ysterday before upgrading attemp and reinstall the upgrades KB3081444 and&nbsp;KB3081441 but it still don't make a complete new&nbsp;download of the th2_release Professional 10525 and belives that it's downloaded
 completly which it isn't.</p>

<p>I have to agree, my install.esd is also still there, from an upgrade from 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, used to wait for the upgrade to start, then quickly copy the file, as it did indeed disappear&nbsp;afterwards&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I see that mine is still there too.&nbsp; This happened with one other Build also.&nbsp; I think it was 10130.&nbsp; It makes sense to leave it there, since it would be simple for Microsoft to create a utility to produce an ISO from it (since users have already done this
 with scripting in PowerShell, etc.).&nbsp; But it is a large file.&nbsp; Maybe that is why most Builds have deleted this file during the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it is the download that is the longest and most tedious portion of these upgrades, plus it consumes so much bandwidth that it can compromise other work or slow down your entire home network's internet access.&nbsp; Anything to avoid repeating this download
 is best for me.&nbsp; I have drive space, so I make a copy of each of these ESD files and produce an ISO from them.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 repeatedly asks to sign into microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased and installed Office 365 on my Macbook Pro running Mavericks. I am repeatedly asked to sign in with user name and password.&nbsp; This occurs approximately every 5 minutes.&nbsp; I contacted support and was told this is a known issue and
 is currently being investigated by microsoft.&nbsp; The initial suggestion was to remove the Thunderbolt bridge from the network connection. It was suggested this may fix the issue.&nbsp; I have completed this step but find that the issue still remains.&nbsp; Microsoft support
 suggested I monitor this community for updates on the resolution, they do not have any further suggestions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a workaround for this problem? </p>
<p>
</p><p>In posting this question the site requested that I identify the software I am using - there was no option for Office 365!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Two months later and still struggling with this in the hopes the issues are resolve.&nbsp; Sign in is requiredevery 20ish minutes.. and to compound this I am now receiving the error:

            <p>Troubling to see that this is still an issue. I am repeatedly asked to sign in and told "Call us overprotective", but I'm troubled by the fact that there is still a bug and there is no way to click out of this box to get help or to report the bug. (Sorry
 if I've offended anybody at Microsoft who insists on calling it a "feature"). I changed my password and signed back in and am still getting prompted to sign in again and again and again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not acceptable. I'm in a work environment on a production computer and losing valuable work time trying to resolve this Microsoft bug.</p>

            Hi, Michael,
<br />there are no safe tools to repair registry. Seems you already have some potentially unwanted program in your PC.
<br />You may fid error code in Event viewer. And you may use third-party tools to analyze dump files trying to find a guilty.

<h2>            Facebook Chat not connecting</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 810. This is a problem that I have been able to fix in the past by simply deleting and re adding a facebook account. I was having a regular conversation with the messenger app using Facebook chat, and then it just wouldn't connect anymore.
 It keeps displaying "Can't connect to chat right now, but we're trying." And whenever I try to check who is online, it would display "Can't connect to see who's online", even though I'm connected on Wifi. And that's not the problem. I can go to the actual
 Facebook website and be able to do everything there. So:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I am connected on Wifi, does the same on 4G</p>
<p>2) Facebook chat is enabled on -settings</p>
<p>3) I have tried removing and re adding the Facebook account</p>
<p>4) The Facebook contact was linked with Hotmail, and I have tried linking and unlinking both</p>
<p>5) I have turned on and off the phone -_-</p>
<p>6) I have logged off and logged back on Facebook</p>
<p>7) Chat Backup is enabled</p>
<p>8) Chat status is on Available</p>
<p>9) Microsoft has permission from Facebook to manage my messages</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I please have some help here?</p>

 Once I reset it I remembered that my LIVE account name that I had used was an alias to the normal account. meaning if you have a live account hooked up with ur alias name instead of the main name the chat will NOT work. Example My live account was something
 weird like *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (not a real account) I had changed it to an alias so I could remember how to log in even tho I changed it I could still log into my xbox and online but for some reason
 the phone wont take the alias. Hope this helps some ppl like it did me.

    <title>Problem opening Word 2013 document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j davidowen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem opening Word 2013 document</h2>
                    I have a very strange problem with Word (Office 2013 version).&nbsp; I can create new documents and re-open any previously saved document by opening the program and selecting the document I wish to re-open.&nbsp; Any new document I have created and saved, however,
 cannot be re-opened by clicking on the documents itself.&nbsp; When I attempt to do so I receive the following message - "<i><b>This file was created by a newer version of Microsoft Word.&nbsp; Do you want to download a compatibility pack so that you can work with this
 file?</b></i>"&nbsp; What's happening - and how can it be corrected?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            PROBLEM RESOLVED!&nbsp; I hope my solution is not worse than the problem itself.&nbsp; Although I only have the 2013 version of "Word" in my computer, I decided to check out the "Wordview" program in which the error message appeared.&nbsp; Somehow during my new SSD Boot
 Drive installation (and related program and data transfers), a copy of the 2011 version of "Wordview" got buried with my documents on the Data Drive.&nbsp; Unless I installed it some months ago to solve a compatibility problem, I have no idea where it came from
 (my previous version of Word was 2007).&nbsp; Anyway, I temporarily renamed the Wordview.exe file to see what would happen.&nbsp; Then when I clicked on one of my new documents that previously wouldn't open, an error window appeared saying that the program was no longer
 available, and allowed me to select my new version of Word to always open such documents.&nbsp; Now, document created in Word 2007 as well as newly created documents all open as they should.<br />

            Same here, following the update neither of the two NAS's are shown in the Computer Sections, Mapped Drives not available. Both NAS's can be seen as Storage Devices as well as Media Devices and their respective admin panels can be access through a browser.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1832527-283b-4458-ac0f-2903ca305a52" />

    <title>Issues with USB Synching HTC Mogul &#40;Sprint&#41; and Windows 7 Beta - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with USB Synching HTC Mogul &#40;Sprint&#41; and Windows 7 Beta</h2>
                    
<p>I'm attempting to synch my HTC Mogul (Windows Mobile 6.1)&nbsp;with my Windows 7 Beta - it can connect&nbsp;to my Vista desktop, so I know the HTC Mogul is ok in that respect.&nbsp; I've also tried two USB cables - they both worked with the Vista desktop.</p>
<p>A friend of mine is running the Windows 7 Beta and he's able to USB Synch with his HTC Mogul.</p>
<p>I was troubleshooting with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/synchronize/device-center-troubleshooting.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot Windows Mobile Device Center</a> under "Troubleshooting tips" &gt; "My device is not able to connect." &gt; Step
 4.</p>
<p>It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look under the "Network adapters" node for <b>"Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter"</b>. If this is
<b>not</b> present, skip to step 5. Otherwise, right-click "Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter" and choose to "Uninstall"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was no node for "Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter" under "Network adapters" so I skipped Step 5 and jumped to Step 6 which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disconnect and reconnect your device. Your device driver will re-install and Windows Mobile Device Center will launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue is that my device driver does not re-install.</p>
<p>In fact, I don't notice much changing when I plug the PDA Phone into my USB port - the screen brightens because it's getting power.&nbsp; Also, probably related to my installation of Junefabrics PDA Net, the item "Generic RNDIS" appears under "Other devices".&nbsp;
 I do hear the "Device connected" and "Device disconnected" sounds when I plug and unplug the device from the computer.</p>
<p>Anyone have suggestions on how to establish a synch with my laptop in this situation?</p>

</p>
<p>I unchecked "Enable advanced network functionality" as described.&nbsp; This allowed me to establish a USB connection and install the device drivers as described in the troubleshooting process I initially mentioned.<br />
</p>
<div><span>Linley Meslier said:</span>
<p>I tend to believe that Bleak morn needs to uninstall the "generic RDNIS" driver and re-install by pointing to c:\Windows\Windows Mobile\drivers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I wasn't able to find the path mentioned above, but I ultimately ran c:\Windows\WindowsMobile\setup.exe (after rebooting following the device driver installation).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After this, the Widnows Mobile Device Center appeared and I was able to configure my device as well as connect via the PDA Net client.<br />

</p><p>Are just the notification/ringtone for incoming calls not working with your laptop speakers? How about&nbsp;with an audio call? Can you hear the other person from your speakers? How about other applications? Have you played an audio/music on your speakers to

    <title>Excel 2011 window is too big to resize - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stacy.masiero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2011 window is too big to resize</h2>
                    Ok - I am fit to be tied. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't USE Excel because when I go to open the program, the window opens up so big that the bottom of the window is beyond the screen. The scroll bar across the bottom is not visible, neither is the resize corner. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course, this would be no problem for Windows to handle, since windows can be resized from all of the corners.. The upper two corners of Excel are accessible but the lower ones are not. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried everything. I have even tried opening Excel, saving a blank workbook, opening the blank workbook in Open Office, or even Numbers, then trying to open it back up in Excel, but nothing has worked.... &nbsp;what in the world is the problem here.??
 HELP!</div>

    <title>Glance&#47;Lock Screens Upside Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaykeneetit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Glance&#47;Lock Screens Upside Down</h2>
                    I have a Lumia 1520.3 and the screen got cracked.&nbsp; I had it replaced, but now the Glance and Lock screens are upside down when I wake up the phone.&nbsp; I did a hard reset, turned off the screen rotation lock, and have looked at every app to see if there were
 any orientation settings.&nbsp; I do not have the Remote Access app installed; there is nothing on the phone except what you get after a hard reset.&nbsp; ]The screen eventually flips to the correct orientation in a few seconds.&nbsp; However, when you finish a phone conversation,
 the screen is upside down.&nbsp; Weird thing is when you enter your access code.&nbsp; In the place the numbers "should" be (not in the upside area as they appear), the screen responds as if the image were correct.&nbsp; Any solutions?!&nbsp; I spent a TON of money getting this
 phone fixed and hate to toss it.

            <p>Hi Kay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like the screen was installed upside down, which doesn't even sound feasible. &nbsp;The connector for the screen is in the upper right side of the display, it should only go one way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no settings for forcing the orientation. &nbsp;It's only supposed to one work one way out of the box.&nbsp;Is there any warranty on the work that you had performed?</p>

            Hi Christopher. The screen was installed correctly; in fact, the repair shop went through three screens to be sure it wasn't faulty equipment. The image flips around to the proper orientation after a few seconds, but the glance screen is always upside
 down. Others have had this problem and it ended up being a software conflict or bug, but since I did hard reset, I can't figure out where the conflict lies. Thanks for your response!

            It looks like some apps have conflicts with the Glance screen. The Microsoft Remote Desktop or Movie Moments installed, the Glance Screen can rotate 180 degrees. &nbsp;If you have one of these apps, try removing it and then reboot the phone and see if it resolves
 the problem.

            <p>Same problem.&nbsp; I've tried soft reset and hard reset.&nbsp; Now, I'm going to try software recovery.&nbsp; BTW, I watched a video on replacing the 1520 screen and it doesn't appear that you can install it upside down.&nbsp; I was watching to see if there was some connector
 that could be connected backwards, but there doesn't appear to be.&nbsp; I uninstalled remote desktop and it didn't make a difference and I don't have movie moments installed.&nbsp; In order to use remote desktop, you have to connect to a computer, and mine wasn't connected
 to a computer.&nbsp; If you solved the problem, please let me know.&nbsp; I'll keep you posted.</p>

            I'm with you thetenor.&nbsp; I don't have any software installed that doesn't already come on board with a new phone.&nbsp; I'm going to open each app and take a look around.&nbsp; I wondered if the picture viewer might be a problem.&nbsp; It rotates every which way when
 viewing my photo galleries.&nbsp; I wish I could just go back to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I didn't have this problem until I got the first 8.1 update.&nbsp; Is there anyway to go back?&nbsp; Maybe the Windows 10 update will fix this problem.&nbsp; I have spent $450 getting two screens replaced,
 and I love this phone.&nbsp; But I'm thinking an iOS 6+ sounds pretty good right now.

            Hello Chris. The issue is that I don't have any of these installed on my phone. All I did was have my cracked screen replaced through a phone repair shop. Just like Kay mentioned above, the shop did it twice with 2 brand new screens as they thought there
 was an issue with the first one. It seems a hard reset isn't resolving it either.

            Software recovery didn't work. Does your unlock screen eventually right itself and when the unlock screen is inverted, can you still enter your code in the location the keypad should be? Mine works that way. Try nokiaviews.com, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. They
 have a video on YouTube showing the inverted glance screen when remote desktop is installed. I'm hoping they have a solution for this. Also, you may call www.palcocellphonerepair.com to see if they will kindly give you a solution. They are an authorized Microsoft
 cell phone repair facility.

            It sounds like we have the exact same problem. My screen will right itself after a few seconds. However, when the image is upside down, you still have to press the unlock code numbers in the position they would be in if they were in the normal position.
 It's particularly annoying when ending a call. The call end button is at the top of the screen, but you push the bottom of the screen to hang up. Crazy, man! I hope a software update is coming soon. Any way to downgrade to plain 8.1?

<p>I have business essentials and I would like to create a folder and send a link to outside emails, not people in my site, so that they can have full access without logging into a Microsoft account, is this possible? &nbsp; Basically just like one drive personal
 edition folder sharing functionality. &nbsp; I am trying essentials because I need a business email and could use the 1TB of storage it offers.
</p>
<p>Also is there a desktop app for business essentials that syncs one drive files ? &nbsp;Just like the personal version .

<p>Thank you</p>
