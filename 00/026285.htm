    <title>How to change the color of the insertion point in Microsoft Word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change the color of the insertion point in Microsoft Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Simply put, I changed my default Word page color to a dark color very close to black (RGB: 23, 23, 23).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the insertion point is still the same and shifts between white and black. It also still remains a constant black when I am typing out a continuous stream of words.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: Is it possible to change the colors themselves or invert the insertion point colors if the former isn't an option?</p>

            Dear MB77,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You have posted your question in Outlook.com forum, so I assume that you are using Outlook.com in browser and you have Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />If you are getting an error that says that folder ( or some of the folders ) have some kind of unauthorized symbol in name, that means that system found some symbol not appropriate and this causes conflict. In order to resolve this, please check all the folders manually, and when you will find a folder with some symbol, rename it <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/working-with-message-folders-in-outlook-com-6bb0723a-f39f-4a8d-bb3f-fab5dcc2510a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/workin...</a> and this error will stop to appear.
<br />
<br />Since it says from IMAP, probably origianlly this folder comes from connected account.
<br />
<br />If your problem is about something else, please describe it in more details. If you are getting error code, please share the screenshot.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your reply.       
        </p>

</p><p>One of my folders had a "+" in the name. I removed it. Hopefully, that will resolve this issue. &nbsp;I can recall when Outlook wouldn't allow users to have symbols in folder names.&nbsp;</p>

            Dear MB77,
<br />
<br />If you removed it, then those emails should stop, as they are triggered automatically by the system when it syncs with connected account. If there will be other symbols, you will receive another email, but you will know what to do.
<br />
<br />Let us know if there's anything else. If you don't have any more questions, feel free to choose a rating. Thanks!

<h2>            How do I forward attachments on Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I've been switched from Hotmail to Outlook.&nbsp; I can forward the text content of emails to others but if there are any attachments they are not included or can not be viewed by the recipients..

            <p>I am also having this problem, forwarding all attachments. All emails; all recipients. It only happens for forwarded messages/attachments. I am able to successfully send new attachments. It happens consistently whether I'm using my desktop windows7/IE9 or
 my Ipad. </p>
<p>Tried following your directions for account settings in Outlook; there is no options or "more options", just 'mail settings'. I have adjusted attachment option to "Always send files as attachments". And I can no longer switch back to Hotmail; that option
 has been removed.</p>
<p>Have changed to HTTPS, with no results.</p>
<p>I have had no response to requests for assistance&nbsp;from Microsoft or Outlook.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any help or suggestions. Downloading to reload all attachments is not a reasonable&nbsp;option. Was a happy Hotmail user since 2001; hope I don't have to change.</p>

<h2>            Get Lumia 640 help</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 640 phone that was under warranty when I started trying to get help and has now expired.&nbsp; It seems that I purchased the phone in the USA and it was a AT&amp;T phone.&nbsp; I live in Canada and registered the phone online.&nbsp; After a lot of problems with
 web sites, I finally found SBE-Ltd.ca that was suppose to repair my phone.&nbsp; I sent them the phone and went on holidays.&nbsp; I got back to find out they will not look at the phone as it is a AT&amp;T phone and sent it back to me.&nbsp; I was given Support.B2X.com but as
 the warranty has expired, I get no where on that site!&nbsp; The Microsoft help number 1.888.226.6542 does not seem to work.</p>
<p>The phone will not startup, and if it was a computer, I would say I needed to install a new operating system in to the computer.&nbsp; I would hope I could connect it to my computer, link to the phone's hard drive and re-install Microsoft Lumia operating system.&nbsp;
 Can you do that?</p>
<p>Just a few months ago, the Microsoft watch gave up, just days after the warranty period expired, so I do not want to spend much more money on Microsoft hardware as it is as reliable as DOS 4.0 was!</p>

<p>Hi Wayne, <br />
<br />
<br />
This may be a phone's software or hardware issue. To determine what causes it, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Windows version does your phone have?</li><li>Have you tried performing a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset</a></strong>?
 This will wake up your phone, and it won't lose any data on your device.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>I believe the trial period is 60 days from when it was installed and activated. To continue to use the product after the trial period you have to buy a key.</p>

I have not forgotten you. Just that this outlook.com is new to me as it is to you. I have to do a lot of toals and errors.</p>
<p>As to you problem....</p>
<p>You need to SIGN OUT from your outlook.com first. Click your name at top right and Sign Out option is there.</p>
<p>Once you are signed out, go to Google and look for Hotmail.com &gt; sign in with your hotmail.com address and password.</p>
<p>Are you&nbsp;back on hotmail now ?</p>

<div>the problem is: i have two addresses &amp;</div>
<div>i can only log in with the new one, and i can't log in with the old one (the basic one)</div>

<p>I see. Just to clarify, is this the Local Admin password? If yes, you're unfortunately unable to reset it. The only way that you can use the device again is to
<strong>reset the PC</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: If youâ€™re using Windows 10, version 1803, and added security questions to your local account to help you reset your password, select&nbsp;<strong>Reset password</strong>&nbsp;on the sign-in screen. (This link appears
 after you enter an incorrect password.)&nbsp;Then enter the answers to the security questions and&nbsp;choose a new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>:&nbsp;Following these steps will remove all of your data, programs, and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start your PC and select the&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the lock screen.</li><li>While holding down the&nbsp;<strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;key, select&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>On the&nbsp;<strong>Boot options</strong>&nbsp;menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Reset this PC</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Remove everything</strong>.</li><li>Your PC will restart and will reset itself.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi, Elisabeth.<br />
<br />
We'll be glad to help.<br />
<br />
Some minor glitches appear on some instances after updates, which can be easily rectified with an easy solution. For this instance, when a phone isn't responding to any command, a soft reset can solve the issue.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Can we use a video capture card for sharing content&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an AV Technician working on an upgrade plan for a community college presentation/lecture hall.&nbsp; Currently we're using a PolyCom codec based system for video conferencing but would like to move away from that and on to a PC-based conferencing system primarily
 using Skype for Business.&nbsp; Our plan is to have a dedicated PC at the back of the room with a Vaddio USB camera for video and a USB audio interface from our mixer for sound.&nbsp; We think this will all work out fine with SfB.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question revolves around external content.&nbsp; Often presenters will bring a laptop, which they operate from the stage, that will connect to the house projector via an HDMI video matrixing system.&nbsp; With PolyCom the codec has a "Content In" port which allows
 us to share whatever is projected with remote viewers.&nbsp; Would we be able to use some sort of video capture card to achieve the same result with Skye for Business?</p>

<p>Hi AV Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for post here. I have learned the following points from your description:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are going to have a dedicated PC for presenters at the back of the room.</li><li>You want to know when presenters use their own laptop, how to contact the presenters' laptop to the dedicate PC so that the presenter can use the dedicate PC and share contents via Skype for Business.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Is my understanding right? If so and your organization has enabled <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-a-skype-meeting-broadcast-c472c76b-21f1-4e4b-ab58-329a6c33757d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the Skype Meeting Broadcast feature</a>, then the answer is yes, you can use a video capture card for sharing content. For details, please kindly check if this article helps:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-skype-meeting-broadcast-for-tier-1-events-bf5b3ba8-f2b4-4600-b943-25ee71081b8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use

            I tried changing microsoft id&nbsp;password but it made no difference until I checked the date and time on the phone.&nbsp; The date had reset when the phone had crashed. I set the date correctly and then tried app store again.&nbsp;Instead of saying "Microsoft account
 services unavailable at the moment, try again....." it then prompted me to enter my password. I entered it and it now works fine. Strange but it worked.

            <p>In Windows 10, you need to pick a version.&nbsp; If you use Desktop mode, the Metro screen is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the setting in on the Properties dialog from the Taskbar.&nbsp; It has a Start Menu tab and a check box for using the Start Menu, what you have now.&nbsp; You should be able to uncheck that option, and Sign Out or reboot and be back to the Metro Start Screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I do not know how that behaves since I don't use that screen.</p>

<p>I like having 2 versions.&nbsp; I find the Apps more streamlined and simplistic, while the DT-programs are more full featured.&nbsp; Apps tend to run on less memory so it's great for tablets and devices with limited RAM.&nbsp;

<h2>            btinternet email account</h2>
                    I want to get my bt emails in Outlook, not through Microsoft Edge and BT page.&nbsp; Before April 2017, that's where my emails were, but no longer.&nbsp; I try to set up an account, but it tells me there already is an account. I try to do a manual set up, which
 gives me 5 options.&nbsp; Office 365, Outlook.com, Exchange, POP and IMAP.&nbsp; Whichever I click on, it states Getting things ready and then eventually states Something went wrong.&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Whilst this is happening a box also appears containing:&nbsp; Server:
 mail.btinternet.com&nbsp; User name (which is correct) and Password (also correct). I have the option to OK or cancel.&nbsp; It doesn't disappear, it keeps returning.

    <title>Task Duration Calculation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fraserkrayenhoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Duration Calculation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to schedule a project where each task has a fixed quantity and a&nbsp;rate assigned to it that will determine the duration.&nbsp; For example:
<em>Task A requires 100 units to complete.&nbsp; Resource B completes&nbsp;20 units per day.&nbsp; Duration therefore automatically calculated to be 5 days.<br />
<br />
</em>Is this possible in project?&nbsp; I am admittedly confused by the Resource terminology.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>The term, Units, in Microsoft Project tells the software whether the resource will work full-time or part-time on the task.&nbsp; If you enter a Units value of 100%, this means the resource will work full-time, or an average of 8 hours per day on the task.&nbsp; If
 you enter a Units value of 50%, this means the resource will work half-time, or an average of 4 hours per day on the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Project uses the Units value as part of what I refer to as the Duration Equation, where the Duration is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">Duration = Work/(Hours Per Day x Units)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: left">The default Hours Per Day value in each project is 8 hours, so if you&nbsp;enter a Units value of 100% and 40 hours of Work for a resource, Microsoft Project will calculate a Duration of 5 days.&nbsp; If you enter a Units value of 50% and 40
 hours of Work for a resource, Microsoft Project will calculate a Duration of 10 days.&nbsp; Does that make sense?</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">What Microsoft Project does not calculate is what you cite as an example in your original post.&nbsp; We need to produce 100 widgets and a resource can create 20 widgets per day.&nbsp; The software has no built-in mechanism to make that kind
 of calculation.&nbsp; That is something you would need to manually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">

                    <p>Hello,</p>

 there anyway I can recover the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is a word issue or document issue (i currently don't have access to the computer in which this issue got created)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Do they print or show up in print preview?
<br />If not you likely have run into the non-printing formatting characters that many
<br /> of us like to have turned on so we can see what is really happening in our documents. It makes them look very messy, though!
<br />
<br />Try pressing Ctrl+Shift+8 (Ctrl+*). Does that help?
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<h2>            Not requesting password - outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have outlook 2016 running on my home PC. It's hooked up to my hotmail account and running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I startup Outlook it doesn't prompt me for my password (i.e. my hotmail password). It always used to but stopped following the install of the latest connector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the prompt back? i.e. I want the password box to appear each time I startup Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-a-password-to-help-protect-your-outlook-information-e8cbb416-256b-4a39-8633-303bf3c70b08</p>
<p>
</p><p>...but this doesn't work. When clicking on the hotmail account I can't prompt for a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can someone give me a definitive link to the car kit software updater? Looking on the support site I canâ€™t find anywhere to download it.&nbsp; Also looking through these forums people have put&nbsp;links like
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ck-200/car-kit-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are different updaters for different versions mine is the CK-200.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia sites, accross a number of countries, all draw blanks. &nbsp;Googling "car kit software" updater has results but they all lead nowhere. &nbsp;It's as if all the copies on the internet have been deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia support in Australia has been a frustrating and unfruitful exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All help greatly appreciated :-)</p>
