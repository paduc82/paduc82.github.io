            <p>What probably happened was that you changed operating systems and did not 'deactivate' your previous copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to http://office.microsoft.com and log onto your account and on the main page, click on the "INSTALL" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will display all of your computers that have an active installation of Office 365.&nbsp; You may notice that you have an active installation on your tablet.&nbsp; Deactivate it and wait a few moments and then launch your installed version of Office 365 and see
 if you can activate via log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not, stay on your account web page and uninstall the office suite you have installed on the tablet.&nbsp; THEN, on the web page, click "INSTALL" and install a new copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people switch machines or upgrade their operating system, they forget that the office suite (in most cases, not always) needs to be deactivated from the Office 365 web site.&nbsp; You are making a major change to the system and the suite picks that up.</p>

            <p>Contact Microsoft Technical Support - let them know what region you are in and see if they will check the servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, they are going to ask if you installed all updates.&nbsp; Also, open the Store and on your account icon, click on that and click on "Downloads" and "Check for Updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the Metro UI apps will have updates and they choke off the bandwidth even if you are on high speed Internet.&nbsp; I did that on mine and hade about 14 apps needing updates (they come across automatically).&nbsp; When that is finished, try activating again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, uninstall your installation of Office, go back to your Office account page, deactivate (again), wait a few minutes, and then click install to re-download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still thinking the problem is the server side because everybody sees that every now and then and sometimes, even this forum will not load and also OneDrive.com will not load either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has server capacity but do not have bandwidth to handle global data streams like they think they do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do what you are doing 5 times at one point and then it worked like nothing happened.&nbsp; Now, I currently have changed that by clicking the "Installation Options" instead of INSTALL and then go to "Advanced Installation Options" and downloaded Office
 2016 64-bit Preview instead.&nbsp; It does count on your account because that will be the next office suite coming out very, very soon (and it is fully functional).&nbsp; Microsoft also added the Mobile apps in the Windows 10 store (Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, and PowerPoint
 Mobile).&nbsp; They are finalized and work as well (only in Windows 10).&nbsp; You can use those as an alternative until the main suite gets its act together and activates.</p>

            I'm seeing the same issue. Installed 2016 on 10240 yesterday after I had to so a system refresh and whilst it shows correctly online (i.e. if I deactivate online, open it and add credentials it is assigned to my licence) it will not then activate in the
 system.&nbsp;

            <p>Okay, if no machine was assigned to the download, you click the install option from the web site (make sure no installation of the program is on the machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the downloader appears, tell it to RUN not SAVE and a small panel will appear and then you close the web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation is complete, open Word, and at that time, it should automatically activate for that machine (it does it by itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the normal installation of Office 365 (including the preview version of 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove the installation from your machine and then go back to the web site and deactivate the installation for that machine.&nbsp; Wait a few minutes and then follow the above steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a new machine with Office 365 already installed on it, all you have to do is activate it when launching Office 365 and it will add that count to your office account "by itself".&nbsp; You do nothing - just activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people forget to deactivate the copy listed on the web site - that is usually the largest problem with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done it about 20 times now and have never had an issue other than the Office 365 web site would go off line and you can't activate until later.&nbsp; That could also be an issue you may see as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep trying, it does work.</p>

            I am in Las Vegas (NV) and have been getting this same activation error for 5 days and now I can no longer use all the features of my Office 365 because it thinks it is unlicensed. I have tried all of these steps and continue to get the same warning and
 it will not let me activate by phone, only internet.

<p>
</p><p>The problem you are having should not happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get minimal use of Office files at the OneDrive.com web site.&nbsp; The web version of Microsoft Office is there but not full featured.&nbsp; That can be used in a crunch if you cannot get your installed suite to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you need to do is ensure your files are on OneDrive.com and from there, just right click on the file from the web browser and tell it to "Open with Word (Excel, or PowerPoint) Online.&nbsp; You will have the capability of creating a PDF file and also be able
 to print to a local printer.</p>

<h2>            What is AnonymizerGadget&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see I have a program in my computer called AnonymizerGadget, its a virus removal program, and have read about it telling me it will generate pop ups with my internet explorer. The Publisher of AnonymizerGadget is Jetico Lim. My question is should I uninstall
 it? If so, what steps should I take?</p>

    <title>OneNote Critical Error Recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n campbell  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Critical Error Recovery</h2>
                    
<p><span>I installed Office 2010 on top of a very new Windows 7 64bit installation.&nbsp; Everything worked fine until I tried to open a notebook that I'd archived in another directory.&nbsp; OneNote asked if I'd like to share this notebook on live.office&nbsp;
 I said yes.&nbsp; Ever since then I have gotten&nbsp; the Critical Error recovery and asked to either start normally, clear cache or delete settings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried all three options and it still will not start.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried removing OneNote via the installer and then adding it back in and it will not start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried repairing the office installation and it will not start.</span></p>
<p><span>I </span>have tried uninstalling all of Office 2010 and then installing and One Note still will not start.</p>
<p>I've seen similar problems with no satisfactory solution.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>"You can uninstall the Microsoft Office system by going to the appropriate "<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/KB/290301#FixItForMe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix it for me</a></span>" section that matches your version of Microsoft Office."</p>
<p>The FixIt tool seems to be for uninstall rather than install.&nbsp; Also this article doesn't state which keys are definitively Office 2010 registry keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I ran the FixIt tool but it only launched a console app that closed immediately and had no effect on my system.</p>

<h2>            Unable to publish to SharePoint Online From SharePoint Designer 2013</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to publish a List-based Custom Workflow from SharePoint Designer 2013 to my SharePoint Online site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my workflow for errors and there were none. &nbsp;Hitting publish in SharePoint Designer also returned no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss as to why this is happening as just a day or two ago I had published another SharePoint Custom Workflow using the same tool (SharePoint Designer 2013), to SharePoint Online (although it was to a different subsite).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My site collection settings have not changed, and workflows are enabled on all sites and subsites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, as I cannot figure this out.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Raymond,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try removing the SharePoint Designer 2013 caches and related credentials to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>1.Open your SharePoint Designer 2013&gt;<strong>Account</strong>&gt;Under
<strong>User Information</strong>, click<strong> Sign out</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2.You may try clearing all the Windows credentials related to your Office 365 work or school account . To do that:Windows+ R&gt; Input the
 following command and press<strong> Enter</strong>.&gt;Remove the credentials.(e.g.
<strong>MicrosoftOffice15_Data:xxx </strong>or<strong> MicrosoftOffice16_Data:xxx)</strong><br />
<strong><em>rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>3.Close the<span>&nbsp;
</span>SharePoint Designer 2013 if it is in use.&gt;Right click the Start icon on the lower-left corner of the PC&gt;Select Run&gt; Input the following paths and click OK&gt; Remove the all the files in the locations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WebsiteCache</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Web Server Extensions\Cache</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>4.Open the SharePoint Online list again in the browser&gt;<strong>LIST&gt;Workflow Settings</strong>&gt;<strong>Create a Workflow in SharePoint
 Designer</strong> and publish it to check the outcome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6364bf9d-f8a1-4995-bf2a-93287ebfc66d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6364bf9d-f8a1-4995-bf2a-93287ebfc66d" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that couldn't help , I'd like to collect the following information to clarify the scenario.</span></p>
<p><span>1.Confirm whether the issue happens to a specific list or all the lists in the SharePoint Online site.</span></p>
<p><span>2.When clicking Publish button in SharePoint Designer, does any message pop up?</span></p>
<p><span>3.For "I am unable to publish a List-based Custom Workflow", please share any screenshot of the issue symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please share updates when you have time.<br />

    <title>Disable application close button X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc_56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable application close button X</h2>
                    <p>I want to disable close button of workbook and allow closure through macro. I have tried several methods including the simplest of all codes:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Cancel = True</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Cancel = True</span><br />
<span>End Sub</span></span></p>
<span>End Sub</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It works once but second time I click on the close button, it asks standard question (Save, Don't Save, Cancel).</p>
<p>I have another question: When I close through Macro, will&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean) not interfere?</span><br />
</p>
<p>Simplified version of Macro for closing workbook is :<br />
</p>
<p>Sub myClose()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; .....</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; .......</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; .......</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Save<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.Quit<br />
End Sub<br />

    <title>Excel 2010 pivot table manual filter - selections changed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisawl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 pivot table manual filter - selections changed</h2>
                    <p>We build spreadsheets with pivot tables in them referencing an OLAP cube&nbsp;as the data source. We use manual filters to choose several GL acount numbers. When we are done we save the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>We have reopened several spreadsheets from a couple months ago to over a year ago and when we look at the pivot table the<strong>
</strong>filter selections (check boxes) are pointing to different accounts than they were when we created them. How can we retain the original selections so that we can easily pull up the spreadsheet and refresh to just pull in the latest data for the selected
 GL accounts? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>We finally found the issue. Excel correctly uses the "key" dimension column value when generating the MDX for a cube query. Most dimension columns have the same column defined for "key" value and "name" value in the cube. For example, in the GL Account Dimension,
 Account Num column uses the same value for "key" and "name", so the MDX will always correctly use the Account Number value in the query.
</p>
<p>For one column in each dimension, we used different values for "key" and "name". This was done intentionally to combine the key column and another popularly used column in order to limit the number of dimension attributes (saves processing time). For example,
 the "Account Num - Name" was defined with GlAccountKey as the key value, and "Account Num - Name" as the "name" value. The "key" is a generic ID which is refreshed every weekend when we do a full refresh of our data warehouse. If a new account was added, or
 an account was deleted that week, the key value would change. Thus, when you brought up your spreadsheet with a key value selected, a different "Account Num - Name" would be selected.
</p>
<p>To fix, we will no longer combine the real dimension key column with another popular column in the dimension. We will change each dimension so that the "key" and "name" columns always match, or at the very least not use the generic key column. This will
 ensure that the Excel selections do not change since the MDX will refer to the correct values and not a generic key.</p>

<p>You can't in Android.</p>
<p>Of course the question is, why do you need to BCC when you already get a copy of the outbound email in your Sent Items? Seems like useless duplication.</p>

<p>The reason for this A.User is some 3rd party tools like Hubspot don't have integrations to outlook for mobile.&nbsp; You can bcc your&nbsp;id email in HubSpot and the email is then tracked in Hubspot&nbsp;CRM.&nbsp; Auto Bcc is a pretty basic requirement</p>

    <title>Office 365 Access can no longer email a report. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malcolm weller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Access can no longer email a report.</h2>
                    <p>Since Office 365 was updated recently (Aug-2018) the [Email]&nbsp;button on the Print Preview Ribbon has stopped working.</p>
<p>Version information: About &gt; Microsoft Access 2016 MSO (16.0.10325.20082) 32-bit<br />
To reproduce the error: Open a Report, Hit the [Email] button on the Print Preview Ribbon. Instead of the report opening in Outlook, the following dialogue appears; "Microsoft Access can't open the mail session. Check your mail application to make sure that
 it's working properly."</p>
<p>This fault appears to have been introduced by the latest software update.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mal.</p>

            Hello Malcom,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor wiling to help.
<br />
<br />The email app is actually sending and receiving emails.?
<br />
<br />I would suggest to you performance an office repair, before you have to check and install the operative systems and office updates.
<br />
<br />Repair steps:
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the quick repair. This will take a few minutes.
<br />If this doesn’t work try the online repair.
<br />Go to the control panel &gt; open programs and features &gt; click office &gt; click change &gt; and try the online repair. This can take around 10 minutes or more.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this worked for you.
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

<p>Hi Liliana,</p>
<p>Yes, Outlook was configured. Everything was working before. It feels like it was the Office 365 update that changed things (see Karl's reply above) and stopped the email button from working.</p>

<p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>I just heard back from my colleague. Apparently it was Office 2016 not Office 365 but he "used Windows's System Restore to wind the PC back a month, and that took me from Access 1807 to 1806.&nbsp; Importantly, sending reports as PDF by email now works". He has
 turned off Office updates to keep it working.</p>
<p>So it seems that the problem and fix you pointed to works for Office 2016 as well as 365.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Malcolm.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade for nokia lumia 1320</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>Why is windows 10 not available for download for nokia lumia 1320 , the phone has the capability of running windows 10 as i did install the insider preview app, but the phone is not included in the list of phones that are eligible for windows 10 ? will this
 always be the case ? i find it some what a real let down as i was looking forward to installing the release of windows 10 onto my lumia 1320&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can you give me an update of when you expect this release date &nbsp;? as i have been reading other questions from other lumia 1320 owners and there were replies saying that the reason for the update not been available for the lumia 1320 was because the phones
 hardware would not be powerful enough to run windows 10, which i can't find to be true i say this because i did download the insider preview app and it worked fine , why can't the update be released to all phones at the same time ?</p>

            I think Microsoft have completely messed up this upgrade and availability since day one. People have gone out and bought handsets thinking they would be able to upgrade to Win 10 . How does MS think it is going to stay ahead of the game with this poor
 service. No wonder people are moving over to Android devices . Very poor customer support, imagine Iphone users being treated like this.

<h2>            Office Professional 2013 Can&#39;t connect to server to register&#47;activate, runs in protected mode</h2>
                    I installed Office Professional 2013 a couple weeks ago and it has had trouble "connecting to the server" since the beginning. &nbsp;I was not able to register or activate it because every time I try to I get an error "Sorry we are having some temporary server
 issues." I think there is some problem with the cloud situation? &nbsp;Now all of my office programs open in protected mode and I can barely do anything in the programs. &nbsp;I've tried uninstalling and re-installing and that didn't help. &nbsp;What should I do? &nbsp;I have
 Windows 7 OS.

    <title>Cannot create an asset library in SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan ghitis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot create an asset library in SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>Newbie alert: I'm new to SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 3 sales people making customer visits and each one of them has a laptop with his own video library (to show our different solutions to customers). This creates redundant work in updating their libraries (and at least one of them is always 'missing
 out' on the newest videos).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a very simple SharePoint site that will hold the videos our company uses so that each representative will be able to add to the video list and access it when visiting customers (they always have an internet connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm the administrator of the organization's Office365 accounts and also the administrator for any app (including SharePoint), so I have all the imaginable permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into sharepoint, create a new site, try adding an app (that's how I read you create 'Asset Libraries' that are used to hold videos).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that "Asset Library" doesn't appear in my app list (I searched for it and really looked everywhere. I only found asset libraries in the SharePoint store, but I understand this should be a basic feature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me find the missing 'asset library' app?</p>

<p>The first question you should be asked is what file types are the videos? For most common file extensions (avi, mp4 etc) you are better off avoiding the asset library and just using a document library. The asset library&nbsp; adds the video content type to video
 files which has been proven to be dysfunctional and cause videos not to play. Modern browsers have a built in player so play raw video files fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most experts agree Msft has done a very poor job with video content so I'd advise against using their proprietary solutions like 365 Video and Stream and just use SP for what's it good at: storing files.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Sometime between yesterday &amp; today, my Windows 10 Defender suddenly has decided to (detect viruses &amp; delete" ALL of my downloads! It looks like some kind of Defender Definition updated overnight but I can't find it in my list of updates that can be uninstalled.
 &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can no longer download ANY files through my Gmail Account (jpgs/pdfs/pngs/zip files). I uninstalled Google Chrome thinking that was the issue &amp; tried to reinstall it but now it even deletes the exe file before I can install it!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked everywhere for a solution. Turning off Real-Time Defender doesn't work. I also changed the scan security thing from 3 to 1 &amp; it did nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEED to be able to download programs &amp; files on a daily basis for my work &amp; whatever happened in the past 24 hours has rendered my system completely useless!&nbsp; PLEASE help or fix this bug asap! Thank you!</p>

            Hi Jeep
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience this is causing.
<br />
<br />To isolate the problem...
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Open App &amp; browser control
<br />Set 'Check apps &amp; files' to off 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try downloading again to see if your download are still being deleted.

            Hi  Jeepgirlsauni 
<br />
<br />Microsoft is now publishing the Windows 10 1809 update to all computers world wide. Could you try upgrading to that release to see if it resolves the current issue?
<br />
<br />You can also try upgrading manually:

<p>I will try that today! I have a job due to press (I do graphics) so I need my computer freed up to be able to do that but as soon as it's set, I'll update to 1809 &amp; try it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also going to re-scan my system to make sure no viruses are hiding someplace. I only download things from trusted sources...well....I USED to download from trusted sources until yesterday hahaha</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for offering me advice! I'm not in a position to buy a new system &amp; this is computer is my livelihood so I'm in a bit of a panic
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll check back in once I update!&nbsp;</p>

<p>ok so....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a full system scan &amp; there were zero threats or viruses found in 950,000 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried repeatedly to download the latest version (1809) of the Windows OS but when I do the "check for updates" it doesn't show up &amp; when I try to download it from the internet, I get the same "virus detected, file deleted" message &amp; it's nowhere to
 be found, not even in the quarantine area of my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also still cannot download anything from Gmail like zipped files, jpgs, pngs, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? Is my computer just screwed?</p>
<p>

            Hi Sauni,
<br />
<br />Thanks for the update. Here is what I recommend you do.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />Look through the list for any entries for suspicious software installed
<br />Select it then click uninstall
<br />
<br />Reset all your web browsers to their original factors state
<br />
<br />In Microsoft Edge - Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; Microsoft Edge
<br />Select it, click Advanced options &gt; Reset
<br />
<br />Reset Chrome settings to default - Google Chrome Help
<br /><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3296214?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/329621...</a>

<br />
<br />Also use ESET Sysrescue offline scanner to scan and clean the computer, see instructions in the following article:

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to minimize OneNote to system tray so that we can keep it open at all time without waste of space? And also.. is there a way to open Outlook in one-click (rather than double click) when its minimized to tray?</div>
<div><br />

            There's a tool called RBTray that I use. If you have it run on startup, you can right click the minimise button on ANY program and it will minimise it to the system tray. The only drawback I've found is that the process is ID'd as RBTray, so you can't
 have it remember your view settings on the system tray per program you have used it on, and sometimes it goes to the hidden list.

            <p>Looks like MS doesnt want anyone to make OneNote too useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every great tool has some weirdness to it, like some apps on smartphones that refuse to close, skype needs many button hits to close, OneNote readily closes and is s-l-o-w to open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it too much to ask for it to be minimized to tray ??</p>

<p>Click the Display at left side</p>
<p>Place OneNote Icon in the Notification Area of the Task Bar -&gt; Checked</p>
<p>Click OK and close the Options Screen.</p>
<p>Now when ever you done with OneNote, click X to close the OneNote.</p>
<p>You can get it back by right clicking the System Tray and Open OneNote.</p>
<p>Simple.&nbsp; Now it works like EverNote.</p>

<p>it RESTARTS, not "wake up from sleep" :)</p>
<p>after click X to close OneNote, it doesn't sync with server,&nbsp;</p>
<p>we love it to work like Evernote, start, stay synced, wait for a call, stand up and work, then fade back and sleep wait for a new call&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Distorted sound in audio recordings in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lotsawa---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distorted sound in audio recordings in OneNote</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, just got my Lumia 800. I noticed that the sound quality of recordings in OneNote is very, very bad, totally distorted, as if recording level is much too high. Disappointing, because otherwise it would be a very helpful function to record directly
 from within OneNote. But like this it is of no use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the app "Audio Recorder" and the sound quality is great!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is strange. Is there any way to adjust the recording level in OneNote?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone of you tried this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and have fun,</p>
<p>Christof</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Single Language edition of Windows 8.1 is only available pre-installed from the computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did not create a Backup before installing Windows 10 you will need to contact the computer manufacturer and obtain a Recovery Disk.</p>

<h2>            Delete a Onenote Notebook on Onedrive when only a URL is available</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>After saving a OneNote notebook on our company OneDrive it creates a URL file there instead with a link to the xxx.SharePoint.com server. We now want to delete that file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we delete the file on the xxx.sharepoint.com server?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is is it enough to just delete the URL file in order to trash all the data associated with the OneNote Notebook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your posting in our forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we saved a local notebook to OneDrive for Business or SharePoint site via
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Move-a-OneNote-notebook-to-OneDrive-0af0a141-0bdf-49ab-9e50-45dbcca44082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the method in this support article</a>, it will display as a *.one type file in<span>&nbsp;
</span>browser. But it will display as an URL(Internet shortcut) when it is synced to locally in OneDrive sync folder. This is an expected behavior. If you want to delete the notebook, please go to your OneDrive for Business in browser, select that notebook
 and click Delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>First of all I am posting here because I am having a hard time finding a way to submit feedback to the windows 10 preview.&nbsp; It should be much easier to find and give feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got the latest build on Tuesday and so much is now broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lost my hyper-v and VMs.&nbsp; Tried to reinstall Hyper-V but it fails every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are things like control panel missing from the start button.&nbsp; I do not want to search for everything I need to use.&nbsp; Less actions not more.&nbsp; Looks like I will have to use another 3rd party start button app again like I did for windows 8.</p>
<p>
