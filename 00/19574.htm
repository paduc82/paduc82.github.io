<h2>            Outlook 2016 Mac no attachments when forwarding message</h2>
                    <p>We got a really annoying issue here with Outlook 2016 Mac 16.9. Every time i forward a message, all the attachments disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i drag the mail to my desktop and open the mail in Apple Mail everything is fine, but this is not a solution for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried with older version of Outlook 2016, with the same result. &nbsp;Outlook 2011 works fine, but has other issues, and is no longer supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone has a work around for this issue, or any solution?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<p>Antivirus can alter the content of the email and affect how the attachments are displayed (and Mail could be better&nbsp;equipped to deal with it), so I wouldn't dismiss this possibility just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now… Outlook has has its share of bugs too, so I can't exclude a bug in Outlook, but then, I'm not sure why the issue wouldn't be more widespread and reported all over the forums, which is why it makes more sense to me to focus on what could be happening
 outside of Outlook itself and affecting the way the content of the messages are displayed.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>Truth be told, they didn’t make scheduling a scan more difficult in Windows 8/8.1/10 – they made it completely unnecessary.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows Defender Scheduled Scan task (a Quick Scan) is now run daily by Automatic Maintenance.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The scheduling options have disappeared from the Defender interface because the scheduled scan no longer requires any kind of setup at all – it just runs automatically like the definition updates.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On most systems, the Automatic Maintenance scan runs with near perfect reliability – which is a far cry from the MSE scheduled scan, which just sits there and refuses to run indefinitely if the PC isn’t on and awake at the scheduled time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, the Automatic Maintenance scan only runs when the PC is idle, so you don’t have to settle for half of the system’s resources while&nbsp;your scheduled scan is running (like you do with MSE at the default CPU setting).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You get the full power of your PC every time you start using it – because Automatic Maintenance immediately halts the scan and waits for you to take a break before&nbsp;restarting it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>So the procedure that we’re discussing here isn’t something that’s required in order to get a “scheduled” scan in Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That happens automatically. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What we’re talking about is scheduling a redundant Quick Scan that runs with normal priority and starts precisely at the specified time (or scheduling a Full Scan).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That’s completely optional. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A scan scheduled with the </span><em><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></em><span> provides</span><span>&nbsp;us with the full Task Scheduler option-set, so I’ve been recommending it as a replacement for the onboard MSE scheduled scan from the get-go.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>It starts precisely on time</span></li><li><span>It runs at full speed</span></li><li><span>It can wake the computer to run the scan, or run the scan at next startup, for real reliability</span></li><li><span>It can keep the PC awake for the entire duration of an unattended Full Scan</span></li><li><span>It provides the option to shut the PC down at the end of the scan</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/running-mse-full-scan-as-a-scheduled-task/f627f5ce-0b74-4b1d-be64-d6ceeb4d9b02"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/running-mse-full-scan-as-a-scheduled-task/f627f5ce-0b74-4b1d-be64-d6ceeb4d9b02</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In short, the scheduled scan that you set up with the </span><em><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></em><span> fixes everything that’s wrong with the MSE scheduled scan – and it likewise provides for a full-featured Windows Defender scheduled scan.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most people who&nbsp;claim that&nbsp;the </span><em><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></em><span> is too “difficult” are just repeating the mantra, and have never actually tried it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The </span><em><span>Create Basic Task Wizard</span></em><span> is a highly-simplified
</span><em><span>walkthrough</span></em><span> for setting up a scheduled task – designed especially for novice Windows users.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But if you want something over and above the Automatic Maintenance scheduled scan – and you’re overwhelmed at the very thought of setting up a scheduled task, then I think you should probably consider just replacing Windows Defender with one of the
 free alternatives. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Most of the competitors fare better in lab testing, and some of them have "extras" that might turn out to be useful. I haven’t really had time to investigate the way they handle scheduled scans, but my impression is that most of the third-party AV
 apps still handle this in the conventional way – with onboard scheduling options rather than with Automatic Maintenance.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So that might be the way to go.</span></p>

            <p>Hey RandyOuellette,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you allow the Fix It to disable the add-on that was causing the problem? If not, you may want to try allowing it to automatically make corrections when you run the Microsoft Fix It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An alternative solution would be to reset Internet Explorer's settings using the (different) Microsoft Fix It located in the link below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset Internet Explorer settings</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By resetting Internet Explorer's settings you will disable your third party add-ons as well as return to the default settings that Internet Explorer started with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

</p><p>Based on your description, I understand you want to change the whole background color for your Outlook Web App (https://outlook.office.com/owa/). Please note that we can just change the colors on the top and the letters by clicking Options -- Change Theme
 but not the whole background.</p>
<p><span>I understand it would be nice if we have this feature in the Outlook Web App. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback via &nbsp;the link below:</span></p>

<h2>            Office 2016 won&#39;t download on my PC</h2>
                    I've tried to download the Office 2016 I purchased with my new PC. I entered my Key Code and got to the page where I can click on "install." Once I click on that a window pops up on the bottom of my screen that asks me if I want to open, save, or cancel.
 I click save and then nothing happens. I expected to get another pop up that says to "run" the installation but nothing happens. When I go into the file that was saved it is a bunch of scrambled characters that do not make sense. The one sentence it does say
 is "cannot operate in DOS" or something to that affect. I'm not very computer savvy but I did follow all of the instructions and I'm not sure how to get this to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.&nbsp;

            The page I'm downloading from is the Microsoft office website under my account where it lists which products you have purchased. Next to Office 2016 it has a button that says "Install" when I click on it a pop up comes up on what to expect. It says to
 press save and then press run when it pops up. The problem I'm having is that "run" never comes up as an option. The file saves when I tell it to but it saves as a document that has symbols and no actual words in it. I'm not sure how to get it to actually
 install/download to my PC. I don't know if there's a problem with my settings or if I'm missing something obvious. I am set as the administrator so I don't understand why it's not allowing it to download.

<h3> michaelsperry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting more than one device and&#47;or location as trusted for Outlook.com</h2>
                    We have an Outlook.com account and use two PCs and a Galaxy Tab to access the account. We may be in the UK, USA, France or Australia when we try to access it. The PCs use W7 and W8.1. How can we set up the account to allow all these devices we own to have
 easy access no matter where in the world they may be (we do travel for holidays and visiting family members across the world)? We can't find any option in any settings page or dialog that will allow us to specify which devices and to remove any location restrictions.
 (We were unable to use it recently as it was unexpectedly blocked with no reason given and no access to the PCs at home!)<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(77, 77, 77, 1)">We have recently implemented a security update called Familiar location protection to keep our customers’ accounts secure. The message "You haven't signed in from this location recently." will occur if you are signing in from
 a location more than 300 miles from your normal location. The Microsoft account service will prompt you for an additional challenge to complete the log in. Codes can be the date of birth, or receiving a code sent to your SMS number or alternate email if configured.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent this you will need to&nbsp;configure&nbsp;your computer as your trusted PC and other security information for added protection to your account.&nbsp;
<strong>When you are logged into the below link you can also tell MS "do not prompt me on this device"&nbsp; (see snip).&nbsp; You can also set up 2 step verification by installing an app on you smart phone so that you can get a code where ever your phone works</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new system update, you can remove old inaccessible security information on your account automatically after 30 days. To do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log in to this<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Delete</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on the security information you do not have access to. (Alternate email, Trusted PC, Mobile number)</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select&nbsp; "<strong>No, I Don't have access</strong>" button. (The date on when the security information will be removed will appear )</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Delete Security Info</strong>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update the account with new Security Info.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Save</strong>.</p>

            <p>That is precisely the problem. We have THREE devices, not one, that we want to be 'trusted' by Outlook.com and they may be mobile (at least one is and we plan on another) so we could well be using it/them at locations far more than 300 miles from home -
 people do travel a lot you know! The challenge does not appear on the tablet device, only the message about access being blocked. The 'release' email is sent to the alternate previously set up and that would be at home - not where we are when travelling!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do we set up all three devices to be trusted? Where is the option found to set such devices as trusted? We do NOT use a 'smart phone' so that method is irrelevant.</p>

            <p>Firstly, we were not informed that such an application was needed as the Galaxy Tab was previously working properly without any additional software, Outlook.com just worked. Secondly, we have no intention of adding any applications that are not specific
 for use on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, so any additional Microsoft application would be rejected on that score alone.
</p>
<p>Why should we need an additional application now? It worked fine for a year without, it worked fine on all the PCs as well. It's only that the latest ill-considered change has caused unnecessary problems - and at a time when we really needed good access
 to emails as we are nearing the end of the process of selling and buying houses!</p>
<p>At a time when more and more cross-platform usage is the norm, it would be expected that the account should be easily accessible from any device in any location using the login and password known only to the user.

<p>Does the raw Autodiscover XML output for that user also contain the &lt;PublicFolderInformation&gt; section?</p>
<p>It should include the mountpount information (an SMTP-address).</p>

            We ended up convincing the client to move the public folders to a normal mailbox with a redirect. &nbsp;If MS are going to make public folder management so poor to try get people off it, so be it.

<p><span>When you say username, do you mean your full Windows Live ID? Note that the Windows Live domain name (live, hotmail, msn, etc.)&nbsp;should form part of the user name you're

<p><span>Please let us know how if you see any changes</span></p>

            Well I had this issue and it ended up being a push button from a website that I had copied a table from for my budget worksheets. I tried to delete the push button but I couldnt so I just copied all the data off that work sheet and created a new one and
 pasted it there and deleted the other worksheet and now it opens fine. Hope this helps someone else.

            I just ran into this same issue. To find the offending "buttons", open the Excel file and press F5. Click the Special button on the window that opens. Then select&nbsp;Objects... and click OK. This will highlight/select all of the objects on the worksheet.
 You can just press Delete to remove them all. Save the file and then try opening it on your tablet.

            Thanks bsarlo. This worked for me. You will need to do this for every page in your workbook.

<p>
Not really as such as a line can be part of a sentence or several short sentences, so there’s really no logic to define a line.</p>
<p>
However, if the insertion point is at the beginning or end of the line, then Shift+Home or Shift+End will select from the insertion point to the beginning or end of the line.</p>
<p>
If the insertion point is somewhere else in the line of text, Home, Shift+End will select the line too.</p>
<p>
But if you have to take your hand off the keyboard to move the cursor to the line of text with the mouse, you may as well click in the left margin to select it.</p>

    <title>Some websites won&#39;t load&#58; &#34;Internet Explorer cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulguglielmi1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some websites won&#39;t load&#58; &#34;Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This Question has been asked numerous times and has yet to be answered, i think the reason for the lack of an answer is the failure for posters to shut down the technical supporters endless copy-paste answers by ensuring them that everything they are about
 to say has been tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem, i am running a fresh install of windows 7 ultimate x64 and while using internet explorer 9, internet explorer 10, and internet explorer 11, a few (important to me) websites will not work. 3 days ago i had the -same exact- copy of windows
 installed for 5 years with no problems using ie10, after crashing my computer and installing windows 7 back onto my pc the first thing i did was run windows update, 3 restarts later and 2 internet explorer updates later (updated to&nbsp;ie11) the very next step
 i took, without configuring -any- type of internet options, was downloading a game i use on the computer, World of Warcraft. After installing the game i went to the website i have always used to install "addons" to this game. the website was curse.com. when
 attempting to access the webpage it took about 10 seconds to load the "internet explorer can't display this webpage". i assumed the site was down, after loading other programs i previously had on the computer i came across another website with the same error,
 i realized it was internet explorer or my computer, not the websites. after searching vigurously through microsoft answers i found many "solutions" that i attempted and none worked, the following solutions were attempted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>the obvious "diagnose connection problems" was the first thing i tried, could not find a solution running this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Edit: Sorry i forgot to mention that i tried compatability veiw as well, this was my 2nd step as i just clicked the compatability button in address bar, and then tried actually adding curse.com to the compatability list)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(edit again, sorry but i want to make sure anyone considering to answer this with another copy paste of obvious/suggested sollutions will refrain from doing so, i deleted browsing history with everything checked.. this was clearly not going to help but i
 wanted to make sure i wasn't asked to do something this obvious.. it didn't help..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>next step i attempted was&nbsp;checking internet options &gt;&nbsp;Connections &gt; Lan Settings &gt; made sure no proxy boxes were checked, i knew this ahead of time but figured i'd humor the solution, the only box that was checked was the automatic detection as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next step was to reset settings, i knew this would not work as i have not installed any programs that would change these settings, nor did i manually change anything, but yet again i humored the generic copy paste solution and reset advanced options, restarted,
 still no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next step, i used the troubleshooter solution, Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Troubleshooting\All Categories and to my surprise there was no "internet explorer performance" option, which was strange but i had assumed this would not work either anyways,
 i searched online to find a solution to this option missing and found no available information so i skipped this step. (edit: i figured out that the posters with this solution were just wording the option incorrectly, at least for my version of windows, i
 ran troubleshooting &gt; internet connections (not internet explorer performance) and had it try to diagnose problems using microsoft.net, and then manually entered
<a href="http://www.curse.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.curse.com</a> and it said troubleshooting was unable to identify the problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>next step i went to advanced options in internet options &gt;&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;and under security i checked the box (which was unchecked) enable protected mode, restarted, this did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next step, again, fresh install of windows 7 with just 1 program installed that did not come with windows, i knew this would not help BUT HUMORED THE GENERIC COPY PASTE SOLUTION AGAIN! i ran internet explorer without addons (no addons to have running installed
 anyways) obviously this did not allow me to load the webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my next step was to install firefox which i hate, to check if the webpages were working,&nbsp;though from reading other unresolved posts on this site about the same exact site (curse.com) not loading for some people, i assumed it would work. i was correct, i
 had no trouble loading the webpage, went back to ie11 and same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next step was to ensure there were no non-microsoft services running in the msconfig &gt; services tab, which there were but just 2 and they had nothing to do with internet connections (amd external events utility and MBAMservice and MBAMSchduler, which is
 my antivirus)&nbsp;but i disabled them anyways, restarted, still nothing, i then reenabled them as they were important to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next step i uninstalled windows 11 update from programs, restarted, loaded reccomended settings and checked the site again using ie10, still nothing, i uninstalled 10, restarted, loading ie9 this time not using reccomended settings just clicking the "Ask
 me later" button, loaded the page, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i went through every possible solution i could find as well as some editing of security options and advanced options to see if it changed anything which it didn't, out of desperation i attempted to roll back EVERYTHING to a fresh install and before updating
 ANYTHING i tried accessing the website with the default ie web browser that came with windows 7 (ie8 no updates or anything) the website still fails to load while most other sites do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if someone with actual knowledge of fixing problems that have to do with microsoft related software, and not just some&nbsp;person&nbsp;copy-pasting solutions that are clearly accesable to me (im on this webpage so to think i haven't gone through all solutions
 is just ignorant) it would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>The most important thing for me would be to refine this "will not work" symptom description.</p>
<p>

<p>A problem with that is the message can mean too many too different things.&nbsp; Try using the Developer Tools, Network Capture tool to find out what is going on when you go there.&nbsp; E.g. most likely there will be a redirect.&nbsp; If so any diagnostics you were doing
 for just the domain name (without a protocol prefix?) would be a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW as suspected there was a redirect to&nbsp; <a href="http://www.curse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.curse.com/</a>&nbsp; and after that there was a lot of ad related stuff, so if you are trying to block those in any way that could change your symptom too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that the site is slow loading, so if you aren't waiting long enough that&nbsp;might explain your symptom too.&nbsp; In that case you might also want to try using the UI Responsiveness tool.&nbsp; There is something strange going on at the 10s mark but I don't know
 enough about the tool to know what it implies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See this video to get an overview of the F12 tools.</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>FWIW the only time that I have seen this troubleshooter is on W8 Pro.&nbsp; In particular I never saw it on W7 HP.&nbsp; However, depending on what your symptom actually means I might agree with your assumption.&nbsp; E.g. when I tried to find out what the troubleshooter
 would do, hoping that we could use it as a replacement for&nbsp;our&nbsp; IE-rereg&nbsp; hack, it looked as if all it might be was a way of enforcing a full application of RIES.&nbsp; (Initially&nbsp;RIES did everything as soon as it was started; that's why we had to issue caveats
 about losing saved passwords--at least--but now there are prompts and defaults which may make RIES much less effective for anything that it was designed to do--which isn't really that much when it comes to repairing the browser functionality of the OS but&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that</span>
 I suspect has more to do with your symptom.)</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>next step i went to advanced options in internet options &gt;&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;and under security i checked the box (which was unchecked) enable protected mode, restarted, this did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Normally you would only see that if you were running in a Trusted Sites zone or using an elevated iexplore.exe (e.g. running as an administrator), so otherwise that might be a bit of a red flag about the possibility of malware being involved in your symptom
 scenario.</p>

<p>Quick points since this might be seen. The current used to charge a device is determined by the device, not the charger. You could charge off a 5v car battery if such a thing existed*. The current capacity of a charger is what it is designed to deliver,
 at most. If you try to charge a device that wants 1.5 or 2 amps with a 1 amp charger, the charger will in some cases get hot, and the duration of charge will certainly be longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some devices are able to determine if they are connected to a PC, .5A max output (500mA, at least on typical ports), and if they are connected to a wall charger. They may have the ability to draw more current on the latter to charge faster, and may get a
 bit warmer. In no situation should the device draw more current of any charger than the cable that came with it can support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5volts is important though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Think about lights in a car for example. Headlights and the little dash lights are both hooked to that big old battery that can supply enough current to crank over the engine when starting. The little lights don't pop, they just draw the current they need.</p>

<p>thanks Cjlim and Svenj for your replies</p>
<p>went on nokia support uk and chatted with ''an assistant''.....just lol :D</p>
<p>first I have asked him to tell me if my screen will have to suffer if I will make a habit in using the phone as a bed side clock on the dt 910.....he said there is no risk to worry about even if I have my doubts concerning long term use of the screen (dead
 pixels, burnouts, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>secondly I have asked him about the car charger.....he sent me to a nokia center nearby :D ....couldn't tell me anything :D this is ridiculous ....nokia can't tell you what would be a compatible charger among their own model lineup&nbsp;!? Just peachy...after
 this kind of information (or better said lack of it) imagine how confident am I about the first advice he gave me.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how can this be considered ''support''&nbsp; :D ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think will go with the 5V 2A spec and see how it goes....</p>

            As SvenJ said, a 5V 2A charger will be fine as long as the 5V is good.<br />
<br />
The 2 amp rating means that it is able to pump out 2 amps if the device connected to it *requires* that kind of current. If your device only needs 1A then the charger will simply be used below capacity. It won't suffer, nor will the phone.

<p>There is another thread on here specifically about Nokia Drive and car charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/10FB8468-08D8-40F0-888C-4ADD3AD16A0B">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Nokia-Lumia/Nokia-Drive-Beta-Nokia-Lumia-920-battery-issue/td-p/1608892</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results seem a bit spotty, but certainly is implied that a greater output capability does help. A decent car charger is certainly indicated. I haven't had the opportunity to take much more than 15-30 min trips, so I'm not much help as far as Navigation and
 charging. I can just comment in charger specs from a technical POV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will say that a processor working hard will produce heat, so if Nav taxes the processor as it surely will, you can expect the device to get warm. Charging of course produces heat as well, so charging at a higher rate, as demanded by the device will create
 a bit more warmth. Charging at a higher rate, whlie taxing the processor, would then generate even more heat. That situation would certainly have been a design consideration in the engineering. I personnaly would have faith that charging off a car charger,
 while playing video games, or navigating, would have been considered.</p>

            <p>Hi MOHANKUMAR06,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updates in the private message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What Spike has done to the sample is manually reentering and replacing some of the wrong backets. We have seen that the brackets are just incorrect when they were inputted into the file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to manually replace the wrong brackets in your document. Below are the quick steps you can verify if the inputted brackets are correct. (If it shows correctly here, it will be good after convertedto PDF.)</p>
<p>1. Open File tab &gt; Quick Access Toolbar &gt; find Reveal Formatting... in All Commands &gt; click "Add&gt;&gt;" &gt; OK.</p>
<p>2. Click the Reveal Formatting... icon in Quick Acess Toolbar on the top left corner of your Word window.</p>
<p>3. Check the display of brackets by selecting the whole words. </p>

                    Hello forum, I have following issue. I paid Sygic navigation from my phone (Lumia 650, Windows 10 latest update), it was working. Then the phone was physically destroyed so I bought new one (again Lumia 650). I logged in with my Microsoft account, I went
 to Store and tried to download Sygic, but I get error 0x8007000B "Something went wrong". In Store I can clearly see that I owe the application but I can't download it. Any ideas? I tried it 10+ times and no luck so far. Windows support didn't help&nbsp;neither
 Bx2 support. Please advice. Thank you

            Hi Dean475
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You need not forward the call. If you have logged in with same account id and password into Skype, the call will ring simultaneously on all devices. You can choose to accept the calls on your phone or any other device
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>.NAR file restore on Lumia 930 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            .NAR file restore on Lumia 930</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently done a hard reset on my Lumia 930. By doing so all photos were removed from the camera roll, so now I would like to restore it.
</p>
<p>By just dragging and dropping the photos from my OneDrive folder to the phone's Camera Roll folder all seems fine.
</p>
<p>However, Lumia Camera 5 and above use .NAR files for the Rich Capture features. The photos uploaded to OneDrive are converted to .jpg files and thus after adding these to my Camera Roll I can no longer use the Rich Capture enhancements. The Rich Capture
 button still appears due to the _Rich filename end, but pressing the button just terminates the program.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to restore the .NAR files? If not; Is it because there is no tool for it or because all information is lost by converting it to .jpg and it isn't saved anywhere else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Robbe</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: the OneDrive backup features can still be vastly improved: Not all settings back up, the photo problem (above), a lot of apps don't use the highscore and settings backup option, music is not backed up (although I think the Windows 10 Music app is going
 to solve this). </p>
<p>Just letting you know for future improvements. </p>

            <p>Hello RobbeB32,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the community regarding uploading NAR files to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately these files are not saved in the same format as you can see them on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend you to add your suggestion to official Windows phone suggestion page here:</p>
