</p><p>Skype consumer is ideal for home and smaller businesses of up to 20 employees. You can use it for free unless you want to buy credit or make calls to landlines and mobiles. In the Skype consumer, if you will initiate screen sharing
 while on a video call, the receivers will only see the shared screen, your video will resume as soon as you stop sharing your screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype consumer is different from the Skype for Business, and I'm afraid I can provide little details about Skype for Business as it's no longer our scope of support. However, you can check this article if you want to know more
 about screen sharing in Skype for Business: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-your-screen-in-Skype-for-Business-2d436dc9-d092-4ef1-83f1-dd9f7a7cd3fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share your screen in Skype for Business</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you're after a service that will provide your needs and is free of charge, I highly recommend to use the Skype consumer, but if it's the other way around, you can check&nbsp;Skype&nbsp;for Business. If that will be the case, it is
 best to contact their support for more details.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted to get onlone and it said I had to input my email and password for security reasons then after I did it didn't want to log on and gave me the error code&nbsp;800705b4 so after trying solutions on other forums on here I ejected my disk and tried it
 again then&nbsp;I got the error code 80151103 so i looked that one up and followed instructions on that forum&nbsp;I deleted my profile and cleared the cache in an attempt to fix it and now I still got that error code and it won't go away. What is the point of giving
 error codes if you don't know the exact cause or fix to them? It makes no sense.</p>

<p>Hi DEATHat,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue signing into Xbox Live... The first error code you provided is a general connection error which you seemed to have solved, and the second is an error loading your profile.</p>
<p>I see you've attempted the typical troubleshooting steps. However, as of the time of this post there is currently a
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">known issue for Time Warner Cable internet customers
</a>which is preventing some of these users from signing into Xbox Live. Please advise whether or not Time Warner is your internet provider, which may explain this issue.
</p>
<p>If this answer does not resolve your issue, please let us know to allow us to troubleshoot further.</p>
<p>Thank you! :)</p>

 been a few weeks since this has been happening and it’s incredibly annoying since the wifi is completely normal on other devives, just the PC. &nbsp;I’ve tried updating drivers, which said it was at the latest update, resetting network adapters, and moving the
 computer even though the spot it is at is the strongest signal possible. &nbsp;Everytime I connect it shows 2-1 bars of connection and sometimes gives no internet. However while not connected it shows that the wifi is full bars. &nbsp;Help?

            Hi Salty.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17****&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, Salty,
<br />
<br />1. is wifi embedded in the Motherboard? It won't get a strong signal like the laptop does. 
<br />If pc is next to a wall, move it. The wall will block signal.
<br />Metal case may interfere if it's in the back of the unit.
<br />
<br />2. Go to Power Options in Control Panel
<br />Select your Power Plan
<br />Click Advanced Settings
<br />Select Edit Settings
<br />Select Change Advanced Power Settings
<br />Click Wireless Adapter Settings
<br />Click Power Saving Mode
<br />Check Maximum Performance
<br />click OK
<br />
<br />3. Right-click on your network adapter and click Properties. 
<br />Open Advanced tab and under Property locate “Roaming Sensitivity Level“. In the value pane, 
<br />Click “High“. 
<br />Make sure that “Antenna Diversity Selection” is set to “Auto“. Save changes by clicking OK 
<br />Check if the problem is solved. 
<br />Note: you may have to restart your computer for changes to take effect.

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1 - 99&#37; RAM usage and inability to shut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidneysnell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1 - 99&#37; RAM usage and inability to shut down</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on July 30 and since then I have experienced problems on two occasions where the RAM reaches 99% usage which then slows the system down and results in an inability to shut down correctly.&nbsp; Shut down appears to happen but I believe
 it goes into sleep mode despite choosing 'Shut Down'.&nbsp; There is no output to the monitor but the hard drive continues (blue light showing).&nbsp; Even when the computer comes out of sleep it still shows 99% RAM usage.&nbsp; The only way to sort this out is to hold the
 power button in until full shut down occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the RAM is showing at 99%, the actual usage is nowhere near that figure.&nbsp; The first time the problem occurred, I was playing GTA V and thought that this was the cause however the second time it happened I was using Internet Explorer with very little
 else running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 16Gb of RAM so it is a bit worrying that all of this can be used especially with very little running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching the web, I found that users of Windows 7 and 8.1 have experienced similar problems in the past and in most cases this appears to be a memory management leak problem related to the 'ndu' (Windows Network Data Usage Monitor).&nbsp; Amending the
 registry solved the problem by changing a setting (Start value) to 4 which disabled some part of the ndu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this does not make much sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this problem following the upgrade and if so whether changing the ndu setting would work.&nbsp; I have not tried chaging the setting in case it creates more problems as I do not fully undersatnd the significance
 of the above solution and more importantly why the problem occurs in the first place.&nbsp; I never experienced this problem when running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be a case of going back to 8.1.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to your request, I solved&nbsp;the problem by editing the Registry.&nbsp; You will notice that I mentioned this in my original post but I had not tried it at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The registry edit worked for me prior to Parth P Patel's entry so I never tried the memory test.</p>
<p>I am no expert so I do not know the full implications of the Registry edit but it did work and it does not appear to have had any adverse effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Non-paged pool has not risen higher than 200Mb since I edited the ndu setting.&nbsp; Even running GTA V does not result in any stutter now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try it, right click the Start logo, choose Run and type regedit.</p>
<p>Once in the Registry Editor, you will need to navigate to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Ndu and then from the right hand section of the window double click Start in order to be able to edit the Value data setting.&nbsp; It will probably
 be 2 but changing this to 4 will disable the ndu.</p>
<p>I would suggest that a backup of the registry is performed prior to the change and this can be done by choosing File, Export to create the backup although it is a simple matter to change the setting back to the original number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, please search the web using 'disable ndu in windows'.&nbsp; You will get quite a few hits, just work your way through them for peace of mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can explain in simple terms the effect of disabling ndu, it would be appreciated.</p>
<p />

            <p>NDU stands for Network Diagnostic Usage, it is a monitoring tool. What it monitors for, I do not know. It could be statistics or something. I had the same issue with Windows 8 and I've had no issues disabling it there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future users, I have made a video for how to do this, instead of just text, making it easier for some people.</p>

            <p>Disabling ndu sorted it for me (see above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I believe the problem resulted from downloads which caused the non-paged pool to continue increasing and never reduce even when a restart was initiated.&nbsp; Somehow the RAM was not being flushed correctly (probably due to a program/driver).&nbsp; Only
 completely shutting down Windows reset the non-paged pool but it quickly built up again until I disabled ndu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since disabling ndu, my non-paged pool is usually less than 300Mb and I have had no problems with anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a go, disabling the ndu takes less than a minute and you can always change the setting back again if it does not work for you.&nbsp; You might even find that the start process speeds up slightly, maybe due to the low&nbsp;usage figure&nbsp;in the non-paged pool.</p>

            <p>Further to the above, since I received the Windows 10 update (Version 1511) yesterday, the problem returned because the setting in the registry had been reset to 2.&nbsp; I have once again changed it to 4 (see entry 14 August above for full details) in the hope
 that it will sort things out.</p>
<p>Obviously Microsoft has not looked into the problem and I cannot believe that I am the only person who is experiencing this.</p>

            <p>Hi amiTiSO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Killer Network Manager is running on your computer&nbsp;(possibly came with an MSI motherboard) the following&nbsp;might help you in conjunction with my previous notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my note of 30 April, the&nbsp;problem did not totally go away so&nbsp;I also removed or disabled Killer Network Manager and then changed the ndu setting once again&nbsp;to 4 in the registry.&nbsp; My non-paged pool dropped to&nbsp;less than 200Mb and has remained there ever
 since and as far as I can tell without affecting any other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search on Google re the Killer Network Manager, there are some pages that suggest updating the Killer Network Driver directly from the Killer website rather than from MSI.&nbsp; I haven't tried that as I haven't experienced any problems following my action
 but you might want to try that first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember if I simply disabled Killer Network Manager or removed it.</p>

For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not

have a&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and they are not copy

Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />

If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy

    <title>Need gamertag help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rulxa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need gamertag help</h2>
                    
<p>I just spoke on a chat with an xbl support agent and he brought me here. Basically, ive admired certain gamertags that are currently in use of accounts that have been inactive and silvered for a while. I was wondering if theres anyway i could get one of
 the awesome gamertags labeled below. My friend had contActed xbl support and was abel to come to an agreement on a gamertag he wanted that was used and he got it, so i hope the same can be done with me. The gamertags im interested in are the following</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>Missing</p>
<p>Giving</p>
<p>Stop</p>
<p>Android</p>
<p>Looking</p>
<p>Clapping</p>
<p>Nuke</p>
<p>Clear</p>
<p>Spawn Trapping</p>
<p>Frost</p>
<p>Craving</p>
<p>Pencil</p>
<p>Switching Side</p>
<p>Freezing</p>

<p>if anyone of these gamertags can be freed from the silver accounts that are inactive and dont use xbox live that will be greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>Sorry, but support is incorrect. There is no way to request a certain gamertag and no one on the forums can do that. The tag system is also used on other Microsoft services so even if it's not being used on Live, it could be use somewhere else.</p>

<p>Hello there&nbsp;<strong>Rulxa</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I`ve got to agree with&nbsp;<strong>Smwutches</strong>&nbsp;on this one, but i`m going to explain in a little&nbsp;<strong>more detail</strong>&nbsp;for you.</p>
<p>When an&nbsp;<strong>Xbox live member</strong>&nbsp;chooses an&nbsp;<strong>Xbox gamer-tag</strong>, they have the&nbsp;<strong>full rights to keep that gamer-tag</strong>&nbsp;even know if they have been<strong>&nbsp;inactive for years</strong>&nbsp;along with&nbsp;<strong>no gamer-score</strong>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<strong>no
 gold membership,</strong>you will not be able to&nbsp;<strong>request for the gamer-tag to be forced changed</strong>.</p>
<p>The<strong>&nbsp;owner</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>gamer-tag</strong>&nbsp;must&nbsp;<strong>change it himself</strong>&nbsp;or when a&nbsp;<strong>forced gamer-tag change</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>imposed</strong>due to the&nbsp;<strong>gamer-tag violated the code of conduct</strong>&nbsp;in any sort
 of way, if the&nbsp;<strong>gamer-tag you enter is already</strong>&nbsp;taken, you are&nbsp;<strong>prompted</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>try another gamer-tag.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;gamer-tags are also tied to services like Zune or games for windows live. If a gt doesn't exist on Xbox, it might be in use on one of those services. If you try sending the gamer-tag you want a friend request and it says it’s not a
 valid gamer-tag that just means it isn't used on Xbox live, but it could be used for Zune or gfwl. I thought this Information would help you understand&nbsp;<span><strong>Rulxa</strong>, Good luck,</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Check with Brother Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. As OEM Brother<br />
is responsible for the proper operation of both the printer and their supplied drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<h2>            LSISAS 9211-8i in Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought this card with the thought that all motherboards can accept any PCIe interface: of course I was wrong because my board only has x16 &amp; x1 slots, whereas this LSISAS is x8... anyway, I researched all night and found some said that I can install
 the x8 into the x16, and somehow they seem right (I installed and there was light). My problem is Win10 cannot "see the LSI" thus, the 4 HDDs connected to the LSI are also "not seen".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CD that comes with it only has 32/64bit drivers for XP, 2003, 2008, &amp; Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know now that I am out of my league in this, hoping that everything was plug-&amp;-play because I had wanted to maximize the number of HDDs in my machine so I can use it as a server (via W10 Pro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone be so kind to help me with this?</p>
<p>(I am a novice in actually installing hardware I am used to just clicking on 'setup' or 'install' ad that's it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even reinstalled my W10 Pro hoping that it will 'discover' the LSISAS Board, but it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edgar</p>

    <title>Can I control where the sound output is going&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I control where the sound output is going&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have built in sound on my motherboard (Asus Socket 775 using Realtek Audio). &nbsp;So many times I need to switch between different audio outputs. &nbsp;Amazingly its very difficult to find a external box that accepts one audio in and can switch that input to 2
 or more outputs. Most of us use a headset, then speakers, then perhaps high quality headphones, a speakerphone, etc. &nbsp;Most of us need at least 2 audio outputs. &nbsp;Anyway I tried plugging in my headphones into the rear and side channel outputs and it sounded
 identical to the front channel output when in 2, 4, 6 or 8 channel mode in the Realtek audio program. &nbsp;Really identical. &nbsp;I switched back and forth several times to make sure. &nbsp;There was a tiny delay in the sound coming through when I plugged into the the
 rear ones (in 4 channel mode) and the side ones (in 6 or 8 channel mode). &nbsp;But the sound itself was the same in every way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know why it would be the same? &nbsp;Was it because it was encoded in stereo? &nbsp;Wouldn't the Realtek audio program try to synthesize multi-channel audio for the side and rear channels? &nbsp;The Center/Subwoofer channel was mono so that made sense. &nbsp;And
 the mic input works fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If I could control which output I wanted to use I could have a selection of 3 outputs (front, side and rear) to choose from. &nbsp;Quality headphones, headset for chatting and speakers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize many computers have audio outputs for the rear and front but I'm not using that nor do I have the header panel for that. &nbsp;I'm not sure if there is a provision to switch between front and back outputs. &nbsp;If there was that would be a big plus.</p>
<p>But as everybody knows, its a pain to switch outputs in Windows. &nbsp;You have to launch Sound in Control Panel, navigate to Audio out of the 5 tabs, pick what output you want, Apply, OK. &nbsp;I've put Sound on a shortcut but its still a pain. &nbsp;And you have to often
 close the application that was using that sound output as well. &nbsp;A mechanical switch could be instant and right by your keyboard or mouse. &nbsp;A volume control on the same box would be most intelligent. &nbsp;There is always a delay when adjusting the sound in Windows
 that would be best avoided. &nbsp;You could do the same for the mic so it could be muted most of the time, then switched to the headset or for a speakerphone application where you're a little ways away from your desk. &nbsp;Software switching just doesn't work very
 well. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microphone not working with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perrydb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
Just updated my windows 10 installation, and noticed that none of my programs are picking up sound from my microphone.<br />
Heading into sound settings, i noticed that the green bars are not moving.&nbsp;<br />
However, if i click "listen to this device" i hear myself in the speakers clearly and the green bar is moving. Still no sound picked up in audacity, discord or any other apps, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have made some attempts reinstalling realtek drivers and restarting, as well as unistalling the basic driver and reinstalling, but the same issue persists.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Camera app returns &#34;We can&#39;t get to the camera roll right now&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my kids did "something" to my pictures folder and since then, I have not been able to take pictures or videos with my Surface Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He tried to copy off some pictures, but, I believe, he inadvertently deleted the camera roll by accident. It was a while back and he does not fully remember what he did. I have tried: restoring the libraries, using the app troubleshooter, searching for the
 folder in deleted items (no luck), adding back the camera roll manually, and assigning it to the Pictures library, all to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried an early restore point, but it too did not work. &nbsp;I really do not want to fully restore my Surface Pro if I do not have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Windows Store, Music and Video apps stall and toolbar has stopped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave woodhead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store, Music and Video apps stall and toolbar has stopped working. Any suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since running the latest batch of Windows Updates, my installation of Windows 8.1 has started falling apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 is now booking to the Desktop instead of the normal Win8&nbsp;Start screen. For a while it appeared to be trying to run the Windows Store app, which was minimised to the taskbar. Running Windows Store manually results in a green "Store" screen for
 a few second, which then minimises to the Desktop taskbar. The Music and Video apps do the same, although the Camera and Photos apps work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since applying several fixes recommended by the Microsoft Community, the toolbar (by which I mean the bar which pops when the cursor is moved the corner of the screen, which includes the Power button and Volume control amongst others) no longer appears,
 so to shut down the laptop I have to go back to the normal Win8 interface and use the Power icon in the top-right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone recommend a fix for these problems? My laptop is an Alienware with an i7 processor and 16 GB RAM. Virus scan doesn't reveal any problems, and I really don't want to reinstall Windows or setup a new user ID to rectify the problem (which I've seen
 recommended elsewhere but I would&nbsp;consider only as a last resort.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Thanks for your questions and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tested all of my Apps, but the following are all showing the same problem:&nbsp;Store, Music, Video, Help &amp; Tips, Reading , Weather, Alarms, Maps, Calendar, Games, Sound Recorder, Reader, People.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these apps start up when clicked, but simply show the app logo in the middle of the screen (with a coloured background as expected for the app, e.g. green for Store,) and then minimise to the desktop taskbar. You can click on the apps in the taskbar
 which causes the same (logo-only) screen and then minimises the app again after a second or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the standard Microsoft apps, the only ones I have found not showing this behaviour are&nbsp;PC Settings, Camera, Photos and OneDrive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have already tried the measures you suggest. The powershell command returns an error as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Get-ExecutionPolicy : Cannot bind parameter 'Scope'. Cannot convert value</em><br />
<em>"Unrestricted" to type "Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicyScope". Error:</em><br />
<em>"Unable to match the identifier name Unrestricted to a valid enumerator name.</em><br />
<em>Specify one of the following enumerator names and try again: Process,</em><br />
<em>CurrentUser, LocalMachine, UserPolicy, MachinePolicy"</em><br />

<em>&nbsp; &nbsp;ell.Commands.GetExecutionPolicyCommand</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The App troubleshooter reports: <em>There might be a problem with a device or you might need to update your display adapter drivers. The Device Troubleshooter will help identify any known device issues.&nbsp;</em>I ran the Device Troubleshooter and it suggested
 that a Hardware change might not have been detected. However, the laptop hardware has not changed since the machine was built. I also checked my graphics card driver, and it is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running WSRESET, but get error message <em>ms-windows-store:PurgeCaches The app didn't start.</em> Store opens to the green screen and Store logo, then minimises to the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have relocated the Temporary Internet Files folder in IE to a new location (using a new folder containing no other files.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recently installed updates are (most recent first)&nbsp;KB2919355, KB2933809, KB2267602 and &nbsp;KB2919355. I can't recall exactly when this behaviour started as I tend to use the Desktop most of the time, but these updates were all installed within the
 past few weeks when I believe the problem first arose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the additional information can help identify a solution.</p>

            I should have added that the "swipe-in" toolbar (Search, Share, Start, Devices and Settings) is now working again, so the problem may be unrelated to the Apps issue.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the display adapter<span> from Manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Follow these steps to <strong>Display Adapter</strong>.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></li><li><span>Search for <strong>Display Adapter</strong> and expand it.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the </span><strong>Display Adapter </strong><span>and select

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Go to the manufacturer’s website and install the latest drivers for your computer and install it.</span></p>

            <p>Deleting and reinstalling the graphics drivers didn't work. The apps still behave as previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look in various event logs and found the following events recorded after I tried running the Help and Tips and Video apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the Windows System log, I have found:</p>
<ul>
<li>The server HelpAndTips did not register with DCOM within the required timeout. (Event ID 10010, Source: DistributedCOM)</li><li>The server Microsoft.ZuneVideo.wwa did not register with DCOM within the required timeout. (Event ID 10010, Source: DistributedCOM)</li></ul>
<p>Under Applications and Service Logs | Microsoft | Windows | Apps | Microsoft - Windows - TwinUI/Operational I found the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Activation of the app Microsoft.ZuneVideo_8wekyb3d8bbwe!Microsoft.ZuneVideo for the Windows.Launch contract failed with error: The app didn't start.. (Event ID 5961, Source: Apps)</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The event immediately before this was: <em>Activation of app Microsoft.ZuneVideo_8wekyb3d8bbwe!Microsoft.ZuneVideo attempted. Execution state: Attempted activation of the app, 0, The operation completed successfully..</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ul>
<li>Activation of the app Microsoft.HelpAndTips_8wekyb3d8bbwe!HelpAndTips for the Windows.Launch contract failed with error: The app didn't start.. (Event ID 5961, Source: Apps)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to these there were three instances of the same error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activation of the app microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe!ppleae38af2e007f4358a809ac99a64a67c1 for the Windows.BackgroundTasks contract failed with error: The app didn't start..</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any further advice is welcome. Feel free to be as technical as needed - I have two IT degrees and am a professional IT developer, hence my failure to resolve this problem is very annoying!</p>

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Install the driver by following this step:</p>
<p>You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.</p>
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‌</p>
<p>2. In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</p>
<p>3. Click the Driver tab, click Update Driver, and then follow the instructions. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>If this does not help, you may download the drivers for the device from the manufacturer’s website and install them manually.</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more details on updating drivers:</p>

                    <span>
<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I had to format my C-drive and reinstall Windows 7 on it (had problems with starting the Windows up). It went well, but now any of the programs that I had installed on my F-drive are not found by Windows. They are in the F-drive and I can even run them without
 problem directly from the directories, but I was wondering if there's a way to get the Windows to recognize them as installed, e.g. so they would end up listed in the Programs and Features list and in the All Programs-list. Is there any way of doing some sort
 of registry scan (or something) so they I could get them automatically there?</p>

            No, best if you reinstall them or attempt a repair installation.

<h2>            How to create a backup and restore script using CLI utilizing robocopy &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Environment: Enterprise</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Enterprise</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Actual Title: I'm working within CLI utilizing robocopy creating a backup and restore script.
</strong><strong>migwiz.lnk=@%windir%\system32\migwiz\wet.dll,-588</strong></p>
<p>I'm working within CLI utilizing robocopy creating a backup and restore script. Endpoint is a local server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Backup works perfectly but during the restore&nbsp;script notepad opens desktop.ini and has the following:
</p>
<p>[LocalizedFileNames] </p>
<p>migwiz.lnk=@%windir%\system32\migwiz\wet.dll,-588. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I "X" the notepad the script continues to run but this happens about 3 times during the restore.&nbsp; Once I "X" the Notepad the script&nbsp;appears&nbsp;to run successfully but since I need to roll this out to the Service Desk I would like this to run silently.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Doesn&#39;t Exist</h2>
                    So i have an old xbox profile thats linked to a microsoft account, i can sign in to this account and download the profile to my xbox. I also have a new profile that i currently use, but when i look to see which microsoft account its linked to, it says
 the same as the first profile. Ive tried switching microsoft accounts with my xbox, but it says that it cant do it and tells me to go to xbox.com/accountswap. When i try and sign into the old microsoft account on my phone, it says that it doesnt exist.

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Account swapping is no longer a working function on the 360. To clarify here, what is it that you are trying to do? are you trying to download your profile to a different Xbox? Were you just wanting to change
 the Email to your Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, being told that a Microsoft account does not exist means that you are using the incorrect email to sign in.&nbsp;Use this link to recover a forgotten email :

            Your Xbox Live account is part of your Microsoft account and is there forever. You can sign out (remove your account) and it still exists and is ready to be signed into or downloaded as often as you need.

<p>What the heck?</p>
