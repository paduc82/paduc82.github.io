<h2>            Puzzling Log Entry &#34;Office 365 Service Is Listening&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All!</p>
<p>I use a Mac running OSX 10.6.8. On this computer, I do not have Office 365, but I do have a purchased-on-disk copy of Office for Mac (2011).</p>
<p>The programs I use in Office For Mac are Word and Excel. Occasionally, I open Power Point. I do not have Outlook or Entourage installed. I have Update set to automatic, weekly. I am up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one of the computer's log files titled <em>Daily.out</em> there are hundreds and hundreds of entries each day that state
<em>Office365islistening.</em> (All one word).</p>
<p>In the total log, it amounts to thousands of these entries for the last week alone. The specific location on the Mac is</p>
<p>Macintosh HD/Private/Var/Log/Daily.out</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a sample of the line-</p>
<p>Thu Feb 12 14:02:58 (my name is here) Firewall[161] &lt;Info&gt;: Office365Service is listening from 127.0.0.1:1538 proto=6</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am curious-</p>
<p>What is Office 365 listening to?</p>
<p>Is it using bandwidth or CPU resources to listen?</p>
<p>How can I stop the item form listening and using resources and making my daily.out log so giant sized?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Very Much for your ideas and suggestions. They are all appreciated!</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<h2>            Planck&#39;s Constant h bar and how to type d bar</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>is there any formula to type d bar in MS office, just like the formula for h-bar? I mean you can add a line over or under the letter, but can you add a line in the letter (for example) d, like the line in h-bar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>There is a Unicode character <em><span>đ&nbsp;</span></em>with the character number hex 0111. It's present in most fonts that contain more than just the 128 ASCII characters, such
 as Cambria Math, Times New Roman, and Arial Unicode. To insert it, you can use the Insert &gt; Symbol &gt; More Symbols dialog, or just type the number 0111 in the document and immediately press Alt+X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regular text you can apply italic formatting to the character. In an equation control, unfortunately, I don't see any way to italicize it to match the&nbsp;<em><span>ħ</span></em><span>
 character.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get help to access email - very frustrated&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm sending this on behalf of my boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp;setup his Hotmail account several years ago,&nbsp;for the last couple of years has only accessed&nbsp;his email through his phone and only occasionally through a computer.&nbsp; Now he can't access it at all through a computer,
 seems to be locked.&nbsp; He has&nbsp;filled out the questionnaire and he is told he has not provided enough information to verify his account.&nbsp; He doesn't have any self-created folders&nbsp;to note&nbsp;on the questionnaire,&nbsp;he has provided recent email information, even past
 passwords used and they still can't confirm it's him asking to regain access?? It's ridiculous, he has even called the Toll-free number, they tell us that&nbsp;someone will get in touch with him via alternate email, which is mine, only to give us the same link
 to the same questionnaire we've filled out 2 or 3 times already.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we're&nbsp;pointed to this forum, which doesn't seem to give any help. &nbsp;I am only finding people asking for help and no resolutions being posted.&nbsp;&nbsp; So how the&nbsp;heck do you get&nbsp;help via this forum???&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone can help, we're very frustrated!</p>
<p>Thank you so very much!</p>

<h2>            Update&#58; Unlocked T-Mobile Lumia 925 - Internet Sharing does not work on AT&#38;amp&#59;T wireless &#40;Solved&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have my T-Mobile Lumia 925 unlocked as I plan to use it with other carries when I travel to other countries.&nbsp; To make sure it works I tried the phone with an AT&amp;T SIM.&nbsp; Everthing works,&nbsp;for example, I can call, send/receive SMS, surf the web, send/receive
 emails,etc., only that internet sharing does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet sharing works if I used my T-Mobile SIM card.&nbsp; But when I switch to the AT&amp;T SIM card and tried to turn on internet sharing, it would show the broadcast name and password but nothing can connect to it.&nbsp; Actually the SSID could not be detected by
 any other devices.&nbsp; Also with T-Mobile SIM card I can set my own SSID and password, but the "setup" button is grayed out if I used AT&amp;T SIM card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tech supports at an AT&amp;T store told me that it does not work because the phone is made specifically for T-Mobile.&nbsp; Is that the case?&nbsp; Any way to get around the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: The Windows Phone 8.1 update has fixed the problem!</p>

<p>There is no way around the problem. It is still a T-Mobile phone even though can use other sims.</p>
<p>Users have gotten sharing to work on unlocked phones on other carriers but each carrier is a project. Here is one thread I found .</p>

<p>@garym11, thanks for the link.&nbsp; The discussions there indicates that the problem with tethering is in the APN setup.&nbsp; That makes sense.&nbsp; Either the phone is expecting a TMO-specific signature from the server, or the server requires a carrier-specific data
 from the phone.&nbsp; Most likely it's tha latter since many have made it to work on foreign, non-TMO carriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my conclusion is that AT&amp;T requires some specific data but fails to get them from the phone.&nbsp; For example it may need an appropriate "connection type" string to work.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Access Point setup tool that came with the Windows Phone does not
 covers only the basic&nbsp;data fields.&nbsp; Hopefully a future Windows Phone update will include more fields.&nbsp; In the mean time do you know if there's a more comprehensive APN setup app for WP8?</p>

<p>You may have been better off getting the factory unlocked&nbsp;international version of the phone.</p>
<p>There is a Nokia Access Point app that installs in phone settings. Don't know if you already have it or not.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/access-point-updated-lumia-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wpcentral.com/access-point-updated-lumia-owners</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is not string setup for APN settings. It is all just the correct information in the fields provided.</p>
<p>Search for APN settings for different carriers and you will see what I mean.</p>
<p>Don't start blaming the phone.</p>

<p>Who's complaning about the phone?&nbsp; As stated in my initial post, internet sharing works fine with TMO.&nbsp; So the problem with AT&amp;T should be a software issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the term "string" to mean a string of characters, as in computer languages.&nbsp; An AT&amp;T tech support worked with me on the phone went through&nbsp;a list of&nbsp;APN fields.&nbsp; I can&nbsp;enter some of the fields but not all.&nbsp; He asked, for example, if I can specify
 something like "ineternet,MMS" as the "connection type".&nbsp; But there's simply no such field in the Access Point setup.&nbsp; (BTW, the Access Point setup function is now part of the Settings in WP8, and not a seperate app.)&nbsp; There's also no way to specify MCC, MNC,
 and maybe other fields.&nbsp; Those information may be needed to enable internet sharing on AT&amp;T.&nbsp; I would enter those data into the phone if there's a way.</p>

<p>Yeah, I have searched the web quite a bit for a soultion.&nbsp; There are quite a few different suggestions on the APN setup, but the current Access Point setup function simply&nbsp;does not cover all data&nbsp;fields.</p>

<h2>            N900 shuts down when opening slider</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone else have this problem? I believe I've figured out that it happens when I put a certain battery in it. I have three, total, because my previous phone was a 5800, so I had ordered an extra one. So, now I have three that I can use in my N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it is an official Nokia battery because it looks exactly like the others...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, my phone shuts down when I open the slider, using a fully-charged battery. The lights dim as if it is a power failure and it does not reboot like the others having the reboot problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for rambling on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Thanks</p>

<p>I've spoken to a few people who have had problems with their keyboard.. back lights not coming on and random shutting down..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what exactly happens when you open the keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When does this abnormal behavior start?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The keyboard sensor is right at the top.. the N900 can't tell if the keyboard is open until it is almost completely open.. If something happens before then, it could be something loose inside the handset..</p>

<p>Thanks for the fast reply, Cpitchford!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been happening for about three weeks now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as I open the slider, for instance to reply to a message, the lights go dim and it shuts off completely. It does not restart--I have to turn it on again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think the battery is a fake? Or is it something in the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping that the firmware update would have fixed it but it didn't.</p>

<p>So it shuts down if you open the slider a little.. Does it happen if you open the slider so only the bottom row of keys is showing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like a hardware fault. It is unlikely to be a software problem. It might be worth taking into a care centre along with the batteries and seeing if they can spot the fault..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to someone recently whos device was doing all sorts of crazy things and the fault turned out to be a broken power button.. someone else had a loose sensor the keyboard.. the hardware quality is not that uniform with the N900.. they don't make them
 like they used to!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out of interest, can you run this command in an x terminal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>cat /proc/bootreason</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this should tell you why it was rebooted (or shut down)</p>

<p>Ok, I ran the xterminal and got this: pwr_key</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's obvious it is the power key... I put another battery in and it works fine...Not sure what is going on here. I should probably just trash that battery!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, it shuts off when I barely open the slider. Everything else work great. And yes,I do agree they do not make them like they used to!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do love this phone though:)</p>

<p>hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought my n900 and yes, my previous phone was a 5800 as well. I tried the exact same thing as you did because the battery life of the N900 is not up to the mark. I figured out that this happens because the the battery in my 5800 was a fake and i figured
 out that the N900 does not accept fake batteries or memory card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone's a life-saver! &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am so relieved it is only the battery! I was reading for days about how some people needed to reflash and enter this code and that code...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi guys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a very similar problem and have been unable to enjoy my phone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a new N900 yesterday, for the 2nd time, but the device is still manifesting the same symptoms:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- shuts itself down regularly, whether in use or not;</p>
<p>- sliding the keyboard back in causes it to shut down;</p>
<p>- it shut down when it was taken off the charger;</p>
<p>- I left it on the charger overnight and it stayed up all night (&gt;10hrs);</p>
<p>- even when it is on (for a short while) the screen stays inactive and blank permanently, and the device shuts down when I attempt to slide it open to check that it is indeed on</p>
<p>- attempt to start it up again are not always responded to, and when it does it starts to boot up and then dies again</p>
<p>- it barely stays up long enough to use it for any purpose</p>
<p>- sometimes the charger responds to the power supply and sometimes it doesn't</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was exactly what was happening with the new one I recieved from and sent back to Nokia within days. They asked me to return it without the battery and charger and claimed to have tested the new one before sending it back to me. I have put&nbsp;in the&nbsp;battery&nbsp;and
 used the charger from the previous new device.</p>
<p>I have tried to analyse the problem and I am beginning to think that the issue might be related to either a dodgy battery or charger. What do you think?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have asked Nokia to send me a replacement charger and batter. In the meantime, have you any suggestions I could try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**bleep**</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried every tip, uninstall skype 6.1 due to skype bug, try outlook /safe mode with administrator privileges, and widnows 8.1 notification settings, nothing helped. After that notifications showed only in Inbox folder, but not when message arrived in subfolders.</p>

<h2>            Not Being Offered Build 10532&#63;  Read Here&#33;</h2>
                    <p>***edit - 8/28 at 8:40am PST ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a few users seeing this same issue on 10532.&nbsp; Resolution steps should be the same, so editing this thread rather than creating a new one. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello Insiders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your feedback, it seems some users aren't receiving the new 10532 build when checking for updates.&nbsp; There are a few different things that may be causing this.&nbsp; Review the checklist below for suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To continue receiving Insider flights, you need to be on an activated copy of Win10.&nbsp; Please ensure your Win10 build was properly activated on 10240.<br />
<br />
Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation<br />
<br />
(Your edition will likely be either Home or Professional)<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfca5969-5a8a-4f70-996d-3c05dea1626a" /></li></ul>
<p>Once you've done that, please check the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you registered to receive flights?&nbsp; You can do so in the following location: Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced settings.&nbsp; Here's a screen shot to validate:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38dec905-3f0e-4345-bc47-d3dea035f295" /><br />
</li><li>Are you set to the Insider Fast ring?&nbsp; We have only released the 10532 build to the Fast ring at this time.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; Your machine may simply say "Fast" rather than "Windows Insider Fast".&nbsp; This is ok.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64d038ec-d069-42c5-91e8-4bc8f0d5bdfa" /><br />
</li><li>When did you opt in for receiving Insider builds?&nbsp; If you've done so in the past few days, you need to know about Compatibility Adviser.&nbsp; After you register your PC to receive Insider builds, this adviser is what provides the basic information about your
 OS and machine.&nbsp; Language, locale, OS type (Home/Pro/Enterprise) and processor architecture (x86 or x64).&nbsp; This is to ensure that we send you the correct version of the OS when we deliver updates to you.&nbsp; Once you opt in to receive Insider builds, it can take
 up to 48 hours for this event to run.&nbsp; Until that happens, the PC in question will not be offered any Insider OS updates.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Did you do a clean install of the OS recently?&nbsp; If so, did you opt back in for Insider builds?&nbsp; Clean installs will remove the Insider configurations on your PC.&nbsp; You'll need to opt back in to receive new Insider builds.&nbsp; Once you do that, the bullet point
 above regarding Compatibility Adviser will also apply.<br />
</li><li>Reboot your machine and check for updates again.&nbsp; (Sometimes the easy steps are the answer!)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>That should about cover it.&nbsp; If you've gone through this checklist and you're still not receiving a flight, please post here and we'll work to gather some additional info from your affected machine.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>
<p>- Jason</p>

            All points you outlined covered, but no Fast track insider build offered.&nbsp; Running a dual boot of 1) Windows Ten official version RTM, none insider, 2) Windows insider build 10240, activated, fast track all updates, thus far (6 hours), nothing has tripped
 the 10525 build. Tried updating a number of times.

<h3> lean79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Time Zone for Central America &#40;UTC-06&#58;00&#41; has bug</h2>
                    <p>For several years now I have noticed that when trying to accept meetings in Outlook Calendar from other platforms the Time Zone for Central America (UTC-06:00) is replaced with the Mexico Time Zone.</p>
<p>Why is this a concern? Central America countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) do not observe Daylight Saving Time - DST while Mexico does.</p>
<p>Proof: Changed Time Zone in Windows and in Outlook Calendar to Regina,&nbsp;Saskatchewan, Canada (UTC-06:00) which also does not observe DST and the meetings were placed in the calendar on the correct time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have observed this issue in Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, and now in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>Request to Microsoft Outlook team: Please take note that&nbsp;Central America countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) do not observe Daylight Saving Time - DST.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The fact that this problem occurs on several pc,s and on Office Outlook as well as Outlook Hotmail clearly indicates a server problem which is reported in Office Outlook but not on the Outlook/Hotmail site.

<p>Emailing me a reply is a total waste of time as the problem is that I cannot access my email!!!</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live does not sync after enabling two-factor authentication</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many others, I enabled two-factor authentication on my Microsoft Account today, and as soon as I did that my Xbox Live account is not able to sync on my Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open the Games Hub and click on my gamertag, it takes me to my profile page and achievements, however when I swipe over to my achievements, it says Xbox Live isn't available at the moment. It also doesn't allow me to change my avatar, there it says,
 "Make sure your Account and Date &amp; Time settings are correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did generate my App Password in my Microsoft Account and I also entered the same in the Password field of my Microsoft Account under Emails + Accounts settings on my Windows Phone. My emails are syncing fine, however Xbox Live doesn't seem to like 2-FA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know how do I fix this issue, the last thing I wanna do is reset my phone.</p>

<h2>            Is Windows 10 upgrade applicable for OEM versions of Windows 8.1 SINGLE LANGUAGE version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Under <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/free-windows-10-update-for-windows-7-and-881/7567f5f5-1fb3-49db-b0f5-50379bbe12b9">this thread</a>,&nbsp;</strong>I found an answer conveying that Windows 8.1
<strong>Single Language users</strong> (with OEM keys) would be able to upgrade to Windows 10
<strong>"CORE</strong>" version. But it will still be upgraded with the OEM key. Now if in future, I want to clean install Windows 10, which version should i use it to do so? And which key should i use? Will that OEM key work with an image downloaded provided
 by MS? Will there be an <strong>image of Windows 10 "CORE"</strong> be available with Microsoft? Just like how Windows 8.1(or 8)
<strong>"SINGLE LANGUAGE"</strong> image is <strong>NOT AVAILABLE</strong> from Microsoft and only be attained from the OEM/laptop manufacturer. Moreover my laptop(an hp envy laptop) has the recovery drive to install windows 8.1 single language version only
 and not Windows 10. If I can create a recovery drive of Windows 10 after upgrading it, it will not be a clean copy of Windows 10. So,
<strong>how to get a clean copy of Windows 10 without purchasing it</strong>, as I am eligible for the Windows 10 upgrade?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be thankful to be enlightened in this regard.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem however that Microsoft will release Windows 10 with .iso images (which will make life a lot easier for reinstallation in particular clean installation).</p>

<p>
</p><p>The license will go from an OEM license to a RETAIL license so the support for Windows 10 should come from Microsoft and not the OEM - as the OEM never sold the device and preconfigured it with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 may still prove to&nbsp;be a special case as its a free upgrade&nbsp;if Microsoft provide some incentive to OEMs to support Windows 10 on their full Windows 7 and 8.1 range baring in mind many of the Windows 7 systems (2009 - 6 years ago)&nbsp;in particular
 will have long ago&nbsp;expired the OEM warranty period. The main problem in this case will be third party system drivers but Windows 10 has many inbuilt.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Oops, I forgot to mention that my hp envy came pre-installed with WIndows 8.1 Single Language version. Hence the doubt about my license. I would be glad if my license converts into a Retail license with the upgrade, as Windows 10 will not be provided to
 me by the OEM.<br />

Thank You for the info. :)</p>

            <p>Its interesting... Finally someone is providing some information. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres the thing though I have Windows 10 Technical Preview installed on my Dell Inspiron 7347. This has a Windows 8.1 OEM license...
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This installation was performed by a clean installation with the Windows 10 Technical Preview .iso.
</em>The full install is recorded here:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5TrgrEr-KM&amp;list=PL1RkaknDn7v_SJaBuleIyodZD7Nt_IgqM
</p>
<p>You see in both cases it reports it as retail. Now Microsoft have the capabilities of determining that this system has a UEFI BIOS Embedded SLP key so should from that be able to determine that this system is eligible for the free upgrade. Of course for
 the Windows 8.1 Edition, it can readily be reinstalled with the Windows 8.1 Media Creation Tool (assuming this is not removed the date Windows 10 is released). Users with the likes of windows 8.1 with Bing will not be able to download a Windows 8.1 with Bing
 .iso to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then theres a case for Windows 7 which uses an older version of OEM System Locked Preinstallation. The installation media in such&nbsp;cases&nbsp;inputs a generic OEM SLP key. As this SLP key is dependant on having OEM Installation Media or an existing installation.
 The question is whether Microsoft will issue these users a new product key in the future and if no new product key is issued how users will reinstall on this system as theres no record of the OEM license. Windows 7 COAs also tend to fade very often and most
 users cannot read them any longer.&nbsp;This old version of SLP was relatively easy to pirate so it would be better for Microsoft to give out retail keys in these instances otherwise it opens an easy means of piracy for Windows 10 later down the line.&nbsp;My suggestion
 would be to force users to sign in to a Microsoft Account so the new product key is recorded somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few questions for other users on the Windows 10TP, particularly those who got it via Windows Update does it say OEM like Andre demonstrated or RETAIL like my system does. I may reload my factory image and try the Windows Update method myself.</p>

            <p>Things are going to be different for Windows 10.&nbsp;During the initial&nbsp;upgrade from Windows 7/8.1 to Windows 10 your devices hardware will be scanned and submitted to a Microsoft Product Activation Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has an inbuilt feature to make a Windows 10 Recovery Drive. It allows for a vanilla Clean Reinstallation (locked to Edition, Architecture). During installation Windows rescans your hardware and resubmits your hardware profile to the Microsoft
 Product Activation Server. If the Microsoft Product Activation Server can recall your device, Windows is automatically activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 25 digit key is becoming a thing of the past and it seems Microsoft are finally taking complains regarding installation policies seriously bringing Windows up to end users&nbsp;expectations from the time Windows Vista was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note I have tested using a Recovery Drive created in 1 system with another so its not system specific. I have tried using the Recovery Drive to Reinstall without a Microsoft Account, so&nbsp;Product Activation&nbsp;is not locked to a Microsoft Account. I have also
 tested minor Hardware Changes such as a SSD upgrade.</p>

            I have Windows 10 and Word 2016.&nbsp; On the print preview page, it has become very tedious to have to scroll to the bottom of the preview window and hit the small arrow or number to get to the next preview page. Then I have to scroll all the way to the top
 to see the top of that page. (This is especially tedious as I am having additional problems with my preview page being way, way, too long.&nbsp; I have asked about that as a separate question.)&nbsp; I thought that you used to be able to hit the page-up or page down
 button--or something like that, to get to the next page.&nbsp; Has this been changed?&nbsp; Does anyone know a way to scroll faster through the preview pages without having to scroll to the bottom and hit the next page button, and then scroll up?

<p>I have the "Print Preview and Print" icon on my Quick Access Menu.&nbsp; My document (and/or Excel sheet) is set on 100%.&nbsp; I hit the Print Preview and Print Icon.&nbsp; The preview window opens.&nbsp; I have to scroll down a little over one full screen to even see the
 beginning of the first page of my document.&nbsp; In Word, it will let me see 2 pages together, one under the under.&nbsp; In Excel I only get one page at a time. Lot more scrolling to get to the bottom of the page.&nbsp; Then scroll down a little over one full screen to
 get to the little arrow-number button to see the next page.&nbsp; I can use the page up and page down buttons instead of scrolling but it moves in big leaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, it is like the print preview screen has gotten way too long.&nbsp; It wasn't that way before.</p>

<p>Can you show us a screen shot of the screen as it appears through the use of the Print Preview and Print button.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Due to the fact that the print area in Excel can exceed the page width, it is a completely different situation from that in Word where all of the text of the document will (normally) fit within the width of the paper. &nbsp;</p>

<div>=vlookup(B2,Sheet1!C3:E97,3,0)</div>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;<br />
I notice that "vlookup" is in lowercase.&nbsp; If you copy-and-pasted from the Formula Bar, as you should, that means that Excel does recognize the function name.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the cell was formatted as Text before you entered the formula.&nbsp; Change the format to General.&nbsp; Then press F2, then Enter to re-enter the formula.<br />
<br />
If that does now work....<br />
<br />
I notice that the line with "=vlookup" in your posting has a space to the left.&nbsp; Jeeped already mentioned that.&nbsp; Are you sure there isn't one in the worksheet?<br />
<br />
If not a bona fide space, perhaps a non-breaking space (ASCII 160).&nbsp; This sometimes comes from copying and pasting from a webpage.<br />
<br />
If not, is there an apostrophe (aka single-quote) to the left of "=vlookup"?<br />
<br />
In either case, try copying the text from "=" to the right, delete the cell contents, and paste what you copied into the cell.<br />
<br />

</p><p>I went into Word options on a network on the office and chose the " pasting from other programs" default paste option under Advanced to have paste be "merge formatting" from other programs...like when I copy from outlook to word (if outlook is Calibri 11
 and word is times new roman 12) when I do a paste from outlook to word I want text pasted automatically in times new roman 12</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works on my laptop but does not work in the office on network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any assistance here appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>If you are saying that the option reverts to something else as you exit and restart Word, it hasn't been saved properly to the Windows registry. Try deleting Word's registry entries (with Word closed) as discussed in the article at
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/921541/how-to-troubleshoot-problems-that-occur-when-you-start-or-use-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/921541/how-to-troubleshoot-problems-that-occur-when-you-start-or-use-word</a> and then restart Word and re-select the options you want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that in a corporate environment you may be prevented from writing to certain registry entries. For example, this could be set via so-called group policies.</p>

    <title>Getting Rid of Sidebar Numbers and Text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting Rid of Sidebar Numbers and Text</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with formatting in Word. I have tried 2 different versions of Word on 2 different computers, both running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a journalist and conduct a lot of interviews. When I get backlogged, I outsource the transcription to professional transcriptionists, and I currently have 4 raw transcripts I've gotten back from them that I need to turn into polished interviews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, for some reason (likely the transcription software), the documents all have numbers (line numbers, I believe) for each line running down the left-hand side of each page. Also, the questions and answers are all marked with q's and a's, which
 I do not need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying many things to copy just the text and get rid of the numbers and q's and a's without removing all of them by hand.&nbsp; I was thinking that pasting and selecting "keep text only" one time had worked, but it's definitely not working now. I
 have also played around with Google Docs and Zoho to see is another program would do any better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any tips?</p>

            <p>If the line numbers have been created using the Line Numbers feature in Word, you can remove them just by disabling this feature (on the
<strong>Layout</strong> tab of <strong>Page Setup</strong>). More likely, however, if the transcripts were prepared by legal transcriptionists, the line numbers are in a text box anchored to the header. Access the header by double-clicking in the header area;
 select the text box and delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Q's and A's, if the transcriptionist was knowledgeable, she might have used Q-and-A styles (as described in
<span><a href="http://WordFAQs.mvps.org/QandA2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://WordFAQs.mvps.org/QandA2007.htm</span></a></span>), using Q and A as bullets. If so, you could remove them by modifying the styles
 not to have these bullets. If the Q and A were typed, however, then you can just use Replace to search for Q and any following space (a tab character, for example) and replace with nothing, then repeat for A and following space.</p>
