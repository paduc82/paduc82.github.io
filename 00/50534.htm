            <p><span>Hi Withy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you performed a <strong>refresh</strong> of Windows 10, <strong>upgrade</strong> to Windows 10, or a
<strong>custom install</strong> of Windows 10 on the same partition as the previous Windows installation without doing a
<strong>clean install</strong>, then you will have a <strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder in your new installation afterwards. The
<strong>Windows.old</strong> folder contains a copy of the previous Windows installation, and can be quite large in size.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Be sure to copy any files that you may want out of the
<strong>Windows.old</strong> folder before you delete it. Once deleted, they are gone.</span></p>

            It should disappear after 30 days since it is for returning to your previous windows, but you can use Windows Disk Cleanup to delete it in Cleanup System files.&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Unusually high consistent CPU usage rate.</h2>
                    I have 2 Surface Pro 4s and I've been noticing that sometimes they will spike in their CPU usage rate above 92%, Its a lot more frequent with one then the other. On my personal one I haven't noticed anything malicious. I've opened up task manager and just
 watched what is exactly taking up so much usage. OneDrive seems to be the killer, running at around 30% consistently, some others that come up antimalware service executable (I'm not exactly sure what this is, I'm thinking windows defender maybe?), Microsoft
 Windows search index (again not sure what this is) and Microsoft word as well sometimes spiking at 30% like OneDrive. Does anyone have any answers was there maybe some sort of update to windows not long ago that could be causing this. The other day my surface
 4 locked up with a total black screen and I could only see the cursor, I tried many different solutions but nothing seemed to work on it, I eventually hard reset it, by holding the shutdown button for a long time, and it worke

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the inconvenience, There is only one reason why this is happening: There are many unwanted apps running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to make sure if the device is in good shape:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the current operating system version of the surface device that you are using?</li><li>When you said that you performed a reset to the device using the 2 button shutdown did you place the device back to default? wiping out all the data on the device?</li></ol>
<p>As far as we are seeing the issue, there might be a great need for us to do a reinstallation of the Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back on us as soon as you get everything sorted out. We will be more than happy to be getting back on you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, </p>

<h2>            All Windows 10 devices with 16 GB eMMC as C drive stuck on 10240 pre TH2 - devices cannot be updated</h2>
                    <p>It seems that <strong>all Windows 10 devices with 16 GB eMMC</strong> as C drive are stuck on Windows 10 initial release (<strong>10240)</strong> and
<strong>cannot upgrade to TH2</strong> (<strong>10586</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade cannot be done <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">even if external memory is attached</span>, because the update procedure asks for about 5 GB disk space on drive C. Freeing 5 GB on C is unfeasible on those devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: The updgrade <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">from Win 8.1 to Win 10 went fine with external memory attached</span> and as little as 800 MB free disk space on drice C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now presumably hundreds of thousends of Windows 10 devices (mostly tablets and 2-in-1s) are stuck pre TH2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way to upgrade (not re-install) those devices, please advise!</p>
<p>

<p>This reply is of no use. Kindly fix this issue plaguing users with 16 GB tablets.</p>

</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I just called up Microsoft India support and talked to one of the Customer support representative Mr.&nbsp;Rahul and his response was that Microsoft does not officially support&nbsp;tablets having screen sizes of less than 10 inches?!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then transferred my call to the Microsoft Lumia section!! This is clear case of incompetence on MS's part.</p>

            <p>I wonder, if the problem has been recognized and fully understood by Microsoft in the meantime.</p>
<p>The bulk of standard (not helpful) aswers that have been posted by MVPs show that this is not yet the case. Of course MVPs are not Microsoft. However, they often provide a communications path to help problems emerge in Microsofts awareness.</p>

            what Microsoft have to do is go back to basics ie make the upgrade overwrite old files instead of creating these stupid shadow copies of windows that take up X amount of gigs on the said storage device. and my advice for people with tablets was always
 a fresh install from the media creation tools option to create&nbsp; a install media flash drive&nbsp; that installed a fresh install strait to 1511 but I guess people moaned to much as they had to reinstall a&nbsp; game or 2 or back up a picture or&nbsp; 2. I guess&nbsp; the end
 users these days&nbsp; have become far to demanding.&nbsp; would love to see them using win 95 / 98 / 98se&nbsp; or ME &nbsp;ect&nbsp; :)

            <p>@Trevor. Well, yes. However, my external storage has 32 GB and even that is not enough for an update because they write about additional 5 GB to the C drive during the update. MS has to look into *that* issue in particular!</p>

            The inplace upgrade&nbsp;basically&nbsp; wrote your&nbsp; windows 8 into a windows.old&nbsp; folder on that disk then wrote your windows 10 installation on the other where there was space for it. That you will get away with as windows 10 didn't have to use any of the old
 windows 8 system files to run.

<p>
</p><p>1. The issue started immediately after installation. There have never been updates after the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>2. I have made no changes. I followed the error message advice under Settings-&gt;Windwos Update: "There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information,
 this may help: (0x80240437)"</p>
<p>3.There are no error messages or error codes on the screen.</p>
<p>However, I followed your suggestion under Method 1. Automatic Upgrades were already enabled. Here was the message under Update History:&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Same problem with me ..... i run&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro 64bit too.<br />
Update doesn't download at all or stop's. Also the same error code.<br />
Looks like this started after a Defender update.<br />
Defender doesn't auto update anymore too.... it keeps busy downloading&nbsp;a new definition file&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A powercycle might be your best option, hold power button for 10 seconds until console turns off and then unplug for 10 seconds. After that fire it back up and try it out.</p>
<p>1- Try to reset the xbox and see if so when you start update the status of the game</p>
<p>2- Go to manage game data and check that it is installed or pending installation.</p>
<p>3- Uninstall the game and restart the xbox</p>
<p>4-Install the games and then install all the updates, be careful not to install any updates before the game.</p>

                    <p>My computer automatically updated - I think it was a browser update. Upon restarting, it goes to a blue screen I’ve never seen before.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I’ve went through the options, and can’t get anything to work. System restore doesn’t work - it just cycles back to the blue screen. I was able to get to the command prompt, which displayed this</p>

            Hi Lisa.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please know that MVP's are pressing Microsoft harder now on these disastrous version Upgrades. After you're back up and running, you can also complain to developers in Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where they are tasked to process Consumer feedback, but they will not even see it here as this is a tech forums where volunteers try to solve your problems.
<br />
<br />In cases similar to yours which we're escalating right now, that Rollback screen you're getting doesn't seem to even apply here since nothing on it works, it may be a legacy screen interfering with the actual Go Back to old Version needed here.
<br />
<br />To test this create the bootable media which is always the most stable method for repairs anyway. 
<br />
<br />To test this create the bootable media to try the repairs from it, which is always most stable anyway, to try to Go back to Old Version. If it also fails then you can try the Reset or use the media to Clean Install with our help. 
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then More Options, then Go back.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot options to try Reset. 
<br />
<br />If these fail proceed with the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Close out repairs and try Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

                    <span>Every time I Install MX GP 3, or Observer from Game Pass and try to start them up, all I get is the Game Screen title then a black screen. I have to quite the game to get rid of the black screen but once that's done if I try to start anything my
 console just crashes, as if the power had just been cut. This is the third game this has happened with on Game Pass, It first happened last month, but I had uninstalled the games it happened with and never tried to install them again until now. And again,
 Observer again, has the exact same thing happening. Start Game, the Game title comes up for about 20sec then black screen, and it just stays black until I quit it. But as soon as I quit the game and go back to my home page, whatever app or game I try to use
 next just crashes my console as if the power has been cut. I have only ever experienced this with three Games on Game Pass, MX GP 3, Observer and cant quite remember what title the other one was but reported it at the time on the xbox, but you get no feedback
 from that and the problem still happening over a month later. I am using a Xbox one X and on the Beta Ring, And installing them onto the original internal hard drive. but its only ever happened with 3 game pass games so far.</span>

<p>If the power reset doesn't work, are you using an external hard drive, or are they only installed on internal?&nbsp; Before you launch the game, could you check if there are any game updates in My Games &amp; Apps or System Updates in Settings?&nbsp;</p>

            I've been having this same issue with _observer since the game was released.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it's because I'm in Alpha Skip Ahead or if it was a bad update on the game developers part.&nbsp; I really wanted to play through this game since it looked really
 interesting but it literally forces my xbox to shut off.&nbsp; Hopefully they can find a fix for it at some point!

<p>Since it is on an insider build, we can't say that normal troubleshooting steps would solve the issue, and your best bet is to reach out on the<a href="http://reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox Insiders Subreddit</a>.&nbsp; I know
 it's a non-answer, but that will get other people to comment if they've had the same issue or if they have resolutions, and better visibility and communication with the insider development team to investigate if it is an issue with insider builds, or an application
 issue.&nbsp; Since there is no real way for us to test or rule out if it is a platform, game, or Insider issue, the Insider channels are the best source for you to get help.</p>

<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reporting through the dashboard</a>, and the Xbox Insider Subreddit are going to get it visible to Insider dev team, and you might also
 want to reach out to the developers for if they have further troubleshooting, or if it's an issue they need to investigate for the Xbox One build.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 from PDC does not work, unable to contact Microsoft support &#40;PID problem.&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I received a free Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 from the PDC yesterday, and it does not work at all—either on Windows 7 x64 or Windows XP x86,&nbsp;with or without the correct drivers. I tried contacting support online, and when I entered the PID, I got this
 error message: <br />
<br />
"The product ID number you entered is not supported in the country that you have selected. Enter another product ID number or select a different support option below."<br />
<br />
Would it even be possible to recieve support for this product, and if so, how would I go about it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help,<br />
Matt

<p>Frontier&nbsp;may have&nbsp;custom firmware for this device.</p>
<p>Certain firmware versions have been known to have issues that results in "Live Connection Error" and "MTU".&nbsp; Try disabling UPnP and enabling Port Forwarding for port 3074.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>******If the above doesn't work*******</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try assigning the Gateway a DHCP range up to 192.168.254.100 and assign the Xbox an IP address outside of that range manually, i.e. 192.168.254.150</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assign a DHCP range of 192.168.254.100-192.168.254.150 follow the following steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a web browser. </li><li>Log into the router by entering the default gateway, <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</li><li>The router will then prompt you to enter the username and password. There is no username and the default password is 1234, unless you are a Frontier customer in which case the login information is username “user” and password “admin”.
</li><li>Select Advanced Setup from the menu on the left. </li><li>Select LAN from the submenu. </li><li>Set the last set of numbers in Start IP Address to 100. </li><li>Set the last set of numbers in End IP Address to 150. </li><li>Click the Save/Reboot button at the bottom. </li></ol>

            Hi CindyTaylor518
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />If you want to set up a new Skype, that will have to be done under a new Microsoft account. So, you will have to create a new Microsoft account using a new mail ID.
<br />
<br />How do I create a new account for Skype? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12413/how-do-i-create-a-new-account-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12413/how-do...</a> 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi RobertEaton2 ,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />If you purchased a 12 month Skype Subscription calling plan, then unfortunately no. You can find out more about your purchase by doing the following:-
<br />
<br />1. Sign-in to your Skype account on this page (top-right of page):-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/</a>
<br />You should be braught onto a 'My Account' page
<br />
<br />2. To the left it will state your active subscriptions, and below that you can Select 'Purchase History'.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<h2>            Unable to retrieve old files of Turbo Tax after resetting Windows 10</h2>
                    I had TurboTax from the past 7 years on my PC with Windows 10.&nbsp; It got wonky so I had to reset it.&nbsp; Now none of the shortcuts will work and I had substantial progress on my 2018 return.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reset says it will keep your files, but apparently
 not.

            Hi Perry.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this an installed program or being run from TurboTax website?  
<br />
<br />If installed I would uninstall in Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart PC and then reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />Then to open the files browse to them from the app to open each one.  You can also find the files in their location where TT stores them, right click one to Open With and then choose Turbo Tax for all files of that type. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h2>            Now have both windows 7 and 10 running at the same time</h2>
                    <p>Did the install and now when I turn on the laptop I see both the spinning ball and the circle of dots during the boot up.&nbsp; The sign in screen is Windows 10 but when the desktop comes up it flashes at about once a second between a windows 7 desktop and a
 window 10 version.&nbsp; I never see the application tiles, but do have an incomplete taskbar for Windows 10 at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I am not able to do much other than run task manager, and shut the system down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues as to what I need to do to resolve this </p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop is useless at this point.</p>

                    I have a file that has been put into the virus chest in Avast under IDP.generic. I've tried looking up on the internet whether I should allow the file or not but not getting clear answers. What must I do?
