<p>Hi Pam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no import functionality in Sway for Google Photos or Google Drive.&nbsp; However, you can select and copy the images in your browser and then paste them into a Sway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Embedding Infogram in Sway</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to embed an Infogram table into a Sway project but I get the message: "Sorry, we do not currently support this site. Please look at the more information link above for a list of supported sites." The site with the list of supported sites
 includes Infogram!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched this problem in the Microsoft community, and I saw an answer that the code chosen from Infogram has to be the "fixed" option that includes &lt;iframe&gt; However, while the "fixed" code does have&nbsp;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen at the beginning, it does not
 close with &lt;iframe&gt; but rather &gt;Infogram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact embed code you're trying to use?&nbsp; Sway won't pay attention wo the &lt;a&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags, just what's in the &lt;iframe&gt; tag.</p>

            Using "infogr.am" instead of "infogram.com" in embeded codes worked like a charm.

<h2>            Windows phone app for desktop not detecting my Nokia Lumia 520</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a big issue. My windows phone app for desktop is not detecting my Nokia Lumia 520.</p>
<p>I run Windows 7 x64, installed all the drivers need it... restarted everything many times, many attempts.. the phone the computer. I'm not a noob, but I just can't make this program to work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I connect my Nokia to the computer, I can see the device in Computer, and I can access both phone memory and sd card.. but, the Windows Phone App for desktop doesn't detect it.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just get the white screen with blue writing asking me to connect my phone. I connect my phone, nothing is happening.</p>
<p>When I press the link "Can't find your phone?".. an IE window is opening and there I can see my Nokia Lumia, but still the software on the computer doesn't detect it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried everything, I don't expect answers like: please reinstall the app, or, please reinstall the drivers, please restart your computer and phone because I'm here just because I went through all this and is not working!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is very frustrating!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anybody has any idea?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Samyaza69,
<div><br />
<div>This has been a common issue since the application was released for the desktop in Windows 8 for the Windows Phone all together. The technicians are working diligently to resolve the issues causing the problems between the phone and the Windows software.
 Don't be alarmed, you can still use your PC and Windows to synchronize your phone and also manage the device as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Simply plug it in like normal, and then you want to select the option to "Browse files" under the menu that should automatically prompt you once the phone is connected. If the window appears referring to the application to download, that is fine, just
 simply ignore the window all together because it will not close by default. Minimize it to the bottom of the screen and proceed within Windows Explorer to manually view and manage your files between the two devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this provided some clarification, and I am glad to be of assistance.</div>

<h2>            Cortana on invoke responds to some queries &#40;what time is it&#41; but silently fails on others &#40;i heart radio, play latest news&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using cortana on an invoke.&nbsp; If I ask "cortana, what time is it?"&nbsp; I get the right answer.</p>
<p>If I say "Cortana, play the latest news" or "Cortana, play piano music", I get silence.&nbsp; In both cases, these skills used to work fine.&nbsp; The first would usually play a top-of-the-hour news summary from NPR, and the latter would ask I Heart Radio to create
 and play a station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these skills work when using cortana on my iphone under the same microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without any error message, I have no idea whether this is a temporary problem or a configuration problem that is permanent until I take some action.&nbsp; And, without any sort of error indication, I have no idea what that action might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get some sort of status information about cortana?&nbsp; In the cortana app on my phone, I can see the 'About' information describing the configuration and address of the invoke, but I don't see any current status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, none of the Category options under this question seem relevant.&nbsp; There's no general 'Cortana' category.&nbsp; Naturally, there's no Invoke category.&nbsp; There's no 'Other' category.&nbsp; The GUI here requires that I enter some sort of category.&nbsp; Sigh.</p>

<h2>            Master slides format is not applying to pasted slides</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create Master slides so I can copy presentations that were created previously, and have the new color and formatting automatically applied to the slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a "New Layout" PPT and edited the master slides (formatting, font, text size and color) and saved these changes.&nbsp; When I copy slides from a different presentation into this new presentation using the destination theme, no formatting changes
 that were made to the Master slides are applied, and when I go back into the Master slides, the changes I made previously to the Master slides have reverted back to what they were.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be causing my master slides to revert, and what can I do to create a "Template Deck" where when I paste slides from one presentation into it, the slides will be updated with the new formatting, color, font, etc?</p>

<p>I've never seen a Slide Master or Slide Layout change formatting because of slides pasted into a presentation. Assuming there is a master formatting problem, here's a article that describes the best order in which to create the elements of a template. Following
 this should get you better results, unless there is some program problem that needs an Office repair:
<a href="http://www.brandwares.com/bestpractices/2017/01/powerpoint-construction-best-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PowerPoint Construction - Brandwares Best Practices</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When slides are pasted in, the layout on which that slide is based must have <em>
exactly</em> the same name in both the host and receiving presentations. If they don't PowerPoint has no idea which layout to apply. In that case, while the slide is still selected, choose a layout for it. If the slide doesn't reformat, click on the
<strong>Home&gt;Slides&gt;Reset</strong> button to update the slide with the chosen layout.<br />

<p>No, I had gone from an IMAP host to Office365 and 5hen back to the IMAP host, it was still working fine.&nbsp; There was a Windows 10 update before I noticed this.&nbsp; Also, Outlook was acting strange.&nbsp; Yesterday, email was "stuck" in my outbox. Closing and reopening
 Outlook causes it to send.&nbsp; Today, this morning, my incoming mail would not download, but it was visilble in my web-based email.&nbsp; I removed Outlook and re-installed it. My email problems disapeared but the "View Settings" menu is still gone.</p>

    <title>Phantom screen when dragging Excel 2016 window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom screen when dragging Excel 2016 window</h2>
                    <div>My company&nbsp;recently upgraded everybody&nbsp;to Windows 10 and coming along for the ride was an installation of Office 365... specifically Excel 2016.&nbsp; For some reason, and with no rhyme or reason to when, when&nbsp;I try to "un-snap" and drag the Excel window to
 my other monitor&nbsp;I can get a phantom grayed-out window that will hang in the original location.&nbsp; The only way to get rid of it is to drag the active window back over the phantom window and let them "re-join" into one.&nbsp; Does anybody&nbsp; know why Excel is doing
 this?&nbsp; It's almost like when you minimize an individual Excel workbook and get the gray master window in which you can tile multiple Excel instances...only the instance pulls away from the window and leaves this phantom hanging in its place.</div>

    <title>Play Video After Animation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irarabinowitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Play Video After Animation</h2>
                    <p>I have a full screen mp4 local&nbsp; video background. I placed 2 book marks on it. I want the book marks to trigger a fade in and fade out animation of another mp4 local video to play overlaying part of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get the video to fade in and fade out but I can't get it to play. If I select Video Tools -&gt; Playback -&gt;Start automatically it removes my animation and the video plays but that's not what I want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want it not to appear at the beginning but using animation and bookmark trigger to fade in later and then play automatically.&nbsp; I can put a play animation and a trigger to the bookmark but then the video appears at the beginning of the slide and starts
 playing when the trigger is triggered. I can not figure out a way to do this. </p>
<p>

<p>I got it working! </p>
<p>You have to add an animation then play with the order and the start with settings.I was clicking the choice in Animation&nbsp; instead of Add Animation. So it removed the play and added the animation. That works with text but for video you must use Add Animation.</p>

    <title>How do I get Word to ignore the fact that its working with a document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jader3rd  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Word to ignore the fact that its working with a document that&#39;s in a OneDrive folder</h2>
                    <p>I want Word to be completely ignorant of the fact that the document it has open is in my OneDrive folder. 99% of the time I interact with this document on one computer. I want Word to save the document to the disk and then OneDrive do the syncing and Word
 needs to be oblivious to the syncing. I lost about 5 paragraphs worth of work from yesterday while my networking was poor. Word did put up some sort of dialog yesterday about trying to save to OneDrive. I left it alone. Because Word should save to the local
 hard drive and then let OneDrive worry about the syncing.</p>
<p>Today when I opened my document, I was disappointed to see that the last 5 paragraphs was missing, and that they wouldn't have been missing if I hadn't been using OneDrive.</p>
<p>The fact that I'm using OneDrive shouldn't be resulting in data loss!</p>

<p>If you're opening from and saving to the OneDrive folder on your hard drive, Word (and OneDrive)
<strong>cannot</strong> "ignore" the fact that you're syncing to the cloud. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution for you is to use an add-in such as the one from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/SaveInTwoPlacesAddIn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/SaveInTwoPlacesAddIn.htm</a>. With that add-in active, you must always open the
 document from your local (non-OneDrive) documents folder, and configure the add-in to save to that local folder first, and only secondarily to the OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something goes pear-shaped with OneDrive in that scenario, the only effect will be that the document may not be complete when opened on another computer from OneDrive. The file in your local-only folder will still be intact and can be re-saved to the
 OneDrive folder.</p>

<p>Mickey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I'm not certain what the intended behavior for these settings might be&nbsp;when a major Windows 10 update occurs, I suspect that this is what is causing the settings to return to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In earlier upgrades the Windows 10 privacy settings had sometimes returned to defaults, causing those concerned about these settings to complain, with changes to the handling for these made during later updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know that I'd depend upon any settings being retained through a significant update process, simply because that would require specifically preserving their state in a separate database and then returning them to the previous state after the update
 completes.&nbsp; This isn't always going to be desired when the update process is attempting to fix issues with the underlying code that may include changes to the portions which actually perform the operations the settings control.</p>

    <title>MS Project 2010 delete task duration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ð’ð¸ñ‚ð°ð»ð¸ð¹1812  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project 2010 delete task duration</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
In MS Project 2010 for a <span style="font-weight: bold">manually scheduled task</span> I set task duration and resources. Just after adding a start/end date to the task MS Project resets (clears) the task duration and work automatically to 0 (zero) hours (days).
<br />
<br />
What could be the reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div>I do not get that behavior but then it seems a little backwards to first enter a duration and assign a resource and then enter start and finish dates. Nonetheless when I set up a sample task in manual mode and enter the parameters as you indicate, the
 duration and work are recalculated to match the entered values for start and finish. Duration and work do NOT go to zero.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My first question is, do you have SP1 installed? If not, you can get it at,&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587.</div>

<div>Okay, that's a little different dragon to slay. Could be a specific sequence or other uniqueness to the tasks that show the problem or it could be file corruption.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you can recreate a test scenario wherein it always occurs, then it will be easier to try and troubleshoot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it is due to some form of file corruption, oftentimes (but not always) saving the file to XML and then re-opening in Project will clear corruption. It's worth a try.</div>

            Thanks again, John.<br />
<br />
<p><span>I suppose the problem may be caused by my MS Project 2010 local copy been corrupted, because there are not any other obvious and reasonable causes such a strange error. Trying to create another file from scratch does not produce stable outcome - sometimes
 everything seems goes without a hitch, but suddenly the problem reappears.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Suppose I need to reinstall my local MS Project copy.</span></p>

<div>Since this is an inconsistent issue, (i.e. caused by some unique combination of things), it's possible it was addressed by a hot fix. You might want to check the download site at,&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ee748587, and read what issues
 the various hotfixes address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another possibility is a corrupt user profile. I've never experienced a corrupt profile, (as least that I know), but I've read several other posts wherein a corrupt user profile can cause strange behavior with Project (e.g. suddenly can't switch between
 manual and auto schedule mode). For information on how to fix a corrupt profile see,&nbsp;<span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></div>

            I'm afraid you can't. Palm devices (depending on them model/age, run the PalmOS operating system, or Microsoft's Windows Mobile).<br />
<br />
The N95 is based on S60 and Symbian operating system, and cannot run Palm or Windows applications. I also do not know of any Palm emulators that'd help.<br />
<br />
As there are probably 200 million Symbian based devices on the market (Nokia alone, sold something like 70 million of them last year), you could also contact the software developers for Palm applications, and request them to make S60/Symbian versions of rheir
 applications, if they haven't already. I think the Symbian market is big enough (certainly much, much bigger than the Palm device market).<br />
<br />
Note also, that Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) applications run on the N95.

 to market", said Elisabet Melin, VP Marketing, UIQ Technology AB.<br />

<p>I would like to add a folder (and subfolders) to favorites in the outlook 2016 application. &nbsp;When I add the public folder to my favorites it does not pull / bring the subfolders of main folder. &nbsp;Is this by design, or is there something else I can do to get
 this to work?</p>

<p>Hi MattStaude,</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the screenshots. I totally understand your requirement.</p>
<p>After doing some tests on my side and consulting our related team, I confirm itâ€™s by design.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if the subfolders can be added to Favorites together with the main public folder. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:

    <title>Nokia 6131 SMS issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> forbes30  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6131 SMS issue</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need your support to solve a problem with my phone company in a conflict over some SMS overcharge. I sent a SMS to a group of about 20pers. My company register and charge my from this SMS with about 1500 SMS (!??). Looking on a detail list of my calls
 and SMS I discover that they charge me with this SMS's in only 3hours like this: first is started with about 150 SMS to only one number, next normal to some 3-4 numbers than again 500 SMS to the 6th number than normal again to another 3-4 numbers, next another
 400-500 to another single number, and so one for about 3hours. After I file the claim they told me that is my phone problem either due to accidentally activation of send button, which is impossible as I have a clamshell 6131 or due to phone program error.
 My question is if this is possible, to have this problem due to some phone errors, and the phone will send this amount of SMS and in an random matter. I need to tell you that I have a&nbsp; N 6131, with soft V 03.50 31.03.2006 RM 115. Also in that period the phone
 company experience a lot of problems and blackouts due to the overload of his network.</p>

<p>I find it extremely doubtful that your phone would send that many messages. I think you need to take up the issue with your consumer watchdog association in your country (whatever they are called). And let them know of your experience with your telco, and
 they can advise you from there. There's not much else I can suggest, as this is a forum for phone problems only, and by the look of things, yours is not a phone problem, but rather with your phone company.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew. I know that this is the issue that I have to solve with phone company. What I want to find out is if some one experience following technical issue: It's possible at a Nokia Terminal if you try to send and SMS and due to congestion of network the
 SMS is not send than the phone will keep try to send this SMS? And when the congestion is over and the phone will send only one, original SMS or all SMS, as much as he tried until he could send it? In other words is he try for 100 times to send the SMS, than
 when the network is working fine he will send one SMS or 100? Is this scenario possible?</p>

<p>Ideally, the phone should send the sms only once even though you've tried many times. But, due to problems in the network, your sms would've been sent earlier, either in part or completely but it still shows up in the outbox, waiting to be sent. In that
 case, it might've reached the Telco's servers multiple times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i said is only a rare possibility, as, from my experience, the phone would try thrice before labeling it as failed, and when the network is fine and I send the message, it will go in the first try itself. The person at the other end will receive the
 message only once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are problems in the interface between two telcos then we might end up receiving the same message many times - I frequently experience this phenomenon when a friend of mine who uses a different operator sends texts to my Vodafone number</p>

            Hi!<br />
<br />
It will beep every time you press the camera shutter button whilst talking.<br />
<br />
Check next time you make a call that you're not accidentally pressing the camera shutter button - it's very easy to do!

<h2>            Sway editing on iPhone app</h2>
                    <p>I can only work out how to post photos / text on my sway on the iphone app but not how to open it in full edit mode - would like to change the font etc. There isn't an obvious button to press. It only allows me to change the whole theme but my latest post
 is in a different font.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to be able to make other changes (like font), you'll need to open sway.com in a browser on a desktop/laptop/tablet.&nbsp; The iOS supports most Sway functionality, but not yet all.</p>

    <title>9926 not installing on Surfsace Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bensmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            9926 not installing on Surfsace Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Not sure what is happening. Been through several loops of the 9926 Windows 10 update being installed via WU, only for it to revert to the previous OS (8.1) during the setting up your PC phase of installing Windows 10. No failure info is given - WU reported
 the installation was successful, even through it is clearly not. Kinda a groundhogs day problem. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx, </p>
