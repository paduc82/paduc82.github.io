<h2>            Setup Dual Boot after Win 10 is installed - need to download HDV files via firewire</h2>
                    <p>Today I discovered that Win 10 does not support Firewire connections to my Camcorder. Though the IEEE 1394 host controllers is listed in Device Manager and indented is VIA 1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller, the Canon Vixia HV30 cannot be recognized by
 software installed in Win 10. When I plug in the cable, I see the OS saying Vixia HV30 is being installed but it is not recognized by either Canon or Adobe software. Canon has validated that Windows no longer supports Firewire connected devices. They said
 the last Win OS to support firewire was Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I do not currently have a dual boot setup and all I read says I must install Win 7 first and then Win 10 to achieve a successful dual boot. I need to have Win 7 so I can download a number of HDV cassette videos to my hard drive. Can I
 just disconnect my Win 10 boot up drive and install my legal version of Win 7 on a spare drive, download my files, disconnect the spare drive with Win 7 and then reinstall my Win 10 disk drive?</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to make dual boot on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with you that for having dual boot first we need to install lower version of OS on one drive then we can install the upper version on other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer's hard disk has adequate free disk space, you can install a newer version of Windows on a separate partition and keep the earlier version of Windows on your computer. This is called a
<span>multiboot</span> or <span>dual-boot</span> configuration. Whenever you start your computer, you can then choose which version of Windows to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the article mentioned below to make dual boot on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/install-multiple-operating-system-multiboot#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Install more than one operating system (multiboot)</span></strong> &nbsp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do feel free to post on the forum if you have any more concern related to Windows. We will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Something not Kosher here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dual boot system: Windows 8.1 and Windows 10(240). </p>
<p>It has a WD Passport drive connected by Firewire IEE 1394 SBP2. No problems. I have been using it for the past years on Windows 8.1 as a backup / File History drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an old computer. Firewire 400. Plug has the rounded end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your connection Firewire 800 ? Plug square both ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe that Windows 7 would be an issue other than that was the last version of the software that Canon certified and released. Have you tried running the Canon software in Windows 7 compatibility mode?</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for your reply. It is the rounded plug so must be Firewire 400. After my post I did some added research and found the following article to upgrade Win 8.1 for older firewire.
</p>
<p><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2970191</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately I followed the instructions but it still did not work in Win 10. Perhaps there will be a fix for firewire when Win 10 is released.</p>
<p>I wish to avoid a dual boot on a single drive solution because it took a great deal of time to setup Win 10 on my SSD. To accomplish dual boot I would need to remove Win 10, install Win 7 and then setup dual boot with Win 10. We are so close to final release,
 I think I might already have it, that I hoped to avoid all the time consuming effort to reinstall all my software etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think the other option in my original post would work? <em>"Can I just disconnect my Win 10 boot up drive and install my legal version of Win 7 on a spare drive, download my files, disconnect the spare drive with Win 7 and then reinstall my Win 10
 disk drive?" Do you think this would work?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also check to see if I can do Win 7 compatibility mode in Win 10.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Hi KM KTNN,</p>
<p>Would you try and see if you are able to create Managed Navigation after the Publishing feature is enabled and see the outcome?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Go to Site Settings &gt; under Look and Feel, Navigation &gt; Global Navigation section, select Managed Navigation &gt; Managed Navigation: Term Set section, Create Term Set.</p>
<p>I would explain the default group and term sets automatically created when activating SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure feature are used for managed navigation bar and managed metadata column.</p>
<p>So, as for the Wiki Categories, the term set is mostly applied to, as mentioned above, managed metadata column in the Pages library underneath Enterprise Wiki site, we are able to&nbsp; accordingly create a term set for the column, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

                    I've noticed you can get games, hook up with people, and all kinds of fun stuff. I have been looking for a couple apps that I have been using to save money. They can't be installed on windows phone; Retail me not and another application that helps you
 save money called Stealz, Dunkin donuts app. If I knew there weren't any apps that I used almost daily available, I wouldn't have got this phone. It's fast and all, but it isn't what I want in a phone. As a kid, this would be a great phone.

<p>Have you recently upgraded to&nbsp;/ updated W10, it may require more up to date driver!</p>

<h2>            Excel 2010 A loop to Data Sort</h2>
                    <p>Hello from Steved</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Data Sort</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I use $ "Dollar"Values to sort in Column G:G ie $5.20, $11.70 and $2.70 and sort it to $2.70, $5.20 and $11.70</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In row H:H I copy the numbers from E:E say 1 to 6, 1 to 15, 1 to 10, </p>
<p>so the column wil1 start with 1,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10</p>
<p>0k looking at the above I want a script please that will only&nbsp;Data Sort the cells with say 1 to 6, or 1 to 15, or 1 to 10.</p>
<p>Meaning Data Sort 1 to 6,&nbsp;then Data Sort&nbsp;1 to 15,&nbsp;and then Data Sort&nbsp;1 to 10</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So sorting the $ "Dollars" puts it&nbsp;from the &nbsp;lowest to the Highest </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I may have over 300 rows of this do to hence a macro that will loop please</p>

    <title>entering text with Nokia 2630 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> namaste---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            entering text with Nokia 2630</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I enter text or numbers into the display fields nothing shows up at first, but then when I scroll or jump to the next field the initially entered numbers or letters show up. In other words, when I try to fill in the "to" field nothing appears in box
 until after I move to the "text" box. When entering letters in "text" box, nothing shows up until after I jump back up into the "to" box. By the way, the letter counter (from 1000/1) seems to be working.</p>
<p>Because of this I can't really write text messages since I can't see what I am writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried removing battery for a few minutes, and have also tried menu&gt;settings&gt;configuration&gt;activate default in all apps. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other solutions please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            What email account are you using in Outlook? If you use outlook.com email, the calendar will be available everywhere you open the mailbox. 
<br />
<br />If you use POP or IMAP, you'll need to use a 3rd party utility or an outlook.com account. 
<br />
<br /> If the microsoft account you use for your Office subscription is not in the outlook.com domain (or Hotmail etc), you need to add an outlook.com alias to the account to use it in outlook.

<p>Hello Tracyvan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be an email software which can help you to organize all you emails. However, this is a third party software. We would suggest that you contact the developer of the application to know more
 details about it. Yet, Microsoft do have a mail client application which is Outlook 2016 that would definitely provide you everything you are looking for a mail client application. To know more about this application and where to get this, you may check out

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is a formula of VB question so here's both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Formula if the&nbsp; range is a single column</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=CELL("address",INDEX(A1:A100,MATCH(MAX(A1:A100),A1:A100,0)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's multiple columns. ARRAY formula so CTRL+Shidt+Enter</p>
<p>=ADDRESS(MAX((A1:B20=MAX(A1:B20))*ROW(A1:B20)),MAX((A1:B20=$A$1)*COLUMN(A1:B20)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or in VB</p>
<p>Dim c As Range, Lmax As Double<br />
For Each c In Selection<br />
If c.Value &gt; Lmax Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add = c.Address<br />
End If<br />
Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Rose,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you share with us more details about “docs that are deleted from 
<span>SharePoint permanently delete</span>”? Do you mean permanently delete a file in the second-stage recycle bin? You could share with us some steps about “SharePoint permanently delete”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My understanding is that Recycle bin in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for business are used to store those deleted files for users within certain days. User or Site owner have the chance to restore the deleted files during those days.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If we permanently delete a file in the second-stage recycle bin, we are not able to restore it. To learn more, see the following articles:</p>

                    <p>Hi Running on a Mac OS 10.14.2 Mojave. &nbsp; &nbsp;When my computer wakes up, my One Drive tries to sync files continually even if there are no files to sync. &nbsp; &nbsp;If I pause the syncing and then resume, this clears the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done about this please? &nbsp;Using OneDrive version 18.222.1104.0007</p>

<p><span>Hi Alex_Hamm,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If&nbsp;OneDrive shows&nbsp;“Processing changes" for a long time, it could be because you have an online file open, lots of files stuck in a queue, or a very large file syncing
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If there’s no file stuck in the process and still OneDrive shows “Process change” message, try resetting OneDrive sync app, check if this resolves the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Exit OneDrive.</span></li><li><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find OneDrive in your Applications folder</span></li><li><span>Right-click and select “<strong>Show packaged contents”</strong></span></li><li><span>Navigate into the <strong>Contents/Resources</strong> folder</span></li><li><span>Double tap on <strong>ResetOneDriveStandaloneApp.command.</strong></span></li><li><span><span>Start OneDrive and finish the setup process.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note</strong>: When choosing location, remember to select the previous OneDrive syncing location. This means your files won’t be downloaded again if they haven’t changed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Neha</span></p>

            <p>I looked at the options in that area and they appear to be set correctly - "Keep Source Formatting (Default)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>None would indicate an incorrect setting that results in the requirement of copying twice.</p>

            <p>The fact that you have to copy repeatedly suggests that something is interfering with copy and paste. See if Word behaves if you start it in Safe mode, as part of troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to start in Safe mode: Exit Word if it is currently running. Hold the Ctrl key as you restart Word and click yes when asked about Safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything works properly in Safe mode, further troubleshooting will be required. The first thing that should be investigated is poorly designed add-ins. See

            <p>I tried starting in Safe mode and it still exhibits the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me make sure I've stated the problem clearly (in case there's a misunderstanding).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Word and start a new document</p>
<p>Type 'This is a bulleted item' (without the single quotes) and then hit enter twice</p>
<p>Now, select the entire, single line, paragraph (that was just typed).</p>
<p>In the 'Paragraph' tool menu, push the 'Bullets' button.&nbsp; This should cause this item to become bulleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the bullet itself is unselectable via dragging over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, select the entire, single line, paragraph again.</p>
<p>Press CTL-C</p>
<p>Put the cursor on the empty line two lines below the typed line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press CTL-V</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I can now select (and delete) the bullet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if instead of typing 'CTL-C' and then 'CTL-V', I do 'CTL-C' followed immediately by 'CTL-C' and THEN 'CTL-V', it pastes as a new bulleted item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost like it gets set to 'Paste as Text' and then later gets set back to keep the formatting.&nbsp; Very strange and hoping someone has figured this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to come and go, but I don't know that I'm doing anything differently.</p>

            I don't see that happening here. Are you sure that you selected the whole paragraph, up to and including the paragraph mark (¶) as seen in Doug's screen shot? (You can use the ¶ icon on the Home tab to toggle the display of nonprinting marks such as paragraph
 marks.)

            <p>Doug - I agree that's how it _should_ work, but for me it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stefan, yes - I'm selecting the entire paragraph.</p>

            <p>This could be a bug... In some versions of Word, paste options do not work properly if you choose to hide the Paste Options button. Verify that you have the Paste Options button activated.
