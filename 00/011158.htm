    <title>How to change duration without changing start&#47;end date - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change duration without changing start&#47;end date</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I'm currently evaluating a trial version of Microsoft Project Pro 2013, and I have a newbie question (apologies if this has been addressed, a preliminary search did not turn up any answers).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to assign tasks to employees where the amount of hours worked is significantly less than the duration of time needed to complete the task. &nbsp;For instance, my executive director will be working 5 hours over the course of a 12 month project. &nbsp;The duration
 should be 12 months, but I only want to allocate 5 of her 2080 total hours. &nbsp;Whenever I enter in the hours the duration changes, when I correct the duration the hours change. &nbsp;Is there any way around this?? &nbsp;(Additionally, I tried to mess with task type, and
 it would not let me change the type).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Again, I'm very new to this software. &nbsp;I appreciate any help that folks here can provide! &nbsp;Thank you!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: your title does not describe what you explain in the question.</p>
<p>First, are we dealing with a manually scheduled task or an automatically scheduled one?</p>
<p>If it is an auto schedules one (looks like) you ARE able to change task type (through Task Information, Advanced). Set it to fixed duration.</p>
<p>Now you can change Work into 5 hours and duration will not change.</p>
<p>For manually schedule tasks duration won't change either.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>I cannot change task type, see attached screenshot. &nbsp;Currently my tasks are set to manually scheduled, however I don't know the consequences of changing that setting so I'm not sure if they NEED to be manual. &nbsp;Please advise. &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You now have to explain hat you mean by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Whenever I enter in the hours the duration changes"</p>
<p>What do you mean by "the hours"? Hours is not a field known to Project. I assumed you meant Work, but changing work on a manually scheduled task does not change duration. Do you change duration? Then it's quite normal duration changes, and duration directly
 influences finish date, you cannot change that.</p>
<p>But the solution of your problem is : enter the hours worked in the Work column (insert it if necessary), for a manually scheduled task that will not change duration.</p>
<p>Task types only play a part for automatically scheduled tasks.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have a problem regarding those three application while I'm using Windows 10 Build 14971. When I left My Surface Pro 3 idle, randomly those three programs launch by itself. Then I close it and continue to use it. These programs launch only when I left it
 in idle. I wonder did you ever experience this before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and sorry for my bad english.</p>

            <p>If you are trying to submit the Word document to a site and that fails, the reason is likely that the site doesn't accept *.docx files. You will have to choose PDF (and it may be for the best, anyway, if the document isn't supposed to be edited further).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you e-mail a document, you usually have to save it to your hard drive first, then start your e-mail and attach the file. The commands in Word that send a document to e-mail do not work with internet-based e-mail (such as Gmail).</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I am trying to upload (again these would be multiple portals (usually business employment application portals) it tells me to upload - I push the "browse button - it can be a select file button too" and it takes me to my documents directory on my HD.&nbsp;
 I select the file, say okay and it doesn't appear in the portal.&nbsp; If it is a PDF it does but the portal says it will accept a DOCX along with other types of files.</p>

<p>Have you tried this with the Google Chrome browser as well. The Edge browser isn't doing all the things the Internet Explorer browser previously did, but this seems strange. What exactly happens when you try? Are you getting an Error Message when it fails?</p>

 and Excel weren't even in the running. </p>

<h2>            Can I reuse my Office 2007 product key once I reinstall Windows</h2>
                    I had bought a licence/product key for Office 2007 for my laptop. I then experienced problems because its hard drive was faulty, so I changed it and now I have a new one. My question is: will the code be valid to be used again or do I need to purchase
 a new one?

I understand the majority of these issues points towards the Office/Outlook application, but why don't any of the troubleshooting methods resolve or alleviate any of the aforementioned symptoms at all?</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
No one else in my company with this software is receiving this message.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have rebuilt the database 3 times.<br />

I have reinstalled the software twice.</p>

Why doesn't Apple support this software?</p>
<p>
Why doesn't Microsoft support this software?</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Every forum I search regarding Office for Mac results in a never ending loop of both companies panning the issue off to the other and nobody takes responsibility.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Is there anyone out there willing to take the time to assist me and fully exhaust their knowledge to present some sort of solution towards this issue?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I am fully committed to this discussion and will provide any and all information needed in order to fix the issue.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Why are there other users with the same software who are NOT experiencing the same issues?<br />
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
As a last resort, I am aware backing-up the profile/account and restoring the OS is an option. What if this plan of action doesn't solve anything? What if the problem persists?</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
My technical knowledge of Apple/Mac devices is limited, and I would appreciate any advice/suggestions/support on the matter, as this is a high priority issue and I would like to learn from this so as to avoid any similar issues that I may encounter in the future.<br />

            Hi&nbsp;MrEZ3,
<div><br />
<div>I would double check to make sure you're up-to-date. 14.2.4 was only released yesterday, so you're likely no longer up-to-date. You can get the latest update by choosing
<b>Help &gt; Check for Updates</b>&nbsp;inside any Office application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some of your issues really scream corrupt database. Since you're on Exchange, rebuilding the database is the
<b>wrong</b>&nbsp;thing to do. Instead, try creating a new identity and download a fresh mailbox.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>To create a new identity, follow these steps:</span>
<ol>
<li>Quit all applications.</li><li>Hold down the Option key on the keyboard, and then click the&nbsp;<strong>Outlook&nbsp;</strong>icon in the dock. The Microsoft Database Utility will open.<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;You can also access the Microsoft Database Utility by opening the Application folder and then opening the Microsoft Office 2011 folder. Open the Office folder, and then double-click Microsoft Database Utility.app.</li><li>Click the plus [+] sign to add a new identity, and then type a name for the new identity. For example, type&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">New identity</span>.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>

</li><li>Set the newly create identity as the default. To do this, select the newly created identity, click the&nbsp;<strong>Action</strong>&nbsp;button, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Set as Default</strong>.<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>

<br />
</li><li>Quit the Microsoft Database Utility, and then restart Outlook and see whether the problem is resolved.</li></ol>
<br />
<div><br />
<div>It's worth mentioning that if you're installing Office, then updating and using, then reinstalling on top of itself, you might be making the issue worse. You need to be following the steps on the following KB to properly remove Office for Mac 2011 before
 reinstalling:</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>How to completely remove Office for Mac 2011</b></a></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Not doing this can create multiple versions of the same files and cause some really nasty issues. If you've been incorrectly removing Office for Mac, please start with a complete removal and start fresh.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>As for the "<i>Random beeping noise coming from machine</i>", that's&nbsp;<span>very likely related to this thread:</span></div>
<b><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macoutlook/chirping-sound-when-retreiving-data/4e376126-c8a2-4073-bb48-c53d735d501d">Chirping sound when
 retreiving data</a></b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><span>If Outlook was recently installed and configured, it's going to take some time to download the entire mailbox (depending on the mailbox size). The longer this takes, the more likely the fans will kick up.
 In most cases, this goes away after about a day or so.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Hope this answers some questions!</span></div>

</p><p>Please save your data to a USB before trying to update via an ISO,<br />

<p>Installing using an ISO in windows is similar to windows update</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Mix analytics and iPads</h2>
                    
<p>I am impressed with Office Mix and would like to be able to use it with my students. My students use iPads and on recent occasions when I have deployed a Mix to them, the Mix presents as slow and glitchy, will freeze and even occasionally kick students out
 requiring them to sign in again and start over. The analytics are also hit or miss, as sometimes they will register student responses and not others. At a recent Microsoft Innovator training I was told that the Mix analytics will not work with iPad devices.
 Is this something that is true and if so, are there plans to make it accessible to those districts that might be 1:1 iPads? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Trick&#63;&#63; to unhide Excel columns on a touchscreen</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have been using Excel for several versions. I often hide columns to make it easier to see my headings in column A. I know that I must select the columns on either side&nbsp;of the hidden columns then right-click to get the unhide option. My problem is, I
 hid columns on my Windows 7 laptop, but can't unhide them when I open the same&nbsp;file on my Surface touchscreen. No matter what I've tried, using either my finger or a stylus, I can't select adjacent columns. Is there some trick to this that someone can help
 me with? For instance, when I need to use Autofilll, I've found that I can select the cell(s) I want to autofilll, then click again. I then get a menu which contains. the Autofilll option.

<h2>            Outlook data file on my Lenovo Windows 8.1 laptop cannot be located</h2>
                    <p>After receiving a Windows 8.1 update last week, I am unable to restart my laptop, and will have to use a recovery disk.&nbsp; I was able to transfer all files from my laptop hard drive to a free standing hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I subscribe to Office 365, but I maintain an Outlook data file on my hard drive to store emails.&nbsp; I have searched through all of the files now residing on the free standing hard drive, and I cannot find an Outlook.pst file with a last update date of August
 21, 2014, which is the last date that I was able to access emails on the laptop.&nbsp; I can only find one with a last update date of June 6, 2013.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the Outlook data file still have the extension .pst, or has it changed to something else with Office 365?&nbsp; If not, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to find this data file?&nbsp; I have some critical information in that data file, that I need to
 access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a workbook that takes a long time to close. &nbsp;I have figured out that the problem lies with calculations. If the calculation method is manual the file closes in a flash. &nbsp;Is their any way to switch to manual calculation as part of the closing sequence/routine?</p>

            Hello gustavoLitvinoff1 ,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />you can ideally add multiple accounts in your outlook profile however, an issue will occur if, You add both the manager and delegate mailbox accounts in the same Outlook profile as per this article --- <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/981245/issues-that-can-occur-when-you-add-multiple-exchange-accounts-in-the-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/981245...</a>
<br />
<br />the above article has some scenarios and how to fix them. 
<br />
<br />Regarding the error you are seeing, there is an article Microsoft has published, but its mainly for Office 2013. however, you can try to follow the steps as sometimes, the credential manager's cached entries can cause issues as well. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2750229/sorry-another-account-from-your-organization-is-already-signed-in-on-t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/275022...</a>
<br />
<br />I am directing you to the articles, as there is a bit of reading to understand the scenario and you may have different variations in your organizations. so the detailed steps in the article will help you.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if, you have any other queries. 
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

<h3> badfan14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 favorite keys not working on Mac El Capitan</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my Mac to the El Capitan OS (v. 10.11) and my Favorites keys no longer work. The F keys can be programmed in System Preferences, but there is no way to program the Favorites. MS Help says to hold down a Favorite key to pop up the dialog box
 to configure it, but that doesn't do anything either. I have tried reinstalling IntelliType Pro, but still nothing. I've tried with F Lock on and off, again nothing (I'm not even sure F Lock is working).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Category" selections below seem to be for MS software only, but I'm hoping someone out there in MS Office for Mac land will have a suggestion. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: The downloads page for this keyboard indicates support for Mac OS 10.4-10.7. The El Capitan OS is 10.11. Has MS stopped updating its driver for newer versions of the Mac OS? Is that my problem? I've spent an hour on the phone being transferred to
 various MS support sites to try to get an answer, but finally had to give up. Does anyone know where I can get a straight answer on this?</p>

            <p>I deleted Arshad's answer. Obviously you are not using an iPhone or an iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's going to be hit or miss regarding hardware drivers for a brand new operating system. I suspect a number of factors are involved such as age of the product, cost to build-test-deploy a new driver, anticipated demand, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly your hardware didn't change and the driver didn't change. Mac OS X changed. This might be something Apple has to fix, not Microsoft. Be sure to post the same question in Apple discussions.</p>

            &nbsp;Thanks, Jim. That's pretty much what I expected. However, Microsoft is still selling this keyboard, and I can't imagine what kind of problems they're going to run into when people try to attach it to a brand-new iMac, which ships with El Capitan. It seems
 to me someone in Microsoft &nbsp;would have to be working on a driver in a big hurry. I just don't know where to ask. &nbsp;I did ask Apple, of course, with the predictable, and in this case I believe perfectly reasonable, response: &nbsp;call Microsoft .&nbsp;

            <p>I'm using MS Desktop 3000 and I had the same problem and struggled for days and then I got my solution. I switched to a 3rd party software. Try USB Overdrive http://www.usboverdrive.com/. It's a shareware and is free forever. The only limitation is a popup
 notifcation to upgrade when you start your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent upgraded yet but it's something that I will consider if MS didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the good thing about USB Overdrive is that.. it was able to customize buttons that IntelliType didn't allow me to.. For example, now I can customize Number Lock Key (on the number keypad), Insert Button, and everything else. The only problem is.. it
 was not able to detect 5 special hotkeys. Otherwise, it's just perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            Thanks! That's a great tip, which I'll keep handy just in case. My biggest frustration, however, is not being able to use those five Favorites buttons. And I'd really like to avoid yet another third party product on my system. As a pretty basic user, I
 just don't have the tech chops to deal with the potential incompatibilities. For now, I'm going to stick with the plan of trying to get MS to provide the support that a customer is justified to expect.&nbsp;

            Yeah! Actually, I was exactly like that.. I rarely install 3rd party software when the official ones are available.. but I guess exceptions happen. And what i really liked about USB Overdrive is that.. it allowed me to customize the Zoom buttons... that
 option was not there in IntelliType. With USB O I configured it to switch between browser tabs.. (really a life saver for me).

<p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize this is an old topic, but I'm hoping as an MVP forum member, you have at least a bit of clout to get MS to update these drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As already mentioned, El Capitan and later all use System Integrity Protection. No one is allowed to install anything (drivers and other OS tie-ins) to the System folder. The new allowed location is the
<strong>/Library/Extensions/</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps still don't <em>have</em> to be signed. You can run anything you want by right clicking an unsigned app or installer and choosing
<strong>Open</strong>. It's then up to the user to know what they're installing or opening is not potentially harmful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, on to the point. This should be a one day job for an experienced engineer at MS to complete. It truly makes no sense why they won't do it. All they have to do is rearrange the installer so the IntelliType keyboard and mouse kernel drivers get installed
 to, and registered in the&nbsp;<strong>/Library/Extensions/</strong>&nbsp;folder. That's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else is already done. The installer has 64 bit Intel, 32 bit Intel, and PowerPC drivers it can install according to the recognized OS/hardware. Heck, MS can greatly simplify the installer by removing both the PPC and 32 bit Intel drivers. Mountain
 Lion and forward all require a 64 bit startup anyway, so the other two are completely unnecessary for any Mac running ML or later. It wouldn't even be necessary to look determine what OS or hardware is in use as there would only be the 64 bit kernel extension
 to install. For users with older Macs, they can still use version 8.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to rebuild the installer myself, but can't get it to work. Rearranging the&nbsp;Archive.pax.gz file within the separate keyboard and mouse .pkg files was pretty easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a29931e1-fe85-4b1d-b955-0f079f66eae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a29931e1-fe85-4b1d-b955-0f079f66eae1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But when placed back into the main installer and attempting to run IntelliType, it says nothing can be found to install. So there's obviously something else that needs to match (the .bom files?). I lack enough programming experience to figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would a simple job for MS to update this driver and would make Mac&nbsp;users of Microsoft's keyboards very happy. Like me! ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know I can simply switch the keys in the System Preferences so the Command and Option keys are in their normal Mac positions and not use the IntelliType drivers at all. But I use the top row of keys a
<em>lot</em>, and they don't function with the IntelliType driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't use a keyboard mapper such as Karibiner to get all of the top keys to work, either. Without the IntelliType driver, they don't produce a key-code. Without which, you can't assign an action to them.</p>

<p>You can get them to work in High Sierra, but it requires turning System Integrity Protection off. And for all intents and purposes, leaving it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the Mac and hold down the Command+R keys to boot into Recovery mode. Ignore the standard options that appear and go to the top menu bar. Choose Utilities &gt; Terminal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Terminal type:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>csrutil disable</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You should get a message that System Integrity Protection has been successfully disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then type:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>reboot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mac will restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now install IntelliType. The drivers will install and work, but there's one step you have to do manually. And that's to add the startup file to your account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You <em>can</em> reenable SIP by going into Recovery mode again and typing <strong>
csrutil enable</strong>, but because the .kext file is in the System folder, SIP will eventually disable it. Might the next day, a couple of weeks, or a couple of months. Then you have to go through the whole routine again to get IntelliType working. If you
 leave SIP off, the IntelliType drivers will always work. However, you then lack SIP's protection. The OS is essentially back to the security level of Yosemite or earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking into this a bit further, it would be some extra work for MS to rewrite this installer. In the OS after High Sierra, 32 bit apps will not run. Period. The IntelliType installer and uninstaller are both 32 bit, so they'd have to be updated to 64 bit,
 besides changing the install location of MicrosoftKeyboard.kext to the <strong>/Library/Extensions/</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, this is piddly work for a company the size of MS, and there are a <strong>
<em>lot</em></strong> of Mac users who use, and prefer Microsoft's keyboards.</p>

            Hello
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />Well something important to know. In what applications do you have your hotmail.com account set up on the mobile, when you check from the computer do you do it from the web or through the desktop Outlook application?
<br />Where are the inbox rules configured on the web or in any application where you have the account configured?
<br />
<br />Let me know to understand your incident and be able to guide you in the solution.
<br />

<h2>            How do I change the default spacing between bullets or between numbers in a list in a Word template&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want the default bulleted or numbered lists to add space between each item, to differentiate them from the spacing between lines in the text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eg:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Item 1</li></ul>
<p>---</p>
<ul>
<li>Item 2</li></ul>
<p>---</p>

<li>Item 3</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Not&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do this by default, so I don't have to manually deselect the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" checkbox in the Line Spacing tab in the Paragraph window on Word for each bulleted or numbered list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do this in my custom template short of creating a special bullet style?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modify the List Paragraph style by removing the tick from the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" and before dismissing the Modify Style dialog, select the "New documents based on this template" radio button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An easy way to access the style is to put the selection in a bulleted paragraph and press CTRL+SHIFT+s to display the Apply Styles dialog, which should display List Paragraph in the Style Name control and then click on the Modify... button to access the

            In your template, you can set up a specific paragraph style with the settings that you want. For example, you can modify the built-in List Bullet style to suit the needs of your documents.<br />

<p>I have a spreadsheet where column J is dollar amount, column E is a state abbreviated, eg NY, CA and column E is a date eg 1/5/19</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to add all dollar amounts that are associated with a particular state, eg CA, and is in the 1st quarter of the year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I have that doesn't work &nbsp;:( &nbsp;where J is the $ amount, I is the state and E is the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS($J$1:$J$200,$I$1:$I$200,"CA",$E$1:$E$200, MONTH={1,2,3})</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know how to enclose a pic of the spreadsheet but would look like:</p>

<p>I want the result of the formula (if there is any) to be added up if the other conditions are met. &nbsp;It seems I need to get the value or some other formula to make it work. &nbsp;If I remove the formula from the O column and put in various numbers in the O column,

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only way to make it work with SUMIFS is:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">=SUMIFS($J$2:$J$200, $I$2:$I$200,"CA", $E$2:$E$200,"&gt;=01/01/2019", $E$2:$E$200,"&lt;=03/31/2019")</p>
<p>
</p><p>not ideal as everything is hard-coded (State &amp; Date range). Or</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8e61e7a-df3e-43f1-9e5c-c8e3f0ba20f6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8e61e7a-df3e-43f1-9e5c-c8e3f0ba20f6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>in <strong>L5</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you use a Pivot Table that will easily allow you to do the same by Month, Quarter, Yearâ€¦ for each State + very efficiently</p>

<h3> mikesurerus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install applications using Skype for Business in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We use Skype for Business to remote into machines in our network. We frequently will install applications or run software updates while remoted into a user's computer. This works great in Windows 7, but we're starting to migrate to Windows 10 and this doesn't
 work anymore. We try to run as administrator or different user (local admin account), but each time we are kicked off the remote session and the user has to give control back or share their screen again. We've tried putting the .exe files on the desktop, C:\temp
 folder, but we continue to get kicked off because the pop-up prompts for credentials. We have User Access Control turned all the way down. Is there a way in Windows 10 to use Skype to install applications using the Share Desktop function without getting kicked
 out? We don't want to give the users admin rights either. Any assistance is appreciated.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Elardus,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To resolve the issue let us know the following:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are the options to Edit, Open and Remove hyperlink from the right-click menu completely missing when your Excel spreadsheets?
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you have other options when you right-click on the hyperlinks? For example, copy, paste, paste special, insert, delete etc.?
</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is this issue happening with one Excel spreadsheet or all Excel spreadsheets?
</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the meantime, you may try the following step:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try opening Excel in the Safe Mode and check if the Hyperlink options on right-click work.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the steps as suggested in the following Microsoft Article to open Excel 2013/2016 in the Safe Mode.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The above article lists steps for all Microsoft Office 2013 and Office 2016 applications, however, follow the steps to open the application/program in the Safe Mode for which you are experiencing an issue â€“
 in your case Excel 2013/Excel 2016.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The above step opens Excel in the Safe Mode. <br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, check if you are able to resolve the issue or if the issue still persists. If the issue resolves in the Safe Mode, then follow the steps detailed in the same Microsoft Article mentioned above to troubleshoot Add-Ins in the application.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the above information helps. </span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mohan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. In the meantime, the hyperlinks options re-appeared after a few hours - without me having done anything to make that happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I'll stil share what I know:</p>
<p>1) The option was not missing on all spreadsheets at the time. It was missing on the one (which happens to be one that I have an opening password on).</p>
<p>At the time, I captured the right-click menus of another spreadsheet as well as the offending one as shown below:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8750d31d-675f-4fce-a881-8849fb3edfa8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8750d31d-675f-4fce-a881-8849fb3edfa8" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e3c80de-c462-4042-8326-1a9beee146e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e3c80de-c462-4042-8326-1a9beee146e6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the two menus were quite different at the time, but as I said, later when I had saved and opened the file again, the no-hyperlink menu just came right again....... It is still OK after about eight hours later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both files reside on my laptop in the 'OneDrive' section. Could it have been a syncing issue?</p>

<p>
</p><p>No Hyperlink options in right-click menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do they come and go? Surely MS must be able to simply explain what I may be doing wrong - and then right again as at some time later they will probably be back - without my deliberate doing......</p>

<h2>            EXCEL 2010 - MACRO TO SORT ROWS BUT IGNORE ROWS WITH NO DATA AT ALL</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an excel 2010 spreadsheet with different macros to sort by different columns.</p>
<p>What I need is a macro that will do the above sorting but will ignore the rows that are&nbsp;completely&nbsp;blank (no data in no column).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>I have inserted the blank rows following the&nbsp;last populated row&nbsp;so that&nbsp;users do not need to&nbsp;insert a single row each time&nbsp;they need to update the spreadsheet with new entries.</p>
<p>I cannot set the sort range in my macros to a "random" -&nbsp;greater number of rows because, following my last empty row I have summary tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think there is a macro code to do the above? </p>
<p>(Sample of my spreadsheet here below; I hope it helps ....).</p>

            <p>This question has been posted for some time so I wonder if you have an answer yet from somewhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In VBA code the CurrentRegion is ideal for this type of situation. CurrentRegion is the area that contains data surrounding a specific cell or range. Both the first and last cell of the range will be the cell inside where blank column and row meet at top
 left and bottom right.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Therefore by assigning a range variable to the current region of cell A1 in your example it includes&nbsp; the Range $A$1:$G$5.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Now if you record code to sort a selected range (in the example $A$1:$G$5) then the recorded code will specify the selected range. You can then edit the recorded code and replace the selected range with the variable and it will always be the correct irrespective
 of how many rows of data <em><strong>provided you have at least one blank row between the data to be sorted and the Summary data.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Code as follows where data was selected to get the initial sort syntax&nbsp;and then how to edit this for the final code.
<em>In good programming it is rarely necessary to actually select and if you are competent enough to write code without selecting then the example should still be sufficient to guide you in setting the correct range to sort without selection but if not that
 competent then just go with selecting the range.</em></p>

            hey radtech2,<br />
<br />
I'm experiencing exactly the same problem with my E65, I installed some themes some time ago, initially they were all available. Yesterday installed some more, and surprise...!!!! some of the older themes disapeared from the theme list (I guess they are still
 in the phone/memory card)<br />
<br />
I'm having another problem with themes, I go to the app manager, and some of them don't even show up in the list (so I can't unintall them), would you please check if it happens to you to?<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping that it's not ANOTHER firmware bug... :S<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers

            hey, friend!<br />
Yes, I am having the very same problems with mine.I can't uninstall some themes because they don't show up on the uninstaller! I eventually went in via the data cable abd deleted them from the private folder manually. it seems to be the only way to do this.<br />
I now install themes using UnSis- it's a buttache, but it works.<br />
Good luck and shout if you need any help!

so i didn't try to install themes on my E65<br />

            I think it IS an OS bug- I use Un Sis now to install and deinstall my themes and it works great!!

            Also, don't install via PC suite- use the data transfer option and UnSis.

            Hi Friend,<br />
I encountered the same problem whereby some of the installed themes are not found on the App Manager.<br />
<br />
I connect the cable and choose data transfer..but can not do UnSis.<br />
<br />
Does 'UnSis' mean Uninstall Sis ?<br />
<br />
How to do UnSis ?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks.
        </p>
