<h2>            Update Destroyed my Audio - Lumia 535</h2>
                    <p>I had not updated my phone since I had bought it.</p>
<p>A few days ago I went ahead and updated it.</p>
<p>I then lost audio. The volume bar did not appear when trying to change volume and the Audio in the Systems menu was inaccessible (clicking on it just brought you back to the options menu where the Audio was).</p>
<p>I updated it again, the same problem existed, but at least I could see the volume bar, when trying to adjust the volume (but still no audio).</p>
<p>I tried a soft reset, then a factory reset, but it only reset my phone to the broken update, not to the factory default.</p>
<p>I tried the windowsrecovery tool via my laptop. </p>
<p>It went through all the motions, but failed at the last (I tried several times).</p>
<p>I got the Upgrade Update app.</p>
<p>It installed windows 10 (previously the phone was off course windows 8).</p>
<p>Still no audio.</p>
<p>I updated the windows 10 to the latest patch. Still no audio, also the audio option has dissapeared and been replaced by Equaliser option (which is accessible but unchangeable).</p>
<p>I tried another Factory Reset, it reset me to the latest windows 10 update.</p>
<p>How do I restore my phone back to the very first, default, factory Windows 8 os?</p>
<p>All in all, if I cannot get back my audio I will have to buy a new phone (and funnily enough it will not be a windows one).</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer 93tid.</p>
<p>I tried the Windows Device Recovery Program, the only option there I could find was "re-install" and it failed at the end of it. I will try again when I get home.
</p>
<p>I did look through the options, but maybe I missed the option for restoring it to the default.</p>
<p>It is annoying, I just use the phone for the basics (calls, the odd text, my own music and taking pictures, I never really bothered with apps) and the first time I update it... grrr.</p>
<p>I should have just left the dragon sleeping :(</p>
<p>I took the windows phone for the easy drag and drop feature, but apparently Android does this too, which is something I didn't know at the time.
</p>
<p>My wifes phone needs zune or some such nonsense to get files on and off the phone (I will never buy another apple product, first and last was an ipod, GIVE ME MY MUSIC BACK YOU... sorry I got sidetracked there).</p>

</p><p>That's it, re-install. If it fails again let us know exactly what happens and which error message you get.</p>

<p>Well would you believe it, this time it worked.</p>
<p>I sure am glad the phone I was going to buy was out of stock yesterday (I was convinced it wasn't going to work, oh ye' o' little faith eh :) ).</p>
<p>My phone is now back to it's original default OS and audio is working again.</p>

<h2>            E5 and C5-00 having same problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought these 2 hp 3 weeks ago. It come with free 4GB instead of 2GB which already inside the hp for both of the hp. I replaced the 2GB SD&nbsp;with the 4GB. The problem is the SD card can't save any picture and video from the camera, it's corrupted and
 i can't even download anything from web to the SD card. (seems like the SD card is broken)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've replaced the 4GB with the new one after make a complaint to Nokia Care Centre in Malacca, but the same problem still occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when i use the origin 2GB, everything is fine. It can save picture, video and download from web. It happened for both of this hp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls advise whether these hp isn't compatible with larger than 2GB SD, or should i ask for replacement of new hp for both?????&nbsp; Pls help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Azmanalib, Welcome to the Nokia Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to reformat the memory card yet whilst its still in the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The memory card limit for the C5 is 16GB and 32GB for the E5.</p>

<p>Yes, few times for both hp but it's not helping. Like i said, seems like the SD card is broken. Even i tried with the new SD, the new SD will corrupted. It's running fine with the origin 2GB. But why for both hp with different model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or should i ask for replacement???</p>

<p>If the phone works fine with the original card but not the one you bought then it would suggest the new card is faulty. Try it with another card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have learnt from experience to use good quality branded memory cards having previously loss important data.</p>

<p>Not yet, but will do that. (but the Nokia Care have reformat the card by PC during my first complaint)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cjlim,</p>
<p>I've change it with another 4GB card. Its ok, then become faulty again. FYI, all the 4GB cards&nbsp;are Kingston.</p>

                    Hello, NOT SURE&nbsp;IF POSTED IN THE RIGHT FOURUM.... However,&nbsp;I have recently updated to windows 10 insider preview, and I have got the 10070 build, I read somewhere that in order to get the latest build (10130) is to update it. I wanted to update as there
 was a few bug issues etc. However, when I went to open settings to update my laptop, it crashes. I've tried all of the Command prompts etc. and nothing's working, I've also done all the obvious bits like re-boot, shut down, wait etc. Can anyone help me ASAP
 thank you.

            <p>Have you tried creating a new profile? Since the Settings app is crashing, you can do that by following these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1</p>
<p>Right click on start button and choose control panel</p>
<p>Choose User accounts</p>
<p>Create a new user with admin privilege </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2</p>
<p>Press Windows logo + R to open the Run box</p>
<p>Type "control userpasswords2"</p>
<p>Click Add</p>
<p>Choose "Sign in without a Microsoft account"</p>
<p>Local account</p>
<p>Once you have successfully created the new user, go back to the small window</p>
<p>Highlight the new profile and choose properties</p>
<p>Go to Group membership and make it an admin account</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try the settings app again.</p>
<p>If it is working, time to transfer your files to the new one by moving the from C:\User\Oldprofileusername to C:\User\NewProfile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that will not work,&nbsp; you can download and install the latest build using this ISO

<h3> inplay jennifer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer OneNote notebooks from personal to Business acct</h2>
                    <p>I recently went through a trial and approval process to standardize on Microsoft OneNote and OneDrive for our corporate document repository. To do this I built out a personal account with the file structure and notebooks we need for corporate use, and did
 some demos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purchase was approved, and now I'm trying to migrate the notebooks and files-- which I've been developing since September-- to the new business instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen and read, I can't. Just--- can't.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Since OneNote 2016 for Mac is different from OneNote 2016 on Windows and there is no Export option in OneNote 2016 for Mac like OneNote 2016 on Windows, as a workaround,

    <title>Multilevel list toolbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 67nmark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multilevel list toolbar</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I previously asked a question about setting up a template that includes only one multilevel list style.</p>
<p>I understand how to create the template and I have created the template but I have an issue that I would appreciate some enlightenment on.</p>
<p>First, I created my multi level list style as per instructions then removed the other default options from the multilevel list toolbar button. When I start a new document based on the template my list style appears as the one option under list styles but
 there is also another option available in the "current list" option at the top of the multilevel list toolbar options. How do I get rid of this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            As Deepa Raj wrote, there isn't much you can do. However, if you set up a list style attached to paragraph styles (one style for each numbering level), as suggested in the article by Shauna&nbsp;Kelly at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html</a>&nbsp;and
 then teach your users to apply styles instead, it won't be a problem.

                    <p>Wonder if someone could please assist? I am using Outlook.com in IE 10 RTM browser encountering display errors when composing and viewing the sent email.</p>
<ul>
<li>I send new emails in Rich Text format</li><li>Composing new emails using Text Indent Tools to move cursor to right of&nbsp;web page</li><li>Composed new email used zero line spacing</li></ul>
<p>The problem is when viewing the sent email all Indent text is virtually running of the right off the webpage with Text line spacing increased to double spacing. This&nbsp;does look good for viewing and might look worse to the recipient of the message.</p>
<p>This is repeated even when "copy and paste" of text from Ms Word file into new mail page.</p>
<p>Is there any resolution&nbsp;that could be applied, I have tried the web research route without finding answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Slow Transition between slides Powerpoint Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>Im very disaapointed with the speed of Powerpoint Mac 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new MacBook Pro, 16GB RAM and fast processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The transition between slides when showing slides is around 5 seconds. I have given up on 2016 and had to go back to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

            <p>Office is all up to date and still the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I have found a workaround...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default Transitions setting of None for slides seems to be the issue. If I switch the Transition for all slides to Cut it doesnt have the 4-5 second delay that happens when its on the Default setting. If I then switch all slides back to None it seems
 ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a great solution, but at least its a temp fix</p>

            Using the latest version, today on the 28th of January 2016. Powerpoint nearly unusable on my Mac Powerbook (latest hardware). A presentation containing lots of figures is very slow, it takes several seconds to change a slide when presenting compared to
 an old Windows PC. Dear Microsoft, is this neglect, poor coding, or deliberate?

            If no transitions are working, then Office 216 for Mac is not correctly installed. This isn't a bug or Microsoft's fault. Please try uninstalling Office following these directions:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall
 Office 2016 for Mac</a>. Then reinstall from your original installation media or download (if you bought the software) or from your Microsoft account, if you have Office 365.

            <p>Thank you for your reply - the first useful thing I've gotten from Microsoft support(?) in some time. &nbsp;I followed the installation instructions exactly, albeit some time ago. &nbsp;I've already wasted enough time on this, so, for the moment I'll pass on re-installing.
 &nbsp;I may try the re-install after my presentation is presented. &nbsp;Based on the history here I'm not sure I'd bet on it solving the problem, though I'm glad you think so. &nbsp;Again, I appreciate your response.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, things deteriorated further - slide transitions don't work at all, a mess. &nbsp;So, I reloaded Office. &nbsp;Now the transitions work, but the timing is inconsistent - sometimes slow, sometimes fast, and this is on a vanilla black and white presentation with
 a few builds within some slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now what? &nbsp;How can I make the timing of slide transitions and builds more consistent? &nbsp;I have the latest Mac OS and the best MacBook Pro available in 2015 (solid state disk, etc.)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problem is that now I click and sometimes nothing happens for more than a few seconds, then I click again, and, of course, &nbsp;it now acts on the two clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I just try another presentation application for my upcoming talk?</p>

<p>Ok I found the reason for that problem:</p>
<p>In the preferences of my mic -&gt; Advanced the quality or "format" was set to the lowest quality! I just needed to change it back to the default one (DVD quality).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if you can fix that bug! If you don't know how you need to look you will think the update "broke" your mic.</p>

            <p>I have my machine(s) set to automatically download and install Windows Upgrades. On December 11, 2014 a security upgrade was included for Office 2007. Once applied it disabled all of my Activex Command Buttons in my Excel 2007 worksheets. It also would not
 allow me to add any new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I had was to restore my system to a point prior to install of the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now changed my Windows update to download and allow me to select what I wish to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seriously doubt there is any active support being performed for Office 2007 and I question the need for any updates. Was this an untested upgrade or an intended functional decrease?</p>

            <p>I doubt very much that it was intended. &nbsp;It's also "improving" all versions of Office since 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix, at least for some, seems to be to go to your TEMP folder, wherever it may be, and delete any VBE files there or in subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this with all of your Office apps closed or it won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA will re-create the VBE files as it needs to, but if you want to be extra safe, rename them to e.g. *.VBE.OLD or hey, *.VBE.EVIL &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Installation&#47;upgrade stuck at 35&#37;&#47;&#34;Getting ready&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to install build 14295 on my laptop, but the clean installation gets stuck at "Getting ready" with Acer logo and a spinning icon on the screen. The laptop in question is Acer Aspire V5-573PG and I don't have anything but the power cable
 plugged into the device, even tried unplugging the USB drive with the ISO after it reboots off of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to upgrade from 10586 instead of doing a clean installation, the upgrade process gets stuck at 35% in the familiar Windows 10 upgrade screen. This also happened with the first fast ring 14xxx build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's starting to seem like some of the hardware is incompatible with the new builds. Any advice?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I already solved it myself, and the solution is not included in the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that my <strong>trackpad was disabled. I essentially had no mouse</strong>, just the touch screen. I enabled the trackpad, restarted the installation and it finished without issue.</p>

<p>My speaker is not working either...This is REDICULOUS I now have a fone that cost a hell of a lot, that has a scratched camera lens that messes up my pictures when a flash is used, poor GPS, OTA firmware updates still not working, and since i have a Mac
 and not a PC the INABILITY to update software period! AND NOW A BUSTED SPEAKER.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I HAVE BABIED THIS PEICE OF SHI*T SINCE NEW AND STILL ITS A PEICE OF **bleep**!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope Nokia gets their act together cause, I don't think I will be a very loyal customer anymore as I have been for the last 5 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TO TOP IT OFF I'm away from home for work, so where and how i'm going to find a competant care centre, that wont take a million years to fix my phone or give me some refurbished junk I don't know! :(</p>

<div>my speaker broke too. lol i cant believe this phone even has hardware "bugs"!!!! i mean software...everybody uses the same software (assuming they have the same version). but for people to come across the same hardware problems?! this is new... anyways
 my speaker&nbsp;was broken (dunno how it happened)... it wasnt the software. i had to replace it (and pay for it BTW!)&nbsp;and its now working.</div>
<div>p.s.</div>
<div>"its time to make use of your warranty". yeah... that doesnt really work for everyone because the biggest cellphone company in the world has decided NOT to give international warranty for some reason... so for those of us who bought their phone abroad
 because it was cheaper there (like... ME!) the warranty doesnt neccessarily apply in their country so they have to pay for that kind of stuff where they have only had the phone for a few months.</div>
<div><strong>GIVE NOKIA USERS INTERNATIONAL WARRANTY!</strong></div>
<div>this is ridiculous! a company like nokia cant even give international warranty?! common!</div>

            <p>Try this <strong>on a COPY</strong> of your workbook - it would definitely be destructive if I haven't gotten it all correct.&nbsp; Test it and check it very, very closely, especially the formulas created, to make sure that nothing got hopelessly messed up before
 using it in the real world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it should happen to generate a runtime error, please report the error number and text shown to you, and then click the [Debug] button and copy down the line of code that's highlighted (a screen capture of it would even be better).&nbsp; It does compile without
 error, but that doesn't mean I haven't slipped up somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To adapt it to other workbooks, just change the appropriate values that are <strong>
Const</strong> values in this code.&nbsp; With luck on your side, none of the columns will need to be changed, and only the names of the two sheets involved will have to be.&nbsp; Some of the columns are referenced twice, but I thought it safer just in case things aren't
 always the same in other workbooks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the code I came up with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub ProcessTwoSheets()<br />
&nbsp; 'change these Const values to set up to match with the two sheets<br />
&nbsp; 'in a different workbook<br />
'Info for the First sheet (was 27361 in original)<br />
<strong>&nbsp; Const firstSheetName = "27361" ' change per workbook<br />
</strong>&nbsp; 's1 stands for the firstSheetName sheet<br />
<strong>&nbsp; Const s1FirstDataRow = 2<br />
&nbsp; Const s1CommaGroup1 = "E:G"<br />
&nbsp; Const s1FirstSortCol = "F"<br />
&nbsp; Const s1FirstColToSort = "A"<br />
&nbsp; Const s1LastColToSort = "AD"<br />
&nbsp; Const s1SecondSortCol = "E"<br />
&nbsp; Const s1SeriesCol = "C"<br />
&nbsp; Const s1FormulaCol = "D"<br />
</strong>'<br />
'Info for the Second sheet (was 3610 in original)<br />
<strong>&nbsp; Const secondSheetName = "3610"<br />
</strong>&nbsp; 's2 stands for the secondSheetName sheet<br />
<strong>&nbsp; Const s2FirstDataRow = 2<br />
&nbsp; Const s2FirstSortRow = 3 ' for the first sorting<br />

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>Thank you for raising this to us. We apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, we cannot post a single announcement to a multiple private groups. You have to join the group first and then post an announcement individually.</p>
<p>You can also try to post an Announcement to the All Company group since all the members of your Yammer Network is already there.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Nokia - was the delay only to give you time to nail this phone to its perch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the problem with this phone - read the posts your customers are having problems with this phone- (remember us&nbsp;- the customer-&nbsp;the nice people that give you MONEY!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what is it ---</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor engineering and software?</li><li>An obsolete OS platform --past its time ?</li><li>Quality control issues in the manufacturing process?</li><li>Bad business call on the part of management to release a product before it was ready in the hopes&nbsp;of offsetting the mediocre reviews. ( If this is the case, just how has that been working out for you? Someone must be inline for a big promotion given all
 the great customer response)</li></ul>
<p>Anyone: How do I get my phone back-I am traveling on business and this is costing me. I&nbsp;can live without a Camera, Facebook, Social networking. And games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me a phone is a business tool used for communication and any phone that can't do that is pretty much useless.</p>

<li>Poor engineering and software?</li></ul>
<p>no the phone as engineered and released is fine, you are one of the unlucky few with a bad phone or you have installed something it didn't like</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>An obsolete OS platform --past its time ?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a brand new OS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality control issues in the manufacturing process?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>probably not being as the similar complaints on these forums are numbering in a few dozen rather than the hundreds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bad business call on the part of management to release a product before it was ready in the hopes&nbsp;of offsetting the mediocre reviews. ( If this is the case, just how has that been working out for you? Someone must be inline for a big promotion given all

<p>no</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in short there is nothing wrong with the handset in general you are having issues with the one in your hand as you are either one of the unlucky ones to have found a duff one, or something you have installed has caused an instability</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as a temporary fix try the hard reset procedure as described in the linked post above, for a permanent fix take it to where you bought it from for repair / replacement</p>

<p>I&nbsp; want to thank you for your response- it does not bring the phone back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But so just so you know&nbsp;I only installed apps available from Nokia AVI store&nbsp;recommended for my phone - so I would assume them to have been vetted (all 2 of them) &nbsp;for use&nbsp;!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just plain dead!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in the US and at a price of approx $600, &nbsp;I would expect it to work! It was purchased directly from NOKIA here In the USA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an app killed the phone then its a Nokia problem, Since the app came directly From Nokia's web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the phone was bought directly from Nokia, the Apps came Directly from Nokia, everything is by the numbers here and no deviation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mean time, I am out of communication and losing far more money than the I paid for the phone I have since signed up for a contract with another provider, bought a Droid (locked I might add making it useless except for one particular carrier )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to stop the bleeding --&nbsp;the damage this phone has caused!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already written a memo to the IT department to purge our company of&nbsp;all Nokia phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has been a nightmare</p>

<p>Om my goodness! Do you fail to listen to what people are telling you?</p>
<p>All electronic devices have some fail rate, typically a small percentage. That is why there is something called warranty.<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span> You are one of the few unlucky ones who happened to recieve
 a bad phone!</p>
<p>This is not a specific issue due to Nokia! This happens to all electronic products.</p>
<p>It sucks it happened to you, but neither you, nor Nokia, nor anyone is responsible or could do anything to prevent it. Go to your nearest repair center and have them look at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just because it so happened that YOUR phone stopped working doesn't mean ALL nokia devices are the same.</p>
<p>So don't be silly, and don't be unfair.</p>

<p>Trust me I&nbsp;truly want to be fair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As an engineer myself-&nbsp;I know the problems that come with the launch of a new product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also know the cuts taken and the pressure in getting that product on the market, In particular given the mediocre reviews this product received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(I was being fair, I bought the phone despite those reviews)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you read the posts I am sure you would agree the phone has issues. This only the tip of the iceberg, I would bet only a small percentage is voicing an opinion on this and far more are experiencing problems than what is being reported here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read the posts-- far more dissatisfaction than satisfaction and more importantly _ no resolution other than return the phone and wait !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would appear that the N8 is a failure! (by the way a hard reset does not work in my case)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i like the design really, only problem with the phone is it does just not work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>while i would like to debate the issue- i assume the forum is devoted to helping users get solution to problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia- please fix the problem</p>

<p>Well mines working perfectly as are quite a few guys I know who also have one</p>
<p>again had you been around these forums for the launch of the 5800 or the N97 you'd see how quiet they are on N8 issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>most of the issues that are being raised are more questions as to how features work</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are very few (a few dozn at most) issues similar to yours, which being as these are the global nokia support forums is excelent given the numbers that have shipped in the last few weeks</p>

<p>hi sorry about your problem</p>
<p>i am not from nokia but i have 2 suggestions that may be a hope for you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-maybe is battery issue</p>
<p>may be a possibility while you was on the phonecall( i guess moving the phone by walking or moving around or perhaps an earlier slighty drop of the phone etc, so while on the phone call it caused crash) or perhaps the battery was not fitted propely in the
 connectors (inside and back of the phone) and caused this</p>
<p>hold the phone in your hands and turn phone upside down and tap it gently to your palm(hdmi connection side to face down your palm and hit your palm gently with the n8)</p>
<p>like i used to tap the cigarretes the old time for the tobacco to move more down if you know what i mean</p>
<p>if this crash caused because the battery does not fit the connectors, by doing this battery may remove back to position and be ok for now, if that was the problem of the crash</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-the software of the n8 is new so may be buggy as all new softwares in any phone company and not just nokia</p>
<p>maybe some applications was installed had cause the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;in this case if is possible connect it to a pc and with the nokia software updater try to reinstal the software again.it will not void your warranty</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>good luck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Sorry for your luck man, I know it sux but Don't go on a rampage like that,&nbsp; you say your an engineer and yet you don't seem to understand your dealing with electronics and they tend to not work at times you can pick 100N8s and im sure you'll find
 5 or 6 defective. You could have picked up your Droid and it wouldn't work, I'm sure there are some people that got Droids and it didn't work. I haven't had any problem with my N8 so far so good and besides what kind of Engineer are you that you leave yourself
 with one device? What if you break the damn thing? I have back up phones just in case stuff like that happens. I understand your traveling, well OK no big deal you could get a cheap phone anywhere. I assume your on At&amp;t or even T-mobile you could still get
 a phone so you could use for now that way you don't "LOSE MONEY"... Anyways don't blame the nokia just cause you couldn't get a second phone to cover yourself till you figure out what you going to do with the N8, you could have easily returned it and got you
 another one. Well your loss I'm definitely enjoying mine so are many other people.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Didn't mean to rampage and&nbsp;this was far from a rampage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had I known perhaps I should have bought 3 or more.</p>
<p>Last time I purchased a car -&nbsp; bought&nbsp;two new ones -- one for parts --just in case</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dealing with electronics is rather poor excuse -&nbsp;sorry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;deal with electronics - the problem I have is- it should not have made it past QC.</p>
<p>My fault&nbsp;I expected more from a brand like Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 or 8 out of 100- that's pathetic&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's what Nokia consider to be acceptable then this is truly no surprise and I am right in returning the phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just unacceptable- please read -&nbsp;the failures are happening globally- so it is difficult to relate this to just a bad batch or bad luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes some are having a good experience others are not but it appears to be weighted more to the&nbsp;the "are not" &nbsp;side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to be one or more of the following &nbsp;an inherent flaw in design, &nbsp;poor production- lax quality control&nbsp; insufficient testing - just hard to have this one add up to plain ole bad luck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to be rude but please keep comments to what can be done to correct the issue or provide information as to the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again and have a great day</p>

<h2>            Setting up a mail.yourcompany.com sub domain</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I've just finished setting up my custom domain within Office 365. &nbsp;I have O365 managing the DNS records for my domain. &nbsp;I've tested the emails and it's all working correctly with the custom domain.</p>
<p>The question I have is whether it's possible to setup a shortcut URL for my custom domain to go to Outlook. &nbsp; Specifically I would like a "mail.yourcompany.com" subdomain that takes users directly to O365 Outlook sign in.</p>
<p>Can someone please help guide me through whether this is possible and what the steps are?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
