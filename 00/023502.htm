            <p>I'm assuming you want to transfer programs when you say content. Is that correct? I'm also assuming that you may have installed Windows 10 on the device. Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If using Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p>If yes then open the store on your device, click on the hamburger menu in the upper left and choose My Library. It will show you the programs you have purchased and will distinguish what programs will (and will not) work on your current device. you could
 choose when you setup the device to restore from a backup but I do not advise that. There will be some you don't want and by picking and choosing what you want will let you methodically (and slowly) setup your device at your own pace. Just my thoughts....</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If Using Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p>Open the store and click on the ellipsis (...)&nbsp;in the lower left. Click on My Apps and you can see all that you have purchased. Install what you want,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for pictures, calendar and contacts, when you set up your device and sign in with the same Microsoft account, all your contacts and calendar will return. If you have uploaded your pictures to OneDrive then you will have access to all your previous pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for SMS refer to this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdtips/sms-backup-and-download/43d9868f-b676-4995-9ce6-744381187e4c">

<p>
</p><p>Just as an aside, I have never restored old SMS messages. I just do not see the need since I never go back to look at them. In fact, I always tend to delete old SMS massages just save space. Again, just my thoughts ....</p>

<h2>            Undo Send Email</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I'm not entirely sure how to get this feedback to the right person so I'm posting it here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something gmail does better, in my opinion, is the UNSEND feature in settings. I finally toggled the feature on in Microsoft, but was disappointed that it just functions in such a way that the email just takes longer to send now. In gmail, by contrast, you
 get to see what your sent message actually looks like. 100% of the times I've used the feature have been to retrieve an email to change a typo, formatting issue if copy and pasting looks different in the sent version than the composed draft, or I want to re-word
 something that came to my attention after hitting send and seeing it delivered. For whatever Murphy's Law I end up wanting to change something after the fact- the tool is extremely helpful for me in business and would love if Office would consider showing
 us the sent email instead of just showing us our email takes 30 seconds longer to send and appear.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Inappropriate videos start playing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikaln  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inappropriate videos start playing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a real serious problem.</p>
<p>I bought a brand new LG smart tv. &nbsp;I found out it had a web browser. &nbsp;So my boys were talking about wanting to look at tornado videos, and instead of going to my computer I decided to try the web browser on my new tv. &nbsp;I have a lot of filters on my internet,
 so I didn't think adult content would pop up unannounced auto playing on the videos on my tv.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me see if I can explain it a little better. &nbsp;I typed in tornado videos into the bing search engine, installed on my tv. &nbsp;Fine. &nbsp;All the videos that were listed in Bing looked like tornado videos. &nbsp;So I started playing one for my 5 year old and 7 year
 old. &nbsp;No big deal. &nbsp;It was the 10 biggest tornadoes of all times. &nbsp;I watched it and it was pretty awesome. &nbsp;Then the videos continue to auto play one after another. &nbsp;I'm putting dishes in the dish washer while my boys are watching and I can see what they are
 watching, they don't have the control, I do. &nbsp;Then I hear my oldest son say what is that. &nbsp;I look up and just about had a heart attack. &nbsp;On my screen is an almost naked woman pole dancing on my TV. &nbsp;WHAT THE ...,!!! &nbsp;I stop the video look at the list to see
 if I missed something and that video is not even showing in the search engine list. &nbsp;I'm extremely upset that I had to even have a talk about this with my young boys. &nbsp;So tell me how an inappropriate video that isn't even listed under the Bing search engine
 just pops up unannounced and plays automatically with filters and all?</p>
<p>

            You have lots of options when setting the Format property of the text box on your form or report. Perhaps choose "Standard" and then set the decimal places as you desire.

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/error-in-excel-2013-only-error-in-typing-an-input/e2b8e634-dc11-4db8-a912-c1fa98f0bade">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/error-in-excel-2013-only-error-in-typing-an-input/e2b8e634-dc11-4db8-a912-c1fa98f0bade</a></p>
<p>I believe that a user may have discovered a true bug in Excel 2013.&nbsp; A test file is available in his discussion along with steps to duplicate the problem.&nbsp; I have verified that the problem exists in 2013 and that the same file used with either Excel 2003
 or 2010 behaves properly.</p>
<p>It appears that somehow Excel 2013 is becoming confused as to which is the true ActiveSheet internally!</p>

<h2>            &#34;You need permission to perform this action&#34; when deleting a file</h2>
                    I have a .jpg file I recently created in Photoshop.&nbsp; All the other image files in the directory that were created the same way are working fine.&nbsp; But this one is having permissions issues.&nbsp; I want to just delete it and re-save from the original photoshop
 file, but it won't give me permission to delete it.&nbsp; It's not open anywhere else on the computer.&nbsp; The user I'm logged in as is the only user set up on the machine and is an administrator.&nbsp; It's the same user that created the file.&nbsp; But when I try to delete
 it in Internet Explorer or try to overwrite it in Photoshop I run into a permission error.&nbsp; It says that "You need permission to perform this action."&nbsp; When I look at the file properties, it says I don't have permission to view or edit the file's permission
 settings.&nbsp; I have tried running Internet Explorer as Administrator and that didn't change anything.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Karen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Windows 7 Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Where have you saved the file?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might have to set the permissions for that particular file manually. To do so follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the File.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Properties.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the Security tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the lower end of the window there will be an Advance tab to change permissions, click on it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the next window click on the Edit tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Permissions window will open; there you can edit the permission to Full Control, wherein you will have all the permissions for that particular file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also check if you have the ownership of that particular file. To do that repeat the above steps till step 5 and Click on the Owner tab
 in that window and check who has the ownership of that file, if required change it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Setting File Permission for a single file
 may or may not work; you may give it a try and see if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 Calendar &#40;copy an appointment&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to find the best way to have several users share their calendars correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things I want to know is if appointments can be copied. I keep reading that if I hold control and click and drag the appointment to another calendar, it should copy. I made myself an Editor of one of the calendars and another user a delegate of
 another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried on both to do the same thing, copy the appointment instead of having the users do a double entry and it is not working. We used to be able to do this on older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions? I've viewed tuts on but it is weird how I can't find much on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good morning Coldwell Shao MSFT,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>I'm using Office 365 online. I'm not getting any errors, I'm just trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several users that need to view several calendars so they know what each other is doing. If one person can't make it to their appointment, then they move or copy the appointment to another user's calendar who will be able to go the appointment (at
 least they were able to do this on an older version of outlook).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to give full permissions to some of them to see if they could move the appointment to another calendar but they can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Mario</p>

<p><span>Hi Mari-oh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the delay, as I was out of office. According to your description, the users need to edit the calendar for each other. To do this, please ty to make them be each other’s delegate, and give them
 the delegate level--Editor, with this permission, the delegate can do everything that an Author has permission to do and additionally can change and delete the items that you created. For your reference:</span></p>

<h2>            Problem installing Microsoft Office Professional on a Windows XP professional x64 machine</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have a Lenovo X201s running Windows xp professional x64 edition version 2003 service pack 2. I'm trying to install Microsoft Office professional through HUP, but when I try to install it, it gives me the below error:<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
Setup Errors<br />
---------------------------<br />
Setup is unable to proceed due to the following error(s):<br />
To install and use this product, you must be running one of the following operating systems:<br />
<br />
x86 platform<br />
- Windows 7<br />
- Windows Vista SP1<br />
- Windows XP SP3<br />
- Windows Server 2003 SP2<br />
<br />
x64 platform<br />
- Windows 7<br />
- Windows Vista SP1<br />
- Windows Server 2008<br />
<br />
Correct the issue(s) listed above and re-run setup.<br />
---------------------------<br />
OK&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
If this means I should have Windows XP SP3, or Windows 7, where do I get Windows XP SP3 from (can I download it free)?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rajeev<br />

            I bought my Lenovo X201s from Flipkart - an online store in India. It mentioned OS as Windows XP professional x64 edition with SP2. So I got what I purchased. However the label at the bottom says "Windows 7 Pro OA India". I'm not sure what this means.<br />
Its a model without DVD drive, and I had to install the drivers from Lenovo support site. Even there, when I select Win XP professional for my model 5413-A63, it displays a system running Windows 7. I did install the audio and fingerprint reader drivers but
 bluetooth driver stopped working.<br />
I'm now stuck with not able to install Microsoft Office Professional 2010 (which I downloaded from their online store through HUP). While purchasing, nowhere it prompted me or told me it will not work on the version of OS my Laptop is running.<br />

            <p>You need to call Lenovo support.</p>
<p>If you have a label on the bottom of the PC which shows it as win7 with the 25 charactor win7 Key, that should mean that win7 is the version</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Levono support page for India is in your language, I cannot read what it shows as the default version of Win</p>

<h2>            Attachment x was removed from the message because it violates your mail server&#39;s policy</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm in the process of troubleshooting an issue related to my client not being able to receive an email attachment. The body of the message states that the attachment "was removed from the message because it violates your mail server's policy". I cannot find
 a trace of this attachment in the quarantine section of Office 365. There are no custom rules configured for the inbound filtering. Messages that are known to contain malware are actually set to delete the whole message. Does this seem to be an issue related
 to the sender and not my client (the recipient)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Dan</p>

<p>Might be on the sender side, look at the headers and see if you can find any relevant info there. You can also do a message trace and check all the details, if any action was taken by EO it should be listed there.</p>
<p>Don't forget to test with other sender as well, try with a mail from outlook.com or gmail or similar, see if you can repro. This should give you a hint whether it's on your side.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, could you provide the following information?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Do other people in your organization receive the same email with attachment?<br />
2.&nbsp;Do you use Outlook Web App (OWA) or desktop clients?<br />
3.&nbsp;What’s the type of attachment? <br />
4.&nbsp;Can you receive emails with attachments from other senders?<br />
5.&nbsp;I agree with Vasil’s suggestion. Can you provide the mail header? To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. To access the message, you can follow the steps below:<br />
a) Go to the your details section on the right side of the community site. <br />
b) Click Private messages. <br />
c) Click the subject title of the response to read the message. <br />
d) You can reply by using the form in this display. Click Submit Reply.</p>

<h2>            All day every day - Request for Credentials and Forget Office Theme - Any Solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every day and all day Outlook continues to prompt me for my credentials (user name and password).&nbsp; It will forget the theme I've chosen a couple times a week;&nbsp; this also affects my other Office products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two Office 365 subscriptions.&nbsp; For whatever reason it only ever asks for credentials from the one subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still receive email, however it's spotty.&nbsp; Some days it will sync on its own, other days I have to manually sync for it to get email and send.&nbsp; Once in a while I have to reenter the credentials so that it will sync.&nbsp; So whatever it's trying to connect
 to doesn't seem to really care whether I fill it out every time anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't bother entering the credentials very often anymore, as it's obnoxious and forgets and asks again within an hour (even though I click 'remember' checkbox).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have full access to my email and accounts with my phone and tablet.&nbsp; They don't have any issues and don't request my credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues</p>
<p>- Outlook constantly asks for my credentials for one my Office 365 accounts</p>
<p>- Outlook does not obey the 'remember' credentials checkbox</p>
<p>- Office forgets my theme a couple times a week</p>
<p>- Whether I enter my credentials or not, Outlook doesn't always sync</p>
<p>- Outlook can sync 'irregularly and unreliably' without me entering my credentials</p>
<p>- I have no issues on my other devices with Office or Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue was even worse about six months ago.&nbsp; I couldn't even use Outlook with the problem account, as it would lock up and constantly ask for credentials.&nbsp; To resolve that issue I had to disconnect my computer from the AD domain.&nbsp; Then I reconnected
 to the AD domain, but through Azure AD instead of local AD.&nbsp; This worked 100% for about two months, but then Outlook started the above issue magically one day.&nbsp; So it isn't as bad as it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that since I have multiple Office 365 accounts something with AD is related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way I can't recommend Office 365 because of these issues.<br />

<p>The In App support team has been investigating an issue with the Theme switching and a service side change was recently implemented to fix it.&nbsp; I mention this just in case you have the In App support option.&nbsp; Its not available to everyone yet but you can
 check by going to Help, Contact Support.&nbsp; If you have that option and see the Theme issue happen again please submit it via the Help, Contact Support.&nbsp; You can also use this option to submit the auth prompt issue if that happens too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The In App option is rolled out to Insiders and slowly going out to more tenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Pardon my ignorance, but I'm afraid I have no idea what you're asking :-} I'm not familiar with the term 'annexure' &amp; no reference I've consulted defines the term, nor do I know of any way you can 'attach' anything to a Word document.<br />
<br />
Can you please clarify what it is that you want to do &amp; how it differs from normal citations? You might also have a look at the Type of Source list at the top of the Create New Source dialog to see if one of the options there might work for you.<br />

Regarding&nbsp; annexures, perhaps you are thinking of the Index feature<br />

            <p>An Annexure is an attachment to a document that is not added in the document itself but only referred to in a reference.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I conducted 10 interviews. A list of the interviews are attached as "Annexure A", etc.</p>
<p>Then you prepare a file with your document and add all your annexures after the document from Annexure A to Z (or whichever is your last).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue here is: I am referring to 30 Annexures in my document, however, in order for me to list all these documents as part of my index I have to manually go through the document and list each of them.</p>
<p>stevemann12 is asking if there is any way that you can generate such a list like you would generate a Table of Contents.</p>

            <p>The short answer is that Word can do what you are asking for if you use styles. The general procedure is outlined here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/word-2011-for-mac-make-a-table-of-contents-automat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/word-2011-for-mac-make-a-table-of-contents-automat.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you set up your styles properly you could have Word automatically create a TOC that does what you are asking about.</p>

<h2>            X6 - Clicking links on web pages sometimes doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes&nbsp;when&nbsp;I'm web&nbsp;browsing&nbsp;clicking some links suddenly won;t work. They'll show selected but won't actually link, even links I have previously&nbsp;selected, so&nbsp;I&nbsp;know they're good links. Closing the&nbsp;browser&nbsp;down &amp; reopening fixes it. I haven't managed
 to suss a pattern to it yet so am a bit confused. Any ideas please because it's getting really annoying?</p>

<blockquote>Out of those three browsers; Skyfire, Opera Mobile 10 and Opera Mini, I would recommend Opera Mini then Opera Mobile a close second. Really the only thing going for Skyfire is that it can play flash videos / animations internally.</blockquote>

<h2>            Internet Explorer is trying to open a MIDI File and I cannot find the MIDI Extension to change it</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Tools</span>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Options</span>, and then click the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">File Types&nbsp;</span>tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the check box of the file types you want to play in&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;Media&nbsp;</span>Player.</p>
<p>The Player may not be able to play a file, even though you have selected its file type. This can happen if the file uses a codec that is not installed on your computer.</p>
<p>The Player can play other file types but cannot be set as the default player for them.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Clear the check box of the file types you do not want to play in&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;Media</span>Player.</p>
<p>Clearing the check box next to a file type restores the file type association to the previous default player, if one was specified. If no default player was previously specified and you try to play a file, a&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;dialog box will be displayed
 so that you can select the program you want to play the file.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If a check box appears dimmed, the Player has only partial ownership of the file type. Multiple file name extensions are assigned to the file type, but the Player only plays some of those extensions by default. To give the Player full ownership of a file
 type, double-click the dimmed check box.</p>
</li></ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>In some cases, you might set&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;Media</span>&nbsp;Player as the default digital media player for a specific file type but a different player or program opens that file type instead. This may happen for one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Another program that competes for audio and video file types, for example .mp3 or .mpg, may have "taken over" that file type, even after you associated the file type with the Player. This program may use registry monitoring to maintain the file-type association.
 If this happens, you may be able to remove the file-type association in the other program. For more information, see the documentation for the program that has taken over the file-type association.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A program, such as a Web browser, may use its own file-type association methods to change the default program for a file type. In this case, you can use the configuration options provided by that program to change the file-type association back to<span>Windows&nbsp;Media&nbsp;</span>Player.
 For more information, see the documentation for that program.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;Explorer, you may have used the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Open With&nbsp;</span>command to open a file with a different program, and on the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Open With&nbsp;</span>dialog box, you may have selected the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Always
 use the selected program to open this kind of file&nbsp;</span>check box. In this case, you can use the same&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Open With&nbsp;</span>command to change the file-type association back to&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;Media&nbsp;</span>Player. To do so, right-click
 a file, point to&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Open With</span>, and then click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Choose Program</span>. On the Open With dialog box, click<span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows&nbsp;Media</span></span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Player</span>,
 and then select the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Always use the selected program to open this kind of file&nbsp;</span>check box.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2016 Find Tags cannot find custom tags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen sydney  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Find Tags cannot find custom tags</h2>
                    <p>The Find Tags search function in OneNote 2016 only finds custom tags from the page I am currently on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have "Show only unchecked items" unticked, and the Search option as "All notebooks". Refreshing does nothing, nor does grouping the tags by name, section etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely frustrating as the tags are pointless if I can't find them across multiple pages, let alone notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried repairing the office 365 suite, but at about 50% i got this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Something went wrong.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Sorry we ran into a problem.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Error code: 30068-18 (1715)</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have also tried completely uninstalling and then re-installing the office 365 suite, with no success.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please be guided that the process of closing a Skype account has been changed wherein after account deletion, it will take
<strong>60 days</strong> to completely remove the account on our system. Within that waiting period, the account/s can still be searched in the Skype directory.</p>

            <p>Thank you, I can check that later when I get to the machine running w10. But I think I have a solution already, read below. I hope it would work for others also.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Powershell</strong> commands solved only half of the problem - Start menu and notification center were fixed, but modern apps were still broken.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Registry</strong> hack from another post was even less effective. A crippled version of the Start menu was enabled, but the notifications and modern apps were not working.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then I tried another suggestion, to test if it is a corruption of the user profile. I
<strong>created another profile</strong> (a local profile, not MS account based), tested it, and everything worked perfectly: Start menu, notifications and all the apps. So I wanted to transfer user settings from my profile to the new one, I logged out and
 logged into my account, and to my surprise, <strong>MY ACCOUNT WAS FIXED! Everything works again.</strong></p>
