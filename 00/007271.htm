    <title>closing account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ami1312  say:</h3>
<h2>            closing account</h2>
                    How do I close down my skype account. I don't use it and it's just a channel for a spiteful ex to harass me from an account I can't seem to block.<br />
I followed online advice and get as far as being unable to unlink it from my microsoft account, I just don't have the option.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks.<br />
ps, sorry it's in the wrong category, it's late and I'm upset and there wasn't one appropriate to this question

<h2>            Use date range in a form to pull out information in a crosstab query</h2>
                    <p>I create a form called form2 and set the StartDate and EndDate there, give the button to link to a crosstab query, my SQL for Crosstabquery is:</p>
<p>
PARAMETERS [Forms]![Form2]![StartDate] DateTime, [Forms]![Form2]![EndDate] DateTime;<br />
TRANSFORM Sum([qtySold]*[Price]) AS expr<br />
SELECT Sale.MemberID<br />
FROM Sale RIGHT JOIN (Products RIGHT JOIN S_P ON Products.ProdCode = S_P.ProdCode) ON Sale.ReceiptNo = S_P.ReceiptNo<br />
WHERE (((Sale.[Date of Sale]) Between [Forms]![Form2]![StartDate] And [Forms]![Form2]![EndDate]))<br />
GROUP BY Sale.MemberID<br />
PIVOT Products.Description;
</p><p>
</p><p>But when I want to type in certain dates, it appears a&nbsp;#Name? in my StartDate and EndDate in the form, does anyone know this problem? Thanks a lot!</p>

            Are you sure that the 'certain' dates are compatible with the system's regional date format settings?&nbsp; What happens if you format the controls as short date and enter the same dates by means of the date-picker?<br />
<br />
One other, probably unconnected, issue is your use of RIGHT OUTER JOINS.&nbsp; What is the reason for this?&nbsp; As your are restricting the query on a column in a table (Sale) on the left side of a RIGHT JOIN this will suppress the preservation f rows on the right
 side of the join.&nbsp; If you think about it, it is logically inconsistent to return rows where there is no match in a referenced table, but at the same time restrict the result set to rows in that table where there is a specific value in one of its columns.&nbsp;
 In effect the join becomes an INNER JOIN.<br />
<br />
If it is necessary to do this sort of thing, i.e. return all rows from one table regardless of a match in another table, but at the same time restrict the data returned from the other table to only those rows from the other table which meet a criterion, the
 outer join should not be between the tables, but between one table and a subquery in which the restriction is imposed.&nbsp; You'll find an example in the
<em>'building more advanced queries'</em> section of DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />

            <p>Same here, took a long time for me to get it to at least temporarily open. And it's not just the Start Menu here, but everything that has the modern design language e.g., Cortana, Action Center, File Explorer, Internet Explorer, etc. The only thing that
 worked until the rest slowly started was the little icons e.g., Battery, Volume, etc., but even those were working slow. I finally got some of it to work, still slow but working. All the Modern Apps except for Settings do not work, they just open the splash
 screen and then close on it's own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted File Explorer multiple times via CTRL+ALT+Delete -&gt; Task Manager, and waited. For me, the only thing that gets everything but the Modern Apps to work is patience - wait a few minutes after you sign in, and navigate slowly. Otherwise, I can't
 use it at all!</p>

            It seems if I leave the PC alone for a few minutes after I sign in, everything begins to slowly but gradually work. I should not try to click on anything for, lets say 5-7 minutes. After waiting for that long, then everything slowly opens up for me. But
 all the Modern Apps (except for Settings) still do not work.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Really hope someone can help me.<br />
<br />
My ex partner left and is now going back on promises made for financial support for me &amp; our baby. My solicitor needs proof - he made these promises by text.<br />
<br />
As was trying to delete an angry response (before I sent it) to a nasty message from him today, I did so in Conversation mode &amp; accidentally deleted the whole thread. Am gutted as need those texts to prove his responsibility &amp; not loose our house. If can't
 get them back don't know what I'll do.<br />
<br />
Checked with Nokia but N8 it seems doesn't save messages to SIM but to phone memory, so SIM reader no good.<br />
<br />
Have looked online &amp; seen FExplorer but this doesn't seem to be available for N8.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please does anyone know of how to get into phone memory and attempt to retrieve these deleted messages? (As FExplorer does)<br />
<br />
Thanks, really hope someone can help.<br />

            If you have deleted the messages and never synchronized your phone with Ovid suite or your Ovid account there is little you can do ! However, your service provider may be able to recover them from there servers? I know the police can recover deleted messages
 from people's phones. Good Luck

<h2>            HOw do I get back to Hotmai. after foolishly switching to Outlook.  I have tried the forums, Help and LIve chat with NO help</h2>
                    Per your invitation, I switched to Outlook.&nbsp; I thought my Hotmail saved messages and account would come with me.&nbsp; It did not.&nbsp; Now I cannot access Hotmail at all.&nbsp; All of my mail is going to Hotmail and all of my saved mail is there.&nbsp;I cannot access&nbsp;them.&nbsp;I
 do not have the Hotmail connector option in the little gear icon.&nbsp; How do I get rid of OUtlook and back to Hotmail.&nbsp; I SENT 5 OR 6 HELP MESSAGES, POSTED IN THE FORUMS AND EVEN TRIED lIVE hELP WHO SAID HE COULD NOT HELP. At this point, I just want to get back
 to hotmail and forget about Outlook but every time I type in Hottmail, I am automatically transferred to OUtlook.&nbsp; I am shocked that Microsoft's Live help wouldn't help.

            All I get, Brian is a messed up email list and no gear, no way to enter account! &nbsp;At the bottom of the page is my first name and beneath that it says "sign out" and "help". &nbsp;I am desperate to get back my hotmail account and have been reading forums and
 trying things for almost 3 hours to no avail. &nbsp;If you can help me I would appreciate it so very much. &nbsp;Thanks.

 choose Switch Back but Ii so not have it

            Brian, I was able to get Hotmail back--the whole problem had begun on a relative's computer in another state when I was doing my email. &nbsp;That computer had Outlook on it, so they were able to find the aforementioned gear and get it back.
<div><br />
<div>However--NOW I CANNOT OPEN EMAILS OR DELETE THEM. &nbsp;That, of course, is frustrating. &nbsp;I use Safari with my Mac. &nbsp;I used to be able to open and delete them. &nbsp;I accessed my husband's email and his would not open or delete, either. &nbsp;Any idea what is going
 on? &nbsp;I will come back here later to see if you have any suggestions. &nbsp;Thanks for trying and for the previous advice.</div>

            <p>80188301 update error has been fixed and reboot problem has also been fixed without any update. The procedure comprises following steps to get rid of this ******** error
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: First you must full charge your phone. and copy all important data of your device to your pc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2:&nbsp; Turn on your HTC 8x in bootloader mode by holding volume down plus power button until your phone vibrates..
</p>
<p>3: Download and install "windows device recovery tool" to your pc or laptop.</p>
<p>4: Now plug the USB cable with your phone and your pc and detect your phone manually by selecting HTC option. The software will show you the latest firmware for your device. Install the firmware and do not use any backup just install fresh firmware. After
 complete installation, do not install preview for developers or windows insider app because this app inflict your OS. In fact this is not fully compatible with your current OS. The error indicate the windows 10 technical preview OS updates. In order to install
 technical preview windows 10, we must have at least&nbsp; OS version (8.1****.341).&nbsp; However, this is not possible&nbsp;to install this update for such HTC 8x devices (which were bricked due to windows 10 technical preview update or recovered by windows device recovery
 tool ) due to incompatibility with windows 10, technical preview we can't install (8.1****.341) OS update. Because this is not officially for htc 8x devices. In short, you should not install preview for developers app, and windows insider app, and&nbsp; do not
 restore any backup from your device. only make backup of your data in your pc do not restore from the device just move copied content from your pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This will fix reboot and 80188301 error ! </p>
<p>

 complete installation, do not install preview for developers or windows insider app because this app inflict your OS. In fact this is not fully compatible with your current OS. The error indicate the windows 10 technical preview OS updates. In order to install
 technical preview windows 10, we must have at least&nbsp; OS version (8.1****.341).&nbsp; However, this is not possible&nbsp;to install this update for such HTC 8x devices (which were bricked due to windows 10 technical preview update or recovered by windows device recovery
 tool ) due to incompatibility with windows 10, technical preview we can't install (8.1****.341) OS update. Because this is not officially for htc 8x devices. In short, you should not install preview for developers app, and windows insider app, and&nbsp; do not
 restore any backup from your device. only make backup of your data in your pc do not restore from the device just move copied content from your pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This will fix reboot and 80188301 error ! </p>

            <p>▼&nbsp; Windows Phone 8.1 Update<br />
<br />
OS version: 8.10.14141.167, 8.10.14147.180, 8.10.14157.200, 8.10.14176.243, 8.10.14192.280, 8.10.14203.206, 8.10.14219.341, or 8.10.14226.359<br />
<br />
Folders. Folders let you organize your Start screen the way you want. Just push one Tile on top of another one to create a folder and get going.<br />
<br />
Messaging. Combine multiple text messages into one, and then forward them to someone else.<br />
<br />
Selection. With improved selection, you can now delete multiple calls, messages, or contacts.<br />
<br />
Apps Corner. Apps Corner lets you specify apps other people can use on a Windows Phone. Great for individuals and any-sized organizations who want to provide only the essential apps for others to use for work, school, or any other reason.<br />
<br />
Cortana. There's another way to start Cortana from a Bluetooth hands-free system in your car now—just tap the contact named "Cortana" and ask her whatever you want. And now you're able to do more things without unlocking your phone too, making your personal
 assistant even better.<br />
<br />
Store. The new Live Tile for Windows Phone Store helps you discover new apps and games. Just pin the Store to Start and you're ready to go.<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer. Improvements to Internet Explorer 11 for Windows Phone give you a better browsing experience on your phone. Spend less time panning and zooming and more time enjoying some of your favorite websites.<br />
<br />
Alarms. Now you can customize the snooze time for an alarm, and then enjoy a little more shuteye for the time you want.<br />
<br />
Accessory apps. Use accessory apps to get notifications from your phone on your smart watch, active phone cover, fitness tracker, or other kinds of accessories.<br />
<br />
Internet sharing. Now you can share your cellular data connection over Bluetooth, so you can get an Internet connection on more kinds of devices.<br />
<br />
VPN. VPN now supports L2TP, which lets you connect to more VPN services. Whether you connect to a VPN for work or personal use, you can do it on your Windows Phone.<br />
<br />
Narrator. Narrator now has touch typing and a way for you to turn off hints for controls and buttons if you don't want them read aloud. Some other improvements to Narrator help you unlock your phone a little more quickly, find and use the Back, Start, and Search
 buttons more easily, and tell you when your phone screen is on or off.<br />
<br />
Phone update. Install updates when you want by scheduling them for a time that works best for you. And if your phone supports SD cards, it will now detect if you're running low on space when updating and use the SD card. (Scheduling an update is available after
 updating to build 8.10.14203.206. Support for using your SD card for updating your phone depends on your phone model and manufacturer.)<br />
<br />
Battery Saver. Keep an eye on your battery power from your Start screen. Just pin Battery Saver to Start, and the new Live Tile will show you at a glance how much battery power you have left. (This feature is available only for phones running build 8.10.14203.206.)
 To get info about the latest features, see the Battery Saver app in the Store.<br />
<br />
Cellular data. Add cellular data as a quick action, and then turn your data connection on or off with one tap in action center. (This feature is available only for phones running build 8.10.14219.341.)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the<span> </span><strong>V</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button
 until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:<strong> Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt;
 About &gt; Reset your phone.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Backup &gt; Apps + settings &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Back

            Did you solve this problem? I have the exact same problem with a Nokia Lumia 735. I didn't try to do a soft reset yet, although I'm a bit sceptical. And I certainly don't want to perform a hard reset for this problem (it would be the second time I do such
 an extremely time consuming process on this phone...)

            I have tried to use SkyDrive and the program&nbsp;looks nothing like the link shows. I get no 'paste' choice when I go to this site. I would love to send this page that shows the error but I can't. I have tried to 'right click' on the area to add a document
 so I could 'paste' the document but all I get is 'Silverlight' displayed.

<p>Hey SeniorL,</p>
<p>At the screen where you right click and see "Silverlight" displayed you will need to drag and drop the file into the blue box. Then the&nbsp;Silverlight app will take the file and upload it under your username. If that isn't working for you, try clicking the
 "standard upload page" link that is displayed on the page with the blue box. Then click Browse and navigate to the file you want to upload to show the problem.</p>
<p>Then the rest of the steps in the guide above will show you how to take the image you uploaded to SkyDrive and post it here for us to see.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

This is the calander from a web site. It should have Vertical and horzontal lines as shown on the web site. When I view this on this site the days have rectangles around them. The web site is ucan-online.org.

This is the calander from the site ucan-online.org. It should have vertical and horizontal lines around it. When I view this forum I see rectangles around each number. The calander will change to the correct view if I go to the 'Options' and 'Accessability'
 and remove the check from the 'Ignore colors'. You may need to insure your system has this box checked to view my problem. This not being able to read text is getting serious. I will leave the 'Options' alone (box checked)&nbsp;for a few days in case the change
 affects the way this is shown.

<p><span><span>This is what the calendar should look like if you have the Ignore colors specified option enabled:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmevlga.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1psiccoD9RiKJMNmwMMsK6QH8bgtWqYJVkjmE5mPzb--8ACVd1okLCnEBa15F8OToeDoz9ItLuMC7VyTzcOh9JNb6KeT_aO_Zo%2fcalendar.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmevlga.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pT3ywcUypo60b38lafDuojilA8tHydQacwrwK7LvB2X_xIIAoOCxAw0O04bverKjyUiemxPJl6aK3yhL1qtJaZhxcFLvDXPv-%2fcalendar1.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>What is displayed when the Ignore colors specified option is enabled depends on what color is being used by the web designer to render it normally. Notice the table
 shows up as a brownish border in normal view. This is the reason for the really light border that occurs when using the Ignore colors specified option.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps to clarify what is going on behind the scenes.</span></span></p>

<p><span>This calendar was for demo purposes only. I still have the original problem of 'text being too light' with other sites and Google maps
 when the Ignore Colors <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>is not</strong></span> selected. The Google search box has no vertical sides when Ignore Colors<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>is</strong></span> selected. The problem is
 so bad I can't read some info on web sites. Is my only option to select Ignore Colors and to not select Ignore Colors, depending on the site??</span></p>

<p>Yesterday i got my 8.1 update on my Lumia820, and today my here drive+ app is lagging / loosing signal for minutes while driving. If the app cannot follow me, it becomes pretty useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the app review i see more people complain? is this a known issue? anything we can do about this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can put a helper column as the 5th column and if the cells are really empty put this formula in and drag down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=COUNTA(A2:D2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or if the cells contain a formula returning ""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(LEN(A2:D2))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can the filter for &gt;0 on this column</p>

<h2>            &#39;Inspect element&#39; keeps stopping me compose an email</h2>
                    Since upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and when using Outlook.com for emails I keep getting stopped by the text being underlined in red and 'inspect element' pops up.&nbsp; When I click on this a load of 'gobbledygook' appears underneath and I have to
 'save draft', close down and restart Outlook and then 'continue writing' to remove the underlining.&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlining&nbsp;sometimes happens after I have written a paragraph or sometimes even just a sentence before the text becomes underlined in red.&nbsp; What is causing
 this and can the problem be resolved?

<h2>            Transferring Office 2010 Backup&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I am planning on reinstalling Windows 7 on my Toshiba laptop using the recovery partition. The problem is that I do not know how to transfer Office 2010 over to the new installation. However, I found on the Office website that you can download a backup
 of Office. I found my product key and I have started downloading the backup from here:
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products-FX103427465.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products-FX103427465.aspx</a>&nbsp;What I want to make sure is that even after the new installation of Windows 7, I http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products-FX103427465.aspxwill
 be able to reinstall Office 2010 without having to purchase it again. Is there anything else I should be concerned about during this process?</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            All consumer Office licenses allow you to re-install on the same computer after re-installing Windows (or upgrading Windows, or even doing limited hardware upgrades).<br />
<br />
To re-install Office 2010 on your computer after re-installing any Windows version you need 2 things;<br />
<ul>
<li>your unique 25 character OFFICE "Product Key"</li><li>the generic Office installation file for the matching Office bundle (which you should be able to download from the link you provided)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>After the Windows re-install, apply all of the Windows Updates (will take multiple scans!). Then do a normal Office installation. Run the Office 2010 installation file, provide the product key when prompted.&nbsp; The activation system is supposed to be smart
 enough to recognize that you are re-installing on the same hardware and allow internet activation.<br />

<h2>            Draft View has gone wonky</h2>
                    <p>OK... so I am a freelance publishing subeditor and to work on documents I use Office 365 with Dragon Naturally Speaking 12. So far I have found this to be a very good combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However... this morning I was dictating text into my computer using Word when Dragon misheard something I was dictating, believing it to be the command "Draft View".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always work in draft view anyway, so I was already in draft view, so the command should have had no effect. However, what actually happened was that the various text styles used in the documents I edit no longer appear in Draft view. Instead, all of the
 text is in a font which looks like Courier. Doubleand triple carriage returns have all been replaced with single carriage returns; in short, the formatting on the document is FUBAR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I view the documents in print view, outline view, read mode etc, they look fine. And when I open the documents in my laptop, which runs Word 2007, everything is fine in draft view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 'repaired' Office 365 using the control panel and I have uninstalled the programme and then re-installed it and yet the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me: WTF has caused this and how can I remedy it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

            <p>I think you've inadvertently enabled Draft Font. Go to <strong>File | Options | Advanced: Show document content</strong> and clear the check box for "Use draft font in Draft and Outline views" (the default draft font is Courier New).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that reinstalling never helps with this sort of problem because reinstalling doesn't change settings in the Registry or the Normal template.</p>

            <p>The macros just turn off the Draft font, but to ensure that the program starts in Draft view you can easily add a line of code as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub AutoOpen()<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
ActiveWindow.View.Draft = False<br />
ActiveWindow.View.Type&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 'Draft view<br />

<p>ActiveWindow.View.Draft = False<br />
ActiveWindow.View.Type = 1&nbsp; 'Draft view<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 930 with Windows 10 is sluggish</h2>
                    <p>After the recent automatic updated my Nokia Lumia 930 to Windows 10, the phone seems to be little sluggish compared to the way it was with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>(before doing the automatic update, I uninstalled all user installed apps, to make sure they don't get ported to Windows 10, and then I reinstalled them from scratch. The only app I left installed was WhatsApp, and it got ported to Windows 10)</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing a similar issue?</p>
<p>Could this be because the automatic update was an upgrade and not a clean install? If yes, is there a way to do a clean install?</p>

            <p>Thanks Shreyas02.</p>
<p>So if I understand correctly, the update to Windows 10 mobile has updated the phone ROM therefore if I do a hard reset (Settings | System | About | Reset your phone) then a clean install of Windows 10 will be installed, and not the original factory Windows
 8? Correct?</p>

I also have a nokia 930 and I haven't had an update for windows 10 , but I see that you are an insider which&nbsp;means you are trying it out.&nbsp;So I dont&nbsp;think that the 930 has it at the moment.&nbsp;

<h2>            Recieving &#35;VALUE error when multiplying one column</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Excel issue here</p>
<p>Column A consists of dollar values ie $4, $7, $55 etc. In Column B I would like to multiply all the values in column A by -1&nbsp; The formula I have used is =A1*-1 and then used autofill to apply it to each value.</p>
<p>The formula returns a #VALUE instead of -$4 -$7 and so on. This does not occur when I remove</p>
<p>the dollar symbol, however, the data is too large to remove it by hand for each value. How can fix this? thanks.</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />You could remove the $ from all numbers in the column by doing a find and replace. You can input in the find field: $
<br />And then leave the replace field blank. 
<br />
<br />This may have varying success depending on how the sheet is set up, and I would recommend creating a copy backup of it first just in case. 
<br />
<br />The other thing to try might be to change the formula slightly to be something like this: =SUM(A1*-1)
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are able to share the document with me I may be able to assist more.

<h3> glen marshall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Mac 2011&#58; Missing Master List in Citations Source Manager</h2>
                    My list of bibliographical info has disappeared into the ether - again.&nbsp; When I enter citations manager it is completely blank. This happened to me before. I was advised to reinstall office which I did but this meant that I lost all my previous bibliographical
 entries. However it was now working with new entries so I laboured away and re-entered bibliographical details of scores of books and now it's happened again. I don't want to reinstall office again. I'd like to recover my existing data and get the tool working.
 I use this a lot at work. <br />
<br />
I was advised recently on this forum that there was an update due out soon that should fix the problem and that I should wait for that.&nbsp; Since then there have been a couple of updates but still no joy.<br />
<br />
I'm also starting to get paranoid - why me? again!&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I'm using version 14.2.2 of word and running OS X 10.7.4

            I'm not familiar with Araxis so I can't comment on that. I'm sure there must be a simpler way -- particularly if you're XML savvy -- but I've never had occasion to do that either. Combine those points with the fact that I don't use Lion (Technical folder????)
 take the following for what it's worth :-)<br />
<br />
I think what I'd try is:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Quit all programs</li><li>Move the working Sources.xml file to a temporary location</li><li>Move/copy the Sources.xml file from Technical into the MUD</li><li>Launch Word &amp; use the Citations Source Manager [CSM] to add all sources from the Master List [assuming it can be read] to the document<br />
</li><li>Save the file &amp; Quit Word</li><li>Reverse the process to restore the Sources.xml file you moved</li><li>Launch Word again &amp; open the document you saved</li><li>Use the CSM to copy the sources from the document to the Master List</li></ol>
<br />
The one down side I foresee is that you may wind up with some duplication.<br />
<br />

            Have you tried changing the image back to <span style="font-style: italic">In Line with Text</span> after opening the file with Word?<br />
<br />
Perhaps you can get assistance on the issue in the Apple Discussions group that deals with Pages. It's that software which claims to be able to output a Word-compatible document.<br />

    <title>Problem with clean install. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with clean install.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>I just want to make sure how do I resolve my problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having a perfect Insider system and&nbsp; I decided to instal Debian next to it. On a different drive but with a GRUB on the first system partition on my ssd (with win10 ofc).
</p>
<p>I'm not happy with debian because it has a problem with my graphics.</p>
<p>I want to reinstall Windows and I've decided to move some games on my ssd as I'm using it heavily anyway (not as I first expected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will a Windows Disc tool provide the proper formating of my ssd to do a CLEAN CLEAN install? Simpy I just don't wan't to keep that GRUB part there anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last question: There are no insider builds available for download right? I just download the newest same version of windows as usuall?</p>

            <p>I install almost every build as an upgrade,, then later as a fresh install.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I boot the iso off usb and custom install and usually simple delete all the windows partitions and the install is smart enough to make its own partitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
