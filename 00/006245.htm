<h2>            the chive app broke into wp8.1 system</h2>
                    how could you allow this app to the store? don't you test before leaving to destroy people's phones? or wp is a micky mouse os that any app can break os functions? i have serious problems after installing and even after uninstalling the chive official
 app. lock button issue, data sense issue, battery saver issue,.... many people have these issues. don't suggest hard reset . just release a fix to your f...ed up os.

            it's not app problem if os is that easy to break. the app is well done in general but OS should not allow it to do destructive activities. it's not Android. that's why many people bought WP. it's unacceptable. it's definitely an os bug. I think the app
 created a background task that will run once OS allows it even after uninstalling

</p><p>After unblocking a user in the O365 Exchange Admin - Protection - Action Centre, how long does it take for the user to be able to send outbound externally again?</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia - IE-mobile pointermove for first finger &#40;isPrimary &#61;&#61; true&#41; not fired while textarea&#47;editable input field focused</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>highly I assume it is very specific bug and possibly not IE mobile related, but driver bug.</p>
<p>I have two different Nokia models, one with older IE10 and another one with IE11</p>
<p>While textarea focused both browsers shows strange behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE10</p>
<p>mspointerdown is never fired for first (isPrimary) finger</p>
<p>but mspointermove fired, so I can recognize at least that and handle it like mpspointerdown.</p>
<p>mspointerup fired fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE11</p>
<p>pointerdown is fired</p>
<p>pointermove is never fired</p>
<p>pointerup fired fine</p>
<p>(I tried to set pointercapture, but that does not help too, pointermove just not fired)</p>
<p>However touchmove is fired even while pointermove is not fired, but if you call previously on pointerdown preventDefault() than touchmove is not fired too. (but i need to call preventDefault)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On emulation in PC in IE Edge, when using emulation than everything is as expected. It would be not so funny, if touchmove would not work, but it works while pointermove did not fire previously. Possibly native keyboard stops propagation of pointermove event,
 but does not stop default behaviour.</p>
<p>Any solution, fix?</p>

<h2>            Verion Lumia 735 with Windows 10 --  problems</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 735 Verizon phone.&nbsp; I upgraded it to Windows 10.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to work as well as my old Nokia Lumia 822 that had Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Was it a mistake to upgrade the 735 to Windows 10?&nbsp; Does Windows 10 make the phone less able to pick
 up signal, more likely to crash, etc.?&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; wondering if I should go back to my old 822 with Windows 8.1, put Windows 8.1 back on the 735 or just learn to live with what I've got.&nbsp;

            Hi Irish,<br />

<strong>Settings&gt; About&gt; More information.</strong><br />
<br />
For your Nokia Lumia 822, you can use the <strong>Windows 10 Upgrade Advisor</strong> app available free in the Windows Store - to easily check for upgrade availability and prepare your phone to install the upgrade. Click
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/upgrade-advisor/9nblggh0f5g4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>to download the app.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />

</p><div>Thanks helpers,</div>
<div>The OS Build is <strong><em>10.014965.1001 .</em></strong></div>
<div>Is this what it's supposed to be?</div>
<div>I'm not going to upgrade my Lumia 822 unless I decide I have to stop using the Lumia 735.</div>
<div>I only have one account with Verizon and I don't want to get involved in paying for two just to find out if I can make the phone work.&nbsp; It's both an expense and a drive across town to deal with any of this.</div>
<div>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I'll watch my emails to see your advice about the operating system in my Lumia 735.</div>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook 2007&#58; Won&#39;t Connect to Comcast Email. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rocketeeer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2007&#58; Won&#39;t Connect to Comcast Email.</h2>
                    
<p>Operating System: Windows Vista 64 Bit</p>
<p>Software: Microsoft Outlook 2007</p>
<p>So i recently just reinstalled and reformatted my entire Operating System, connected it to a router, internet is working fine. NO Antivirus software or protection whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And i decide to connect Outlook with my Comcast Email account, I looked at a bunch of Set Up Guides, followed them perfectly, over and over again deleting my account and recreating a new one. But the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>It states that my Username and Password is incorrect for my Comcast Email Account, however I insert the SAME exact Username and Password into mail.comcast.net and it logs in with no problem. So the Username and Password isn't an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tired using the "netsh disabled" thing in the command prompt, that didn't solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heres the Error Code:</strong><em>&nbsp;Log onto incoming mail server (POP3): The operation timed out waiting for a response from the receiving (POP) server. If you continue to receive this message, contact your server administrator or Internet service
 provider (ISP). &nbsp;The server responded: -ERR invalid username/password</em></p>
<p>I even tried changing the Incoming Server to: 995, and the Outgoing to: 587, Still no luck.</p>
<p>Is there some type of Port Forwarding i need to do on my router? I really need help on this, it would be much appreciated! If I can find a solution to this I would be the most happiest person on Earth, lol.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDIT: It seems like it SENDS, but it just can't RECEIVE. And it constantly asks me for my Username and Passowrd.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Here's a few Pictures of my settings:</p>

<h2>            Bing won&#39;t save SafeSearch changes</h2>
                    I had somehow managed to turn off my SafeSearch for about a few months cause I forgot about it and now I want to change it back to moderate.&nbsp; But when I try to change it back to moderate or strict, it won't save the changes.&nbsp; I would go back to my Bing
 settings just to see if it will save the changes, but it didn't, it keeps being off.&nbsp; I don't even know how I managed to change it in the first place.&nbsp; Is there anyway I can change it back to moderate or even strict?&nbsp; I'm sick of seeing my favorite cartoon
 and video game characters in porn-like pictures on Bing images.

<p>
</p><p>Hoping you're all well!!</p>
<p>I'm reaching out to the community in asking, where do I get a legit trial version of MS Project 2010 or 2013 or 2016 for individual use. Earlier Microsoft used to have old versions of their software available for download from their development center but
 I don't see that all now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing from someone soon.</p>

<h2>            WiFi sense</h2>
                    Hi all. I have 2 lumias both using 8.1 denim. I can't get either of them to connect to my home router using WiFi sharing with contacts. On either phone it requires a password even though I have the connection set to share with contacts. Both phones are
 logged in on different accounts. Is it to do with my router setup?

<h2>            Problem fully removing Microsoft Security Essentials from computer</h2>
                    <p>I uninstalled MSE thru Uninstall a program with no problem then installed Panda Free Antivirus. &nbsp;Under program files there is a Microsoft Security Client folder. &nbsp;When I try to delete this folder I get message "Folder Access Denied. &nbsp;You require permission
 from Administrators to make changes to make changes to this folder." &nbsp;When I go into Properties for this folder there are 3 Group or user names: &nbsp;SYSTEM; Administrators; Users. &nbsp;When I try to change permissions for Users by clicking the Full Control and Modify
 boxes to Allow I get message "Error Applying Security. &nbsp;Access is denied." &nbsp;When I go int Advanced setting---Change Permissions and check Full Control box for Users I get same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I go into Action Center---Security and click Show me the antivirus programs on this computer both Panda and MSE are listed. &nbsp;When I click on View installed antispyware programs both Panda and MSE are listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I go into Registry Edit and search under Microsoft Security Client and Microsoft Antimalware I find entry Microsoft Antimalware Setup. &nbsp;When I try to delete it I get message "Cannot delete. &nbsp;Error while detecting key." &nbsp;When I search under Microsoft
 Security Client I get Local Settings-MuiCache-BE-52C64B7E with many dozens of entries in the right hand pane none of which appears to have anything to do with Microsoft Security Client. &nbsp;I did not touch this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Latitude D430 with Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help in clearing up these mysteries and in fully removing ALL elements of MSE from my computer.</p>

    <title>How do I downgrade from IE 11 to 10 in windows 8.1 RT&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmorss2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I downgrade from IE 11 to 10 in windows 8.1 RT&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased a Surface 2 and my corporate website worked flawlessly. I did some updates and now it does not work anymore. I know that IE 11 is the culprit since it worked before the update. Is there anyway to downgrade to 10? I unchecked it in program
 and features but that killed IE altogether. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am also facing the same issue. I can't access my log in to my company's web access.com. It is Juniper VPN which my company uses.</p>
<p>Below is the message I get " Your browser is not supported for this component" i.e the windows secure application manager application can't run</p>
<p>This is a VERY BIG PAIN POINT for me. I was able to access this without any issue in the previous version of IE 9, which I before I updated to 8&nbsp;.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I truly want to go back to Windows 8 because 8.1 is a BIG PAIN.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Request urgent help to resolve this issue&nbsp;because not I can't access my corporate client sites from home.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Appreciate your time and efforts in advance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>regards,</p>

I am having the same difficulty. &nbsp;My work place is using the "Outlook Web App" (exchange server?). Since upgrading to Windows 8.1, the web page is no longer compatible with Internet Explorer. &nbsp;The page is missing many features of the Outlook Web App and has
 become very difficult to navigate. &nbsp;I would have thought Microsoft would make its products more compatible with each other. &nbsp;Has anyone found a way to downgrade back to IE 10 or 9?

            Also, if the issue persists, it may be useful to try to capture a user-mode dump of the iexplore.exe crash to see if a third party file may be at issue.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file, then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time iexplore.exe crashes&nbsp;should be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

            <p>Hi AaronFriesenborg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error appears to be caused by the AcroIEHelper.dll, which is a component of Adobe Reader. There may be other files involved though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did the start of the problem coincide with any hardware or software change such as installing or updating Adobe Reader or any other software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, does the following help?:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IE &gt; Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; remove the checkmark in front of "Enable
<span>third</span> <span>party</span> <span>browser</span> <span>extensions</span>" &gt; OK then restart IE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not help you can re-enable <span>third</span> <span>party</span> <span>
browser</span> <span>extensions</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does help, you would have to track down the <span>third</span> <span>party</span>
<span>browser</span> extension causing the problem, which may the "Adobe PDF Link helper".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook&#39;s stubborn Junk Mail filter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vinicio125  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook&#39;s stubborn Junk Mail filter</h2>
                    Outlook keeps sending my wife's emails (among others) to Junk Mail no matter what I do. From marking them as Safe Senders to a specific Rule, Outlooks does as it pleases. If I don't solve this soon, it is going to end up in divorce. Not my wife, but Outlook.<br />

            Perhaps the mail provider your wife uses is the culprit. Who provides her mail and what type of account (i.e., POP, IMAP, etc.) does she use? What Junk E-mail options does she have selected?

If the emails are received in Junk mail folder on webmail, the same will be downloaded in Junk mail&nbsp;folder on the email client.<br />

Let's open the email on webmail, go to Junk folder, click on Not&nbsp;Junk, then verify if the same email is moved to Inbox folder on Outlook.<br />

            <p>I have been managing mail on WebMail screen. Emails I have marked as Not Junk, go to the Inbox, but a new email from the same address will show again&nbsp;in the Junk Mail folder.</p>
<p>Addresses that I have blocked on the Junk Mail folder, new messages will continue to show up in the Junk Mail folder.</p>
<p>Yes, all the moves are replicated in Outlook. When Not Junk mail goes to the Inbox, and when new mail from same sender goes to Junk Mail. Same for Blocked mail as described above.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: error message when using facebook</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last few days, every time I go on facebook, an error message pops up every few minutes. &nbsp;I have to keep clicking and clicking and clicking to get rid of it. &nbsp;
</p>
<div>The error message indicates <u>Internet Explorer</u> on the top (in the blue bar). &nbsp;</div>
<div>The message says: &nbsp;This page has an unspecified potential security risk. &nbsp;Would you like to continue?</div>
<div>Then in the lower right corner are the usual yes and no options.</div>
<div>I tried looking for solutions in the help sections of both facebook and outlook, but obviously am not experienced enough to find an answer. &nbsp;Can anybody tell me how to get rid of that error message? &nbsp;Or how to fix whatever the problem is?</div>
<div>THANKS!!!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are facing issues with accessing Facebook through Internet Explorer and receiving error message saying âThis page has an unspecified
 potential security risk in Internet Explorerâ.</p>
<p>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using#ie=ie-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">version of Internet Explorer</a>
 are you using?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the issue occur only with Facebook website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letâs follow these methods to fix the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>You may open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run Internet Explorer in "No Add-ons" mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then type
<b>Internet Explorer</b> in the Start Search box.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</b>. Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also follow the Step 4 from the below article to disable no add-ons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span></span></span>Open <b>Internet Explorer</b> and click
<b>Tools</b> &gt; <b>Internet Options</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Security</b> tab, and click on
<b>Trusted sites</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>default level</b>, and set the Allowed levels for this zone to
<b>Medium</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Apply</b> and then
<b>Ok</b>.</p>

<p>Welcome to Nokia Discussions, Bigmatt650.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to restart the phone. If that doesn't fix the issue please proceed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have you already updated to Lumia Black update? If not, you can check if an update is available for your phone,&nbsp;</span><span>just tap&nbsp;</span><span>Settings &gt; Phone Update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also toggle this setting to see if it does fix it. Go to&nbsp;</span><span>Settings &gt; Audio &gt;</span><span>Audio Leveling.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried the fixes given by &nbsp;and &nbsp;? Can you try to remove the back cover again &amp; check that there are no issues with the keys that are connected to the battery cover? The keys should be sitting properly on the cover.&nbsp;<span>If
 there are any keys that are out of place, slip them&nbsp;</span><span>back into their proper location using your fingertip before attempting to attach the cover.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Word has disappeared from my Windows 8 start menu. I cannot open Word documents.</h2>
                    <p>After restarting my computer, Word had disappeared from my start menu and I am not able to open any Word documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I search "Winword" an icon pops up that physically looks like Word but is called Winword. When I click this, however, a window pops up that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong. We couldn't start your program. Please try starting it again. If it won't start, try repairing Office from 'Programs and Features' in the Control panel."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do this and chose the Quick Repair option first, and it did not work. I then chose the Online Repair option. It started loading but after a while a window popped up that said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Background installation ran into a problem. Please make sure you're still connected to the internet, or try connecting to a different network. We'll automatically resume installation as soon as possible, and you can keep working once we do".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was connected to the internet, and I tried this process with three different networks. The repair process still didn't work I have no idea why this happened, or what to do. Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft home office use program</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to purchase Microsoft Office through the home use program using my status as a Marine. I was sent an offer email and when I open the offer for office 2016 there is only two products available to select; Project Professional 2016 and Visio Professional
 2016. Home office 2016 is not offered despite the email I received this week specifically offering it to me at the price of $9.95.</p>

            There is a "customer service" link in the email. Use that to contact the store your made the purchase from . There is also an "order history" link. Check that also. I haven't che\cked everything, but I so far I've missed the option to purchase Office.

            Use the service link to find a way to talk to a person there. The HUP is run distinctly from other MS support so you have to talk to those "specialists" for help with HUP problems.   
<br />
<br />It seems like you have been granted access to the HUP, but their automated system seems to think you already have Office.  You need to talk to a real person to get the Office bundle.
<br />
<br />Your other alternative is to contact someone in your service, at the PX or computer support or ??? (whoever would have given your email address to the HUP organization) to get the "company ID".   
<br />
<br />The way the HUP works is the company you work for (ie military) buys a specific type of license that includes HUP rights for the employees.  The company is given a "company ID number". They pass that on to the employees who submit it to the HUP site when they are buying their copy of Office.  I don't know if this exact process will work for your specific situation, but it is worth asking about.

<h2>            Cell styles getting lost even when the workbook has only 300 approx cell styles</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MS Excel 97-2003 file (*.xls format); When I try to open that file with MS Excel 2010, I see some of the cell styles getting lost (I am using cell colors in cell styles), while when I open the same file with MS Excel 2016, I see too many cell styles
 getting lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My file (*.xls) is only 70KB, I am generating this excel file using apache poi library, and I saw the &nbsp;number of cell styles at the time of file creation were only 298. I checked the MS Office site and saw that the maximum number of cell styles supported
 by 2003 version was 4000 and that for 2007 and later was 64000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure, why cell styles are getting lost even when they are too below the maximum limit. Can I do something to let it behave the same way in MS Excel 2010 and MS Excel 2016. Also, how can I avoid cell styles getting lost?</p>
