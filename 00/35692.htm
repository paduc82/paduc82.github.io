<h2>            InfoPost - WUA v7.6.7600.256 &#47; What&#39;s up with this update anyway&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In order to ensure a high level of service quality, reliability, and operation, Microsoft must occasionally do some maintainance work to the Windows updating systems (MU/WU/WSUS) by updating the infrastructure of the Windows Update service. While these so
 called "infrastructure updates" are important for the WU service to run properly, they may not occur so often but maybe once a year, though the latest one (WUA v7.6.7600.256) took place 3 years after its preceding one - the now-old WUA v7.4.7600.226 (released
 September 2009).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Old Windows Update Agent:</strong></p>
<p>For further information in respect to the now-old WUA v7.4.7600.226 you may refer to the KB946928 article found here &gt;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946928</a> which includes old files information and links to download that expired (but maybe current enough?) version of the WUA.
<br />
Would point out that "at this point in time", this is the only WUA installer available for download, as there is no standalone installer (yet) of the latest and current WUA (v7.6.7600.256). Please note that same KB946928 (ignore its title) was last reviewed
 on June 8, 2012 just to notice this fact.- <br />
Notice:<br />
"There is no standalone installer of the latest version of the Windows Update Agent (7.6.7600.256). The following are instructions on how to obtain version 7.4.7600.226 of the Windows Update Agent.<br />
For more information about the latest version of the Windows Update Agent (7.6.7600.256), please go to this location:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104</a><br />
If you have automatic updates turned on in Windows, the latest version of the Update Agent will automatically be installed on your computer.
<br />
To install the latest version of the Update Agent, visit Windows Update here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.update.microsoft.com</a> ".- </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The New Windows Update Agent:</strong></p>
<p>Please note that the new WUA version 7.6.7600.256 was created on June 2, 2012 but released on a "staged roll-out" basis that began (I think) around June 14, 2012. It was announced by the Windows Update Team on June 6, 2012 (Update to Windows Update, WSUS
 Coming This Week) posted here &gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/mu/archive/2012/06/06/update-to-windows-update-wsus-coming-this-week.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.technet.com/b/mu/archive/2012/06/06/update-to-windows-update-wsus-coming-this-week.aspx</a></p>
<p>Full details (as published) including new files information, etc.. are found in KB949104 which was last reviewed on June 8, 2012. See here &gt;&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104</a>
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, because (as of to-date) there is no standalone installer of the new version, the only way to get it installed on your system is through the WU channel by either visiting the WU or MU websites, or by keeping the Automatic Updates (AU)
 feature turned on.</p>
<p>Same as with past WU infrastructure updates, anytime Windows Update (or Automatic Updates) is turned on, Windows Update will take care of updating itself by automatically installing the latest version.</p>
<p>The Windows Update or Automatic Updates client software must be updated, or you may not be able to successfully check for updates or perform other configured actions. If Windows Update or Automatic Updates is enabled to automatically check for updates, download
 updates, or install updates on your computer, then the infrastructure update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Your computer will not be updated if you have disabled Windows Update (or Automatic Updates) and do not check for updates.</p>
<p>Please also note that this update/upgrade will not change your current Windows Update or Automatic Updates settings, either set to automatically install updates or notify you to install available updates.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But what's with the update anyway?</strong></p>
<p>It's normal procedure as part of the upgrade process to update both the back-end infrastructure that supports the service as well as the client side code, i.e. the Windows Update agent or client. On this opportunity however, it seems it took more than this
 as it happened that Microsoft discovered back in (I think) late May 2012, that some components of a serious malware known as "Flame" were signed by unauthorized certificates (affecting 3 real Microsoft signed certificates) that could allow software to appear
 "as if" it was produced by Microsoft. See more information about it here:</p>

=&gt; Microsoft Security Response Center &gt; <em>"Security Advisory 2718704: Collision attack details, WU update rollout"</em> - Posted 6 Jun 2012 11:00 AM &gt;

<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2012/06/06/security-advisory-2718704-collision-attack-details-wu-update-rollout.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2012/06/06/security-advisory-2718704-collision-attack-details-wu-update-rollout.aspx</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As explained on the above linked blogposts, MSRC's research revealed that... a vulnerability existed on a MS signed certificate that chained up to a Microsoft Root authority that could (without the updates being applied) allow potential attackers - with
 the ability to perform a "collision attack" - to forge such a certificate that would be valid for code signing as having been produced by MS, and thus it could be used to attack all versions of Windows systems.
<br />
Without said collision attack however, it would have still been possible to sign code, but that would validate only on systems pre-dating Windows Vista, as that signed code would fail validation on Windows Vista and above.<br />
In either case, an attacker must get his signed code onto the target system and this could be done if the client‚Äôs Automatic Update program receives the attacker‚Äôs signed package as trusted as it was signed with a MS certificate (a faked one in this case).
 Windows Update can only be spoofed with an unauthorized certificate combined with a man-in-the-middle attack.<br />
</p>
<p>So to summarize, MS implemented a phased mitigation strategy to "harden" Windows Update (WU) and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) infrastructures based on two actions taken as a defense-in-depth precaution and to provide additional protection for customers.-</p>
<p><em>First action</em> was taken on June 3, 2012 by releasing an update with the Security Advisory 2718704 (<em>Unauthorized Digital Certificates Could Allow Spoofing</em>) that prevents unauthorized certificates from being used to attack Windows systems.
 The update revokes the trust of 2 intermediate CA certificates (the irregular certificate and all certificates from the involved certificate authorities were invalidated).&nbsp;
</p>
<p><em><strong>Security Advisory 2718704</strong></em> can be found here &gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2718704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2718704</a> </p>
<p>Following broad adoption of KB2718704, <em>second action</em> was implemented with the new update to the Windows Update Client (WUA v7.6.7600.256) that introduced two changes: A hardening of the WU and WSUS infrastructures so that the Windows Update client
 will only trust files that are signed by a new certificate issued by the Microsoft Update certification authority and that is used solely to protect updates to the Windows Update client; and in a similar way, a strengthening of the communication channels used
 by WU/WSUS.<br />
As mentioned above, details on the changes made to the <em><strong>WU client</strong></em> can be found at
<em><strong>KB949104</strong></em> here &gt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong>Other related updates made available:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>- KB2677070</strong></em> Released June 12, 2012 (<em>An automatic updater of revoked certificates is available</em>).-
</p>
<p>In addition to Junes' security updates, MS have released a non-security update to make available an automatic updater feature for Windows Vista and Windows 7 untrusted certificates. Users of WinXP and below would still need to check on WU and install the
 root certificate updates when they are made available. This new automatic updater feature provides a mechanism that allows Windows to specifically flag certificates as untrusted. With this new feature, Windows will check daily for updated information about
 certificates that are no longer trustworthy.<br />

<p><em><strong>- KB2728973</strong></em> Released July 10, 2012 (<em>Unauthorized Digital Certificates Could Allow Spoofing</em>).-
</p>
<p>In addition to Julys' security updates, MS have released a high-priority non-security update, as a pre-emptive protection action, to move 28 certificates that do not meet standards for security practices into the Untrusted Certificate Store.<br />

    <title>Linksys Wireless adapter won&#39;t install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Linksys Wireless adapter won&#39;t install</h2>
                    I have a Windows Vista turned Windows 7. It's also a Dell Studio 540. I had this computer since 2009. January 5th I was unplugging my computer's USB port and it shocked my computer and it immediately turned off. I left it alone until the next day. My computer
 wouldn't turn on. The power button would blip and the fans turned when the power button blipped but that was it. A few days after I changed out the power cord and sure enough my computer came on. It took a few restarts to get the USB ports to read my keyboard
 and mouse. I went to plug in my Linksys AE 1000 wireless adapter and it gave me a error code no. 28. One of the suggestions was to install a update from the net which is stupid because how can I install something if I can't connect to the net? The next problem
 resulting in me not being able to turn on my computer anymore. The power button blipped but that was it. I took it to a computer repair and learned that my power supply was bad. The shock most likely did it in. So now th

<p>I had to re-download my Cisco's driver which you gave me the link to and I say thank you! I'm pretty sure all the shocks and automatic turn offs my computer went through the power supply was sure to go bad. My Windows XP never did that and I had that computer
 since 2001 and it still works! Minus the updates that Windows no longer supports!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a note for those who may end up going through what I've gone through and what I learned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you shock your computer and it automatically turns off and there's no charred or burnt smell, chances are it's the power supply. Mine would come back on after a few hours but like I said it was going bad. If your circuits looks fine with no bulging capacitors
 or burnt marks you don't need to change out the mother board which I was skeptic about doing.
</p>
<p>If your wireless adapter won't connect just find the program your wireless router came with and reinstall that.
</p>
<p>Since I figured out these things w/o having to dig in my pocket I hope this will help somebody out.</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a video in movie maker and am using Nero to convert and burn it to disc for play on DVD player. &nbsp; Below are specs from the file and file types:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>video is 36 + mins long</li><li>file size is 977KB</li><li>files are mp3, mp4, AVI and wav</li><li>Error code when burning is 0x887a005 which reads:
<ul>
<li>There are missing or unusable files in your movie maker project that are preventing your movie from being saved. &nbsp;Please check the file preparation is enabled in options or remove the files and try again
<ul>
<li>Where can I find in options to enable file preparation. </li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to remedy this type of error or know of a free or inexpensive burning software that I can use to burn this video to disc? &nbsp;It took me a very long time to create and edit this video in movie maker, and with it failing to convert and burn
 I am on a tight dead line for completing this for my son's 8th grade graduation on June 1st - I have 2 weeks to complete this.</p>

<p>The preparation options are under File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced. But the default is to prepare the files, so that's probably not the reason you are having problems saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common reasons are incompatible files. The .mp4 file is probably okay, but I'd consider converting the .avi to .mp4 or .wmv and then use that file instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The step of burning a DVD is moot if you can't first save your movie to your PC. That's what you need to get working first.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">
I have downloaded the Microsoft Solitaire Collection including the Magic Puzzles. All of the solitaires work fine except for the Magic Puzzles. I do not always get the puzzle of the day. Sometimes a picture just sits there doing nothing. Eventually a puzzle
 pops up and I start to work the puzzle and then it goes to an advertisement: Metapricing, Yahoo, Slaughter Time, Access Price, Penguin Tips, etc. Sometimes I just get a blank white page. I start all over again and get the same things. It does this every few
 seconds. I uninstalled the Microsoft Solitaire collection and then installed it again. I have done this twice and nothing works. I do not have any other problems with my computer. Nor do I have any problems with the solitaire collection, just the Magic Puzzles.
 Suggestions please...... I have Windows 8.1, 64 bit </p>

<h2>            How to remove Ad Mediator</h2>
                    <p>I had Ad Mediator 1.0.3 installed before upgrading to Windows 10 and apparently there was something wrong with it and now I can't uninstall 1.0.3 (When I install 2.0.0 I have both versions installed, when I try to repair the older version it says the feature
 is unavailable, I guess what it is saying is that it couldn't find the package).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So now I don't know how to uninstall Ad Mediator 1.0.3, I tried to find installation package for older versions but there is only 2.0.0 available on the internet. Plus, MicrosoftFixit didn't fix it.</p>
<p>

<p>I worked for a large company and we had a volume license key that we used to activate it. So I guess it would depend on how/where you purchased the software. I would expect that the package that the CD came in would include a key to activate it.&nbsp; Or there
 should be a Microsoft sticker somewhere on the physical server that has the key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you no longer have that, then you could try restoring the system state from a backup of the server when it was working onto the new copy of Windows. But that opens up a whole new set of problems if you are not using the same physical hardware that was
 backed up. I would suggest trying that on VM that you can just delete if it doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really need to upgrade.&nbsp; If your application doesn't run, then you need to update/replace that too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Moto, we have the license Key and have the installation ID but after calling the Microsoft activation team they were unable to activate it as their "Tools" do not work for it because it is an obsolete product. So after 45 minutes
 on the phone to microsoft i was advised to post on here to get another member of the Microsoft support team to help me activate my 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now i have to sit and wait.</p>

<p>You might be waiting for a long time because I think that most people on these forums, like me, are not MS employees. If you would happen to get an employee, they likely would need to use the same tools as the person on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your application vendor still in business and offers a version that runs on 2012R2? Or is it that your company just doesn't want to pay for an upgrade? You might not have a choice.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is this rude of Microsoft&#63;  &#40;New Bugcheck 0x0000009f  crashes&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface pro 4 is precisely 1 week out of warranty (I was an early adopter). It has recently started rebooting with the event log showing that the bugcheck was&nbsp;0x0000009f. I have changed nothing, except for MS updates to windows 10. It is fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Any ideas what might be causing this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I find that Microsoft wants to charge $29 for online chat "tech support". Does this seem a bit rude, given that my expensive device which has been flakey since day 1, has now become even worse likely due to an update that is forced on me by MS?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you, Barb! Hope, MS engineers will be able to fix this bug soon. It's not a critical showstopper but very annoying during development: I can't interrupt my debugging process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And definitely great product as Surface Book&nbsp;should not contain that kind of a bugs!</p>

            Hi Tymessen, i hope you're doing great today.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately that is not a possible thing to do at the moment. What you can do is change the Game DVR folder location but as i understand that is not what you need to do.

                    <span>Hi all <br />
                    <span>Hi all <br />
First i don't know of this the right section to post , if it was not please tell me where to move it .<br />
<br />
I have windows vista ultimate with sp1 , a while ago i installed " Bio Shock " ( a game for windows ) . during the installation it asked to install DirectX 9 and i canceled the installation because windows vista have DirectX10 and it shall support
</span><span>DirectX9 games . however when starting the game igot the error message " cannot find d3d9.dll " so i went to the game's CD and installed
</span><span>DirectX9 and every thing went great .<br />
<br />
yesterday i installed another game " DevilMayCry4 " , this game have two executables
</span><span>DirectX9 Version and a </span><span>DirectX 10 version . when trying to run the
</span><span>DirectX 10 exe i get the message "ERR03 : Failed to Initialize </span>
<span>DirectX10 . <br />
<span>DirectX10 . <br />
<br />
the dxdiag tool says the DX version is 10 , how ever nothing seems to run on directx10 even the first game " Bioshock " which have an option to display
</span><span>DirectX10 surfaces , but this option is disabled .<br />
<br />
<br />
in winodws&gt;system32&gt; there are a ton of </span><span>DirectX fiels from d3d8.dll to d3d10.dll and d3dx10_xx.dll .<br />
<br />
can any body please tell me what is the problem and how can i fix it . <br />
<br />
here are the system specs <br />
</span><span><br />
OS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : windows vista ultimate SP1</span><br />
<span>Memory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 1.65GB DDR2 533 FSB<br />
<span>Memory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 1.65GB DDR2 533 FSB<br />
Porcessor : intel dual core T2400 1.83GHz<br />
Grapics card : ATI mobility Radeon X1600<br />
System : Toshibe SatellitePro A164<br />
<br />
Note: the graphics card uses hyber memory technology. it has a 256 mb graphics memory built in and takes another 256 from the system memory on windows XP . but on vista the direct x diagonistics tool says that it has an Approx memory of 766 mb .
<br />
<br />
thanks a lot <br />

    <title>Windows 7 versus Windows XP NTFS partition compatability&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rcglider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 versus Windows XP NTFS partition compatability&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm wondering if it's possible to install and setup&nbsp;WIndows 7 on a mutil-boot system with XP&nbsp;so that all files and folders are accesable from Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a dual boot system (XP 32 bit and XP 64 bit, on separate hard drives)&nbsp;with&nbsp;three 2TB&nbsp;hard drives, 5 partitions each for a total of 15 partitions, 6 of which are actually used (OS, applications,&nbsp;data), with the remaining used mostly for backup purposes
 (also swap files, tmp files, &nbsp;and temporary instances of raw video files before processing).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have system restore turned off. I perform backups by doing the equivalent of a drag and drop copy of all files and folders (including&nbsp;hidden and system, but not volume id or recycler folders)&nbsp;from one of my "active" partitions to a folder in a large backup
 partition (I use windiff to verify afterwards). To backup the partition with XP 32 bit on it, I do that while running XP 64 bit and vice versa. I can quick format and drag and drop copy to restore any of these partitions without any issues (except for a minor
 issue with \windows\installer folder where it gets emptied by any update activity, but is fixed by doing a second restore).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm considering going to a tripple boot system, adding Windows 7 to a partition on the third hard drive. My main concern is what impact this will have on the remaining 14 partiions and compatiblity with XP. I realize that one change to NTFS partitions by
 Windows&nbsp;7 is multiple restore poitns, but I plan to disable system restore (if this is possible with Window s 7). I'm also concerned that Windows 7 might affect folders on the 14 existing partitions by adding access rights info to those folders, which would
 prevent me from accessing them from XP. My&nbsp;other concern is the ability to backup&nbsp;and restore just&nbsp;the partition with Windows 7 on it.&nbsp; My drag and drop method would require that none of the files or folders on the Windows 7 partition be protected from access
 via Windows XP. If this isn't possible, my next concern is being able to restore individual files from a Windows 7 type (image?) backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this is an unusual situation, but if anyone here can help me with information about XP / Windows 7 file system issues, I would appreciate it.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:<br />
<br />
1. Search for 'command prompt' using Windows Search.<br />
<br />
2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.<br />
<br />
3. Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command and press Enter key.<br />
<br />
4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. <br />
<br />
If issue still persists, perform clean boot:<br />

            Thank you for your suggestions - I ran the sfc /scannow and there were no problems and I do not have malware - I have not had any problems for a few days now - I did delete some folders I thought may be a problem - if the problem continues then I will
 try the clean boot as you suggested but I am holding off a little longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            In Windows 10&#40;x64&#41;, how do you get to the Bios to change status of Virtualization Technology&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My antvirus protection is compromised, apparently because Virtualization is 'disabled' in Bios (as seen in Task Mgr/Performance).&nbsp; I need to 'enable' it.
</p>
<p>Question is how to get at the Bios Utility to change the status of this Virtualization Technology.</p>
<p>Can any help?</p>

            <p>Your antivirus program is not compromised if virtualization is disabled. One has nothing to do with the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus software typically includes additional functionality that is separate and apart from virus protection. One common antivirus program 'add on' is a special web browser to use when doing online banking. This feature is not really necessary; you are
 perfectly safe without it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The special web browser often relies on virtualization technology - that's why your antivirus program wants virtualization to be enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible use for virtualization by an antivirus program is called 'sandboxing.' This means that suspicious objects coming from the internet are tested in a segregated part of your computer, where they can't harm the rest of your computer. This too
 relies on virtualization technology. Nothing wrong with it, but it's also not necessary and possibly dangerous. If my antivirus program (Kaspersky) detects possibly malicious code coming in from the internet, it will be blocked altogether. No need to 'test'
 it first. I don't want to take the chance that something suspicious will be able to break out of the 'sandbox.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are decisions that you can make. If these features are important to you, by all means use them. However, as your computer skills grow you'll come to learn that these things are mostly theater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enable virtualization you need to boot into your computer's BIOS or EFI. Newer computers typically use EFI while BIOS is used by computers older than about 2 years. Your computer manufacturer has instructions on how to boot into the BIOS/EFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once there, you need to learn how to enable virtualization. The procedure varies from computer to computer, so find out beforehand (from your computer manufacturer) what to do for your computer. I strongly suggest you get this information before you start,
 because if you make a mistake in the BIOS/EFI you can get into real trouble.</p>

<h3> david marlow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Library &#39;Art&#39; Files bug</h2>
                    Having upgraded from WVista to W7, my WMP library incorrectly allocates the latest updated album 'art' to what appears to be a randomn number of other albums when I exit the product.
<br />
<br />
The problem starts when I use the 'Find Album Info'&nbsp;option on the right mouse menu from an&nbsp;album&nbsp;icon (art) in the library.<br />
<br />
I am running WMP version12.0.7600 16415.<br />
<br />
Any ideas please?

<p><span>Hi David Marlow,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Player downloads album art from an online database where the information is supplied by a variety of non-Microsoft data providers.
 If the online database contains incorrect album art, the Player will download that album art.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the Player downloads album art, it also downloads all other media information associated with that album (such as the album
 name, song titles, and so on). If you've manually edited the media information for that album in your Player Library, then following these steps will overwrite your changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Step 1: </span></strong><span>Delete the files in Art Cache folders; there are&nbsp;two folders you need to clear out:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Users\‚Äùusername‚Äù\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player&nbsp;(Delete the contents of the Art Cache folder)</span></p>
<p><span>C\Users\‚Äùusername‚Äù\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Ehome (Delete the contents of the Art Cache folder)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Add the album art of your choice manually:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the Player is currently open and you‚Äôre in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Browse to the album that is missing art.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Find a picture that you want to use for album art (the picture can be on your computer or on a webpage), right-click the picture, and then click Copy.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The original picture can be in any of the following formats: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Player Library, right-click the album art box, and then click Paste album art.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A copy of the picture is embedded into each of the songs from that album. The copy of the picture is automatically scaled to
 the appropriate size and converted to the JPEG format before it is embedded in the file. The original picture file is not modified.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-album-art-in-Windows-Media-Player#TopOfPageTarget" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-album-art-in-Windows-Media-Player#TopOfPageTarget</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>You may disable windows media Player from, automatically obtaining and updating missing media information for music files in your library.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the Player is currently open and you‚Äôre in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Player Library, click Organize, and then click Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Privacy tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Uncheck
<strong>Update music files by retrieving media info from the Internet</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on apply and ok
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>you may follow the same steps and place a check mark against ‚ÄúUpdate music files by retrieving media info from the Internet‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you want the windows media player to add album art from the online database, follow the steps mentioned in the link</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-album-art-in-Windows-Media-Player#TopOfPageTarget" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-album-art-in-Windows-Media-Player#TopOfPageTarget</a>

    <title>Windows 10 reset, inaccessible device blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian_s87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reset, inaccessible device blue screen</h2>
                    I've read many others posts but I haven't figured out on my computer yet. I have a Lenono B575 laptop. It had windows 7 before and I upgraded to Windows 10 lately. The system won't start properly so I did a system reset. But now it ended up a restart loop
 with blue screen saying 'Inaccessible boot device'. I tried reseting BIOS setting. Also I tried pressing F8 at the start as some posting mentioned. F8 didn't work at all on my laptop. Lenovo usually has the one key recovery button. So I tried that too. It
 brought up just like when I press power button. Windows 10 removed Lenovo's recovery function! Now it's completely dead. I can't do any reset or enter advanced setting or safe mode at all. &nbsp;I haven't figured out how to fix this problem as I don't have any
 system DVDs. Anyone has any idea how to solve this? I wouldn't have upgraded to Windows 10 if I knew the system is so fragile.

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform&nbsp;Startup&nbsp;Repair.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a>
</p>
<p>(Refer to the section "<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool</span></a> " in the above article for creating the tool).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start your computer from the installation media. Insert&nbsp;the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to ‚ÄúPress any key to boot from DVD,‚Äù do so. If you don‚Äôt see the message, you might need to change
 the boot order in your computer's&nbsp;BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to&nbsp;start the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Startup Repair'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Hope the information helps. Write to us if you need more information and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 OS has literally disappeared from my computer</h2>
                    <p>The windows 10 operating system has been rendered inoperative on my computer. No programs that use win10 will work including the start button. I can access the internet and google search+chrome works OK but all windows 10 programs and it's features
 such as edge, note, metro tiles, start button, internet explorer files, control panel, Windows Live Email/outlook, ect &nbsp;won't work. I have a microsoft acct and can still access it but no WIN 10 programs will work. Have tried to use my WIN 8/8.1 recovery disks
 but they wont work. It seems that all files are intact which i can access &nbsp;using the only windows program that still works, &nbsp;the Task Manager. Also it seems that many win10 services which I &nbsp;also acessed via task manager(services sub-window) have stopped running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had WIN 10 for 4 month now and it has worked OK in that time tho i was happy with win 8.1. Something has caused my win10 OS to completely shut down and literally disappear from my CPU. Note: all the help/search/link/task buttons at bottom
 of the win 10 OS have disappeared except &nbsp;the Cortana button, which doesnt open nor work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start button wont work at all and i have to shut down cpu using the physical shutdown &nbsp;button on my dell 8500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the Avast anti-virus is working(a non-win10 app)</p>

            Only Windows Vista drivers are available, but you might be able to get a compatible driver from within Windows 10 or Windows Update.

<br />
<br />Connect the printer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add printer
<br />
<br />Click 'The printer what I want isn't listed'
<br />
<br />Select 'Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings'
<br />Select 'Use an existing port'
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Under Manufacturer, scroll down then select HP
<br />Over the right hand side, scroll down through the list and look for your printer model.
<br />
<br />If you don't see it, click Windows Update and wait while Windows Update checks for the printer.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't find it, click the back button, then click Next again.
<br />
<br />This time, select HP and in the printer list, select a driver series that closely matches your printer model

            Most probably yes. You need to run the driver media in compatibility mode for Windows X though, where X can be the OS where it works.

<p>We have a old powerbuilder application which is running fine on Windows xp.</p>
<p>This application has a &nbsp;.ocx(OLE&nbsp;Active X control)&nbsp;file. This file is currently 16 bit and is not registering in windows 7 environment. Please see error below.</p>
<p>I have decompiled this file and got the source code. I am trying to recompile the file.

<p>How can i do it in Micresoft visual studio 2010.&nbsp; Will recompiling and re-creating this&nbsp; ocx file as 32 bit resolve this issue ?

<p>We are migrating our applications to Windows 7.</p>

<h3> richwallacesp  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I escape from Windows 10, which has trashed my pc&#63;</h2>
                    I am now desperate. I attempted to install Windows 10, which has in fact disabled my keyboard and my mouse so that I can do nothing with my pc. I have received various bits of advice from kind people, none of which has worked. I have created a Media Creation
 Tool, accessed the Windows Recovery Environment, and hit a dead end. No-one seems to have a solution. But I really need my machine for work, and currently it is just a heap of junk. Is there anyway I could simply get rid of Windows 10, and revert to my old
 OS, Windows 7, which may be out of date, but at least it works? Remember, I can use neither mouse nor keyboard.

            <p>Your computer manufacturer has a method for restoring your computer to the way it was when you first brought it home. The instructions should have been included with the computer, or contact the manufacturer's technical support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The next time you think of upgrading to Windows 10, don't be like other dummies here: Prepare. If you just click and let Windows do the rest you're taking a chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a lot of preparation that needs to be done to upgrade an operating system. All the information you need is out there on the internet, but you have to do the work. Better to spend time
<em>before</em> you upgrade than waste time&nbsp;<em>after</em>. It's a lot less frustrating too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 is not going anywhere, and since it's only going to get better over time (it has nowhere to go but up) you can take your time and learn the steps that virtually guarantee a successful upgrade.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And once you're done, you can <em>answer</em> questions here instead of asking.<br />

            <p>Without knowing what you have or haven't tried, this is going to be a shot in the dark, starting from the basics to the more advanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When the PC is on, unplug then replug in your mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If it is Win10 killing your mouse and keyboard, then you should still be able to boot in safe mode. Press F8 when you turn on. (Might take a few tries). You can try to get your mouse/keyboard working from here or go to A. below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If it is the BIOS killing the keyboard and mouse you have a much bigger problem. You will need to reset the BIOS. The simplest way is to turn off the PC, unplug it and take the battery out of the motherboard leave for 30 secs put back in. If you are using
 a laptop this is a whole lot trickier given it requires taking it apart. If this is the problem and you are uncomfortable doing it - take it to a repair shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If none of that works. Go to BIOS, change to boot from USB/DvD (whichever has the Media Creation tool). This will run Win10 setup.
<strong>Doing it this way should keep your files and settings but you will lose all installed programs.</strong></p>
<p>Step 4 is dependent on the problem not being your BIOS as you need the keyboard to get into it unless you have a DIrect to BIOS button on your motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. If any of steps 1 to 3 work. In Settings --&gt; Update &amp; Recovery you can revert to your previous WIndows version within 30 days.
<strong>Step 4 will in all likelihood remove that option.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What dead end did you hit with the Media Creation Tool?</p>

            The dead end? Well, I was following the advice of a Microsoft engineer to use Media Creation Tool. I was meant to navigate through the Recovery Environment until I found "Automatic Repair", which would do the job. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I
 &nbsp;got as far as "Advanced Options". However, when I clicked on it, there is no "Automatic Repair" option. What there is is "System Restore", "System Image Recovery", "Startup Repair", "Command Prompt", and "Go back to the previous build".</span>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Startup Repair", it attempted a repair, and then said it couldn't do it, and sent me back to Advanced Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported this, but no response yet.</p>

            <p>Don't quote me on this but the 'Go back to previous...' option should restore your pre Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i'm guessing you booted from the USB/DVD with Media Creation Tool on it? As it sounds like you were able to navigate through meaning your mouse and/or keyboard is working pre OS load. So it isn't your BIOS killing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case try steps 1 &amp; 2 I suggest above, or try plugging in any other keyboard/mouse (borrow one from a friend).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like the installation bauked the drivers. Plug and play should still work but if it doesn't it sounds like you can revert using the Media Tool.</p>
