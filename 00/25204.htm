<h2>            PowerPoint VBA&#58; Move Text To Title Placeholder</h2>
                    <p>HI,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a large presentation with the title's text located in shapes rather than in title placeholder. Thus I am wondering if any of the VBA pros know if there is way to automate cutting the text and pasting it into the title placeholder (which is on screen
 via applying a new layout)? The actions would be:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I select the shape with the text meant to be the title. &nbsp;</li><li>Run macro, which:
<ol>
<li>Cuts the text</li><li>Selects the title</li><li>Pastes the text</li><li>Deletes the shape</li><li>Resets the slide</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>Any help would be most appreciated!</p>

            Calendar views are very limited in the number of simultaneous tasks they can print. The only way to print more is to zoom in so each day is larger and so can show more simutaneous tasks. Alternatively apply a filter to hide tasks you're not interested
 in.<br />

<h2>            Synchronisation of draft emails with upgraded Outlook Email</h2>
                    <p>Should the draft email folder synchronise across devices with the upgraded Outlook Email? It does on a PC with Outlook 2016 / Office 365 Home but does not on Outlook for IOS on an iPad or a Microsoft Lumia 950 with the latest general release Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>I cannot find any information on what one should expect. Does anyone know what devices / apps support draft synchronisation from the new Outlook email?</p>

            <p>Thank you for taking the trouble to reply but I do not think that really addresses the question. I am accessing my Outlook.com account from different flavours of Microsoft Outlook from different devices. Arguably, Microsoft's Outlook is part of 'OFFICE'
 and why should it matter if it is running on a PC or a mobile phone?</p>
<p>All the other email folders synchronise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make my question more specific should one expect drafts to synchronise (on the upgraded Office 365 based Outlook.com email) on:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Outlook Mail Version 17.7812.42258.0 on a Microsoft Lumia 950</li><li>Microsoft Outlook - email and calendar Version 2.9.1 for&nbsp;IOS on an iPad </li></ul>
<p>And, if not, if anyone knows, why not? As I would like to be able to start an email on one device and finish and send it on another.</p>

            <p>Why is this so difficult to answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked support on Microsoft Outlook for IOS. The response is that drafts do not synchronise but claims they are working on it.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that the Outlook client on Windows 10 Mobile might be more in tune with working across devices, I attempted to ask support accessed through outlook.com and had a completely valueless chat with someone who claimed to be trained only on 'Office'.
 They did not know the answer, refused to escalate the issue and claimed that the only place to get an answer was the hardware support partner for Lumia phones: support.b2x.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the spirit of adventure I asked B2x and the representative clearly did not even begin to know how to engage with the question. They asked me to do a soft reset and then failed to ring back as they said they would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems pointless to me to have drafts synchronise across desktop applications and not mobile ones. Perhaps it is Microsoft's aim to provide this feature on mobile devices at some point in the future. If that is the case why not make it easy to discover
 the current state of play across the various Outlook client apps and the intent of future development? Why on earth do I have to contact support (who do not know and 'can't be asked')?</p>

<h2>            N95-1 Music player Volume control problems</h2>
                    I muted the music player recently by turning the volume all the way down via the side volume controls and now I'm unable to turn the volume back on or up. The up controls on the side of the phone seem to work, ie feel the click of the switch operate, but
 nothing happens? I'm able to listen through the headset HS-45 that comes with the phone but have no control over the phone/music/video via the AD-43 in either the Music or Video modes?. Haven't yet tried the phone functions via headset! can somebody throw
 some light onto these issue's - phone has been its firmware recently updated to the latest version via the Nokia web site without any problems in a hope of rectifying these issue's but no luck.

            Can you adjust the volume in calls?<br />
<br />
How about in Hands free mode does the volume work in hands free?<br />
<br />
Is the problem only present when you have headphones or headset connected? or also when playing through the speakers?<br />
<br />
If you can't adjust the volume at all in any application then it's probably a faulty volume control.<br />
<br />
If some applications work but other don't then there's some sort of software problem.<br />
<br />
If the problem only happens with headset or just with speakers then you may have some faulty audio chip or other hardware related problem.

            Hi<br />
<br />
I have a similar problem. Recently upgraded to V21.<br />
<br />
Stick with me here...<br />
<br />
Firstly I noticed the volume keys on the side of the phone didn't work; couldn't turn music up/down nor did they work when I was on a call. The only way to adjust in call volume was to use the centre navi key.<br />
<br />
Secondly; whenever this happens I also notice when the keys are locked that the message "Press Unlock to activate keypad" keeps appears on the screen without me pressing anything.<br />
<br />
Finally this causes a battery drain. Massively increasing the power usage from 0.2w to well over 1w<br />
<br />
This happens intermittently i.e. cant adjust volume for about a day then everything is fine again.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I also noticed that when the above happens the music controls (multimedia keys) when the slider is down dont work, they dont pause, play, stop, fwd/rwd or launch the music player.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            I've not quite the same issue's as my upgrade is 20. whatever, not yet done the new version 21 etc, I was hoping that the was another way of controlling the Music Players volume control apart from the side controls.<br />
<br />
All the other programmes volume can be controlled but only from the centre button conig on the phone - again was hoping there's a built-in short cut to un-mute the Music players volume.<br />
<br />
Thinking about what happened I just turned the volume down a little first and then tried to turn it up again which didn't make any difference before muting it, so i think its the keys up which is the problem and until I can get the mute cancelled then I'll
 not be able to sort any of the other issue's out - thanks for your reply's

            My problem has now stopped.<br />
<br />
I had recently installed some 3rd party software:<br />
FlipSilent<br />
ShakeSMS (self signed)<br />
<br />
So I removed ShakeSMS 1st and the problem persisted.<br />
I then removed FlipSilent and there was no sign of the problem.<br />
<br />
I then reinstalled only ShakeSMS signed and I have not had the problem since I last posted so fingers crossed it shouldn't return.<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to reinstall FlipSlient but dont want a buggy phone again...guess thats the only way to prove it it was what caused the problem...I'll give it a little more time before I try

At least this shows that the problem is not in the phone but in those apps.

            I previously reported that I had battery drain issues which I found to be due to 3rd party software, I suspected FlipSilent v1.03 was the perpetrator and can now saw I truely believe that to be the case.<br />
<br />
Without FlipSilent my phone has been working fine not battery drain or other buggy issues like my clock needing to be reset when my phone was turned off or my slider not unlocking when the phone when slide up.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I installed FlipSilent v1.05 and almost immediately my phone started playing up; the slider issue appeared within minutes.<br />
<br />
I didn't wait for the battery drain issue to start or to see if the clock would start needing reset...I uninstalled it and my phone is fine.<br />
I have been trying to report the issues I had with Torgen but could not get access to post...maybe someone out there can report this to him

<h2>            Please help&#33; Virus not showing in control panel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Usually when I think there are unwanted programs on my computer I go to Control Panel and uninstall any unusual programs. If control panel doesn't work, then I use Revo Uninstaller. But this time, my computer has been acting really slow, especially when
 loading sites like Youtube. I checked control panel and revo for any unwanted programs and both of them are not showing any. I don't know what is wrong. I didnt download anything for these programs to be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also, there are these green ticks on some of my desktop icons, and checkboxes were disabled in folder options when I checked. Another strange thing is that when I go on to YouTube, while the page is loading, things like these come up in the bottom left
 of my screen - waiting for secure.something and ad.something and stuff like that. On my other laptop when I load YouTube, waiting for www.youtube.com comes up on the bottom left, which is normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; The laptop that is showing these problems is a Lenovo G700 with Windows 8. Does anyone know what the problem is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. I know that resetting the laptop would probably solve the problem, but is there any other way?</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - SharePoint Site Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am global admin of my company office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I am not able to see all SharePoint sites of my company at one place. How can I see all SharePoint sites at one place without being Owner or member of it?
</p>
<p>In my SharePoint Admin center, I can see 5 sites:</p>
<p>https://netorgftXXXXXX.sharepoint.com</p>
<p>https://netorgftXXXXXX.sharepoint.com/portals/hub</p>
<p>https://netorgftXXXXXX.sharepoint.com/search</p>

<p>Question 2: Can I see all these sub SharePoint sites in one location?</p>
<p>Question 3: How I can add/remove myself as&nbsp;member/owner&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2: One of my team's SharePoint site is giving 403 forbidden. </p>

<p>Hi Praful, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's discuss with your questions one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Some sites cannot be seen in SharePoint admin center. </p>
<p>a.When we create a site collection in SharePoint admin center, we can see and manage it in it. Those five sites you mentioned are default site collections in SharePoint Online. You may also create new site collection here. To learn more, see<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-or-delete-a-site-collection-3a3d7ab9-5d21-41f1-b4bd-5200071dd539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Create or delete a site collection.</a></p>
<p>b.Other site collections like https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/site name could be a site collection created in SharePoint home page (click the SharePoint tile in app launcher) via clicking Create site. Moreover, when we create a team or an Office 365
 group, a site collection related to this team and group will be automatically created. This kind of site collections cannot be seen in SharePoint admin center. To learn more, see
Create a team site in SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How to add group or user to these site collections?</p>
<p>a. For the site collections in SharePoint admin center, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Customize-SharePoint-site-permissions-b1e3cd23-1a78-4264-9284-87fed7282048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Customize SharePoint site permissions</a>. A simple method is to directly share items in the site to that end user or group.</p>
<p>b. For the site collections which is related to an Office 365 group or a team. Normally it should be managed by the owner of that group or team. As global admin, you may check in Office 365 admin center&gt;Groups&gt;find the group&gt;add yourself as owner of the
 group. Access the site collection, and see if you are able to manage permission there (setting gear&gt;Site Permissions&gt;Advanced Permission Settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Question 2: Can I see all these sub SharePoint sites in one location?</p>
<p>Use SharePoint Online PowerShell. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161380.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get-SPOSite</a> command. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. How I can add/remove myself as&nbsp;member/owner?</p>
<p>a. For sites in SharePoint admin center, see<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-administrators-for-a-site-collection-9a7e46f9-3fc4-4297-955a-82cb292a5be0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Manage administrators for a site collection</a>.</p>
<p>b. For site collections cannot be seen in SharePoint admin center, you may let group, team owner share the site collection with you and give you full control permission.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Cannot use SharePoint Online PowerShell.</p>
<p>Given the screenshot, it seems Single Sign On feature is enabled in your tenant. In this situation, you should use an account which has global admin role and format is name@domain.onmicrosoft.com to connect SharePoint Online PowerShell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. For the issue, one site collection is 403 forbidden and other further questions about points mentioned above. I will suggest you post new threads for different points. Our engineers will look into them further with you in each thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>

            Hi Tatyana,<br />
<br />
The link works for notebooks stored in personal OneDrive associated with a Microsoft account. It cannot be used to set notifications for notebooks stored in SharePoint site or OneDrive for Business account.<br />
<br />
In SharePoint online, we can only <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-an-alert-to-get-notified-when-a-file-or-folder-changes-in-SharePoint-e5a79e7b-a146-46da-a9ef-d65409ba8918#Pick_tab=Online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">set
 alert to one item or the whole library</a></span>, and if there are more than one account you want to send the notification to, please type and separate the addresses with semicolons after the Send Alerts To blank. There is no out-of-box feature to set alert
 for specific file type, e.g. notebooks. I suggest you set alert for every notebook one by one. Or you can post in&nbsp;our
 forum</a></span> to&nbsp;look for some workflow solutions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />

    <title>iPhone sms and mms transfer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winmacpro  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPhone sms and mms transfer</h2>
                    
<p>i've been an iphone user since 2008. I consider myself a fan of good products. I have my lumia 920 which is the best phone to currently hit the american market, but i am unable to use it in its current state. There is &nbsp;solutons &nbsp;to transfer your contacts,
 calendar, pictures, video, and music along with playlist and album covers. But i'm stump that there isnt a way to transfer my text and mms from my iphone. i have important messages and would like to be able to utilize only one device if i need to reference
 anything. with all the work you have put into migration i'm surprise text wasn't first on the list. i have my phone but havent activated it yet and probably won't if i cant bring over my past text history from my iphone 4s. i dont understand how it was presented
 that migration from an iphone would be seamless when migrating a big piece of important content was left out and as of now no announce to develop a solution. as much as i dont want to but i may have no option but to return and abandon nokia and windows phone
 altogether, because that is a big deal breaker for me and i'm sure many others. i did not know during my anticipation of this wondeful device, that, i would have this as an issue.</p>

            I know this doesn't directly talk to your issue with regards to your sms/mms, but here is some data regarding iphone-to-windowsphone for you.<br />

I know that if you use outlook, there is a way to sync sms/mms, though I have not used it. not sure if you can do that with your iphone or not.<br />

<p>Thank you for your response. I checked out the link and theres no information there that addresses my issue. Nokia and Microsoft completely forgot to address message history for non windows phones. Shame I refuse to carry both phones just so I can reference
 past texts with my contacts.&nbsp;</p>

            yes.<br />
<br />
you may be SOL. :/<br />
<br />
I never keep texts for that reference myself. I would imagine that some searching online may find some way or application in the app store to transfer texts for you.<br />
<br />
you certainly cannot be the only one.<br />

<p>Actually iPhone only Allow to transfer Contacts, the TRANSFER Data App in Windows is open to Contacts and Text Messages, i guess there should be an CYDIA app to unlock the Message transfer or may be Descript them, since SMS are always encripted in iPhone.
 Sucks .....</p>
<p>May be some developer can help on this..</p>

            <p>Were you on a support site or was it an email. Sounds like you were on a web page that asked you to make that a trusted site. To know if it's really microsoft-I never saw "oas.support.microsoft.com"-but doesn't mean it may not be legit-use Bing and ask who
 is and do the address you are being requested to put in your trusted sites list.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I was signed in on a Microsoft Support Site and had asked a question.&nbsp; I got the response I posted above when I went back to&nbsp; the site to read the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I BINGed the "oas.support.microsoft.com" as you suggested but only get related sites.&nbsp; When I directly put the site address in and try to go to it I get the warning shown below in large letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Linda here! OK! Now you know! DO NOT PROCEED!! It is a spoofed site and remember, even without clicking on a link, visiting bad web sites can still give you nasty critters you do NOT WANT. Microsoft has the Smart Screen Filter with Internet Explorer which
 is really good, but I also use McAfee Site Advisor free edition. It's just a tiny tool bar, but it has colors, like green, letting you know where you are going is safe. It shades in grey if a site is dangerous, but most importantly, when you do searches, it
 lets you know if the sites in your search are safe by showing a green check mark beside them. Questionable links show up with a "?" circled in grey! You defintely got a fraud email-defintely not MS! Go to McAfee.com and search for site advisor free edition.
 I think you'll really like it and as I said, it takes up hardly any room on your toolbar. Let me know how you are doing. Also, when tracing an IP, sometimes you get this message shaded in Orange "WHOA! Are you sure you want to go there?" At that point, close
 it out and get out-do not proceed! As the old cop show sergeant used to say, "be safe out there." Oh! Defintely report it. You don't get too far trying to contact security or abuse at hotmail, but go to the security forum of this community and post what happened
 to you there so other people can learn what you have and maybe one of the moderators there can better assist you in contacting security with MS about the fraud email!</p>

<p>Yes, I was signed in on a Microsoft Support Site and had asked a question.&nbsp; I got the response I posted above when I went back to&nbsp; the site to read the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I BINGed the "oas.support.microsoft.com" as you suggested but only get related sites.&nbsp; When I directly put the site address in and try to go to it I get the warning shown below in large letters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Good Afternoon,</p>

</p><p>I wanted to know if the final update for windows 10 mobile (when its starts to roll out) whether older nokia lumia devices will be legible to receive the update. I have a Nokia lumia 920. I have read some blogs that state a possible March 17th release date
 but they only mention specific devices that are legible for the upgrade. My Question is will&nbsp; the update be available for other Older lumia devices?</p>

<p>Releases are never done for all devices at the same time.</p>
<p>they'll come in batches. </p>
<p>unless your carrier somehow blocks the release, I see no reason as to why the 920 won't get it at some point in time.</p>

<p>Now that we actually know about the release and the upgradeable devices, this couldn't be less helpful, because it creates expectations that it is available when in fact... it isn't.</p>

<h2>            Stumped on N900</h2>
                    
<p>I charged my N900 until the pulsating yellow indicator LED turned to a steady green on. &nbsp;Upon unplugging the charger from the phone, the steady green turned to a slowly pulsating white. &nbsp;When I pushed the power button to boot the phone, it would not respond....no
 matter how many time or how long I held the power button down. &nbsp;I figure maybe I missed something in the instructions, but couldn't find anything to describe that issue. &nbsp;Finally had to remove the battery and re-install it to get the phone to come back from
 it's zombie like trance ! &nbsp;What did I miss and what the heck was THAT all about?? &nbsp;Thanks for any assist - N900 Rookie !!</p>

<p>im assuming your phone was off when you had it charging? and then the screen was dark but lit up at the same time during the charge/after the charge (hard to describe but you probably know what i mean).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when you unplug the cable, or turn off the device, wait about ten to fifteen seconds before trying to turn it on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I am not sure what this means on a MAC version. You write "<span>Click the File tab". Sorry that does not have any meaning. If I click to open such an old file I only get the alarm, see screenshot. So, there is nothing like opening a file tab. And nowhere a
 convert button, that is all on Windows only, never on MAC. There is nothing we can do, the get info command is of no use, the command "open with" only gives us the Word app. As far as I know NOTHING can be done on MAC, and no so</span><span>lution whatever
 is expected. So I am asking help from Windows people to convert the files to docx, xlsx and so on. For the ones who know, this is an APPLE issue and CANNOT be solved by MS. End of story! In other words, this present discussion is basically a waste of time.

<p>Hi Marie,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Office 2016 for Mac can be used with multiple languages, all of which are installed by default. The Office for Mac user interface (menu items, buttons, or other interface elements) and Help content change dynamically
 based on your operating system preferences, so one way to change the language in Office for Mac is to change the language of your operating system. For example, if you set the operating system language preference to French, Office for Mac will be displayed
 in French.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">If you still want to change the language of your operating system, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Click the&nbsp;<span><strong>Apple</strong></span>&nbsp;menu, and then click&nbsp;<span><strong>System Preferences</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Click&nbsp;<span><strong>Language &amp; Region</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">Click the + sign under&nbsp;<span><strong>Preferred languages</strong></span>, select a language from the list, and click&nbsp;<span><strong>Add</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">When asked if you want to make this language your primary language, click&nbsp;<span><strong>Use [Language Name]</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">You can also set a primary language by dragging a language to the top of the&nbsp;<span><strong>Preferred languages</strong></span>&nbsp;list.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">You may have to restart your Mac for language changes to take effect.</p>

<h2>            How can I check if a slide index exists&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I'm making this .pptm and I need to delete all of the slides(except for the 1st one) every time I open the .pptm.</div>
<div>I already wrote the code that deletes the slides but I can't find a way to tell PPT to check if other slides exist and, just in that case, to delete them.</div>
<div>(Deleting the slides when the presentation is closed would be great too if there's no way to do the other way).</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

                    In Word 2013, I would like to be able to search for condensed text regardless of the number of points the text is condensed. As far as I can tell, I can search for text, but I have to specify the points that the text is condensed. Is there a way to search
 for any condensed text, without entering a number of points?

            <p>It doesn't appear this is possible. I tried creating a macro that used:</p>
<p>but it would not accept anything but an equals sign. I suppose you could create a macro that search for every possible increment of compression, but it would be much faster to use
<strong>Home&gt;Select&gt;Select All</strong>, followed by a <strong>Font&gt;Advanced&gt;Spacing&gt;Normal</strong> command.</p>

</p><p>Thanks a lot. Creating that macro would be a pain in the neck and I'm not sure but there are an infinite number of possible increment, so I'm not sure it would work anyway. But your second suggestion was perfect. (In fact, I can't believe I didn't think
 of it myself!) I just selected the whole document and set the font to normal spacing!</p>

            What you could do is highlight the whole document, then use Find/Replace to unhighlight anything that is not compressed/expanded (i.e. Spacing= 0) . Whatever remains highlighted is compressed/expanded.

            <p>Hi Nicki5,<br />
<br />
Method one:<br />
Let the administrator run â€œmessage traceâ€ &nbsp;for specific recipients. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;â€œmessage traceâ€ cannot trace mails older than 90 days. Here &nbsp;are the articles for your reference:<br />
Run a Message Trace and View Results<br />

<p>
</p><p>Method 2:<br />
<br />
Search mails sent to one address &nbsp;some days ago such as 7days before, 30 days before, 90 days before &nbsp;or 180 days before. You need to set some filters in this page:</p>

            Outlook.com is not a business-oriented mail service and you cannot set up company-wide domains using Outlook.com, so I don't understand the reference to "users". Are you actually using an Office 365 for Business subscription?

<p>we are having the same issue with only 1 user. He is using O365 for Business. The recent people block pops up randomly, and cannot be closed or anything, even if outlook is minimized, it stays up in front of the desktop. As a test, whilst the bar was up
 and stuck i sent a mail to myself, the bar disappeared, and then popped up again but this time with only my address in it. Once it pops up only way to get rid of it is kill outlook.</p>
