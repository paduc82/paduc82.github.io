<h2>            Restoring a deleted file</h2>
                    This morning I was working in a cafe, and when I tried to save my document on the wifi there it said ' could not upload to the server'. I came home and tried saving the document on the home wife and it still wouldn't upload. I then somehow overwrote my
 edited document with my original document which I had last used 12 hours ago. When I looked for other stored files under 'restore files' I couldn't find any other versions uploaded to the server. Is there any way I can retrieve the files I edited?

<p>Hi Anna</p>
<p>Thanks for this. Unfortunately I hadn't previously backed up the computer and since I overwrote the file when I saved it (and my changes had not uploaded to the server) the computer has no record of previous version of the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<h2>            What is Microsoft Dynamic HTML Editing Control&#63; </h2>
                    Recently when going to certain websites I get the following message bar at the top of the screen:<br />

So far I've ignored it and it doesn't seem to have any effect. What is this add-on?&nbsp; What does it do?&nbsp;

You might also consider upgrading to IE8, which provides even more security than IE7.

<p><span><span>Does the problem only happen with JPEG files?<span>&nbsp;</span>What results do you see when trying to insert a Bitmap.<span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem only

 starting with Office 2003, Access / Office no longer ships with Photo Editor, so you would need to install it from an older version of Office if you don’t already have it installed or you would need to try and use a different file type or use Attachment fields
 instead of OLE object fields.<span>&nbsp;</span>The article below provides some additional information:</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Nathan and thanks for the response. Sorry I am answering so late, but was out of town for a couple days.</p>
<p>The problem occurrs with any file format including .bmp. I agree that the issue is with the pgm being used as the OLE server, but I cant find any useful info as to how to register or redirect what pgm is used as the OLE server or how it is setup or reset.
 Just changing the file association to open with different prgms didnt help. Tried JASC Paint Shop Pro 8, and the new Windows Photoviewer, also Office Picture Mgr. I could install the older Photo Editor if you think that might be&nbsp;a solution from an older version
 of Office. I would really like to know more about how the OLE server works and is setup. Thanks. C.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>As mentioned above, Access needs to use Photo Editor to display JPEG files, so I would first recommend installing it from an older version of Office (see link in previous
 post).<span>&nbsp; </span>After doing this, I would create a new blank database with a test table in it that contains an OLE field and try to insert a bmp and jpeg.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you still get an error, then you may have some incorrect settings

            Thanks again Nathan. I will give that a try ASAP and let you know. I take it then, that Access CANT use anything else as the OLE server? Seems strange given that it is an obsolete pgm with 3 versions of Access since then. Will let you know how it goes.

            Hi again Nathan. I installed Photo Editor from an Office XP disk and changed it to the default pgm. I installed ONLY the PE program and deselected everything else on the CD install. Same error occurrs whenever trying to insert a graphic, .jpg or .bmp.
 PE is somewhat limited with graphic size it will display etc. so its really not a suitable pgm to leave as default, but it is installed and functioning, but is not helping with the issue. I opened a sample inventory DB from one of the MS Access Templates to
 test the insert. I have also tried creating a blank, new DB using the wizards with the same results. Current OS is Win 7 Ultimate x64 and running Office 2003 Pro and Office Enterprise 2007. Same results with either version of Access. Saw some references to
 this type of problem being caused by antivirus apps so I also tested after completely disabling my AVG AV and Malwarebytes with same results. Appreciate your assistance and will follow any recommendations you provide. Thanks. C.

<p>I appreciate your help Nathan and the recommendation regarding the ticket, however, I have no desire to get directly involved with MS.</p>
<p>What I will tell you is that I have done some additional testing and found that the operation works fine on another laptop installation (XP Pro OS) of Access 2003, build 11.5614.5606. On that machine, which has not had any of the service packs run, the OLE
 insertion works fine even with the same grapic image. Moving back to my primary PC which has the same Access 2003 only SP3, build 11.8321.8329 shows the issue. Repair and reinstall on this PC did nothing, keeping it at SP3. Total removal and reinstall resulted
 in Access 2003 with a build 11.5614.8329 which also exhibited the issue. So it appears that whatever brings the install from 11.5614.5606 to 11.5614.8329 is the culprit. I was hoping that the total removal and reinstall using the same Office 2003 disk would
 result in a return to the original .5606 build like my laptop, but it appears that there is still some other update files that are resident preventing that. Further testing on yet another XP machine reaffirmed the same thing, however, I found that the uninstall
 of both the Office 2003 and what was listed as "MS Office 2003 Primary Interoperatability Assemblies", file size 7.33 MB, Ver. 11.0.6553.0, then a reinstall of Office 2003, reset the installation to the .5606 version and the OLE insert works fine again. So
 the bug appears to be in that "Interoperatibilities Assemblies" update and can be recreated on 3 different machines, two with XP and one with W7.</p>
<p>I guess I can use this as a workaround and just not allow any updates to be installed on the 2003 Office installation. C.</p>
<p>Addnl. Info:</p>
<p>Attempting the same thing on my primary PC did not work. It seems to refuse to install to the .5606 level even after removing the same IO Assemblies updates. The only difference between the other two PC's and this one is that this primary PC also has Office
 2007 installed along with 2003 and there is also a cpy of Visio 2003 and Adobe Acrobat Pro 9 installed here. I only mention Adobe since it does integrate tightly with Office. So the file that is keeping any Office 2003 install from reverting back to the .5606
 revision is still resident here and with all of the other updates that have been installed it is impossible to narrow it down further. I guess I will just have to design the new database on my laptop instead of my newer W7 PC, but that is a ____ of a workaround
 for a problem apparently caused by a MS update. C.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Chuck,</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Though the testing you have done makes it appear to be related to a specific update (and it could possibly be), these types of problems usually are related to incorrect registry settings, which
 is why I still feel that there may be some registry settings related to .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg that are incorrect and / or a specific CLSID in the registry that has been kill bitted.<span>&nbsp;</span>Unfortunately, going through each of these settings on a
 form could be tough and if done incorrectly could cause damage to your computer or to someone else’s computer if they read these steps and implement them incorrectly.<span>&nbsp;</span>Due to this risk, that is why I would recommend opening up a case.</span></span></p>

            Thanks again for all of your help and time. Present company excluded, my experience with MS is that they are more interested in screwing their customers with licensing checks and verifications than really assisting their customers, so I have no desire
 to get directly involved with them and a work ticket. I will just make due with a partially non-functioning MS product, which unfortunately, isnt unusual for MS. C.

<p>Hi Chuck,</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear you feel that way.&nbsp; But if you change your mind, we would be more than happy to assist you.&nbsp; As mentioned before, I personally have assisted several customer's with this type of issue and more often then not the problem is related to a
 3rd party photo / graphic program that they installed on their machine, which in turn changed the OLE server info that Access needs to render the object.&nbsp; Due to problematic nature of OLE fields, if possible,&nbsp;it really is recommended to stay away from them
 and within Access 2007 use the new Attachment datatype option.</p>

            yes you can. download the update at http:www.palm.com/750updateATT Bear in mind that you will lose your data when applying the upgrade. Make sure you have a good backup.

<p>Thanks SOOO much for the information. I have tried to get the SpriteBackup v5 to download but it won't accept my phone's Serial #...and yes I did use the number "0" and not the letter "O" but it sill says it's invalid.
 They also reference Treo 700W and not the 750. ANY recommendations for a GOOD free backup software for my AT&amp;T Palm Treo 750 running Windows Mobile v5 (hopefully v6 once I do a complete backup!!!)&nbsp; Much Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user that is trying to open a recurring meeting in Outlook 2016 but it keeps crashing. We've ran a repair, deleted Outlook profile, deleted .OST files, and we're still having this issue. I looked through the logs when it crashes but it doesn't provide
 any details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user currently has 289,041 items in their mailbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current work around is to use OWA to change or delete recurring meetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            I'll post on that forum but I disagree. There's nothing wrong with backend configuration. We have several people working on O365 but only one user that has the problem.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t open OneNote &#34;You&#39;re not connected to the internet&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded the free version of OneNote 2013, but when I try to open the program, I get the message&nbsp;"You're not connected to the internet". The only option you have then is click the button "I will come back later".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I for sure have internet connection, so I do not know what the problem is. My computer is brand new and runs Windows 7. I read somewhere about managing credentials, so I checked that. But i do not have any credentials listed in my credential manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody got any idea what the problem might be?</p>

Secondly, opera is much better application than the mobile internet explorer for windows pocket pc/pda/phones.<br />

<br />
The JAVA is enabled already and I checked it but I still cannot get through at all.<br />
<br />
Is there a new Java version that needs to be downloaded and installed? and where from?

<h3> seashellonthebeach  say:</h3>
<h2>            My hotmail account keeps shutting down Internet explorer after a few seconds - why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been diverted from the Windows Live team to here - here's a summary of what happens:</p>
<p>I deleted a suspicious looking email from my inbox.&nbsp; Then after that, hotmail is automatically shuts down Internet Explorer after a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further investigation has been:</p>
<p>I tried Firefox and it is not an issue with that - only with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I also tried reinstalling IE and upgrading to version 8 but this didn't help except that now, it keeps saying the tab is being refreshed before causing the error rather than
 just shutting down IE straightaway.<br />
<br />
I did&nbsp;try using a different computer and the same thing happened.<br />
<br />
Usually what happens is that after a few moments, the Visual Studio Just-In-Time Debugger comes up saying that there's been an 'unhandled win32 exception occurred in iexplore.exe [6312].&nbsp; The dialog box asks me if I want to use the selected debugger.&nbsp; If I
 choose no - it closes down IE.<br />
<br />
If I go yes it tells me&nbsp;"A buffer overrun has occurred in iexplore.exe which has corrupted the program's internal state."&nbsp; Call stack location:
<br />
msvcr80.dll!024abd93()<br />
<br />
The disassembly shows : 024ABD93 and dword ptr ds:[2534920h],0<br />
<br />
I hope this helps<br />

<p>Please answer <em>all of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Does the behavior persist if you've started IE in No Add-ons mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; <strong>Start | (All) Programs | Accessories | System Tools | Internet Explorer (No add-ons)</strong></p>
<p>2. Does the behavior persist after you open IE (only!) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a>, run the Fix It and then reboot?</p>
<p>3. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>

<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>

            I've tried&nbsp;Waze and Maps. Waze has a rather cartoonish interface, a lot of annoying social media stuff that needs turning off and pesters me every time I drive past speed camera to confirm it's still there, but the turn by turn navigation is good and the
 re-routing around traffic seems quite effective. Maps seems a bit more grown-up and as you've seen, there is a way to convert saved locations from a HERE account to a Maps account. I'm not sure it's a substitute for My Commute because that didn't pester you
 with turn-by-turn instructions, just indicated which route was fastest and I don't think Maps can do that at the moment.

<p>If the above does not work, create a new user account on your pc and logon with that account. Connect your device. If it sync, logon back on with your initial account and connect. Let me know if this helps. It worked for me.</p>

    <title>MS Project&#58; Assigning resources with limited effort to tasks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurt-stadler  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project&#58; Assigning resources with limited effort to tasks</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS-Office champions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using MS-Project 2010. I need to plan tasks which have resources assigned, but with a fixed amount. So resource A contributes 3 PD, resource 2 PD and so on. The total effort for the task shall be, of course, the sum of the resource contributions. So
 tasks have effort and resource contributions shall determine the duration. It shall be assumed that resource contribution shall be evenly distributed over the task duration. So if the computed duration is 10 days and the resource shall contribute 5 PD the
 load for the resource shall be&nbsp;half a day&nbsp;over the task duration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do this with project 2010? What task type would be most appropriate? Moreover, how can I consider focus factors for resources?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance</p>
<p>Kurt</p>

<p>
</p><p>OK, now that I know what you want to do, follow these steps instead:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click anywhere in the Gantt Chart pane (on the right side of the Gantt Chart view) and select the Show Split item on the shortcut menu.</li><li>Select a task on which you want to assign a resource who will expend limited effort (work).</li><li>In the Task Form pane at the bottom, select the resources who will work on the task, enter a Units value for each resource indicating the focus factor value (like 50% that you noted in your last post), then enter a Work value for each resource as well.</li><li>In the Task Form pane, click the OK button.</li></ol>
<p>Using the new set of steps, you will not need to change the Task Type and Microsoft Project will automatically calculate the Duration value for you.&nbsp; Frankly, the method I am giving you in this post is the method I prefer to use personally.&nbsp; On a Fixed Units
 value, if you provide the Units value and the Work value, Microsoft Project will calculate the Duration value for you.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<p>No - it just means that the company that makes CoC doesn't want to make a windows version. Microsoft can't force companies to make apps for windows.</p>

            Well..does it mean that android and iOS users contacted them to make it available for them. I paid to MS for this mobile so its their responsibility to look after their customers needs. Yah surely developer may not be interested to make CoC for windows
 which holds only 3% market share.

<p>"Nokia" is a separate company that has nothing to do with Windows Phones or the app store or anything at all. I suppose you meant "Microsoft Mobile", which is the current name of the ex-Nokia device division. they also have nothing to do with it - they just
 make phones.</p>

            Thanks. MS took over the part of Nokia. &nbsp;Recently heard that Nokia will be in the market with their android mobiles. I mentioned about that. I bought Lumia just because i am a Nokia fan. I had Nokia lumia 920, Nokia X2, presently using MS lumia 640XL and
 MS Lumia 540. &nbsp;Cant think anything other than Nokia mobiles. Its a mental attachment. Nokia+android will dominate the mobile market in near future i hope.&nbsp;

    <title>Word 2010 - Undesired text indent for Heading 4 in Multilevel List - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2010 - Undesired text indent for Heading 4 in Multilevel List</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A colleague has defined a new multilevel list as part of a new document she is creating for use as a template . She has defined heading levels down to level 4, generally using Word's defaults. Allof the heading level numbers&nbsp;are left-aligned, but what we've
 found is that while headings 1-3 have the headting title text a few spaces after the leading number, for some reason heading 4 has a lot of space between the number and the heading title text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Background</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; History</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Diet of Worms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've looked a bunch of different places and tried various things to try and eliminate that extra space, but nothing works. If anyone has suggestions we would greatly appreciate them. Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers /td</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you! That gets us much&nbsp;closer, though it starts to shift the header number to the left slightly. However, at this point - and peering into the bottomless chasm that is Word numbered lists - I think that is going to work out well for us.

</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Whether you use your existing profile to add your POP accounts as Imap or create a completely new profile configuring only the Imap accounts from scratch is your choice. What happens depends on what sequence you follow - a lot of different permutations and
 combinations. One thing to keep in mind, regardless of which way you approach it - does not impact the data located on your server so you can't damage anything. POP3 / Imap is purely a "protocol" used to access the data on the email server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - Nothing gets "created" on the server by virtue of using the Imap protocol - what email folders get included will depend on the email provider (for example - Imap GMail will have a root folder called "GMail" with sub-folders located underneath it. You
 can create additional folders but keep in mind that these will never be accessible when you access the account via POP3 which is exclusive to the &lt;Inbox&gt;.</p>
<p>#2 - There's no synchronization between the PST and OST</p>
<p>#3 - Yes there is one OST file created for each Imap account</p>
<p>#4 - The one folder that gets created all the time with "This Computer Only" is the &lt;Sync Issues&gt; folder. Whether or not the other folders (Calendar, Contacts, Drafts, Journal, Notes, Tasks) get created depends on whether or not you have another InfoStore
 (i.e. PST file) designated as the "default" data file for the profile. The "default" data file is the default location for these item types.</p>
<p>#5 - Folders with "This Computer Only" are automatically created (if relevant/required) when you first configure the account - not under your control. Keep one thing in mind - an OST file is specific to the email account/profile which created it. If you
 recreate the email account - a new OST file will be created and any data in folders marked with "This Computer Only" will be lost. You can't open an .OST file on its own as you can with PST files.</p>
<p>#6 - If you want to sync non email folders between computers/devices - you will need to use an email account type (Exchange ActiveSync or full Exchange). Outlook itself does not sync &lt;sideways&gt; (I.e. computer to computer - it syncs "vertically" (i.e. with
 the email account on the server). Since I don't try to sync data "sideways" - have no idea what 3rd party options exist or how well those would work.</p>
<p>#7 - Rules work the same way</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make things easier - if you post any follow up questions using "reply with quote" - please put those questions outside of the quoted area (you can also delete whatever is not relevant in the quoted area) -&nbsp;makes things a lot easier and faster to
 deal with.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What happens depends completely on the sequence of events that are followed when configuring the accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the following description - these assumptions apply</p>
<p>- this description is exclusively for Outlook '2013</p>
<p>- this is in reference to a new Outlook '2013 installation - not an upgrade of a previous version</p>
<p>- this only references one email account (may not make a difference depending on scenario)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario #1 - POP first - Imap second</p>
<p>
</p><p>- this will create a PST file for the POP account (or use an existing one if that's what you've selected) and becomes the 'default" location for your contacts/calendar items</p>
<p>- an OST file will be created automatically when configuring the Imap account and the PST file assigned to the POP account will contain your contacts/calendar items etc
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario #2 - Imap first - POP second</p>
<p>
</p><p>- this will create an .OST file for the Imap account which becomes the "default" infostore for the profile and contain the local folders for contacts/calendar (anything in the folder tree with "This computer Only" in the folder description</p>
<p>- a PST file will be created for the POP account (unless you assign one that already exists). If a new PST file is created - it will not have the contacts/calendar folders. The folders contained in the .OST file will be utilized as the default</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** caveat - any data in OST folders with that includes "This Computer Only" in the folder description will be lost if you have to recreate the Imap account and you don't have a backup of this data. OST files can only be opened in the original profile containing
 the account that created it. (A serious oversight in my mind by the designers when they made this change and am presuming that they were thinking of Exchange accounts which would contain this info at the server level)</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word when launching&#58; an error has occured, Word is not functioning correctly. Word therefore has to shut down.</h2>
                    <p>After installing the Microsoft Office Proplus 365 on my Windows 7, everytime I open Microsoft Word, I get the message:</p>
<p>"We are sorry, but an error has occured, Word is not functioning correctly. Word therefore has to shut down. Would you like us to repair it now? Then there are three dialogue boxes: repair, help, close"</p>
<p>No matter what I click, Word always shuts down within a few seconds.</p>
<p>I have tried the short and long repair in Programs, but it only works during the session that the PC is on. After shut down or restarting, the same problem reappears. I have also tried opening Word in the safe mode, but the same problem persists, so I gather
 it is not caused by a plug-in. I have all latest drivers on all devices (checked manually) and updates installed. I get really frustrated having to run the repair session everytime I switch on the PC and want to use Word. Any suggestions?</p>

            Thank you for the info, I uninstalled using fixit from the link and reinstalled from my account, all to no avail, the same problem persists when I try to open Word. From the entire Office package, only the Word application has this problem, all others
 are working correctly. I do use ABBFineReader 12 and also SDL Trados 2017, but have unchecked the plug in boxes, so that really should not be the problem.

<h2>            DELETION OF FILES MODIFIED BY VIRUS IN FILE REGISTRY</h2>
                    <p>I am a user of Windows 10 operating system. Kaspersky antivirus did not detect any infractions in my system. However, a blinking command prompt screen kept on popping up. I used Rkill to kill unwanted processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OUTCOME USING RKILL:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking for processes to terminate:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;* C:\ProgramData\Windows Security\winsecurity.exe (PID: 3296) [AU-HEUR]<br />
&nbsp;* C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Dsq\network\sysnetwk.exe (PID: 5536) [AU-HEUR]<br />
&nbsp;* C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Dsq\browser\syshostctl.exe (PID: 5820) [AU-HEUR]<br />
<br />
3 proccesses terminated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I boot up the system, I have to kill these processes to prevent them from popping up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, I used an unpaid version of SpyHunter to check for infractions. It identified the above processes as trojan and found out 2000+ other infractions. They also provide the path of the files added to the file registry by the threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example of path provided:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">\SYSTEM</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">\CurrentControlSet</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">\Services</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">\WindowsSecurity::Start</span></p>

You do NOT need to remove files or registry entries manually. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From Microsoft's site:&nbsp;</span><span><em>Warning</em></span><span><em>&nbsp;Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly
 by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating system.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You've only killed the running processes so far. Until you remove the malware that's creating those processes and registry entries, it'll likely keep appearing in startup. What you need to do is run anti-malware
 scans to <em>remove</em> the malware permanently that's creating those processes.<br />
<br />
First, open Control Panel. Under Programs and Features - Uninstall a program, check for anything suspect and remove/uninstall it. If unsure, leave it alone. Note: This will only 'start' the uninstall process. Then run Disk Cleanup to clear out temp, temp internet
 files, cookies, etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After which, run Rkill again if necessary to kill those processes before running these malware removal programs.</p>

It <em>may be</em> necessary for you to seek further help on a specialty forum if those steps don't get rid of it. Let us know how things go after following above steps.</p>

    <title>Inserting a tab into a Merge Field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eriksl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting a tab into a Merge Field</h2>
                    <p>I want to insert a tab between the mergefield and the preceding text. If the mergefield is empty, it should not show the preceding text.</p>
<p>So I use:</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD&nbsp; Productnumber \b "Product Nr.: " \* MERGEFORMAT }</p>
<p>{ MERGEFIELD&nbsp; Color \b "Color: " \* MERGEFORMAT }</p>
<p>
</p><p>This results in:</p>
<p>Product Nr.: 12345</p>
<p>Color: Blue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want it to result in:</p>
<p>Product Nr.:&nbsp; &nbsp;12345</p>
<p>Color:<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Blue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried nesting { SYMBOL 9 } in all variations like { SYMBOL 0009 \u } but that doesn't do the trick. Anybody got a solution?</p>

<p>You just insert a tab character from the keyboard. You'll need IF fields, however, to prevent printing the label data if the field is empty. Something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ IF { MERGEFIELD Productnumber } &lt;&gt; "" "Product Nr.:&lt;tab&gt;{ MERGEFIELD Productnumber}" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>where &lt;tab&gt; represents a tab character.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I find "Product Nr.:" very ugly. The best solution would be to spell out "Number." If you want to abbreviate, the standard abbreviation for "Number" is "No." But to avoid the period followed by a colon, you might use # instead.</p>
