<h2>            live mail&#47;wifi</h2>
                    i have an omnia i910 and use live mail with the push option (as items arrive). whenever i turn my wifi on, the phone goes into a deep sleep and wont wake up. however, when i turn email to 15 min or manual sync, it wakes up fine. is there a setting i can
 use that will help it wake up with the push setting? or is there a reg edit that will allow me to make the 15 min sync more like 1 or 2 minutes. thanks

            unfortunate the wifi connection get's lost while in sleep mode. This is done to preserve the battery. The only way your push notification still will come in is if you have a data plan on your phone.

    <title>Outlook 2016 on mobile devices without Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 on mobile devices without Exchange</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft PC on Windows 10 with Office 365, also have a surface three and a windows phone ( Windows 10) with Insider, I have to use a Google mail account to Sync my Outlook Calendar and Contacts with Outlook App on Phone and Surface. this is because
 I do not have exchange and use outlook 2016 on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as I have to use outlook on my surface and phone with Google to sync it why do I need Office 365? I can get word and excel free for the surface and phone and still use my Office 2007 for my word and excel on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have mobile devices for use when out and about and a <strong>basic requirement</strong> for anyone to to be able to keep a diary and contact info in sync plus send and receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel until we can sync Outlook 2016 with all its features without having to have exchange MS for Mobile devices is not an option, having moved from MS few years back when the seemed to have ignored mobile users to Google and now after spending quite a
 lot of money to get back to windows I feel they are not there yet and I may as well cancel my office 365 as it does not integrate without spending more money each month to make outlook 2016 work with contacts and calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a workaround but that is messy really and is not a proper answer-- folders do not sync etc so we are left without a satisfactory solution, it looks like &nbsp;Microsoft will loose my £80.00 a year subs for office 365 and Google will win again-
 what a great shame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is this- Is there a fix now or very soon that will allow "online Activesync" for Outlook 2016?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure I am not alone in this frustration&nbsp;</p>

            You should be able to automatically sync Outlook 2016 with devices by connecting them both to a free Outlook.com account. The mobile devices will use EAS and Outlook 2016 will use either EAS or full Exchange, depending on whether or not the Outlook.com
 account gets created on the current Outlook.com platform or the Office 365 platform. Contacts, calendar, and mail will all sync. It works for me.

            <p>Hello Brian Thanks, &nbsp;I have tried that work around but I feel a messy way of doing a simple thing, also you finish up with more calendars on your mobile devices and I dont not use outlook.com for mail. &nbsp;- I can get my mail with imap on all devices it is
 the calendars and contacts the problem, unless things have changed in the last two months?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel it is not much to ask Mr Gates- we had it before with active sync but that was a few years back.&nbsp;</p>

            You are already using a third party utility, so what's the problem with using outlook.com, you don't have to use its email section, and since outlook.com is not part of Office you can always cancel Office &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            agree admit defeat and move on or away from MS again and come back ina few months/years, they still have not cracked thing for mobile workers - just yet. Last time I tried a paid 3rd party exchange connection all my contacts were bombarded with spam within
 24 hours.&nbsp;

<p>That is a limitation of the IMAP protocol and not up to Microsoft to fix; IMAP only supports mail folders.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they won't be able to achieve that original (ambitious) target. Expect most US based accounts to be moved by end Q1 2016 and most other accounts by Q2. They are focused on doing this as painless as possible so they rather pause and fix issues
 instead of steamrolling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are really putting a lot of effort in it and it really is a huge undertaking with that many accounts and differences between the original Hotmail/Outlook.com mail service and Exchange Online. But once your account has been moved over, it is definitely
 a huge improvement :-)</p>

<p>
</p><p>3. During upgrade, I want to keep all my system settings and metro apps, while deleting all other programs and files, what is the correct configuration to choose?</p>

<p><strong>This is not true, Microsoft has not in any way made any announcements regarding how the final release will be distributed, whether it be free or carry a cost. Rumor sites have been making those speculations, Windows 10 is still early in development
 and we won't know anything regarding pricing until closer to release. We have a few more milestone previews and interim previews to test before any such information becomes available.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Testing the Windows 10 Preview is not a guarantee that you will get the final release for free, never has been. Persons who evaluated previous releases in preview such as Windows 8.1/8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP never got the final product
 for free. Please note that Windows 10 is a pre-release, you should not in anyway install it on a production system if thats your only computer:</strong></p>

<span>Important</span>

<li>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You'll need a third-party program to convert the ISO file into installable media—DVD burning software often includes this capability.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Remember, trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up
 everything.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you want to stop using <span>Windows&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Preview</span> and return to your previous version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall your previous version from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC—typically
 a DVD. If you don't have recovery media, you might be able to create recovery media from a recovery partition on your PC using software provided by your PC manufacturer. You'll need to do this before you upgrade. Check the support section of your PC manufacturer's
 website for more info. </p>
</li><li>
<p>After you install <span>Windows&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Preview</span>, you won’t be able to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your previous version of Windows.

<p><strong>The best option is to evaluation Windows 10 in a dual boot configuation:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-10-technical-preview-issue/e578e8f6-c317-4e00-87e5-11fd0baed81a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-10-technical-preview-issue/e578e8f6-c317-4e00-87e5-11fd0baed81a</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you understand the risk of installing a preview on a production install, your best option if you don't want to keep programs and files, is to choose the Keep Nothing option during setup. Prior to doing this though, you should ensure you enable
 PC Syncing in Windows 8.1 and sync your settings. You will have to syn these settings after install Windows 10 Preview using your Microsoft Account (Windows Live, Hotmail, Outlook.com or MSN).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I strongly recommend you dual boot instead though, you should not be defaulting to a preview at this early stage of development.

            <p>There has been NO official information on a free upgrade for anyone. Microsoft has not announced how the upgrades will work of if there is a cost. Best guess is that there may be a nominal fee as there was for a period with Windows 8. So at this point in
 time and until there is an official announcement, assume that it is going to have a price fixed to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't upgrade from 32bit to 64bit as it requires a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you elect to use the Tech Preview, understand its a beta and as such things may or may not work. What works and what doesn't varies greatly from build to build. As posted on Microsoft's site, don't install on a production system. A good assumption is
 you'll lose everything.</p>

    <title>Fixed continuous Section Break - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregory winters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fixed continuous Section Break</h2>
                    <p>Since Word seems to require sections be established prior to working with headers and footers, and the breaks actually&nbsp;<em>control</em> the behavior of these, it stands to reason that if you want to ensure that your headers and footers remain as you want
 them on certain pages, then you need to be able to insert sections breaks that <em>
do not move</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working with a template that has a specific header on the first page, and a different header on the second page, and no headers from this point forward. &nbsp;The continuous section break at the bottom of page 1 permits me to insert this second header on
 page 2, but if the amount of material on page 1 changes, then this can kick that section break over to page 2 and now all my headers are hosed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my template, 'sections' are not determined by content, but by <em>position </em>
in the document. &nbsp;Thus, 'section 1' stands for "everything which is on the first page of the document," and 'section 2' stands for "everything that exists on the second page of the document, and 'section 3' stands for "everything in the document which occurs
 after this point" because I have no headers starting on page 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...what I need to know is one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;How to force section breaks to remain where they are&nbsp;<em>on the page</em> instead of relative to text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-OR-</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;How to set up pages which do not rely upon section breaks to be able to control the content of headers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Word does not really work with pages. &nbsp;The pages you get when working with Word are based on the default printer you have set on the computer. &nbsp;Change the setup on the printer, or change the printer, and Word will repaginate your file. &nbsp;Pass the file to
 someone else with a different printer and you document will look different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem explanation confuses me slightly as if your page 1 cannot extend beyond the first page then the problem should not arise. &nbsp;The section break will only move into page 2 if the content inserted before it extends beyond the capacity of page 1.
 &nbsp;Likewise page 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly are you putting in the template? &nbsp;You just need two consecutive section breaks with possibly a single space character or paragraph character before each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't already, turn on display of hidden formatting marks to ensure you don't have a lot of unnecessary paragraphs or spaces. &nbsp;Turn them on/off by clicking the Pilcrow character on the Home tab. (Looks like a backwards P)</p>

            <p>It goes like this...I have three different header situations in this newsletter: &nbsp;the Logo Banner is on page 1, the Editorial Banner is on page 2, then no header for the rest of the document. &nbsp;I need the headers to remain where they are no matter what I
 enter into the pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, let's say I'm creating the document for the first time. &nbsp;I enter text all the way down to the bottom of the page then insert a Continuous Section Break. &nbsp;I keep typing onto page 2 of the document, then go to the header on page two, turn OFF
 'Same as Previous,' and insert a fresh header. &nbsp;OK, I keep typing until I get to the bottom of page two and insert&nbsp;<em>another</em> Continuous Section Break, keep typing onto page 3, then go up to the header on that page and again turn OFF the 'Same as Previous'
 option, delete what carried over from the previous section and continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is fine at this point. &nbsp;However, now I wish to go back and edit the document. &nbsp;I've discovered, say, that I wish to enter an additional paragraph into page 1, which now 'kicks' the section break I previously entered over to page 2. &nbsp;Well, I don't
 think I need to tell you what now happens: &nbsp;&nbsp;all hell breaks loose. &nbsp;Headers appear all over the page, overlapping one another, deleted entirely...you name it. &nbsp;It's gruesome to try and fix manually just be reinserting new section breaks, believe me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is for these section breaks to remain fixed to the last character on each page
<em>no matter what that character is</em>, or have them anchored to some other fixed element. &nbsp;I mean, how else to I prevent the jumping around of these headers?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does this make the situation clearer?</p>

            <p>As Sanwin2 says, you can't force a section break to stay put. But you can certainly solve part of the problem by using the
<strong>Different First Page </strong>setting. This allows you to have different headers on the first page (in the First Page Header) and the second (primary Header). You would then need a section break after page 2 in order to omit the header
<strong>unless</strong> you use a conditional header of this format:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>{ IF { PAGE } = 2 "Text you want in the page 2 header" }</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>{ IF { PAGE } &gt; 2 "" "Text you want in the page 2 header" }</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
All field delimiters (the things that look like braces but can't be entered from the keyboard) must be inserted using
<strong>Ctrl+F9</strong>, though a shortcut for inserting the PAGE field is to press
<strong>Alt+Shift+P</strong>. What goes between the quotes in either the TrueText (first example) or FalseText (second example) can be anything. If your header is complex, the easiest solution is to Cut it to the Clipboard, create the IF field, and then Paste
 it between the quotes.</p>

            <p>Hi Suzanne:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response! &nbsp;It seems that only one questions remains: &nbsp;can material other than text be inserted in your instruction line in place of text?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Header 1 in my document is a grouped set of images. &nbsp;Header 2 is a formatted text box with borders and colors, including tabs and justification of text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will your solution accommodate all of this? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;I'm surprised at this point in Word's history that something so simple and obvious as header and footer control is still so complex, but at least I know that I haven't been missing something simple before posting here.</p>

            <p>Theoretically yes; as I wrote, "What goes between the quotes...can be anything." You can certainly test it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The content of the First Page Header is immaterial; if you currently have it in the primary Header, select all the content, cut it to the Clipboard, and paste it into the First Page Header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select all the content of Header 2 and cut, then paste it between the quotation marks. If it appears on page 2 (and not on page 3), you're good to go.</p>

            <p>Hi Suzanne:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been struggling with this method for over two hours and nothing seems to work.&nbsp; No matter what I do, no matter how the pages are set, if I delete that Section Break which separates page 1 from page 2, then my header on page 1 simply disappears - POOF!&nbsp;
 I can't even get to the part where I can try out the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the case for my existing document and even for a new one, but I have to confess that I haven't done
<em>too</em> much with a new document because of how poorly Word performs with Copy &amp; Paste.&nbsp; I've discovered that no matter what I do, the new document requires a massive amount of reformatting work even though I select the choice 'Keep Source Formatting.'&nbsp;
 I can't even tell you how many aspects of the original document that it ignores!&nbsp; This would require literally hours of rebuilding.&nbsp; Sorry about the paragraph runon, but I'm using Microsoft's own product - IE11 - and for some reason, the return key doesn't
 work.&nbsp; Will this company ever get it right??</p>

            I'm working on this. Although the solution I proposed nominally worked, the document kept crashing Word--hardly a desirable outcome--so I'm working on an alternative solution that I think you may find useful.

            I'm not surprised...and what's even more ironic is that this was created from one of Microsoft's own Office&nbsp;templates (fonts, page layout, etc.).&nbsp; Please don't spend too much time on this - no need for a second person to be as aggravated as I am!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;
 I appreciate all your efforts.

    <title>Excel CONVERT function is inaccurate when converting lbm to kg - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lbarnes49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel CONVERT function is inaccurate when converting lbm to kg</h2>
                    <p>Why does the CONVERT function&nbsp; inaccurately converting between metric mass and US weight incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the CONVERT function from "lbm" to "kg" the function returns the following value:</p>
<p>0.453592309748811&nbsp;&nbsp; (0.453 592 309 748 811)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, according to United States Code, Title 15, Chapter 6, Subchapter I, § 205. Authorized tables:</p>
<p>1 pound (avoirdupois)=0.453 592 37 kilogram (exactly)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not mean much but it does present some issues when performing large batch formulation conversions.</p>

<h2>            additional accepted maildomains in o365 hybrid with ex2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are now in a hybrid scenario with our on-premise exchange 2013 and office365 tenant. we successfully got mailflow working through EOP within our maildomain. so far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however we have some additional accepted maildomains on our on-premise exchange (set as internal-relay) which we like to switch from coming in to us through our on-premise exchange 2013 directly, but instead coming through EOP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>its not clear to me, how to handle that? it's clearly not enough, to simply add and verify the other domains within our O365 Tenant and switching the mx to O365. but how do we have to do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>like ever - appreciate any help or suggestion!</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

            Hi Joerg,<br />
<br />
If you want to add multiple domains to Office 365 in hybrid environment, you need to verify them in cloud and re-run the HCW. Here is a reference about the steps:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn249970.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange Queue &amp; A: Handling hybrid environments</a><br />
<br />
If I misunderstand anything, please feel free to correct me and provide more detailed information.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Erick<br />

            <p>Hey Erick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply and the link to the Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did verify the additional domains and they're all good under "domains". After that i rerun the HCW which listed the domains and prompted me to verify them again via txt files in DNS. i did that too and the HCW ended with an error concerning Oauth (which
 shouldnt be any problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the HCW i checked O365 and found the following...</p>
<p>1. the additional domains we're listed as "accepted domains" als "authorative"</p>
<p>2. under "connectors" the "outbound to..." connector to our on-premise exchange 2013 was updated to accept mails to the additional domains</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i check the outbound connector with a mailadress of our primary maildomain or one of the recently added domains, the test are successfull. funny thing is - no testmail lands in the mailbox. not even the one sent to our primary maildomain! that did happen
 correctly before adding the domains in O365/running the HCW again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i send a mail from externally to an adress in our primary maildomain it is successfully received (despite the lost mails by the outbound connector check)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i'm guessing the mails are getting stuck or lost somewhere inbetween O365 and our on-premise EX2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried changing the accepted domains as internal-relay in O365 - just the way they are configured on-premise but it won't help either...</p>
<p>

<p><span>Thanks so much for your feedback. Can you run message trace in Office 365 to check if the message hit the Office 365 EOP and its inbound connector? You can share the full results via PM so that
 we can check it either. </span></p>

            <p>Hello Ran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry i was out of office yesterday so i wasn't able to perform a new test earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just send an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** which i then checked within O365 message trace (searched for mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - domain2.com is as an additional mail adress in the users box) and the mail is listed as "delivered".</p>
<p>the mail has been send to "mail.domain1.com at &lt;external ip of our on-premise ex2013&gt;". but the mail does not appear in the box's inbox. not in outlook and not when i check owa. the mail is also not listed in any of the on-premise mailqueues.</p>
<p>when i look for other mails sent to this mailbox there is not also a "send" event but a "received" event as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>so my guess is that the mail is somewhere "lost" on its way from O365s EOP to our on-premise exchange 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way to copy the results of the message trace gui in O365 to pm you? or should i take a screenshot?<br />

            Hi Joerg,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information in the private message.<br />
<br />
I have read all posts and understand that your mailboxes with additional domains cannot receive emails. If I misunderstand anything, please feel free to correct me.<br />
<br />
Based on your screenshots, the issue may be related to the mail flow (connectors) between cloud and on-premise as you mentioned. To further narrow down the issue, I’d like to collect some information:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are all mailboxes in cloud or on-premise?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can’t mailboxes with additional domains receive emails from external or internal users? If the issue related to internal users, have you tried sending emails from external users?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do any senders get the non-delivery reports? If so, please send it by the private message. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access to your Private Message：<br />

4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meantime, I want to check the configurations of the connections. Can you run the following PowerShell and upload results?<br />
<br />

Get-SendConnector | fl<br />

            Hi Joerg,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your PowerShell results in the private message.<br />
<br />
I have checked all results and it looks good. Meantime, since you cannot receive emails from internal users, the issue may be related to the on-premise mail flow. Therefore, the EOP may not delivery emails to on-premise as well.
<br />
<br />
<br />
May I confirm which domains are the primary domain and additional domains?<br />
<br />
For the internal emails, generally, they should not be routed by EOP. Did you configure some internal DNS records? How did you set up all emails routing through EOP? Can you provide more detailed information about the environment?
<br />
<br />
If there are any private information, you can send them by PM.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Erick<br />

Thanks for your explanation.<br />
<br />
Based on your information, I have further checked all connectors. I found that the on-premise send-connector of the hybrid (onmicrosoft.com) was false. You cloud change anything before. Please try enabling it in EAC to check whether there are any improvements.<br />

<p>The next public release is scheduled for September. If you install Insider builds, you will soon be upgraded to the next public release, at which time you could exit the program on that device. One of the Insider builds will become the next public release
 once it passes testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as advised already, these Insider builds are not meant for daily use, as they may place your data at risk of loss, or may require you to fully reinstall Windows 10. I run them as an optional Windows OS and boot to them separately for testing. This
 leaves my stable public build for day-to-day use.</p>

<p>If you have upgraded to the Insider build 16251 already, you can either choose to
<em>Go back to the previous version </em>that you had, or keep upgrading Insider builds until September, when one will become the next stable release. Yes, it is possible for there to be problems with Insider builds. Some choose to take the risk and then complain
 if anything goes wrong that prevents them from using their computer, or if they lose data that is not backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to return to the previous version, first use the Settings App page for Insiders to stop Insider builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you then use SHIFT-Restart to restart your PC (hold the SHIFT key while clicking on Restart) you will get a boot menu, which includes a sub-menu with the option to Go back to the previous version.</p>

<h2>            Vertical taskbar search problem build 9926</h2>
                    Upgraded from Windows 8.1 x64 enterprise to Windows 10 build 9926. Using vertical taskbar, if you click Start,&nbsp;typing does not work&nbsp;- you can't search. Could reproduce it on a virtual machine. For now I'm using horizontal taskbar. Maybe there is another
 workaround that could make vertical taskbar usable? I love using start button and typing right away for what I need.

<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern with Windows 10 search, don't worry we will try to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is due to the fact that when the taskbar is in vertical mode the search bar is not expanded, that's why you are not able to search, but if you click on the cortana icon, you will be bale to search. In the horizontal mode the search bar is expanded
 being the reason search is available directly.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, I’m hoping I can get some input on this issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We have just completed rolling out Exchange 2007 in our organization.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also have numerous users now using Active Sync (Windows Mobile 6.0) to sync with the Exchange server using direct push.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Everything is configured and working; however, some comments from users is that email is showing up in the PDA inbox and showing up in Outlook 2007’s Junk Email folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It seems that email is being pushed out prior to tagging as junk.</p>
<p>Has anyone else ran into this or found a way to eliminate the junk mail from syncing to the PDA?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restoring (or reformatting) your player's software to its original factory settings is a last resort for fixing a problem with your player.</p>
<p>Here is the link to help you perfom a hard reset on Zune device :</p>

<h2>            Can I run Office 97 in Windows 7 &#63;</h2>
                    Just bought new PC and new laptop, both with Windows 7.&nbsp; Only have Office 97.&nbsp; Tried to load it and all seemed well (no warning messages, no suggestion of incompatibility).&nbsp; No sign of it having been loaded anywhere.&nbsp; Is it simply NOT compatible ?

            Office 97 was release 12 years ago, subsequent releases such as Office 2000, 2002 have known compatibility issues under Windows 7, I am surprised about Office 97. Also, Microsoft does provide updates anymore for it and that could pose a risk. So I would
 suggest moving to a more recent release of the suite such as Office 2003 or 2007. You could try running the suite in compatibility mode to see if it corrects the problem you are now experiencing. Insert the Office 97 disk, open Computer, open the Office 97
 disk, right click the setup icon and click Troubleshoot compatibility, follow the on screen wizard and select an appropriate version of Windows the suite is known to work in.

<h2>            Syncing outlook contacts to android phone</h2>
                    My primary email account is an imap account so I set up a separate outlook.com account for my calendar and contacts.&nbsp; I have the outlook app on my phone, Samsung Galaxy S9+, and set up a Microsoft Exchange Server account to handle the sync with my PC.&nbsp;
 The calendar syncs.&nbsp; Contacts do not.&nbsp; When I check, it says both calendar and contacts synced but the contacts info is not updated.

<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.

<br />Open Outlook app, go to accounts, select your account and enable syncing contacts. Afterwards contacts should sync

    <title>Document text is replaced by strange error message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david newmarch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Document text is replaced by strange error message</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a very strange difficulty with one particular file in MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I "Save As" to a new filename, or to a different file format (e.g. changing from .docx to .doc or .rtf), all of the document text in the new file disappears and is replaced with a single new line of text that says, "This page uses frames, but your browser
 doesn't support them" (regardless of whether any browser is open on my computer).
<br />
<br />
However an <em>additional </em>copy of the file is also made which ignores my filename and just names the file as 2.doc of 2.rtf etc., but retains the text. This oddly created additional file opens by default in Web Layout, which is also unusual.<br />
<br />
Could the problem be that I inherited the original file (from which I then extracted this particular document) as an .odt file?<br />
<br />
I did a repair of Word 2010, but the phenomenon still recurs, and my real problem is that I need to send this document to someone else and I can't let it continue to malfunction in this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I Just Got My NOKIA LUMIA 520 And Been Using It For 4-5 Days. I Guess It Is The Newest In Lumia Series And Asssumed That The Storage Issue Was Taken Care Of In The Newest Phone In The Series. But The Issus Still Persist. It Gets More And More Filled Day
 By Day As We Install New Apps,Photos,Videos,Etc. I Also Checked The Firmware Update And Phone Update, But I Was Not Able To Find Firmware Update And Phone Update Is Upto The Date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lumia's Feel&nbsp; Is Great, Very Nice Phone And Proud Owner....But You Need Take Care Of This Immidiately As Many Of Us Are Left With No Place In Our Phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also There Is Some Issue With The Music Player. One Cannot Stop The Track But Can Only Pause It. The Player Visible Even If I Lock Screen, After Pausing The Track If You Adjust The Volume On Lock Screen, You Can Still See The Music Player</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, All Lumia 520 Users Are Desperately Waiting For A Solution Immidiately</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have the Storage check app in Settings you can use that to free up some space by deleting temporary files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't want the music player to appear in the volume controls then you can download a music stopping app from the store. Just do a search for "stop the music" and pick one from the many that are available.</p>

<p>my lumia 520 is showing 2.2 GB occupied by Others. What is this others location? How to access and remove unwanted files? This is a serious bug. Storage check is not a solution as it just shows, but doesn't redirect to that location, to see what is there?<br />
It shows storage info of following components:</p>
<p>1. Apps</p>
<p>2. Maps</p>
<p>3. Temp files</p>
<p>4. Photos</p>
<p>5. Music/Videos</p>
<p>6.Office docs</p>
<p>7. Email + contacts</p>
<p>8. Ringtones</p>
<p>9. System</p>
<p>10. Others</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is this Others which is occupying largest section of memory? Any solution?</p>

<p>The 'Other' folder is needed for temporary files. You can minimize it using the Storage Check utility but you can't delete it.800MB for 'Other' is not a lot. The guy below you is suffering with 2.2GB. Unfortunately the more you use your phone the more 'Other'
 increases but you can hard reset your phone to factory state when your phone is unable to download any more apps.</p>

<p>Really not happy at all with Lumia 520. Have installed three apps and phone memory is full, all my saved files are on sd card have tried all other suggestions on this page and can only free upp 150mb (**bleep**). There is no way of migrating or downloading&nbsp;
 other apps to SD card. Not really a "smart phone" more a "**bleep** phone"</p>
<p>Something needs to be done quick or its going back</p>

<p>Yup, this is takin the pi$$!</p>
<p>Like the guy above, I've all my files on SD. Now my phone memory&nbsp;says I've 4.5G occupied by "others" and keeps flashing up warnings telling me my memory is full :(</p>
<p>Overall I'm Pleased with the 520 but I'm sure that the full memory is responsible for my phone rebooting when it shouldn't.</p>
<p>Come on, sort it out!!!!!</p>

<p>Depending on wha apps you use the ' Other ' Storage space may get bigger than usual, especially apps like youtube downloaders and other apps which download items to their own space. Also mail attachements are in here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue where some temporary or no longer needed items are not removed when space is needed is resolved in the coming GDR2 update accoridng to MSFT.</p>

            <p>Outlook has nothing to do with this, the message is coming from your email provider's sending server saying that the command has been aborted due to a server error on the other side.&nbsp; The actual error definition is "Requested action aborted: local error
 in processing".&nbsp; This is something your email service provider will have to deal with, their sending server has a problem.</p>

<h2>            Why is the video quality poor when I upload a video from my windows phone to OneDrive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some background information: I recorded a 6 minute video on my windows phone and emailed it to myself. I am unable to connect my phone to the computer using my charger for various reasons. When I downloaded the video onto my computer (windows 7) from
 my email, the resolution was poor. When I uploaded it to OneDrive, the quality was also poor, plus I got an error when I tried to save it to OneDrive (it just said "an error occurred") but the video still showed up on OneDrive, just poor quality. Out of curiosity,
 I uploaded it to Youtube by email and it also showed up with a low resolution there. How can I fix this? Does emailing the video automatically reduce its resolution?</p>

</p><p>I guess you have to try a USB cable to connect the phone to your PC and sync the video. If the resolution is still poor it might be the video itself.</p>

<h2>            MP4 f&#38; MP3 files will not play in IE11 using Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a number of mp4 and mp3 files uploaded to our externally hosted LMS. When trying to run these files via IE11, the browser forces Windows Media Player to open. I then get the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried adding to Trust Sites, Compatibility view, etc and this has had no effect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of IE we are using is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I should add that if I move the file to a local server and run via the browser it works fine. We also have other users running a slightly different version of IE11 as shown below and this works successfully also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciate.</p>
<p>

<p>Donald, thank you for your reply.&nbsp;I believe I mistakenly generalized the word, "Everything."&nbsp; Let me correct that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have gone on several blogs/forums and went through the steps suggested (which are too numerous to mention).&nbsp;&nbsp;I was hoping that there were
 more options out there to try.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would recognize what I have tried already, more then&nbsp;listing everything I have tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get around on the computer pretty good, but am not a Geek&nbsp;and do not understand&nbsp;a lot of the terminology to explore myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it is quite a quest to ask for help, when&nbsp;no one&nbsp;knows what it is that I have done already, but with all you computer savoy people out there, I was hoping to get a large response, and then start&nbsp;the elimination process.</p>
<p>If you can think of something, please respond, and Thank you for your time.</p>

    <title>Shared Excel file disappearing and being replaced with temp file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg dee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared Excel file disappearing and being replaced with temp file</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Environment: Server 2008 R2 with AD<br />
Clients: Windows 7 with Office 2007 with SP3 &amp; latest patches</p>
<p><br />
We have a few shared Excel files, on our network that are being shared with 4 - 6 people. On a regular basis, the original excel sheet disappears and only a .tmp remains like 7C14F654.tmp. When trying to save, users get an error message: Cannot save file, file
 missing.<br />
When renaming that TMP file back to what the excel file was, then users can safe the file again.
</p>
<p>We tried to replicate the problem but it occurs randomly. It happens at least once a day for various files, all being Excel 2007 shared files.
</p>
<p>All the users have proper permissions to their folder (Read/write) and we know no one is manually deleting the files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone posted already posted the same issue <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/problem-with-shared-excel-file-disappearing-and/c2b24b7b-d3c3-49b2-99f2-393b0737cdc0">
here</a> but is has gone unanswered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone out there provide an explanation as to why this happens and how it can be avoided going forward?</p>
<p><br />
To add the answers to question asked by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/468313dd-27ac-4828-a9e8-74b6e223cb2f" title="Mukherjee Ashutosh">
Mukherjee Ashutosh</a> in the mentioned post above:<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>Is this issue specific only to excel files shared on the share drive?<br />
Yes, this only happens to Excel files.</p>
<p><br />
Try sharing other Office files and check if the same issue occurs, also try share a non Office document and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>Shared other non Office documents and files did not disappear. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note if the file is open on any of user machine while the issue occurs.</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, the file is open and being used by 4 - 6 users at the same time. When one notices the error, we get notified, we rename the .tmp file to the original .xlsx file and users can save again.

            <p>If this was a single-user use of a file&nbsp;I would check whether there was a virus checker running on the server.&nbsp; (Normally when Excel saves a file it writes it to a temporary file, then deletes the original file and renames the temporary file.&nbsp; Sometimes
 a virus checker can start checking the temporary file and get in the way of the delete/rename.)&nbsp; If you can disable its check on XLS files it might deal with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if this is an Excel shared file (which I generally avoid using because of bugs in earlier versions), I am not sure the same advice holds.&nbsp; Worth a try though.</p>

<p>We are looking into excluding TMP files from being checked.</p>
<p>We are using Trend Micro at the moment, but for this case, we are trying Webroot, see if this helps the problem.

            <p>Just as a feedback for others who might have the same problems:</p>
<p>Since we switched to Webroot as an Anti-Virus, this problem has disappeared. No exclusions on files scanned and checked, just the product itself.</p>
<p>Other AVs might work too. </p>

<h2>            WM 6 pro user on HTC Touch - how do I watch movies on mobile media player&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a few movies on my micro SD card and wanted to watch them on Windows media player but it says it cannot play the selected file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the movies are in AVI format, is there a way or add-in that can support this file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>The TCPMP Core program plays the file but it is very slow - the sound comes out fine but the picture comes out in slow frames and makes watching difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know of another program?</p>
