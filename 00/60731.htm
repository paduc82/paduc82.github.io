    <title>Child account validation from the UK - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Child account validation from the UK</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this all started because on Minecraft PE, we can now log in&nbsp;with a Microsoft account. I do Minecraft with my daughter (age 9) so...</p>
<ol>
<li>I set up an account for both of us. My account is fine, I can log in and&nbsp;I've set up a payment method.</li><li>I have added my daughters account as a child family member; this triggered an email to my daughters email address</li><li>Responding to the email to my daughter I try accepting the invitation</li><li>But because my daughter is 9 her account needs validating by an adult (me) I an asked to log on.</li><li>So, I log on and I am asked to pay 50 cents; that's fine...
<ul>
<li>Verify that you're an adult&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Microsoft collects parental consent and verifies it by charging a one-time fee of $0.50 (50 cents) to the parent's
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>US-based credit card</strong></span>. The fee is donated to charity—it doesn't let your child make purchases on that card.</li></ul>
</li><li>This is where I am stuck --- I do not have a US-based credit card, I have a UK-based credit card&nbsp;:-(</li></ol>
<p>So, I am&nbsp;basically stuck at validating my daughters account and proving that I really am an adult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All very frustrating... I'm trying to play by the rules and set up my daughters account accurately and I end up going round in circles and although my account has a payment method, the system chooses not to use it and insists on a&nbsp;US-based credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or helpful comments?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: No comments about the E.U.&nbsp;and Brexit please, I'm sure that's not to blame here; LOL &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>PPS: None of the Categories seem applicable so apologies if this is in totally the wrong place.... How about a category for "Accounts&nbsp;Issues". Eventually I tried MSN, and found some relevant topic.</p>

            <p>Same here - I was trying to set up a Minecraft Realm for my son, and the only way I could find to invite him was for him to get a gamertag (either that or facebook account or a mobile!). He registered but because of his age he can't invite anyone because
 his name sharing settings need to be changed. To change the settings a parent needs to sign in. Once a parent signs in they need a US credit card to verify...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 50 cents isn't the issue, it's wasting our time because we're not from the US! A complete shambles. I've cancelled the Realm subscription.</p>

            <p>How can I put this, without putting forward a suggestion you need to lie...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble is; when a half-baked solution is put in place, albeit for good reasons, but which is so insular and US facing, it becomes unworkable and impossible for the rest of the world to use, it becomes useless and worthless. When dealing with organisations
 and people who make life difficult, but do not listen or offer a workable or alternative solution you are not left with much to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirteen is the minimum age with which you do not need to go through this impossible task of being a responsible parent; playing by Microsoft rules anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look to your usage and reasons for wanting your child to have a Microsoft account and the risks they may face..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; will you be with them when they use it?... </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how far off thirteen are they?... </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how far do your morals bend?...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then do the math!</p>

            <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive sorted it out now! Thought i would post on here how incase anyone else has the same problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I used my account went through the contact us and help to get into a online chat with a advisor. Explained im a UK resident. They advised i could send proof via fax which i dont have access to. They then gave me a link to contact support via email
 so they could escalate the case to a higher up support used the reference number i got in my chat as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 Days later got a email from support everything is sorted they changed the account from US to UK an now no more problems no age verification!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's what I figured out to do, which fixed this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go into your (i.e. the parents) MS account and add a credit card detail into the accounts and billing section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Then change your location to USA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Your and your child's accounts are now both set to USA</p>
<p>4. Now validate your child's account, but enter the same credit card details as the one you have added to your account. You will need to put in a fake USA mail and phone address, though, I just used a hotel in Times Square, NY with correct zip and phone
 code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. This should now work and your child's account should be verified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. If you think you need to, then change back your child's and your account to UK, in that order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent hours on Christmas Day morning trying to figure this out. Basically there seems to be a glitch in that any account created on Windows 10 defaults to USA, even when you enter a completely different country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, above worked for me and should also work for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, it would be so simple for Microsoft to fix this problem - so much for "customer care".&nbsp; They could easily provide localized settings for customers outside of the USA.&nbsp; It's very disappointing that they just haven't bothered to fix this issue which
 has been going on for several months :(</p>

            <p>There are some exceptions, but almost all programs that ran under Windows 7 will also run under Windows 10. The major exceptions are some utilities and some games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that regardless of the version or versions of Windows, a 32-bit program can run under 64-bit Windows. However the reverse is not true--a 64-bit program can not run on 32-bit programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that that last sentence does *not* say that a program that was running on 64-bit Windows can not run on 32-bit Windows. If it was a 64-bit program running on 64-bit Windows it can not run on 32-bit Windows, but if it was a 32-bit program running on
 64-bit Windows, it *can* run on 32-bit Windows.</p>

<p>To stop the computer from automatically restarting, right-click Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Advanced Tab then click Settings at the bottom alongside Startup and Recovery. In System Failure remove the tick from ‘Auto Restart’. Note
 that s<span>ome systems have ‘Disable automatic restart on system failure’ as an option on the Safe Mode (F8) menu.

<p>1. When you receive a BCC (Bug Check Code or informally, a BSOD) error, the STOP error details are displayed on the screen. Make a note of the hexadecimal error number (the format is 0x00000aaa, where aaa is the error code, e.g. 07B). Also, there will be
 an error name, like INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE and the message may point to a specific file. After noting the error, you will have to manually turn off the computer, i.e. press and hold in the power button, wait 10 seconds then restart. Look for an explanation
 of your error number as shown here <a href="http://www.aumha.org/a/stop.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.aumha.org/a/stop.php</a></p>
<p>2. Alternatively, try the free WhoCrashed program, which may reveal the reason for the crash. Obviously, you can only run this if you can boot the computer. Download it from here
<a href="http://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed</a> and install it. To run it, click Analyze then scroll down to see the error(s). When it is first run, it will download the Windows Debugging package, which is perfectly
 normal. All minidumps found on the system will be listed.</p>

<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issues you are going through. We recommend to reboot your network hardware. Also on the Xbox go to system page by hitting guide button then go to right icon. Once there go down to restart console, make sure to restart through this as it clears
 a few extra things. If you are still unable to connect you can contact your ISP to assist you further with hiding your IP or even getting a private one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>You can try clearing cache as well. Press the Xbox logo on the cosnole until it reboots. Then i would run some of the network tests from the console.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>For these types of attacks you'll need to call Virgin Media. They can investigate the attack and get you back online again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't sit around and wait for it to start working again. These attacks are illegal. Hopefully this person is going to find themselves in more trouble than just an Xbox Live ban.</p>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try unplugging your console from its power source along with the router and modem for at least 5 minutes. Once the time has passed plug the router/modem back in first and allow them to boot up to their normal view with the lights flashing or solid the way
 they're supposed to be. When you do this it will reset your IP address for the router so the only way they could continue to do it would be if you were to party up with them again. Check out this helpful link also for more details:

<h2>            Can&#39;t unsync onedrive without it deleting all my files from my laptop</h2>
                    I don't know how this happened, but I turn on my computer today and everything was syncing to my onedrive. Obviously this maxed out the space and now there isn't room for the select files I want stored on the cloud.<br />
<br />
I tried changing the autosave settings (right click on onedrive --&gt; settings --&gt; autosave --&gt; changed desktop, documents and pictures to 'This PC Only') but then it deletes everything from my laptop and its only available on onedrive?<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me how to get everything back onto my hard drive and just have the few files I want on onedrive? I dont want these two synced in any way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(this is only in the Windows 10 category because it says the Onedrive forum has been locked, and I don't know wtf that means)

<h2>            System Restore is no longer available.</h2>
                    <p><strong>hello,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>i was wondering if anyone could please help me with an issue im having with system restore, every single time i access system restore i will try to delete the most recent one to create a new system restore file but it will not let me delete the previous
 system restore points or create a system restore point as well. another thing is that the system restore will show me that it has disk space usage with memory on it&nbsp; "___MB", and the disk space usage will continue to keep growing and it will not let me delete
 the previous system restore points, and when i check the system restore points it shows me that there is no system restore points existant within my system. therefore i cant restore to previous system restore points as well.<br />
<br />
if anyone could please help me with this problem i would really appreciate it, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
</strong><strong>here is a video i recorded of me and the problem i am having with System Restore:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://sendvid.com/8allwki2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="External link">
https://sendvid.com/8allwki2</a></p>
<strong>and unfortunately my System Restore still isnt working after i completed a system refresh...is there a way for me to reinstall it somehow?<br />
<br />
i know i need a sr.inf file for that, but for some reason i dont have it. and my windows 8 did not come with the Windows 8 Installation Disc for me to find the files for System Restore Reinstallation?<br />
<br />
</strong><strong>if anyone could please help me with this problem i would really appreciate it, thank you very much.</strong>

            <p>The problem may be that you have too small of an amount of the disk apportioned to System Restore to save any Restore points or manage them.&nbsp; Move the slider up to 5-10% and then try again.&nbsp; You want as much space as you can afford to have it create and
 keep enough Restore points that it acts as an effection first line of defense if you need to recover your System.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then save a System Image backup to use in place of reinstalls if System Restore isn't enough to repair WIndows.&nbsp;

<a href="https://sendvid.com/8allwki2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendvid.com/8allwki2</a></p>

<br />
also i did the <strong><span>sfc /scannow </span></strong><span>and</span></p>

if so i was wondering if someone could please help me with this part?</p>

<br />
1.&nbsp; Export the SR Service section of your registry and send it here for analysis<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; I can export the SR Service part of my registry and send it to you for installation on your system. &nbsp; I have instructions for that (the SR Service is not very exciting to look at)<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; You can totally reinstall System Restore (you don't have to reinstall XP - just the SR part)<br />
a.&nbsp; I have instructions for that and you do not need an XP installation CD<br />
b.&nbsp; If you reinstall SR, you will lose all your current Restore Points<br />
c.&nbsp; If SR doesn't work anyway, who cares about number b</p>

    <title>FFA needs to lose 2&#47;3 players - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            FFA needs to lose 2&#47;3 players</h2>
                    
<p>Title.</p>
<p>The MCC had this problem, and so did Reach and Halo 3 at launch before Bungie learned; 8 player FFA just does not work on 99% of maps. Sure, its fun to mess around in a Custom Game with 8 players or more in FFA, but for competitive FFA there should be no
 more than 6 players, especially on smaller Arena maps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have 7/8 players jammed into a small/medium Arena/Guardian style map, you basically take all of the skill out of the equation and instead turn it into a **** and game of chance based on spawns, how lucky you get with cleanup kills and how
 many spawnkills you can get. With 7/8 people you can rarely if ever get a clean fight, you basically cannot get your shields back unless they didn't hit you at all and you can rarely take cover or get away from all the grenades.</p>
<p>MCC had this issue too, where FFA jammed 8 players into maps meant for 5-6, and or teams. 8 player FFA can work and be enjoyable, but only if its on the proper maps - maps like Terminal, Longshore, Perdition, Hang'em High etc.</p>

<p>Jamming 8 people into a FFA on Rig just doesn't work.</p>

<p>FFA is fine as it is. I'm sorry but less people will mean less fun. Part of the fun is the choas. As for shields not recharging in time everyones in the same boat and maybe just change your play style a bit you will last longer.</p>
<p>A better solution would be to add more playlists to cater for everyones tastes</p>

<p>No its not. There is absolutely zero skill involved in the playlist right now; it is 100% luck and chance and spawning. There is no one who could reasonably argue that isn't the case without a massive amount of denial. Something like 80% of the kills and
 deaths in FFA right now are just people getting spawn killed or spawning in and cleaning up.</p>

<p>I have to agree on FFA. &nbsp;Here is my issues based on what happened to me;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Swat. &nbsp;I was 9-0 and died, so 9-1. &nbsp;Spawned 7 straight times into death before I could even more. &nbsp;A few other matches this happened a few times but not much. &nbsp;Really throws the match off.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;In the team arena playlist (thinking that is what it is called) I had matches of different types where I would spawn and die instantly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In FFA it is just to many players. &nbsp;Spawning luck is part of it. &nbsp;If you spawn close to the action you can pick off a few very quickly. &nbsp;Or if they spawn right in front of you. &nbsp;And the spawn kills and spawning and cleaning up is a big portion of the games
 I played so far. &nbsp;Of course a few matches I played did not even register for some reason on FFA with the game attempting to load the stats at the end and eventually just going back to the menu. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a huge deal to me though. &nbsp;I am not a FFA player for the most part. &nbsp;Just occasionally really.</p>

            hi Dylan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this recent?  It may be the same issue as here:  <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/78558-windows-10-issue-blocking-users-updating-or-downloading.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techspot.com/news/78558-windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br /> 
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>[quote user="LiL Lo5o"]Do you think this is the worst Halo ever?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely.&nbsp; I purchased 4 copies so that me and my family can play together.&nbsp; This game is awful for mp.&nbsp; I play on my business connection by myself.&nbsp; They play on our home connection.&nbsp; Truthfully:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If all 3 are playing on that connection then they are awesome.&nbsp; My oldest son plays like he is a God among men.&nbsp; His tactic:&nbsp; Run in with the assault, spray bullets, and the occasional melee.&nbsp; His kills are crap, he admits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Getting kills without even remotely hitting the other player.&nbsp; I have pistol headshots while shooting well over the other players head.&nbsp; One such match my son was battling with another player and he was on the ground and I was on a building on Complex.&nbsp;
 I shot out above the other player, at least in this players general direction and it said: "Game Over" giving me a headshot.&nbsp; The other player was a friend of my sons and he asked me if his replay was right.&nbsp; Yep, I shot over his head by a mile and the game
 decided I should get the kill</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Noticed this happening&nbsp;a lot recently.&nbsp; Players just spraying bullets.&nbsp; No aiming at all.&nbsp; And getting kills.&nbsp; I did it in the last match I just played.&nbsp; I picked up a players assault rifle and was able to get a kill and yes, I just sprayed some bullets
 and they where actually hitting the wall.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The other night I was playing and I received ordinance.&nbsp; Picked the saw.&nbsp; I grabbed it and before I moved a player ran past me up the ramp.&nbsp; I unloaded on the players back and he shot the wall in front of him (replay confirmed).&nbsp; He died and a plasma
 grenade literally flew out his @$$.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have pulled off so much crap and seen so much crap on this game already I wonder what is going on.&nbsp; I get headshots that are not even remotely headshots, kills when the player has obviously left the line of site (I have learned to shoot anyway after watching
 a few replays), and deaths when I was obviously out of the line of site.&nbsp; I would blame it on the replay and other things but something is wrong when I can play matches with family and friends and the players on the other team can verify exactly what the replay
 shows.&nbsp; Fact is, if the other player cannot see me because I went around the corner, my game shows I am way around the corner, and my teammate can see I am way around the corner with him and wonders how I died I wonder were the game actually decided I was
 going to die.</p>

<p>Guerrero maybe you should ask the player that was shooting at a wall and hit you for the file and I'm pretty sure it will look different than the kill cam. &nbsp;He is just shooting at what his connection sees.</p>

<p>My favorite Halo since Halo 2. I doubt any Halo will top Halo:CE and Halo 2... just too much fun and nostalgia... and excellence. But yeah.... I'm enjoying Halo 4 multi-player a LOT. Way more than Reach, and quite a bit more than 3.

<p>Guerrero maybe you should ask the player that was shooting at a wall and hit you for the file and I'm pretty sure it will look different than the kill cam. &nbsp;He is just shooting at what his connection sees.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the thing.&nbsp; I know some of these players.&nbsp; They actually verified what&nbsp;I saw on kill cam with what they saw during gameplay.&nbsp; I played a few more tonight and when using the assault rifle and just spraying bullets I just had a match 17-4.&nbsp; I had a
 match at 18-1 as well.&nbsp; Used the light rifle and dmr in one match and was 15-13 while hitting the player in the head.&nbsp; Sure, I did not know these people so I could have been missing while it showing I was hitting but I did however change to a class with the
 assault rifle and that was how I went back to positive k/d.&nbsp; I am not complaining (sorry if it comes off that way)&nbsp;but something feels off about this.&nbsp; No loss as I will probably just finish the campaign and sell my copies.&nbsp; We purchased them with $25 gift
 cards that we used for things we where going to buy anyway and I should be able to recover most of my money.</p>

<p>Guerrero if you go 18-1 with the AR and 15-13 with DMR you obviously need so work with it lol. In the meantime can you make a video on how to go 18-1 with the AR. &nbsp;Looking at your recent games maybe you should stick to medal of honor or gears ;)</p>

<p>Halo 4 worst Halo ever? Not a chance. It's better than Halo 3: ODST and Halo: Reach for sure. I'm still not sure if it's better than Halo 2 and Halo 3 in the MP department but only time will tell. I'm also not overly impressed with the first batch of DLC...</p>

<h2>            Processor upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade the processor in my older Dell laptop from a 1.5 GHz Intel Celeron M 370 processor to an Intel Pentium M 760 2 GHz processor.&nbsp; I have found that the two processors have almost the same specs, but I can't find out if the motherboard
 supports the 760.&nbsp; However I have found out that the chipset in the laptop supports the 760 processor.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; If the processor is supported by the chipset, does that mean that the motherboard will support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The motherboard in the laptop is Dell 0GD366, and chipset is 915 GMS.&nbsp; I know this is an older laptop but it was given to me when it stopped working.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have gotten the OS reinstalled, which was corrupted by a virus, and installed a new HD that&nbsp;went south.&nbsp;
 It does all I need&nbsp;it to do.&nbsp; But I did want to upgrade from the 1.5 GHz processor to the 2 GHz.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>

</p><p>I understand, and have already replaced the HD with a new one I found online.&nbsp; Hard to find but I did finally find one.&nbsp; I know XP is discontinued that is why I use Chrome on the laptop.&nbsp; Windows 7 works fine on the laptop for what I wish to do with it,
 and since it was free, and I obtain[or buy cheaply broken computers to learn to work on them], that is what I am doing with the laptop.&nbsp; Worth the expense, no.&nbsp; Worth the experience--well worth it.&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>I understand, and have already replaced the HD with a new one I found online.&nbsp; Hard to find but I did finally find one.&nbsp; I know XP is discontinued that is why I use Chrome on the laptop.&nbsp; Windows 7 works fine on the laptop for what I wish to do with it,
 and since it was free, and I obtain[or buy cheaply broken computers to learn to work on them], that is what I am doing with the laptop.&nbsp; Worth the expense, no.&nbsp; Worth the experience--well worth it.&nbsp; Thanks for the reply.</p>

<p>Sure, the Inspiron 1300 was my first personal laptop and&nbsp;I done a lot of testing and playing around with my one, I learned a lot with it.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Lesa_Dale,<br />
<br />
</strong>Could you please answer these below questions?</p>
<p>1) How are you trying to create a system repair disc?<br />
2) Is it an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) computer?<br />
3) Are you trying to create a system repair disc with an OEM repair utility?<br />
4) Who is the manufacturer of the computer?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The System Recovery Options menu is on the Windows 7 installation disc. If your computer manufacturer (OEM) has preinstalled recovery options, the menu might also be installed on your hard disk as a recovery partition. If your computer
 does not include the System Recovery Options menu, your computer manufacturer (OEM) might have customized or replaced the tool. Check the information that came with your computer or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>

    <title>Unable to update to Windows 10 on a Crucial MX100 256 GB SSD drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to update to Windows 10 on a Crucial MX100 256 GB SSD drive</h2>
                    <p><span>Here is what I did :</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>Successfully updated my Acer Aspire One Netbook using a Seagate Hardrive from Win 7 to Win 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then I cloned the HD to the Crucial SSD. Win 10 booted up but was unusable, kind of stuck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Therefore I cloned Win 7 HD to my&nbsp;Crucial SSD to perform the Win 10 update&nbsp;via download.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I applied the precautions per :</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/failed-windows-10-install-c1900101-4000d-error/32ad03ee-a218-4317-801b-300c582d96f4?auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/failed-windows-10-install-c1900101-4000d-error/32ad03ee-a218-4317-801b-300c582d96f4?auth=1</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update also failed, i.e. is stuck at about 80 % as here :&nbsp;</span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/the-windows-10-upgrade-appears-to-hang/a3359013-80a7-4a25-a75d-1c828e576c40&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After aborting, rolling back and rebooting into Win 7 seeing C1900101-4000D on the update window.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, a Win 10 update via USB stick failed with same error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So it must related the (Crucial) SSD drive, wondering if there is a specific Win 10 SSD driver not available yet, noticed that after having cloned Win 7 from HD to SSD (or vice versa) after the first boot up a reboot is required because a drive specific
 driver got installed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody out there who knows how to solve this Win 10&nbsp;Crucial MX100 256 GB SSD drive issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[STATUS UPDATE] : Samsung SSD 850 EVO is working just fine now on my&nbsp;Acer Aspire One Netbook</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;Crucial MX100 SSD is working fine on an Asus G53 I upgraded to Win 10 &nbsp;one week later (last weekend), maybe I caught a MS Win 10 patch in the process of upgrading ? I haven't checked&nbsp;Crucial MX100 SSD and&nbsp;Acer Aspire One Netbook combo yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[REMARK] BlueRay Player SW CyberDVD Version 15 isn't working properly on my Asus, movie is in SloMo mode, only sound is ok. The CyberDVD Release 9 which originally came with my Asus isn't working at all but "craving" for an update.</p>

<h2>            Graphics issues after upgrade to Windows 10&#58; SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION sgfxk64.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 days ago I upgraded to Windows 10 my HP ProBook 450 G0.</p>
<p>After I realized my graphic drivers are not working properly I tried to update them to the lastest listed at drivers download section for my model.</p>
<p>After this I had BSODs and couldn't even see login screen. I removed installed update in safe mode.</p>
<p>So right now I'm using some default driver I guess.</p>
<p>In the devices manager on Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 I have something like (manual translation) "Windows has stopped this device because of raported troubles. (Code 43)".</p>
<p>I cannot use HDMI &amp; internal display. To use HDMI I need to restart my PC. After using HDMI I cannot use internal display. A lot of issues, because of this driver...</p>
<p>I really need this, as I'm teacher and I', using both internal display &amp; HDMI for presentations...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any solutions? Any logs I can get to help you help me <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpsg.i.lithium.com%2fi%2fsmilies%2f16x16_smiley-happy.gif" />?</p>

<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span><span><span>You&nbsp;should try to perform a

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you cannot boot up using
 safe mode, chose safe mode with command prompt.&nbsp; Typed <strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> into the command prompt and a window will pop up.&nbsp; From there follow the instruction on performing a clean boot. To what
 you discribe sounds like a third party program is causing your problem. <br />
<strong><br />
<br />
Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />

<p>No matter how I set it , every time I start my system Screen defaults to 1 hour and Sleep defaults to 2 hours.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried both methods that you have referred to in your response.</p>
<p>I set screen to never and set sleep to never and restarted after each attempt .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checked settings and they defaulted to screen 1 hour and sleep 2 hours again .</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, except that the display changes to power off in less than 1 minute.&nbsp; I have changed it back to 2 hours on numerous occasions and again today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should a setting change to less than 1 minute, if I don't set it?</p>

<h2>            How to make a complaint</h2>
                    <p>Hi Gary Richards from Whale City Butchery, 72 Islander Road.
</p>
<p>I would like to make a complaint, Microsoft Have Wasted nearly 3 weeks of my time whilst I have had important files to access. They have also made a large loss of time and also a major loss in my financial side of things. I have had multiple
 technicians here a numerous amount of times, all of them have told me Microsoft released a patch and it’s meant to fix our system which has definitely not would anyone know how i can be reimbursed with the loss of money we spent on technicians and other people
 we have had trying to resolve Microsoft`s issues they have caused!</p>

<p>We don't work for Microsoft.</p>
<p>We are mainly volunteers here, who give other users free advice in our own free time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to make a complaint:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to do this is to contact your Local Microsoft Office by phone or letter with all the details.</p>

<p>
</p><p>And a lot of the Support links&nbsp;are not&nbsp;for what you want, as they go to outsourced Support Contractors who can provide no assistance for your problem; namely a complaint to Microsoft.</p>
