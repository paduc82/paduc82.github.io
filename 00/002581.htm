            <p>Hello syedyousha:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having connecting to the marketplace.&nbsp; We understand the desire to have access to all the features the Windows phone offers and hope to help clear this up for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen several reports of this lately with Iranian customers.&nbsp; What looks to be happening is that the marketplace access is not available in your region.&nbsp; As you will see in the following document, Iran is not a supported country for marketplace access,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability</a>.&nbsp; I have also noticed that Iran is not supported for the Windows 8 phone, which has a wider variety of supported countries,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/how-to/wp8/basics/feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/how-to/wp8/basics/feature-and-service-availability</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you had access to the marketplace in the past then something has likely changed on the side of your Xbox account used on the phone.&nbsp; Otherwise, there was something happening in the past that was allowing access to the marketplace that should not have
 been allowed.&nbsp; We do apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you.&nbsp; I am including a few basic troubleshooting steps below, just in case this can be corrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Soft reset the phone.&nbsp; Go to settings &gt; applications &gt; Internet Explorer &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once the chache is cleared p<font color="#000000">ress and hold the volume keys, power button and camera together for 3-5 seconds.</font><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li>Manually set the time and date on your phone.&nbsp; Go to settings &gt; date + time &gt; turn off automatic setting &gt; set the time, date and time zone manually.</li><li>To ensure this is not related to just the account on your phone you can consider resetting the phone with a different account.&nbsp; The first step in this process would be to create a new account at
<a href="http://accounts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and then a Xbox account with that email at
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a>.&nbsp; Once you have done this you would need to reset the phone.&nbsp;
<p><font color="#000000">Keep in mind that this will set the phone back to it's factory settings.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Media can be backed up to your PC, http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Contacts and calendar events should be backed up to the cloud.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can verify this by going to http://contacts.live.com and http://calendars.live.com.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The information on your phone should be listed here.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Text message history and game progress will be reset.<span>&nbsp; </span>To reset the phone, tap settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</font></p>
</li></ul>
<p><font color="#000000">Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>DO NOKIA USE SAMSUNG PARTS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khel_wang  say:</h3>
<h2>            DO NOKIA USE SAMSUNG PARTS</h2>
                    I bought my nokia 6303i classic two years back from a nokia priority dealer at Mumbai. After 6 month my phone had a network problem for two days. And automatically fixed the problem itself. After that i was using this phone without any problem. Recently
 the same problem had started. I had dismantled all the parts and shocked to see that a chip attached on the motherbord was of Samsung. I was confused, do nokia use samsung parts for assembly of nokia phones or my phone is not original? But i have bought from
 a nokia priority dealer and the all the hollographic seals are opened in front of me... If anybody have any idea about this issue, pliz help...

<p>Just installed the latest MSE2 beta. Everything is working ok but it's consuming a lot of memory (compared to e.g. Avast5, which has much more features than MSE2), see the table. Is this something specific to just beta versions? Any plans to correct this?</p>

</p><p>Whatever whole numbers I subtract, gives me a strange answers which includes a decimal digit after few zeros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the below table I pasted from my excel table. The final answer Excess/Short is having a ghost decimal. I can give you hundreds of examples from my excel sheet.</p>

<p>This is a common problem due to the way that Excel stores numbers, namely 64-bit binary floating-point.&nbsp; Most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly.&nbsp; So anomalies arise with even simple binary arithmetic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The remedy is:&nbsp; whenever you expect a calculation to be accurate to n decimal places (2 or 3 in your case), explicitly round to that number of decimal places.&nbsp; (Not to an arbitrary number of decimal places, as some people suggest.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:&nbsp; =ROUND(C21-C22, 2) if C21 is 468.3 and C22 is 466.5.</p>

<p>Nothing strange here; it is a result of how Excel, and most numerical apps, store decimal numbers in binary.</p>
<p>Use a formula such as =ROUND(C20-C19,2) to avoid the problem</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Workflow does not work show terminated</h2>
                    <p>I have installed sharepoint designer 2013 in my computer. When I go to my sharepoint site list's setting "workflow setting" and try to "create a workflow in sharepoint designer" it redirected to "http://o15.officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidSPD2013Download?clid=undefined"
 and nothing happens. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I manually started sharepoint designer 2013 in desktop and created a following approval workflow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stage:Stage 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set Workflow Status to Pending<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set Variable: Approver to Approval Info:ManagerName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assign a task to Variable: Approver (Task outcome to Variable: Outcome | Task ID to Variable: TaskID )<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Variable: Outcome equals Approved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set Workflow Status to Approved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set Workflow Status to Rejected<br />
Transition to stage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to End of Workflow</p>
<p>
</p><p>This workflow is for list data entry when user will enter data into signup table it should mail an approval request to approval manager and after manager approval workflow status should be accepted. But when user trying to update list the workflow status
 shows terminated. &nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Imran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the "<strong>Return field as</strong>" in your side only shows As String rather than Login Name, I'd suggest you check if the
<strong>ManagerName</strong> column in <strong>Approval Info</strong> list is in <strong>
Person or Group </strong>type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since you also use the <strong>userName</strong> column in the workflow lookup, please also make sure the
<strong>userName </strong>column is in <strong>Person or Group</strong> type too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Frank</p>

<h2>            Old Hotmail spam auto-forwarded to New outlook.com account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many years ago I used a @hotmail.com account. A few years ago I switched to the @outlook.com domain when this was introduced. I set it up with auto-forward for mails sent to the @hotmail, so the these would be forwarded to the new @outlook.com mail. In case
 someone used my old mail...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately after all these years I have begun to receive numerous spam mail sent to my old hotmail account, but received in my @outlook.com inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I stop this? I cannot seem to find a solution. I just want to kill the @hotmail mail account, but when I try to login on that account it seems as if my @outlook account 'overrules'. In the settings of my @outlook account I can't find an active synch
 with the @hotmail mail.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I deleted a Private Group and tried to create a DG in EAC with the same name but unable to due to "Display name already exist"? &nbsp;I tried to search for the group but nothing came up. &nbsp;Please advise as I need to use this name, ie Secretariat. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Ernest,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.<br />
According to the PowerShell outputs, I find the Name attribute is using Secretariat.<br />
So, please run the following cmdlet to change it:<br />
Set-Mailbox -Identity “Secretariat” -Name “Ernest Sun”</p>
<p>Once it’s done, you can create the DG with the display name Secretariat.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

<p>Can add shared folder in OWA.</p>
<p>When they click to expand&nbsp;the shared folder&nbsp;to show inbox, sent items, junk etc it forces it to open in a new tab rather than expanding.</p>
<p>User cannot add calendar items to this mailbox calendar unless they are in the seperate tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems it is forced to "open another mailbox"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mailbox has been around for 4 years and always worked OK up until this week, most other mailboxes with delegated permissions behave normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something I can change through admin console, or is it being forced due to user settings?</p>

            Hi NathanSalmon,<br />
<br />
Based on my experience, I suggest the affected users delete the shared folder and re-add it referring to this article to see if there is any improvement:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to collect the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. Try to clear the browser cache or use the InPrivate mode to see if it makes any difference.<br />
2. Is the affected mailbox a shared mailbox or a normal user mailbox that is shared with others?<br />
3. Can the affected user reproduce the behavior in different browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE and so on) on different desktops?<br />
4. Is the issue specific to a shared mailbox or a user who is granted full access permission to different shared mailboxes? I mean if one user has trouble using a specific shared mailbox, can he use other ones normally? Similarly, if a shared mailbox works
 abnormally from a specific user’s side, will it work normally from other users’ sides?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing and&nbsp;re-adding the shared folders a number of times with no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Clearing cache and inprivate browsing makes no difference.</p>
<p>2. Its a normal mailbox shared with others via Exchange Admin Centre.</p>
<p>3. Yes, this is reproducible in Chrome - yet to try other browsers.</p>
<p>4. Users can access other mailboxes with full permissions correctly. Other users are also having issues accessing the affected mailboxes (though I cannot say for certain that everyone is affected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered 2 mailboxes so far that behave this way - and having given myself permisions on the&nbsp;affected mailboxes and I also have the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi Nathan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
Based on the current situation, the issue should be related to those specific user mailboxes. And let’s move forward based on these steps:<br />
1. Regarding the browsers, I suggest you:<br />
1) Try Incognito mode in chrome to see if the issue is still reproducible.<br />
2) Use different browsers to test if the issue is related to browsers settings in Chrome.<br />
2. May I confirm whether the two affected mailboxes are all user mailboxes? Are there any differences between those two mailboxes and other user mailboxes (also shared with others) which are working properly?<br />
3. The detailed version of Outlook Web App of an affected account in which you fail to expand shared folder normally. For example: 16.1799.13.2326522. Just right click the web page and choose
<strong>View page source</strong>.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Office 365 Home and Office 365 for Business are in different service families. You may need to purchase the Business Premium subscription and cancel Office 365 Home subscription.
</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Cancel-Office-365-Home-Office-365-Personal-or-Office-365-University-d219b5a5-9443-44cf-bcfa-80a052bdd18c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Cancel-Office-365-Home-Office-365-Personal-or-Office-365-University-d219b5a5-9443-44cf-bcfa-80a052bdd18c</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, Office 365 doesn’t Office VPN service. As I know, virtual private cloud service is provided by Azure. But that’s not the field where we focus on. You may need to consult our Azure specialists here:

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better address these behavior, could you please share the following information?</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-version-of-OneDrive-am-I-using-19246eae-8a51-490a-8d97-a645c151f2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Which
 version of OneDrive are you using?</span></a><span> Please share the OneDrive version number as well.</span></li><li><span>Does this behavior persist when you test with a workbook?</span></li><li><span>Please try to save the copy to another location like the desktop, and check whether you can copy it to the OneDrive sync folder directly.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, regarding your requirement, we kindly suggest you enable document versioning for your OneDrive for Business. After that, it will create a new version when you open, edit and save the file.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the second question, what we want to confirm is that whether this behavior occurs with all kinds of file. For example, Word document, Excel workbook, PowerPoint Presentation, etc. Additionally, did it work properly previously?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding enabling version history in your OneDrive for Business, please click
<strong>Return to classic OneDrive </strong>if you are using modern experience&gt;Click the gear button
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt;turn on <strong>Ribbon</strong>&gt;click <strong>Library&nbsp;</strong><strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;under
<strong>LIBRARY</strong> tab&gt;Versioning settings to check whether you can see the
<strong>Document Version History</strong> setting.<br />

            If you have auto upload ON for photos+videos you will get your photos on onedrive. You can also get the photos back by installing a good recovery software on your PC and scan your card.

<p>Hi Tommaso,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the situation, I need to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. Where did the error message occur? Click Project on <a href="https://www.office.com/apps?auth=2&amp;home=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal</a>.</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>3. Can you access Project before?</p>
<p>4. Check if all users have the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>Hi Tommaso,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>I would like to explain that, with only the Project Online Essentials license, the user can’t create a project and access the PWA site if the PWA admin doesn’t share the PWA site collection with her/him. A user is assigned with a Project Online Professional
 license and then he can click Project tile to provision the PWA site collection. After that, as a PWA admin, he/she can create a Project in PWA site and share it with other users who only have the Project Online Essentials license. The PWA admin add these
 users to the Team Members for Project Web App group when sharing the PWA site. The users can access and use Project Online in SharePoint. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The PWA admin must share the root site in the PWA site collection with users, the user is given a specific set of permissions at the same time the root site is shared. This determines what they can see and do within just the PWA site. More information can be
 found in the articles: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2837932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Just because you have a Project Online license does not mean you are able to access the system.&nbsp; Your application administrator needs to add you as a user and resource to your Project Online instance, and add you to at least one security group.&nbsp; After that,
 you will be able to log into Project Web App.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word Stylus Annotations not appearing on Word Online</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this question has been asked before; I'm actually not 100% sure what are the magical keywords to find the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My team is trying to use the stylus on the Surface to annotate editing marks on documents that will passed through our editorial process. The idea is that we'll keep the document in Onedrive so we can take advantage of the revision control, and not have
 multiple copies of a file in different places. However, when viewing the document in Word Online, this is what we see instead of the written marks:</p>

</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/542363d2-190f-4c98-a7f4-dc16a6a3de3c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/542363d2-190f-4c98-a7f4-dc16a6a3de3c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm trying to figure out is if the online version of Word just doesn't support showing the written material, or if there's something we're missing; maybe the wrong browser is being used, perhaps we need to enable Flash (<em>quelle horreur</em>), or
 something similar to that. And if it is something that the online version just doesn't support, is that going to be added in the future or is that not on the timeline?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<h2>            IE error &#34;you are not connected to a network&#34; but there is no network, interenet is wire connected</h2>
                    <p>When I click on IE explorer (Windows 7) the page pops up with the following error message "You are not connected to a network". However, there is no network. The desktop PC is wire connected to a Comcast modem. I checked with Comcast and there was no issues
 on their end, all signals are good. When I check the Firewall to set recommended settings, I get a firewall error. I am assuming that Windows Firewall is conflicting with Comcast Norton Antivirus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what the last automatic update was or when it was installed, the PC is my Father's and I am not always around when the updates automatically install. I tried uninstalling the last updates but it didnt work.&nbsp; I cant run a "fixit" because I cant
 access the internet.&nbsp; I am in need of a fix that I can download to a thumb drive and then take to my Father's computer. Please help!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I am unsure as to what version of IE it is; I think it is IE 8</p>

</p>

<p>That message may only be an indication that a DNS lookup failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a cmd&nbsp; window to check that possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. use&nbsp; tracert&nbsp; with the problem host name.&nbsp; I imagine that you would find that the Comcast modem is set up as a router and that you could
 get some connectivity diagnostics from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry if the tracert doesn't get to the final destination.&nbsp; It uses ICMP and hence may be blocked by some hosts continuously but it should give you a clearer idea of the state of your networking than just
 using ping (another ICMP program).</p>

<p>Then I think Comcast should have helped you more.&nbsp; You are paying for connectivity and they should at least prove to you where the problem is and if it involves their equipment and software give you some help diagnosing it from that perspective.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
IMO it is&nbsp;too&nbsp;soon to be looking for "a fix".&nbsp;&nbsp; You still need to do diagnosis to understand your problem symptoms.</p>

<p>I had recently updated my windows to October 2018 release and my office 365 (monthly channel) was also updated. I was using Microsoft Office 2019 updates. They were visible. But now, when I open MS Word or MS Excel, I see older versions. When I go to File
 &gt; Account and click on update now, it says that I am using the latest version of Office 365. Can somebody help me, why my updates for 2019 are not visible anymore? My MS Word version is&nbsp;<span>Version 1901 (Build 11231.20174).</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Chitrahaas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As requested I am attaching the screenshot of Office Account Details. I have Office 365 Pro Plus. And after updating my windows 10 to October 2018 release, ( on 22-1-19), My MS Office was also updated. And MS Office
 applications, the toolbars and all looked like how they look in MS 2019.</span></p>
<p><span>But now I don't see the same interface anymore. It seems to have gone.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>and for a week after the update, it was showing like this (screenshot below) and now it looks like the above mentioned screenshot. Why is this happening?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b729310d-88fd-43c1-ba23-2234bdffb336?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b729310d-88fd-43c1-ba23-2234bdffb336?upload=true" /></a></p>
