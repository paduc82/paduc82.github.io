    <title>Windows 10 update has wiped my computer of all files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r macnaughton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update has wiped my computer of all files</h2>
                    I have two computers. I downloaded the free windows 10 update on both inadvertently.&nbsp; Initially both seemed fine.&nbsp; Then one of them wiped my screensaver, and then the start menu. On the next log in it had \signed me in as a 'temporary user' telling me
 I could not get access to my files!&nbsp; I have tried system restore which does nto seem to exist on this version, and then resetting to an earlier save, last year!&nbsp; Although I could see the files listed as it 'restored' them, when it finished they were not in
 documents or anywhere to be found!&nbsp; What on earth do I do?&nbsp; I have a lot of important files and recordings which have just vanished into the ether.&nbsp; I am beside myself.&nbsp; I do not have Mcaffee, I have Norton, but the computer originally came with mcafee so
 perhaps this is the problem?

            I have had to take my computer into a shop to be fixed which will cost me a lot no doubt.&nbsp; Thanks very much Microsoft, my next computer will be a Mac, and I will never go for these updates again. I have lost everything apparently, though it must be stored
 somewhere on the hard drive.&nbsp; All kinds of files and recordings I need for work.&nbsp; I am not alone clearly.&nbsp; DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!

<p>So... I had a little problem where my&nbsp;laptop lost all&nbsp;power. (My fault, not the problem I'm having.)</p>
<p>Since then, every time my computer boots Windows 7,&nbsp;it tries to run a CHKDSK.&nbsp; Trouble is, it doesn't run.&nbsp; There is a countdown; it reaches one; then nothing, the computer goes to password entry screen with no other trouble.&nbsp; I've checked the disk and it
<em>is</em> dirty, but whenever I try to run CHKDSK on startup manually, it fails the same way.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 cannot connect to WPA2 secured wireless network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jale01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 cannot connect to WPA2 secured wireless network</h2>
                    Similar to most of the other posts, I do have a 802.11N Wireless Network (Linksys WRT610N Router).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Configuration: <strong>Security mode: WPA2-Personal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encryption: WPA-TKIP or WPA2-AES</strong><br />
<br />
I do have three wireless machines: 1 HP Notebook (Windows 7,&nbsp;32 bits), 1 HP Desktop (Windows 7,&nbsp;62 bits), , &amp; 1 Dell Notebook (Windows 7,&nbsp;64 bits), , including other wireless devices. I am able to connect to the network with all of wireless devices&nbsp;with the
 exception of&nbsp;the Dell Latitude E5400 (Intel(R) Wi-Fi 5300AGN). I do have the latest Wireless NIC driver installed from Intel.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I am to connect to an unsecured network with my dell notebook, but I cannot connect to my own network. I know for sure that my wireless NIC is functional since I am able to connect to another wireless connection. I also know that my network
 is working properly because all of my other devices are connected to the network.
<br />
<br />
I have tried everything but still no luck. I am&nbsp; able to locate all of the broadcasting SSIDs, including mine. When I try to connect to my network, it scans the network and ask me for the security key; I later get a the message stating that Windows is unable
 to connect to&nbsp;my network. However, I do not have the same problem with a neigbor's unsecured network.<br />
<br />
I also tried reconfiguring the wireless setting on the router by changing the encryption type from "WPA-TKIP or WPA2-AES" to "WPA2-AES". Unfortunately, this didn't help.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Reinstalling the OS is a bit extreme. If it isn't just misconfiguration, connection problems are often related to device drivers or firmware.&nbsp;In the case of trying to connect different brands of hardware it could also&nbsp;be incompatible security algorythms
 -eg. no encryption or WEP might connect but WPA/WPA2 won't.&nbsp; The DWL-G520 slipped into D-Link's&nbsp;unsupported adapters category last year and the last 32bit drivers issued for it were for Vista in 2008 (which you can still download). Vista drivers often work
 in Windows 7 but you might have to depend on Windows 7 including legacy drivers for the adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> bobbiejean1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default PC Name.</h2>
                    Is there a way to find out what the default name was on my pc before I changed it? I have a program that won't let me in it unless I type in the name of the pc when the file was last saved. My husband built me a completely new PC and I was going through
 all my files and programs to set them up. I new the name of my old pc so no problem there. I didn't know my husband didn't change my new pc name or I would have done so before I started going through all my programs and saved new files of them on this new
 pc with a default name. Stupid of me to not think about writing this down, just didn't think of it. It is important that I can get into this file as it is my finances. Please, I know how to change my pc name, I just don't know how to find the default name
 or if there is even a way.

<h2>            Strange Windows App with Icon</h2>
                    <p>In my Windows 10 calendar privacy settings I have an option to turn on or off an App called Windows. &nbsp;However, the icon for this app looks very strange and poor quality. &nbsp;It does not look like a normal Windows icon. &nbsp;Is this a virus? &nbsp;I have turned it off
 for now. </p>
<p>Here is the picture.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same strange icon appear on my Privacy:Calendar page as well. &nbsp;Earlier today, around 7:00 PM PST, my computer automatically downloaded and installed a Windows Update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

 &nbsp;It was while turning off MS's "let us see what you're doing" settings that I noticed this Win 3.1-quality icon but I know it wasn't here before the MS update earlier today.</p>

    <title>Can I remove Media Center and go back to Windows 8 Pro&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I remove Media Center and go back to Windows 8 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    So I was upgrading a 2nd machine today and everything went great until I made the mistake of seeing if the Media Center Key I got for my first system would work with my 2nd system. Windows accepted the key, installed Media Center but when the system rebooted
 my activation was broken since it saw the key as being in use on another machine.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Win 8 key I got with my receipt no longer works since it says it's for a different edition of Windows (I guess Windows w/ Media Center is a different edition?).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to remove Media Center so I can use my original key again? Or what are my options? Right now I'm getting nagged to activate and I need to get work done tomorrow...&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            Someone on another forum suggest I attempt to activate my copy of Windows via phone, and it seems like that has fixed my problem. I'm not sure how often Windows checks activation keys but so far (it's been half an hour or so) both my machines are reporting
 that they are activated and in good standing.&nbsp;

            I had the exact same issue. Activated by phone for the second system too. However, if you notice, both systems have the same product key now. How can 2 PCs be authenticated with the same product key? Sadly Microsoft's phone support didn't help me with
 this though, i will call them again to see if they have an update.

            If you get an answer I'd love to hear it. So far I haven't had any problems but if I'm going to have in the future I'd love to fix it before everything breaks. I actually did get my 2nd Media Center Upgrade Key finally. I wonder if I could apply that now?
 I just am wary of breaking things again...&nbsp;

            <p>I am afraid that the same product key in two different pcs will cause some issue in the future, so I will try to find a way to downgrade to windows 8 pro without media center (uninstalling&nbsp;media center/removing it from windows features&nbsp;doesn't downgrade
 the version&nbsp;to windows 8 pro) for both my pcs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support lines open up in about 3-4 hours here, so I will post again if they have a solution for us.</p>

<p><br />
I really wonder what <strong>Microsoft</strong> is trying to do ?!!!</p>
<p>If using the same key on two machines is not allowed, why don't they validate and decline the key from the beginning ?!!! What is the point behind postponing the validation to be after the upgrade is already done and there is no way back??
<strong>Is it a trap??</strong></p>
<p>Accepting the key on multiple machines and then deactivating them all without providing any option to rollback except doing a clean installation for all machines is really terrible and not acceptable at all.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft</strong>, please be reasonable and fix this.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is a major error on Microsoft's part. I am in a similar position because I used the same email address to legitimately upgrade to MCE that I had used on a previous legitimate purchase. That the validation check only occurs AFTER implementation
 means that I cannot get back to my perfectly valid Win 8 Pro installation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a schoolboy error which Microsoft should address to save their embarrassment.

            I too wish I could revert to Windows 8 Pro.
<div><br />
<div>
<div>I bought a Dell laptop with Windows 7 in 2011.</div>
<div>Last year, I bought the Windows 8 pro upgrade.</div>
<div>Then, I got the free Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything worked for one month. Then one day I come back home and discover the activation is no longer valid. There's no key in my system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've got a legal key for Windows 8 Pro.</div>
<div>I've got a legal key for&nbsp;Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Neither works. Windows insists that I need a special "Windows 8 Pro + Windows Media Center" key. This key, however, doesn't seem to EXIST!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've already spent a pretty penny calling Microsoft support, and lost hundreds of dollars in wasted work hours. I had to call Microsoft support SIX times because I was put "on hold" and immediately disconnected. Each time I called, I had to go through
 ELEVEN steps of an automatic menu before I was allowed to speak to a human being. The guy was unable to help, but promised a technician would call me the next day. Unsurprisingly, nobody called. I spent eight hours (from 10 PM to 6 AM) trying to solve the
 problem, until I had to give up, because I've got actual WORK to do, that does not involve trying to solve Microsoft's blunders. And now, everyday, I've got that activation reminder popping up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last week, a friend made fun of me because his&nbsp;<i>pirated&nbsp;</i>Windows works perfectly, while my&nbsp;<i>legal&nbsp;</i>Windows is still broken!</div>

            How long will the Activation window come up? &nbsp;Will we get locked out at some time?
<div>I have legal copies and keys and I am not inclined to spend the time to reinstall Windows 8 Pro because I used a key for MCE that Microsoft sent me.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t Shutdown via the GUI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m,d. kokosnuss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t Shutdown via the GUI</h2>
                    I can't shutdown by using the appropriate option in the start menu. All it does is log me out and the screen goes black. When I click the mouse button I can log back in.<br />
<br />
If I, however, open command prompt and issue "<strong>shutdown /s /t 00</strong>", it shuts down just fine.<br />
<br />
What could be the reason for this?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Mark

            <p>It appears that, instead of actually shutting down, when the shutdown button is clicked Windows enters a hibernation state. By disabling hibernation I was able to change this behavior, so that it now actually shuts down my machine.<br />
<br />
For anyone wondering how to do this (credit to windows10update.com) :</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows + X keys to open Power menu and select Command Prompt (Admin)</li><li>To enable the Hibernate, type command powercfg/h on.</li><li>To disable the Hibernate, type command powercfg/h off.</li></ol>

            If you think someone has violated the Code of Conduct&nbsp; by abusing the message system just report that person or block him. If the messages in question can't be deleted try removing the account from the console, doing a hard restart, hold the power button
 for 10 seconds while the system is on, and then re-adding the account, and deleting the messages.&nbsp;

            So ive also had something silisim to this happen with me. It was not from a random person, but people i knew, and also group messages. For days almost week if not longer I could not delete certain messages. I would click delete and nothing. A short while
 of dealing with that, it eventually worked. It could have just been something on the platforms end. Or maybe trying power cycling your xbox and see if that maybe works.&nbsp;

            I would recommend deleting messages via either console or app on PC. If they are hackers report their profiles and lock them. They're reinvigorating messages. You must remove them definitively

            Hi there, this looks like an intrusion and has compromised your system i would report and block any players you do not recognise and let support know of the situation so they maybe able to monitor the situation further.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also check the xbox app via your phone and see if the issues still occur when using that method.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this helps&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            dead rising 2 not playing on one console but playing on another&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So got it fresh, unopened today, eager to play, and I hear this odd noise. I take it out, investigate, nothing wrong with the disc, try for 20minutes, get mad, trying another game (with impurities on the disc) and it plays no problem. I tried my game on
 another console and it worked, I've nver had troubles wth any other games either. what do do?</p>
<p>In short, my console will not play one game but it will play another, even though the one not played is in perfect condition. tried again with other cnsole, no problems.</p>

<p>Hey how are you doing today?</p>
<p>Lets see if I can help you out. One thing that can make a game not work is if you have to update and you don't have room to update/down load the game If that is the problem go to system then click on storage device to try and delete some things off the storage
 device.</p>
<p>Another thing I would consider doing is clearing system cashe it makes your system run much faster and its right next to storage device.</p>
<p>Last thing you should try to do is try to use a cleaning console disk that you would put inside your Xbox 360 to make it read games faster.</p>
<p>Good luck today and if you have anymore questions ask them on here. I hope I helped you(:</p>

<p>Hi there An,<br />
<br />
It seems we are having some disc drive issues eh? Let's see what we can do to get this resolved.<br />
<br />
I'm going to suggest we start out by running through our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Disc Drive Solution</a>. This is a great troubleshooter. In the end, it should determine the most appropriate next step. From the sound of it, the disc drive may be going out, seeing as it is now unable to read any discs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how all that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, the sound was an electricy -zzt-, didn't move the console, no scratches or anything, the game has only ever gotten as far as showing me (c, capcom ltd, 2010, etcetc), but most of the time it freezes, shows a black screen, so then I have to eject the
 disc for it to tell me it's scratched (when it isn't). I've whittled down every option, I was wondering if I would be best off just buying a 2nd hand copy or something?</p>

            <p>Hey there An!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear it's still not working for you.<br /><br />I've heard of similar issues before with new games. It usually comes down to just being a bad copy of the disc. <strong>My suggestion would be to return it to store you bought it from and ask for a new copy of the same game.</strong> I've seen people do those exact steps and the new copy of the game runs perfectly fine.<br /><br />I hope that helps!</p>

            <p>Hello Eddie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you're having issues on your audio once you used the full screen mode in Movie Maker. We would like to inform you that the preview screen sometimes does not show the exact outcome of the movie/video
 that you're creating. Since there are no issues in viewing the video normally, we suggest that you continue on creating the video. But, if you'd like to troubleshoot your inquiry, please try to repair Windows Movie Maker by following the steps below:</p>

<br />
We did as you suggested, and nothing changed:&nbsp;&nbsp; If we <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
start the movie in full screen</span>, the first piece of music plays to its end (191.01s);&nbsp; but as the slides continue, the audio does not resume at 216.60s where the second piece of music begins.<br />
<br />
However, if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before we go to full screen</span> we first simply scroll down the edit panel
 first scroll through the edit panel first.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. Sorry to hear that that steps provided didn't work. Let's see what we can do. We would like to ask some information from you so that we could check it on our end and to isolate your issue further.</p>

            <p>Helene,</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<ul>
<li>We created the movie in Windows Movie Maker version 2012 (Build 16.4.3528.0331) which came as part of our Windows version 8.1
<br />
</li><li>The various audio segments were added by clicking on the "Add Music" icon, which took us to the directory "This PC : Music" where we had previously placed various recordings.&nbsp; We then selected each piece for insertion at various sections of the movie.</li><li>some of the recordings are .wma and others are .mp3</li><li>We had no problem playing the movie and hearing all of the various music pieces when playing the movie from the small screen during the making of the movie, and we still have no problem hearing all of the music pieces when playing the movie from on the
 small screen when the edit panel is displayed to the right.</li><li>However, when we exit Movie Maker and then return later, if&nbsp;the first thing we do is click the icon for "Preview full screen (F11)" and then start the movie on the full screen, the first music selection will play to its end, but subsequent selections do
 not play.&nbsp; (All of the selections will still play if we watch the movie on the small screen; and all of the selections will play on the full screen if we scroll down through the edit panel before going to the full screen.)</li></ul>
<p>We have no idea what a codex is, and when we go to the Microsoft Fixit tool link that you provided, we get the message "We're sorry, but your operating system is not supported by Microsoft Fix it at this time."&nbsp; We downloaded MediaInfo as you suggested,
 but can't figure out what to do with it.&nbsp; We don't know what you are talking about when you suggest converting the video to a supported format and then adding it to our project.&nbsp; We need user friendly information.</p>

            <p>A couple quick questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that some of the music was in .wma files and others are in .mp3 files.&nbsp; Is the first piece perhaps one type (e.g. wma) while the rest is another type (e.g. mp3)?&nbsp; It would be helpful to know the various types to know if this is perhaps the
 cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you said the normal preview works, but not the full screen preview.&nbsp; How does the final movie sound?&nbsp; If you save the movie (File &gt; Save movie) and playback that file, does it behave like the regular preview (sound all the way through) or like the
 full screen preview (only sound for the first song)?</p>

            You were right: we went ahead and finalized the project and saved it using the Save Movie drop down menu, and the final movie works properly with sound all the way through.&nbsp; The fact that the full screen in the unfinalized version does not work properly
 is no longer relevant.<br />

            <p>I also see you might have a workaround which is to scroll through the project completely before trying the full-screen preview.&nbsp; Perhaps that does prepare Movie Maker so that it can better preview the project in real time with the songs already cached in
 some fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rarely use the full-screen preview but if I have time, I try to play with it to see if I can recreate your symptoms.&nbsp; If you can provide any further details on the file types, it would help my investigation.</p>

<p>This did not help. I switched to UK english and UK region and removed US region &amp; US english, saved, went back in added US region and US english as defaults, removed the UK region &amp; UK english, saved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then rebooted, and Cortana still shows "disabled by company policy"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again this is a private laptop, HP ProBook 450 G2, running Win10Pro 64-bit upgraded from Win7Pro 64-bit approx 3 months ago. It is not a machine belonging to any company or corporation. I am the only user of this machine.<br />
</p>
<p>Having worked in the telecom industry for many years, and having built several windows PC's, over the years, this would seem to indicate that this is an issue/setting in the registry that needs to be corrected. I have had to edit the registry (regedit) in
 many machines for various issues over the years, and have no fear of doing so.</p>
<p>I just need to know where in the registry to look and which setting to change. &nbsp;<br />

<p>It sounds like your best option is to clean install Windows 10 before you give it to someone . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you do not have Windows 10 Installation Media Click&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HERE</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;to
 download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file
 which you can later burn to DVD</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since</span><span>&nbsp;you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated
 on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Servers</span></p>

            <p>You are alternating calling the disc a CD and DVD. Those are different things.&nbsp; You say that the movie on the disc plays on a DVD player,&nbsp; but you say that you're trying to read it on the PC using a "CD ROM."&nbsp; Is your PC optical drive capable of reading
 DVDs?&nbsp; </p>

Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file.

                    Getting "out of memory" message when I try to print in Microsoft Works program - particularly the database.&nbsp; Was working fine just a month ago.

<p>You didn't include the version of Works you have, the version of Windows you have, or the specifications of your computer (particularly the amount of RAM you have), all of which might have some bearing on your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you probably have the problem described here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.small-business-technology.net/other-microsoft/out-of-memory-error-message-when-printing-in-works-7-2003-and-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>The link to the Microsoft Knowledge Base article in the article linked above is no longer functional; fortunately, the Internet Archive Wayback Machine comes to the rescue:&nbsp;
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150401070755/http://support.microsoft.com:80/en-us/kb/841220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://web.archive.org/web/20150401070755/http://support.microsoft.com:80/en-us/kb/841220</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Method 1" in that old Microsoft KB article is the place to start.&nbsp; Go to the website of your printer's manufacturer and download the driver appropriate for your version of Windows.&nbsp; If you have difficulty with this, please identify the make and
<strong>specific </strong>model of your printer.&nbsp; Also identify your edition of Windows and include whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit system.&nbsp; If you're not sure, press the "Windows Logo" key and the "Pause/Break" key simultaneously to see this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have the latest printer driver AND you used to be able to print Works spreadsheets and databases without any problem, I suggest that you remove the printer driver that's now installed by using the following directions and then install a freshly-downloaded
 copy of the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Uninstall printer-related software from Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</span></li><li><span>Open an Elevated Command Prompt (click Start, type Command Prompt in the Search box, right-click the link to Command Prompt, and select "Run as administrator")</span></li><li><span>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>printui /s /t2<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>exit<br />
<br />
Be sure to remove the driver AND the package.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If installing the latest driver doesn't help, and you already have configured your printer as the default printer, I'd suggest going with the work-around suggested in the small business technology article rather than attempting to figure out what you might
 be able to use as an "emulation printer driver."&nbsp; I'm not familiar with pdf995, but I can recommend CutePDF Writer, which is also free and doesn't have a nag screen as PDF995 apparently does:&nbsp;

<p>Microsoft "Works" need to be enabled with Microsoft Office components..To enable,download Microsoft data-base engine 2016,Microsoft Access runtime 2013,plus office compatability pack 2007</p>
<p>Don't forget,Win 7 needs .NET to be enabled,to do that open add/remove/open Win components (L.sub-menu) chk .NET
</p>
<p>That gets you going,plus download: windowsupdateagent-7.6-x86&nbsp; from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Also,none will run until kb890830 is installed,get tht from update catalog.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also,out-of-memory OS error,can be corrected by R.clicking my computer/properties/advanced/virtual memory/advanced/change button..With&nbsp; C:&nbsp; highlited,set to "Let system manage"&nbsp; click set 2X&nbsp; close out,restart pc..This works with any storage drive,USB flash
 included,it takes fragmented files to a slave HD instead of C: drive...</p>
