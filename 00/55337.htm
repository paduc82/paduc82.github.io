    <title>Dual Monitor &#40;HDMI&#41; Through HDMI Switcher - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevindark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Monitor &#40;HDMI&#41; Through HDMI Switcher</h2>
                    <p>I use a 3 port HDMI switch with my laptop and my Xbox One in to one external monitor.<br />
<br />
When I use the laptop I use the laptop's screen and the extended/external monitor in 'extended' mode. When I want to use the Xbox, I simply switch it on and the signal from it automatically switches the HDMI switch to the Xbox's input, thus putting the laptop
 back in to 'normal' no external monitor mode. If the laptop's screen goes off (not sleep), I simply move the mouse and it comes back on again and I can use the laptop, whilst still having the Xbox on the other monitor.<br />
<br />
This worked perfect when I was running Win 7 on my laptop, for well over a year...<br />
<br />
Since recently installing Win 10 on my laptop (fresh install, not upgrade), when I'm using my Xbox and my laptop either turns it's screen black/off (not sleep) after a period of time, every time I move the mouse to get the laptop's screen back up, the laptop
 puts itself back in to 'extended/dual screen' mode and I lose my Xbox signal from the other monitor, overtaken by the laptop's signal!<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how I can get it back to working how it was with Win 7 please?<br />
<br />
(The display drivers are all up to date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Turns out my display drivers were NOT up to date. Downloaded the latest NVIDIA drivers (not from their actual site I might add) and it's now working as it did before.</p>

            <p>Hello Kevin,</p>
<br />
<p>We appreciate the details that you have provided. For us to further isolate the issue, we would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried updating the drivers for your HDMI switcher?</li><li>Can you provide us the Make and Model of your HDMI switcher?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

            The HDMI switcher is a stand-alone unit, smaller than a cigarette packet. I imagine if there were any updates to be done it would be the firmware, which I'm not even going to look in to.<br />
<br />
The issue wasn't there with Win 7 but it is now with Win 10 so it's obviously something to do with that and not the switcher...

            <p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's not related to your HDMI switcher, what we suggest is that you check your
<strong>Power plan settings</strong>. We recommend that you set your display settings to never sleep. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control panel </strong>and then click on <strong>power options.&nbsp;
</strong></li><li>Then click on <strong>Create new power plan.&nbsp; </strong></li><li>Change the power plan accordingly and check.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Try running the <strong>Hardware troubleshooter. </strong>This is an automated tool which will check the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues with it and provides the details and on how to fix them.&nbsp; Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key to get the Start menu.&nbsp; </li><li>Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box right up corner and hit
<strong>Enter.&nbsp; </strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting tab.&nbsp; </strong></li><li>Click on <strong>view all option </strong>on the upper left corner.&nbsp; </li><li>Select the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>options from the list.&nbsp; </li><li>Click <strong>Next </strong>to run the <strong>Hardware Troubleshooter.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result so we can further assist you.</p>

    <title>Do these reasons justify purchasing a Surface Pro 4&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cloudsbelow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do these reasons justify purchasing a Surface Pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Should I buy a Surface Pro 4, m3 processor, 4 GB RAM to accomplish the following tasks and meet the following specifications? (not necessarily listed in order of priority) If not, why not, and what would you recommend instead? Considering these goals, one
 constraint is price: I cannot spend much more than $900.</p>
<ol>
<li>Environmentally-friendly (e.g. low electricity consumption, long battery life, recyclable)</li><li>medical and scientific research at a national university</li><li>replaces pen and paper, and laptop computer</li><li>lightweight and portable: able to use on train, bus, airplane, or outdoors*</li><li>full-size keyboard (for ease of typing)</li><li>speak instead of type: including dictating text to documents and using computer</li><li>ergonomic: screen adjusts to any angle, keyboard in good positions, keyboard detachable</li><li>screen does not reflect overhead fluorescent lighting (straight-down unshaded fluorescent lighting is common in Japan), i.e. screen image is not masked by reflection of overhead lighting</li><li>no waiting to multitask: basic office software, web browsing with multiple tabs, cloud storage[1], remote desktop, music streaming, rather constant use while operating including alt+tabbing to a different application while waiting for something to load
 or process</li><li>front and back camera for conferences, and camera able to focus; e.g. to photograph text for use in work, e.g. OneNote, both of document on table and of projected presentation at a conference</li><li>able to share annotated documents, including PDFs, without OneNote login/software required</li><li>OneNote files not accessible to the public (see #2 medical and scientific research)</li><li>headphones compatible, including mic/earphones combo jack[2]</li><li>wirelessly connect to projectors in conference rooms (recent Apple computers have this feature)</li><li>able to install Windows software, including from independent developers (not only from Windows Store)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>* I found a Microsoft webpage weeks ago stating Surface products could not be used outdoors due to infrared solar radiation, and that avoiding direct sunlight was imperative. It said infrared was used for touch-functionality and that sunlight could damage
 the infrared sensor. Is it true that the Surface Pro 4 should not be used outdoors? Does it matter if it's in the shade, or mostly shaded (e.g. under a tree)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[1] Must I buy an adapter for ethernet cable use? How much is it? </p>
<p>[2] Is there the possibility of using headphones that don't have the microphone-and-speakers combination plug, but the older two separate plugs (like for desktop computers)? How much is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I should buy a Surface Pro 4, how long should I wait? Don't the threads here indicate the first-released models are having problems? What is the lifetime for this product, and how long will there be customer support for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestions for accomplishing the goals above with the same or less money?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>lol, thanks. Are these first models coming out of the factory all defective, though? How long should I wait?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also serious to see if there is an alternative, since the two Windows 3 Pro models I tried were both flawed, likely even on the level of software design (e.g. Cortana not transcribing dictated text and interfering with Windows Speech Recognition which
 does).</p>

    <title>File permissions messed up after Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File permissions messed up after Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. My operating system is installed on an SSD whilst my My Pictures folders and some programs are on an HDD. Since the upgrade im unable to save pictures from Photoshop (which is installed on the SSD
 (C:\) ) to My Pictures (E:\) due to no permission, I have also tried running it as Administrator (My user account is an administrator account anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have give all users Full Access to the folders on the E:\ drive. I have been told that I should do a fresh install of Windows 10 on my SSD to get rid of all Windows 7 permissions that may be conflicting with Windows 10. Is this the case?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I have a lot of programs installed on my HDD (E:\), is there a way to recreate the registry items if I am to reinstall Windows 10 without needing to replace all the Program Files on (E:\) so I don't have to change all the settings again within all
 my programs installed separately to the OS?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have ALL KINDS of screenshots showing my messed up permissions (usually read only) ... and I'm unable to correct any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started when my left-click on start stopped functioning.&nbsp; Then right-click on most applications/programs went.&nbsp; Then when I could not install or update anything, I tried system restore to previous restore points.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I read somewhere to&nbsp;refresh Windows 10 (and lost EVERYTHING I had installed with the refresh, too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do ANYTHING I have to provide Admin approval ... I have to&nbsp;run Paint Shop in administrator mode just to create files.&nbsp; I can save them to my desktop, but can't create in my documents folders.</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>Formatting and reinstalling is NOT an option when you have terabytes of files which had good permissions but seem to have forgotten all about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems I have seen are not being able to install stuff, not being able to sync dropbox etc. etc. all related to this same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, have you had any luck fixing it? Besides asking Windows to change permissions and see it fail?</p>

            <p>After a few hours on a LogMeIn session with MS 2nd level support Saturday afternoon, their only viable route was to refresh the Windows installation (again) or completely reinstall Windows 10. &nbsp;I ended up restoring from factory image and reinstalling (my
 Windows 8.1 Pro product key does not allow for clean install of 10 Pro).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I created new admin user accounts, which worked and gave full access permissions, briefly. &nbsp;But then the same thing began again (left-click on start not working, right-click on taskbar items, unable to create or delete documents/permissions, unable
 to install, etc.). &nbsp;I even tried a 3rd party "take control" utility to modify registry/account permissions. &nbsp;Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran several different full system virus and malware scans ... absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied and backed up files and settings, but I still lost a lot. &nbsp;I didn't want to copy any settings that were corrupt. &nbsp;I restored to factory condition, reinstalled 8.1 Pro ... let the system run updates (one set of 155 and one set of 83) ... then reinstalled
 10 Pro with nothing else running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be working, but something was definitely corrupted or did not want to cooperate with my upgrade and MS couldn't figure it out or fix it remotely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! &nbsp;If anyone figures this one out, I'd be interested in hearing the problem and solution.<br />

            <p>Well this response was useless and I consider still open. &nbsp;The question was and I have the same issue upon upgrading and sitting back as Microsoft says while the install is being performed with Windows 10 everything would be great. &nbsp;We know that not to be
 true, however the question was how do we correct our tangled permissions which were in order with windows 7 and now seem to have been corrupt and inconsistent. &nbsp;How can you be an administrator and not have full control? &nbsp;I certainly didn't make manual changes
 to my permissions levels. &nbsp;How does chkdsk remotely have anything to do with correcting an epic upgrade failure with permissions issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled programs that were corrupt or incompatible unknown to me at the time that still don't let me even do the simplest things such as end task when the program hangs. &nbsp;I get access denied. I can't even begin to outline all the inconsistencies
 I am having.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we please get a solution?</p>

            <p>I went through the same exact thing this past weekend....all of a sudden after updating, I was blocked from getting into my word files. The first thing I did was to create an "alternate" login local accoount with full privaleges. &nbsp;I was able to access the
 errant files from word, so I knew it was not an encryption problem, but a permission problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the C drive and right clicked on it and selected properties. &nbsp;I looked at permissions and found the default user did not have full access. &nbsp;I went back to the "alternate" user, logged in and gave the default user full permissions on the C
 drive, and so far, I've been able to access everything I have tried. &nbsp;For whatever reason, the permissions from Windows 7 sometimes get hosed when porting over to Windows 10 as near as I can figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that some people have turned off OneDrive and this has fixed the problem, mine was not on. &nbsp;It was grueling trying to figure it out, once I was sure it was not encryption, I figured I had hope. &nbsp;Now I have my fingers crossed that it will not revert!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response and sharing your similar experience/information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Windows 10 offers an option to restore back to previous OS for 30 days, my first attempt was to refresh Windows 10 which sacrificed my email archives and office profile settings. &nbsp;Now, I wish I would have restored to Windows 8.1 Pro, but I was too
 far into the process before I realized it was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might suggest restoring back to earlier OS before "refreshing" Windows 10. &nbsp;You'll keep your files and settings intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopeful that refreshing the OS would resolve the corrupt registry, or whatever was causing my problems, I wasn't paying attention when it warned that files would remain, but settings might be lost. &nbsp;(I thought email were included in my files. &nbsp;I lost all
 my ost and pst settings/files.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I played with a new user ID (admin), which worked for a short while. &nbsp;However, soon the new admin user began acting up, too ... first file read/write permissions again, and about the same time right-click/left-click functions on start and taskbar
 items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I merely deleted the new admin user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was unable to reassign/reset permissions (even with 2nd level tech support - everything they attempted, I already tried). &nbsp;When I assigned specific permission hierarchical inheritance, nothing seemed to be resolved/working. &nbsp;Still unable to install
 applications/programs, even unable to delete or create files. &nbsp;It was frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering something was corrupt, yet no malicious activity detected on several deep scans by various reputable antivirus/anti-malware products, I eventually acquiesced to reinstalling from Factory Image (8.1 Pro) and then re-upgrading to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I'll be paying attention to this discussion thread, because I'm interested to hear if anyone else resolves this without reformatting/reinstalling.</p>

            <p>I'm glad to know I'm not the only one feeling as if they were going insane with windows 10 upgrade issues pertaining to permissions. &nbsp;It doesn't get any worse than dealing with inconsistent permissions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since then reverted to windows 7 pro. &nbsp;The OS runs like a charm and I have recovered most of the damage windows 10 caused. &nbsp;The only thing I can't recover is my hours of non-value added time trying to correct Microsoft's issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My favorite part about the roll back - if there is any, was a window that said and I paraphrase, (as I couldn't alt-tab /ctrl-alt-delete - the window wouldn't let me take control) "...thank you for using windows 10, if you want super fast browsing and super
 performance, consider upgrading back to windows 10..." &nbsp;This is during the uninstall after I just finished checking the boxes for the 4 out of 5 reasons I reverted..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I only had the ear of the CEO - I would have a discussion regarding quality of service and customer satisfaction. &nbsp;Keep the customer happy and they will keep your business happy. &nbsp;The customer is your corporation's livelihood and your employees. &nbsp;I suppose
 that is lost in the many cultures of a mega corporation. &nbsp;I wonder if they measure quality, I'm sure it is nowhere held to the six sigma standard of which my industry is held. &nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<br />
Sometimes BlueScreenView will implicate XP files as the cause of the crash (ntoskrl.exe, win32k.sys, hal.dll etc.) but they are probably not the real cause of the crash (BSV does the best it can).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You would have to either gather up some more example crashes and look through them, or find some where XP files are not the "cause" or you could upload your crash dump files to your
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a> and somebody with the Windows debugging tools can help take a look at them in more detail.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is easiest to just upload the memory dump files from your most recent crashes to your SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing file).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somebody that already has the Windows debugging tools can take a closer look at things and figure
 out what is going on.<br />
<br />
The memory dump files from the recent crashes and BSODs are usually in this folder:<br />
<br />
<br />
The files will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to upload the most recent ones...&nbsp; maybe 5-10 of the most recent crash dump files ought to be enough if you have that many.&nbsp; If you do not have that many, send what you do have.<br />
<br />
Getting started with SkyDrive:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started</a><br />
<br />
After you get your files uploaded and are looking at them on your SkyDrive, you need to "share" your folders/files so others can see them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you how to do that:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq</a><br />
<br />
Then choose the "Get a link" button.&nbsp; When you click that, a window will open that contains the link to your SkyDrive files.<br />
<br />
Copy the contents of the box "Copy this link to share:" by selecting the link contents (it will all become highlighted), press Ctrl-C (copy) and then come back to the forum and in your next message press Ctrl-V to paste the contents of the link back here.<br />
<br />
What you paste back will look something like this link to my SkyDrive:<br />

            That is a good start, but you only have one crash dump file?<br />
<br />
Send the last 5-10 that you have and the other requested information.<br />
<br />
Did you complete the scans for malicious software?<br />
<br />
Sometimes BlueScreenView will implicate XP files as the cause of the crash (ntoskrnl.exe, win32k.sys, hal.dll etc.) but they are probably not the real cause of the crash (BSV does the best it can) and the real problem lie elsewhere, so if the cause is not obvious,
 you are going to need to look at more than one crash dump, or upload them to your SkyDrive<br />

            Hey&nbsp;TenisVerma,
<div><br />
<div>I am glad you were able to do a scan, but that reply does not tell us much :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please rememeber that it is better to include too much information rather then not enough when troubleshooting a computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What did your security scan return? And malware found/removed?</div>
<div>Will you please post your dump report?</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>You may look at the following thread for more in-depth instructions on posting a file to your skydrive:</div>
<div><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></div>
<div><br />

    <title>Games Suddenly freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lennissnowdon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games Suddenly freezing</h2>
                    <p>I have the latest version of Windows 10 and a new HP laptop with plenty of space. All of a sudden the games I play (Pearl's Peril &amp;&nbsp; Criminal Case are starting to slow down and freeze as I play. They usually start OK, but gradually slow down/stop working.
 Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Other computer functions seem to work fine. This problem started about a week ago &amp; are happening on both my computers (both with Windows 10). Could it be a virus? Is there a way to run a virus scan on a game?</p>

    <title>Internal sound recording does not work, but recording from microphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don milne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal sound recording does not work, but recording from microphone and line in do work.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron One 2020, bought in January. Running Windows 8.&nbsp; I can record from a line in from my stereo, or from the integrated microphone when speaking.&nbsp; However, it will not record any sounds playing internally on the computer, such as a CD,
 internet radio, or anything playing on Media Player.&nbsp; I have tested it with the Sound Recorder, and that program is working.&nbsp; I receive no error messages.&nbsp; I ran the Audio Troubleshooter and it found no problems.&nbsp; I checked for updated drivers for the installed
 Realtek High Definition Audio and it says I have the latest.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers.&nbsp; I checked to make sure the recording device is the default, is enabled and listening.&nbsp; Please help.

            <p>To record with sound, the program has always to be run with padsp xvidcap (for example from ALT+F2). To run it always like that from the menu: run alacarte, go to Sound and video, then to XVidCap Screen Capture, Properties and where it says Command put padsp
 xvidcap.</p>
<p>[ I would add this: ]</p>
<p>The stated is to record the system sound, that is, the one coming out of the speakers, that can be of a song or movie of our hard drive or pendrive played by Totem, of a Flash music video of a website played by Firefox, ...</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sometimes it can be necessary to record the microphone sound, for example if we want to make a videotutorial to explain how a program works. In this case we put xvidcap in recording state, run pavucontrol and in the Recording tab we put Analog
 Stereo Internal Audio (without "Monitor of" ahead).</p>
<p>If we only want to record sound (without video) we can run from ALT+F2 gnome-sound-recorder. The first time probably it will be configured to record from the microphone. To record the system sound we run with ALT+F2 gnome-volume-control, go to the Hardware
 tab and in Profile we put Analog Stereo Output (it's also possible to do this running pavucontrol and using the Configuration tab).</p>
<p>But when we finish we have to put again Analog Stereo Duplex in the Profile of Hardware of gnome-volume-control (or of Configuration of pavucontrol), so we can still choose the origin of the sound when recording with xvidcap.</p>
<p>NB: sometimes, to change from Analog Stereo Duplex to Analog Stereo Output it may be necessary to change first to Off, close, open again and then change finally to Analog Stereo Output. The same for the opposite change. If not, the computer may "not notice"
 that we have applied the change.</p>

Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it's far too technical for me.&nbsp; I don't even know where to find the first item "padsp", or "alacarte", etc.&nbsp; And when using the Windows Sound Recorder, hitting ALT+F2 does not provide any menu.&nbsp; You sure you're not talking
 Linux?<br />

    <title>Far Cry Freezing on PC with Windows 7 64bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matrixmainframe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Far Cry Freezing on PC with Windows 7 64bit</h2>
                    
<p>My computer spec is shown below</p>
<p>My question is about Far Cry which I have installed on my Windows 7 64bit PC which has an nVidia GT220 graphics card installed and it has the latest nVidia drivers installed.</p>
<p>I have tried running Far Cry in the games native 32bit mode (i.e. I used the 32bit shortcut to launch the game)&nbsp; with the 1.3, 1.31 and 1.33 patches installled but after I have been playing a while the picture on the monitor freezes and the only way I can
 get running again is to reboot the computer.&nbsp; The CPU is running at around 56 degrees celsius whilst playing the game so there is no overheating.</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling the patches and installing the 2 64bit patches and launching using the 64bit shortcut both with and without the CD in the CD Drive.&nbsp; The title sequence video runs perfectly well but when I load the game the screen is black and white
 and those are the only colours I can see.&nbsp; The compass, proximity and other gauges appear in their correct positions and colours but the 'picture' is white at the bottom and black at the top.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest what the problem is and how I can resolve it.&nbsp; I don't mind playing the game in 32bit mode as long as it doesn't keep freezing all the time.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hey,</span></p>
<p><span>Give a try with the following:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to use performance monitor and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749115.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749115.aspx</a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Update your computer with the latest updates available:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Updating-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Updating-your-computer</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Put the computer in clean boot state and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set
 of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details:<br />
<br />

</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps in the above article to reset the computer
 to start as usual.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If nothing helps,</span><span>try
 uninstalling and reinstalling the graphics card drivers and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under
<strong>System</strong>, clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><span><span>‌</span></span><span><br />
<br />
2. In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Right click on the device to uninstall the drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Restart the computer to reinstall the drivers.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can even look for</span><span>previous version of the
 drivers for your nVidia GT220 graphics card&nbsp; and install it and check if&nbsp;it works fine.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to do some actions with a folder (such as delete or rename) on the network (and even on my local hard drive), Windows locks up and puts a ridiculous message about "discovering items".&nbsp; It already read the directory - what's left to discover?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello HannoverFist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you are going to delete a file/folder you can try to hold down the shift key, which will delete the file/folder and not send to the recycle bin. &nbsp;Is your computer on a business domain?&nbsp; I have included a link below, which discusses this very issue.&nbsp;
 There are some steps that have worked for some, please let us know status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions but, like many other users, I still have the slowness issue. Unfortunately, hacking the registry is not an answer for real business users. Nor is asking me to reboot in Safe Mode just&nbsp;to delete a file - it's slightly quicker to
 wait for Windows to figure it out.</p>
<p>I was deleting files from a network, which doesn't use the Recycle Bin. The computer is on a business domain. I am also an
<strong>Admin</strong> on this computer but that just seems to mean <strong>User</strong> in Windows 7 as I can't do anything Admin-like.</p>
<p>Apparently from the users comments, this&nbsp;seems to be another&nbsp;issue that's been around&nbsp;for years that Microsoft refuses to correct or even acknowledge ("the problem is Windows, nothing to do with drivers or third party software. It's been like that since
 Vista...") ("Does MS have a fix that I can download to permanently correct this obvious flaw").&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It has never worked correctly but unfortunately Microsoft will never fix it. They don't fix bugs anymore unless they affect large corporate users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to start compiling a list of all the Microsoft bugs so we can humiliate Microsoft into fixing the bugs in their products. Other than them losing large chunks of business, they don;t care if their products don;t work correctly.</p>

            <p>Well, you will be surprised at how you can show that it is a Microsoft bug:</p>
<p>Just kill a restart Explore process from Task Manager and the copy/move/delete will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also will be surprised at the fact that it seems the same problem still exists in W8 .</p>

            After encountering this in Windows &amp; and now a brand new machine with windows 8 and reading all the diverse suggestions and NO serious response from Microsoft I can also only surmise that its a MS bug that's to difficult to fix. We seem to have gone backwards
 in regard to file handling since MS-DOS. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It staggers me that MS have not addressed this common and painful deficiency and also that the Media has not highlighted this painful problem in all their critical reporting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm just going to use a third party file manager, given up on MS doing anything</div>

<br />
They were persistent and after checking many things we ended up doing an RMA for the original CORSAIR RAM after it came back with memory errors from a memtest86 check.&nbsp; After a few weeks we finally got the RAM back, installed it and ran the computer again.&nbsp;
 The BSOD starting up shortly after the rebuild.&nbsp; We figured it must have been due to a bad install of 7 with the faulty RAM, did ANOTHER fresh install (fully partition, not quick) and started it up again.&nbsp; Again, we started having VERY random BSOD's that would
 sometimes go 3/4 days without one and then we'd have 3 in the same day.&nbsp; After running different lengths of time, cold/hot and otherwise every way we could figure metest86's we were not getting the RAM errors any longer.&nbsp; Still thought it was hardware, so
 we bought new RAM (from Microcenter, their brand) and a new motherboard:<br />
<br />
- MSI 880G-E45<br />
<br />
The BSOD's persisted and so we decided one last option was to see if another OS did the same thing. We decided to then install Windows XP Enterprise 64-bit edition to see if this was in fact another hardware issue, or software.&nbsp; Windows XP ran for 2 weeks with
 normal usage (the same things we were running before) without a single BSOD, so I am now assuming there is no hardware issue(s).&nbsp; Reinstalled Windows 7 64-bit home edition and within the week the random BSOD's started up again.&nbsp; Below you can find a .zip of
 all the minidump files that have been created from these crashes in the past month.<br />

<br />
So our current configuration is:<br />

<br />
We have removed the 5770 video card and each stick of RAM with the BSOD still persisting.&nbsp; My thought is that there is a driver conflict, but and unable to figure out where it is.&nbsp; I see the ntkrnlmp.exe as a casue in the dump files, but I'm not sure what that
 means.&nbsp; Thank you for any help!<br />

            That doesn't help at all, Windows just says there's nothing to fix the problem(s) and I see all the errors in the reports with no solutions.&nbsp; All of my drivers are up to date BTW, I forgot to mention that in the original post.

            <p>That looks like the right driver for your onboard Intel video component (from the Intel site) but you could let their driver update utility take a look at your system and see if they suggest something different:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But sometimes the latest driver from the manufacturer is not the one that is going to work - sometimes you might have to use an older version or you might need to stick with what is on the manufacturers (Lenovo) WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So checking the Lenovo 80K6 model on the Lenovo WWW site from video drivers does not offer an option for Windows 7 drivers (only Windows 8).&nbsp; Did&nbsp; the system originally come with Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd5e8d69-d78f-42f6-b520-ddf46f52d961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd5e8d69-d78f-42f6-b520-ddf46f52d961" /></a></p>
<p>You might be able to enter your serial number and get more details about your exact system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am not sure what to suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your issue has many topics in the AMD community (same problem) you might browse some of them and look for topics where a solution was found or start a new topic of your own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously other AMD users have had this issue before so it is not just something about your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody else might have some other ideas too.</p>
<p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 keyboard detach issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mj_308  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 keyboard detach issues</h2>
                    <p>I stared having an issue with the detach function&nbsp;<span>on my Surface Book 2 15". After starting the system and leaving it on for a few minutes, the detach icon will start saying the keyboard is detached, although you can still type and the touch pad works,
 but there's definitely an issue with the graphics card. It starts displaying errors in Device Manager under Surface DTX and GeForce. If you manage to start something GPU-heavy before it detaches, it prevents the detach for a while. GeForce keeps appearing
 and disappearing from the Device Manager. Also, if you click on GeForce properties when it happens to be there, devise status is: Windows is uninstalling this device. (Code 21).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I ran the diagnostics and it says there "might" be a problem with my Surface.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Has anyone else experienced this and knows how to fix it?</span></p>

<p>I recently was running into similar issues with the Graphics card. While trying to play a game I noticed that only one card was listed, the onboard card. Not strong enough to support the game.&nbsp; When I went to device manager I saw it didn't list the nvidia
 card anymore. When I detached the screen and then re-attached it, the card was back for a while.&nbsp; But it ended up disappearing again. I updated everything to the latest version&nbsp; and still no change. I went to the Microsoft Store and they tried re-installing
 the surface firmware and some other things, and nothing worked. I walked up to 2 different Surface Book 2 in the store that are on display and opened Device manager. Both didn't show the nvidia card. I detached and attached the display on one of them and the
 nvidia card appeared. I have a feeling this may be more widespread than we think, it just happens that you won't really notice unless you do something that relies on the power of that card. I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for a big lag in a game that
 was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone at MS can look into this to determine what is going on with these.</p>

<p>As Jjardine's test of 2 machines at the store and the fact that Tim is having the same problem suggest it's a wider issue that Microsoft probably caused with a messed up update. My Surface installed another massive upstate yesterday which I think was trying
 to fix the problem. GeForce will now run for a bit longer before it disappears again, but when you restart it's still a lottery whether it's going to be there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is also that they're not treating us seriously here. It's clearly a problem caused by Microsoft that they're trying to fix before people notice, while waffling to us about running diagnostics. Maybe it'd be a good idea to
 flag it up to Windows Central or some IT mag to get a bit more of a reaction from MS.</p>

            <p>You are kidding ... right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of simply hitting F8 upon boot to enter the option to select SAFE MODE, in the tutorial you list there are 7 steps to get into SAFE mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... as I stated....Why does Microsoft continue to make things more difficult?</p>

            I think I figured out what's wrong. I've been using CCleaner and chose some options I haven't used before and I think one of them may wipe out saved passwords.

<h2>            Friends list is gone</h2>
                    
<p>So, I got home from school &amp; tried signing into Xbox Live &amp; it signed me in but didn't connect to Xbox Live, just figured something may have happened and my router might have been turned off or something today so I connected to my internet, signed into Xbox
 Live &amp; I find that all of my friends have been deleted &amp; I have none of the messages I had before, recent players still show up though. I logged into xbox.com &amp; tried talking to a couple ambassadors, needless to say I was extremely disappointed with that.
 Also, my friends and messages are appearing on xbox.com, but not on the console itself. Someone please help me out?</p>

<p>Also, some ambassador was extremely rude;&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/88etvj</p>
