<h2>            My PC Wont Detect My Wacom Second Screen &#91;Windows 10&#93;</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>&nbsp;I have Windows 10 &amp; trying to duel screen with my Wacom 13 Cintq. Okay so I looked up many guides on this subject but only got basically the 1 answer, and that it update my drivers or roll back. But every time I tried that, it will tell they ARE up to
 date so what gives?It used to have the options for things like adjust brightness,and had the [1] (box on the top of display settings) thing but not anymore. When I connect the Cintq to my PC Viva "HDMI" cable, it will either display only on the main screen
 or just the Wacom it self never both. And when I try clicking on "detect" nothing happens, is there something wrong with my Pc or am I just missing something?</li></ul>

<p>could be several things</p>
<p>
</p><p>what ports are on video card such as VGA DVI HDMI</p>
<p>usually monitors have a simple driver to run them so I do not think that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have settings on your display settings and on the monitors</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you are using an adapter to like VGA to HDMI and such, the adapter could be wrong transfer direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your video card or system drivers need updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to manufacturers site and see if they have windows 10 drivers for your system</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not uninstall your video card, restart PC and let windows reinstall the video card drivers</p>

<h2>            How to reinstall Windows 7 Pro.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I had to do a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium because I had done a on-line install of Windows 7 Pro and didn't have the disk. Had some problems and the only way that I knew of to fix was clean install as the problem was also on my backup hard
 drive ISO too. So I was wondering is there anyway to reinstall Windows 7 Pro from the old files or do I have to do it another way? I thether with my Blackberry so I don't want to download it again as it is a large download that takes 8 to 10hrs at 115k. I
 sure hop that someone has a short cut for me.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Mark.

            For anyone from Aug 2015.&nbsp; This is what I had to do.&nbsp; I went to https://<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7</a>&nbsp;and entered in the win7
 home premium product key that I had.&nbsp; I then downloaded and installed it and when it asked for my product key I gave it the 7 Pro product key and it worked.&nbsp; Thank God I had 3 different Windows 7&nbsp;product keys (no discs) and one just happened to be a home premium.&nbsp;
 I can assume that the basic would work too.&nbsp; I am thinking that if I couldn't find my disk or product key for the&nbsp;Home 7&nbsp;that I could have either spoke on phone or by online chat to ask for a product key for a basic 7 maybe they could have given me that so
 that I could download.&nbsp; You can NOT go to this address and put in your Pro key cause it will only let you download Korean or French maybe someone from Microsoft or connections can fix it or give permission to give basic 7 product keys.&nbsp; Good luck!

            Hi Damien.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />THere are multiple problems with your disk junkyard.  For one it's converted to a Dynamic Disk which is only meant to span a partition across multiple hard drives.  Windows cannot operate for long on a Dynamic Disk, and most conversion methods require wiping the drive, so to convert non-destructively  see Option 1 in this tutorial:  <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e3c4d62-347d-4e44-9bc2-531defe9329d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.c...</a>
<br />
<br />Next, the Unallocated Space is empty space.  You can use the same partitioning tool Partition Wizard to extend the data or C partition into the Unallocated Space since it is also the only one that can annex space from non-adjacent partitions and Unallocated Space:  <a href="http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/extend_partition/extend_partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://partitionwizard.com/video-help/extend_pa...</a>
<br />
<br />Note that these are Seven Forums tutorials because the features to do this for free haven't been in PW for years, but Shawn preserved a download so you can still use the older free version to do these things.  
<br />
<br />If I were you I'd do the cloning over using the best free Tool Macrium and include only the System, C and Data partiitons.  With Macrium you'd drag those to the new drive, a link appears named Drive Tools that lets you resize the partitions on the fly to make them fit like you want, before completing the cloning.  See these guides:
<br /><a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2015/08/29/the-best-way-to-clone-a-hard-drive-least-time-consuming-error-prone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ghacks.net/2015/08/29/the-best-way-t...</a>
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Cloning+a+disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/C...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you want you can fix what you have by converting Dynamic to Basic (which Macrium would never allow), then use Extend function to redistribute the space from Unallocated space to C and Data partitions.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>windows 10 Pro version 1703 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertcomly  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 Pro version 1703 update</h2>
                    I have an HP Pavilion dm4-1265dx Laptop that has updated from Windows 7, to 'windows 8.1 , to Windows 10 PRO, version 1607 Build 14393.&nbsp; For over two months, I have been told that a update to Version 1703 is recommended.&nbsp; Over 70 times, the update has
 failed to install.&nbsp; I got the Windows 10 update assistant program, but the installation still fails.&nbsp;&nbsp; The update downloads 100%, verifies the down load 100%, and then fails installation at 72% and provides an error code of:&nbsp; 0xC1900107.&nbsp; This is indicated
 as an "Translation failure", whatever that means.&nbsp; It suggests restarting the computer and trying again.&nbsp; this has repeated many times (well over 70.).&nbsp;&nbsp; Other MS programs update normally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea of what is wrong with version 1703 ????

            Ciao,

please do the following:

1) Go to your C: drive in the file explorer 

2) Click View and check the box that says "Hidden Files"

3) There will be a folder named "$WINDOWS. ~ BT"

4) Rename that folder to anything you'd like.

5) Attempt the update again.

Please let us know the outcome.

Ciao
Ugo

            Hello Robert. I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

1) Please work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

2) If any steps cannot be performed then try whichever method works to enter Safe Mode with Networking which may work better to perform the steps:  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html

3) If no  Safe Mode, from the Advanced Startup Options use the Command Prompt at boot to run the Repair Commands in the Checklist:  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html
 
3) If nothing else works then you can Upgrade Windows to the latest version and perform a Repair Upgrade manually. Install the Media Creation Tool from this link, choose Upgr

            HI Teddy, if your Windows version is 1803 or older, you can run the inbuilt troubleshooter for hardware and devices.
<br />1. Press Windows + I - Click on Update and Security - Select the Troubleshoot option
<br />2. Then tap on Hardware and Devices and Run the troubleshooter.
<br />If it doesn’t help, uninstall the Xbox device controller from the device manager. This option doesn’t depend on your version and build.
<br />1. Type in devmgmt.msc in the Windows search bar.
<br />2. Search for Xbox 360 controller under Sound, video and game controllers or under other devices
<br />3. Right click on the Controller and choose Uninstall device
<br />4. Restart your PC.
<br />You might want to refer the support article with steps on how to troubleshoot your Xbox 360 controller <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-controller-for-windows-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/...</a>

            Hi Teddy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<p>So Windows automatically updates and that kills the controller connection every time. Even uninstalling the updates requires several attempts to reconnect the controller, usually resulting in only a few minutes of connectivity. This is a crappy response,
 "uninstall the updates." Especially since the updates are automatic.<br />
My controller is Xbox One which is Microsoft. So why does the update jack my connection?</p>
<p>Why can't microsoft account for this?</p>

<h2>            UFC Undisputed 3 on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Like i said in a title up there, UFC Undisputed 3 should be added on Xbox One backwards&nbsp;compatibility. This game is really amazing, even after a long time that game was made. You have to believe me. I'm fighting for this game for a long time, so please comment and let this game be on Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

            I definitely want to see this as well! Unfortunately, the games that make it into the BC program aren't entirely up to Microsoft; they can only enable it, the devs are responsible for getting their game updated and enrolled. On top of that, some games
 will never make it onto Xbox One because of licensing issues, even if the fans and devs want to make it happen. I suspect that game could run into such licensing issues because the UFC and certain fighters and brands in that game may not allow the original
 to be ported and extend that original license.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>As this is a fairly old thread, I will be locking it down. We encourage you guys to keep the conversation going by creating a new discussion. Seeing as combat sports in general continue to gain audience, I'm sure many gamers will want to talk about the various
 UFC games.</p>

                    The title pretty much says my problem. I have installed all zoo tycoon's 2 expansion packs on my ASUS laptop (type : S550CB-CJ103H). I was using the tips from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933346/en-us to install the Marine Mania EP. It can be played
 as usual. However, the photo safari mode seems to be not working. Every time I take picture, the picture ain't saved, like nothing happens, still 00/24 in the album. Anyone knows how to fix that so I can complete the challenges?<br />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may arise when there are issues with the Windows update components. Try the following methods to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run the Windows update troubleshooter, it will detect and resolve the most common issues with the Windows updates. To do so, follow the
 link below. You may also follow some other common solutions on the same articles.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-7</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Reset Windows Update components</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue is with the Windows update components, this method will resolve the issue by repairing all the components associated with it. Click
 on the link below and follow the article on the same.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How do I reset Windows Update Components?</span></a></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might
 occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how
 to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>

<h2>            Blurry programs on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had windows 8.1 for a couple months now, and am now experiencing some new issues regarding blurry screen text. I had these issues with Google Chrome (fixed them), and now Office 365 and other Windows programs like control panel, file navigator window
 are now with blurry text. I noticed this after disconnecting from a external screen via HDMI, so that might have something to do with it but I cannot figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated thanks</p>

            <p>Could be that the disable is stretching out the image to fill the screen size.&nbsp; Make sure your DPI setting is at 100% for the clearest image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click your desktop wallpaper, choose Screen Resolution, then click <em>make text and other items larger or smaller</em> to reach your DPI settings.&nbsp; Here, make sure it's set to 100% normal size, not enlarged.</p>

            LNK isn't a problem by itself. &nbsp;That's simply a shortcut file. &nbsp;For example, you may have many shortcuts on your desktop that open up your media players or web browser.

</p><p>After waiting for hours, Windows finally got to the second step. It's been stuck on "Scanning and repairing drive (C:): 100% complete" for almost 5 hours. This is incredibly frustrating as I don't want to reset the computer and start all over. Is there a
 solution to this?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 PC &#34;No Wi-Fi networks found&#34;</h2>
                    I jusT got a windows 10 pc and right out of the box it had this issue. It will not show any wifi networks. However, when I turned on mobile hotspot on my phone that did show up, if that helps at all. I have looked it up and tried all the things I found(uninstalling
 drivers, reinstalling drivers, updating drivers, disabling firewall....) but none of these solutions have worked. My software is a bit out of date, because it has no internet connection. Yes, all other devices in my house can connect to the internet.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As OEM the system maker is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. Added the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Also contact the seller.<br />
<br />
=============================<br />
<br />
If you want to try to troubleshoot the issue (which I would not do much of on a new computer) :<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;computers have hotkeys&nbsp;or manual switches which could be involved. Also be sure you&nbsp;are not somehow activating Airplane Mode.<br />

Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version -
<strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong> <strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong>
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

            I have sadly enough already tried all of these things. I have another pc running windows 10 and it works fine with my wifi. I tried manually updating the drivers by downloading them from my other computer, but it simply failed to update. &nbsp;In the device
 manager, under the events tab, every single network adaptar(Bluetooth and wifi) says Device PCI (insert long string of numbers here) requires further installation. The wifi adaptor is Qualcomm Atherosclerosis QCA9377.

<h2>            Black screen with disappearing and reappearing cursor</h2>
                    <p>Hello as the title says i have a black screen problem, i never seen this type of problem and spent many hours to search for it and found nothing. When I boot the pc my screen shows the asus logo and the dots spinning after 4 seconds they stutter and a black
 screen appears with no cursor,&nbsp; if I move my mouse the cursor appears for 3 seconds, then it lags and changes to the loading cursor and disappears, if I move my mouse again same thing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What led to this problem:</p>
<p>I messed with the d3d11.dll file from system32 replaced it with another file, then when I tried to open regedit or other file like steam etc:Extended attributes are inconsistent.</p>
<p>I tried to fix this problem,&nbsp; I watched a video and did exactly as that guy did. I opened netplwiz, chosed my PC name properties group management and ticked others(Administrators) and hit apply,&nbsp; then it asked me to sign out,&nbsp; I signed out and then poof
 black screen with hoodini cursor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did to fix the black screen:</p>
<p>1 Ctrl alt delete not working neither other commands</p>
<p>2 Tried safe mode, it boots in safe mode with black screen(ctrl alter delete not working)</p>
<p>3 sfc scannow says no issues found</p>
<p>4 chkdsk same</p>
<p>5 Tried system restore, startup repair, go back to the previous version, not working</p>
<p>6 tried every solution for the black/blue screen&nbsp;</p>
<p>My assumption is that I have to undo the changes that I did to netplwiz but I don't know how, I searched for a command to change netplwiz but found nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a partition of 7 GB with windows 10 that's how I opened Cmd.</p>
<p>Please help me!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Teodor,<br />
<br />
<br />
The <strong>Blue Screen</strong> error is caused by an outdated driver, a recently installed application that causes conflict on the system, or due to missing updates. The
<strong>Stop errors</strong> (also known as blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. Improper shutting down of the computer or forcefully turning off your device might also cause
 a startup issue.<br />
<br />
I would like to know more about your blue screen concern. Kindly verify the changes on your computer prior to the issue. Have you tried all the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we suggest that you run the boot recovery commands in Command Prompt. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on your computer.<br />
</li><li>When you see the loading dots, immediately turn off your computer.<br />
</li><li>Repeat step one and two. Twice will be enough for the computer to think that you are having issues with start up.<br />
</li><li>Once the computer boots up for the third time, you will see the loading dots on the screen and the message "<strong>Preparing automatic repair</strong>".<br />
</li><li>Afterwards, your PC may turn blank then it will show "<strong>Diagnosing your PC</strong>".<br />
</li><li>It will ask you to restart or choose Advanced options, choose <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Type each command followed by hitting Enter:<br />
<em><strong>BootRec /fixmbr</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>BootRec /FixBoot</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>BootRec /ScanOs</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>BootRec /RebuildBcd</strong></em></li><li>Close <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and then reboot your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.</p>
