<h2>            Anti-virus software problems</h2>
                    My anti-virus software is turned off and when I go to the home page and click on the button to turn it on the button goes to pastel red but will not turn on the anti-virus software. How do I fix this?

            <p>Hi Clover,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure where you are so lets start from the beginning, check a few things, and make sure everything is done correctly. And we're going to forget upgrading and WU and install MSE fresh to remove WU and upgrade problems from the equation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE<span>.</span><span>This means not only current
 ones but any EVER (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<strong><span>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering
 with the MSE install, try a scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</span></strong></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></strong></a>.<span>Do
 not yet remove the one primary AV program you are using until you have downloaded the MSE file so you are protected while doing so then uninstall and remove that program after the download but before beginning to install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once
 done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
 and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</a>
 or<span>try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version is behind this, so you may need to focus more on the recently
 added manual procedures in the first link or those in the second link with the Mr Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it is completely removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</a>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing
 of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span> </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs - you MUST also use the removal tool - even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn't use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on more languages and versions and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running
 it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've
 found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the assisted support or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn't know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            What conditions did you apply? Did you apply them to the PivotTable or to the source data? Is it possible for you to share (say on DropBox or other sharing service) your workbook so we can all take a stab at it?

            <p>Jim, I think you&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">nailed it. Im not selection the entire column, instead Im "painting" the cells. Why? Because I need that
 the conditional format doesnt considerar the total of the column (in order to avoid a miscalculation of the&nbsp;</span>range).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows allows me to dodge this problem by choosing the "level" of the condition format (as the image below). How I can do it w/ mac??</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm using inbox rules for other purposes, but not as a replacement for Junk E-Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as i know, there is no direct replacement rule template for Junk.</p>
<p>It is possible to create separate "move to folder" rule for every sender, but this will generate hundreds of rules, no good idea.</p>

            <p>Hi Lindsey... I'm not aware of any app that provides this 'find the rest of my family' capability in the Windows Store (but I'm certainly not the expert in that domain :-)) and to be honest, I'm not sure that the GPS capabilities within the phone &amp; associated
 cell phone towers around Disney World would be able to resolve distances sufficiently if you were in the same park -- maybe, but I wouldn't count on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet (and what I've seen other families do) is for each of the adults and communications-capable children to have cell phones or walkie talkies and text/call each other when they get separated.&nbsp; Alternatively, there are many Customer Assistance
 stations throughout the park (at the entrance to rides, etc.) where family members can go if they get separated -- especially children.&nbsp; And you can agree on a specific place/time to meet up after going on separate rides, etc.</p>
<p>For the younger family members, I would keep them very close to an adult at all times -- but that's probably obvious....</p>

<h3> daniel orman  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA UserForm - Application.Sum incorrect calculation</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to place what is effectively a formula into a UserForm textbox. I've listed the formula (which can be used on a spreadsheet) and the same method for the UserForm but for some reason they return different results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spreadsheet Formula:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">=E2/F2/((B2-A2-C2)*24)+3</p>
<p>
</p><p>UserForm Code:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Total = Application.Sum(500 / 3.5 / ((170000 - 90000 - 10500) * 24) + 3)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>E2 = 500</p>
<p>F2 = 3.5</p>
<p>B2 = 17:00 hrs</p>
<p>A2 = 09:00 hrs</p>
<p>C2 = 01:05 hrs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer on the spreadsheet is correct - 23.65</p>
<p>Answer on UserForm is incorrect - 3.00</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening? I'm very confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I want to link the 3.5, 170000, etc to different text boxes which contain that data. For some reason I'm unable to get the value of each textbox and it returns either 0 or nothing. I've been using this code which should return 3.5 but it doesn't:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Me.D1_PB_A_KPI.Value = KPI</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<p>You are working with times in the formula on the worksheet and therefore you have to work with&nbsp;time values in the VBA code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>170000 is not the same as 17:00 hours</p>
<p>90000 is not the same as 9:00 hours</p>
<p>10500 is not the same as 01:05 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Application.Sum is not the&nbsp;code to use. Just perform the calculation and assign the answer to a variable like the following. You can then assign the value in the variable to the textbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: By including the seconds in the TimeValue, there is no confusion in the code as to whether it is hours and minutes or minutes and seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim dblAnswer As Double</p>
<p>
</p><p>dblAnswer = 500 / 3.5 / ((TimeValue("17:00:00") - TimeValue("09:00:00") - TimeValue("1:05:00")) * 24) + 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the worksheet formula and the VBA above return&nbsp; &nbsp;23.6540447504303</p>

    <title>Student Status Verification for Office University - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> livvyday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Student Status Verification for Office University</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm trying to download Microsoft Office 365 University for my Macbook Air - after putting the software in my basket and pressing continue it leads me onto a screen to verify my student status.</p>
<p>I've tried two methods for this - typing in my university and pressing continue to hopefully reach a stage to input my login details, but after pressing continue, it simply says "sorry, you could not be verified as a student" in red writing (i don't even
 get the chance to input my login details).</p>
<p>Secondly, I've also tried another option listed of supplying documentation - I tried uploading a letter of acceptance from my university (the same document that verified me to set up my student bank account) but I still get the same message.</p>
<p>None of the other verification methods (e.g. international student card number) doesn't apply to me, how can I fix this and verify my student status?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying so quickly.</p>
<p>However, I am not trying to log in with my e-mail details, just my university log in details (they come under separate headings on the verification screen). I know it can also not be to do with my login details as I don't even get to the screen where I can
 input them - I select my university from the drop-down list and click continue to what should presumably be a screen to input my username and password, but I get the error message before this is even reached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know that my institution is valid and can receive MS Office university as it is a main London university and other people in my year have been able to download it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately an ISIC membership card costs money to buy so I will not be able to verify my student status in this way.</p>

<h2>            IE 11 Command Line for edit,print,cut&#47;paste etc disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft had to set up new account due to last update somehow I have corrupted account they said.&nbsp; Now, I have new account but things are gone and I'm searching to them back..</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The tool bar with edit, print, cut/paste is gone.&nbsp; I can't even find where to pick a tool bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I had a line which a private service tech set up that showed my frequently used sites where he added his name...This was on the top of the screen also..how do I get that line so I can add my sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I had sticky notes on desk top.&nbsp; Where do I find these.&nbsp; I've searched but it is really not clear how to pin to task bar at bottom so I can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; The "wrench" doesn't show on upper right side of screen so anything referring to that is useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I have tried to list "trusted sites" to allow some popups as I play some games.&nbsp; I can find the space to list the sites when I use the "gear wheel" in the upper right side of the screen and I see the list which shows "popups" but I am unable to type
 anything in the space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anybody who can help me I would appreciate it.&nbsp; I've waited for live chat since I bought a package for help from Microsoft, but all I'm doing is waiting this morning and it's totally frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks....Penny</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure.&nbsp; Now more than before, though it sounds as if you weren't even using "tiling" in XP but just manual rearrangement of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting in W7 tiling is easier than ever before.&nbsp; E.g. before you needed to minimize all windows, then restore the ones you wanted the tiling operation applied to and then right-click the Taskbar to use either Horizontal or Vertical (assuming you could
 remember what either of those actually implied).&nbsp; Now that Taskbar uncertainty has been clarified by the Show side by side and&nbsp; Show stacked labels for the same functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can do what you could do before exactly the same way but now with more
 clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition W7 introduced a feature called&nbsp;Snap&nbsp; which simplified Side by Side viewing at least.&nbsp; E.g. all you need to do is drag a window through the side, notice a ghost image of it appearing as a vertical tile on that side and then dropping the drag.&nbsp;
 Doing that with another window on the other side would thus have the equivalent effect of tiling both windows vertically (horizontally?)&nbsp;without having to do anything else which would involve&nbsp;other windows or the Taskbar.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure how tiling Horizontal&nbsp;windows
 is supposed to be done, apart from the Taskbar Show stacked command.&nbsp; Doing a similar drag of a window up to the top, produces a ghost image of the window being maximized and then dropping it actually maximizes it.&nbsp; So just equivalent to double-clicking on
 the Title bar.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition,&nbsp; IE allows you to drag tabs to tear them away from windows and create new IE windows that way.&nbsp; Of course, you can still use Ctrl-N to clone a tab in a new window and use Shift-Click to launch a link in a new window.&nbsp; Standard IE multi-window
 stuff.</p>

<p>Hello Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the tips. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Our formatting is not complex, it removes the hard carriage returns and line spacing and puts everything into one long paragraph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Annoying and not a productive way of time to send emails as suggested since it does not occur every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would certainly be more proactive if the Microsoft engineers would solve the problem across the board and not have the user jump through hoops to keep the formatting. Not user friendly in the least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Donna</p>

<p>
</p><p>To make a further analysis and narrow down the possible causes for your condition, I’d like to collect more information from you:</p>

 misunderstood.</p>
<p>2. If so, since this issue does not occur every time, I suggest you&nbsp;may firstly check updates for your Outlook client to make sure it is up-to-date, and use

<h2>            Office 365 ProPlus&#47;Education for Students Aliases</h2>
                    
<p>I'm pretty confused. I tried to set up aliases on my student account, but the only way to do so was to login from the login.live.com site rather than the login.microsoftonline.com site. When I login to the "live" site, I can create aliases. However, when
 email is sent to those aliases, they only appear in the "live" inbox, and don't appear in the "microsoft online" inbox. Kind of defeats the purpose to have an alias and have to sign in to a different account to check the mail to that address. Is there a way
 to receive the "alias" emails in the "microsoft online" inbox either instead of or in addition to the "live" inbox?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom Pratt</p>

<p>Hi Thomas Pratt,</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting Office 365 community.</p>
<p>From the description, I understand that you are only able to set up email aliases on your student account via logging into login.live.com instead of login.microsoftonline.com.</p>
<p>Based on the thread title “Office 365 ProPlus/Education for Students Aliases”, I suppose that you are only assigned the Office 365 ProPlus license by the administrator of your organization. Am I right? If you don’t know about it, please involve the global
 administrator of your organization into this thread to provide the information.</p>
<p>If my assumption is right, I’d like to tell you that this is an expected behavior because Office 365 ProPlus plan doesn’t contain the Exchange Online license, the login.microsoftonline.com is for the user who are assigned the Exchange Online license. So,
 if you want to receive the “alias” emails via logging into login.microsoftonline.com, you need to be assigned the Office 365 plan which has an Exchange Online license such as Exchange Online plan 1 or plan 2.</p>
<p>If you still have anything unclear, please don’t hesitate to post back. I’m always glad to help you.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

    <title>Creating a Manning Report directly from MS Project - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating a Manning Report directly from MS Project</h2>
                    <p>Hi, there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created an MS Project Plan and added resources (Personnel Positions) to the tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to create a report directly from MS Project into Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This report should include all the needed positions and respective shifts&nbsp;with the date ranges for each individual position.<br />
(12-hr day shift, 12-hr night shift, maximum 1 shift per 24-hr day and 28 days per individual)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The date ranges should be illustrated in a format similar to that of a gant chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal for this report is to identify the individual positions needed and for which date ranges they will be needed.<br />
This will allow for input of names for each needed position in order to secure personnel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be accomplished?</p>
<p>
</p><p>See attached for an image of what I am hoping to attain.<br />
Thank you for your insight.</p>

            <p>Easily.</p>
<p>Which version of MS Project are you using?</p>
<p>Does it have all of the service packs/updates?</p>
<p>There is no need to use EXCEL.</p>
<p>The functionality that you want is already built in to MS PROJECT.</p>
<p>There is no image.</p>
<p>But you can email me trevorATperfectproject.com.au</p>
<p>By the way, Henry Gantt's name has one "n" and two "t".</p>

            <p>Pardon me for bumping in. &nbsp;A couple of options get you close:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the professional version of MS Project - take a look at the Team Planner view. &nbsp;It organizes the resources down the left and in a Gantt-like format shows the assignments for that resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Resource Usage view also shows you Resources and their assignments. &nbsp;You may add Start and Finish to the left side of the view to see details about when each assignment begins and ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with those two views and see if either gets you close.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for the note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Team Planner view and Resource Usage view got me closer.</p>
<p>However, still not exactly what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Do you know of anyway I can achieve this though MS Project Views/Reporting?</p>

            Thanks very much. I try it again with smaller pictures &nbsp;and find that&nbsp;we can't insert &nbsp;a picture larger than 770MB. I try with other applications such as PageManager, and find it is OK. So I think our Word have limitation about inserted pictures.

            For a single page, even a 770MB picture is excessively large. An A4/letter page, for example,&nbsp;would require no more than&nbsp;8 megapixels&nbsp;for photo-quality printing. A JPG file of that size would typically be 2-3MB.

&nbsp;Thanks,I know it is very big. When I insert a 200MB picture, it is OK! but 770MB is not OK! I think there may be some limitation about insert picture. I want to know the limitation.Thanks

            Given that Word 2007 has a file size limit of 512MB, I'd expect the maximum image size in any version of Word to be somewhat less than that. If you really want to find the actual limit, I'd suggest trying 256MB and, if that works, try 384MB and so on,
 halving the gap to 512MB each time (Save, close&nbsp;&amp; reopen the file between tests). When you find a size that no longer works, try half way between that and the last known workable size, and so on. Do note that the real-world limit for an individual image might
 also be affected by whatever other content the document has.

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had installed MS Office for Mac 2011 on a new Macbook Pro Retina laptop which I just bought.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The installation went fine, but when I tried to create an Account for Email Account from Tools -&gt;Account. It does not appears any window for me to enter all the Pop/IMap details. I am not able to closed Account page. I tried the Exchange and Directory
 options, they work fine. Hence, I am now not able to create any Opo3/IMAP account :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone encounter the same problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>best regards</div>

<div>if yes, add your&nbsp;Exchange account and any other accounts you have. You can delete the&nbsp;original&nbsp;Identity when you are&nbsp;satisfied you have all data that was under local folders expoted.</div>

<div>If no,&nbsp;testing in a new User will quickly tell you if the problem is system wide or if it's your User's folder that contains the problem.</div>

<h2>            Re-enable send and receive progress popup</h2>
                    <p>When&nbsp;I press the manual send and receive button (outlook 2010 / Windows 7)&nbsp;I used to get the popup appear showing progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, this now doesn't happen anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to find a way to re-enstate it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anything in help.</p>
<p>Been through send and receive settings.</p>
<p>The check box&nbsp;in the send and receive dialogue box allowing you to disable&nbsp;send and receive is unchecked.
</p>
<p>Checking it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if anyone knows the answer id appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>

            <p>When you create a Microsoft account using another email address, the Microsoft account will not receive any emails.&nbsp; All emails will still go to the other address's server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides importing emails, the only way to get emails to the Microsoft account is to add an @outlook.com alias.&nbsp; The alias will be able to receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login to your VM account and forward emails to the @outlook.com alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best if you created a new outlook.com account.&nbsp; You can add the VM account as a send/receive account.</p>
