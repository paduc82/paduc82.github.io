    <title>AutoCorrect in Word 2016 not working &#39;properly&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajs100uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            AutoCorrect in Word 2016 not working &#39;properly&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Another issue I have that is driving me nuts.&nbsp; Recently, as my word 2016 kept hanging and after advice received here,&nbsp;I had to repair my word 2016 using the 'online' option.&nbsp; What a nightmare that was - was like a whole new install - had to find my key etc,.&nbsp;
 It still does hang and I now have a new issue since the repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new issue is with autocorrect.&nbsp; Now, usually, I open a new doc, and type away.&nbsp; If I type something incorrectly the word is underlined with a red squiggly line (RSL).&nbsp; If I create a new blank doc this is still the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I open a document to edit the autocorrect is not working - no RSL.&nbsp;&nbsp;I try 'select all' select proofing language etc and it does nothing.&nbsp; The only way I have found (after hours of trial and error) to get the AC on for 'existing' documents&nbsp;is
 this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I open a doc for editing and type some rubbish in the middle of an already existing sentence ie sdfasjflafjalfj (this will&nbsp;NOT have a RSL).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I immediately open a new blank doc and type some rubbish ie sdfafasdfa (this WILL have a RSL).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I go back to the doc for editing, select all, change proofing language, and (usually on the first attempt) the RSL is under the rubbish in point 1.&nbsp; Sometimes I have to repeat this a couple of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, surely having to do this every time I open a document for editing this is not right?&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps:&nbsp; to explain further if not clear, looking at what I have just typed here, several words have a RSL.&nbsp; Say, I could save what I just typed and then open it to add/edit on my PC, the RSL would not be there but the misspelt words still would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>From the many posts on this error it looks like it is a problem with the new start menu</p>
<p>itself not releasing correctly.</p>
<p>A new version build 10145 most likely may fix this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have tried, right-click the taskbar at the bottom of the screen, click task manager</p>
<p>Click Processes tab, locate Windows Explorer and right-click and select restart.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean, how else would you shut down windows 10 as this is the proper way, and why would you bother using a CMD or CMD file for shutdown?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be a common bug in Win 10 but it needs fixing.</p>

            I got that too but what got rid of it is shutting down by Alt-F4, then choose option to shut down. I think it's just a bug...

    <title>User Account Woes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robwroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Account Woes</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a desktop system with four discs, two of which (C:\ and L:\) are SSDs and the other two are large HDDs in a RAID configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Window 10 Pro Insider Preview, which is installed on C:\ along and is a pretty full 100GB. Due to this my previous builds of Windows have been telling me to delete the old Windows files, but gave me no means of doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just had Build 14965 of Windows 10 arrive. As there was insufficient space for this to install I had it load onto a partition of L:\ and it seemed to install well. However, when it started up I again received a space warning and suggested a disc clean
 up. That yielded little and so I explored the drive contents. When doing so I saw that my main user account was over 13GB in size, although most of that was hidden and so I unticked the 'hidden' and 'archive' boxes so as to display the contents. However, when
 clicking 'okay' button, the user account promptly vanished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted to see if that would restore it but clearly the user account has been deleted. As such, on logging on the PC first displays a blank screen for a few minutes before putting up the wallpaper. It shows no shortcuts in the bar along the bottom and
 most icons, including the windows button does not work - and will not on my keyboard either. After more time some programme icons, including chrome, appear and work. However, Firefox and Thunderbird will not work, as they can't find my user account. After
 a while the shortcut icons disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sometimes access Task Manager, although that keeps hanging, but that has allowed me to confirm that windows only has the 'public' and 'default' user accounts. When I have tried to use User Account Control it hangs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, although I can log on, Windows is stuggling to find or hold onto any account settings and is falling over when I try to set up a new user account. Any suggestion would be very gratefully received. Thanks</p>

            You may need to do a "clean" install of the OS as less than 20% free space on the OS drive can cause issues and you have removed other drives, if you have another spare drive do a clean install on it to test the system, as it will auto activate your system.&nbsp;

<h2>            Excel Menu of pinned files when 1st opened</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">This might be a trivial problem to some, but to me (physically disabled and frustrated when things don't work for me the way I want them) it is quite important.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentStandard">When I click on the Excel 2016 icon in the taskbar, I get a list of the 10 files that I have pinned to the menu. Until recently, the menu read:</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Excel (large)</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Pinned (medium)</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Then the 10 files are listed, strictly in alphabetical order (which is how I want them, as I know then where they are).</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But now the menu reads:</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Excel (large)</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Recent (medium)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Pinned (standard size)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">But now the files are listed in order of the most recent used first, all the way down to the 10th file that was opened the longest time ago (which is NOT how I want it).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

            <p>I am afraid you would have to unpin and pin Excel to the Taskbar and add the most frequently used Excel files to the jump list again. Here is what you should be doing:</p>

</p><p>Unpin Excel 2016 shortcut from taskbar - &gt; Repair Office 2016 -&gt; Restart -&gt; Add Excel 2016 shortcut to Taskbar -&gt; Pin your the most frequently used Excel files to the jump list. This would suffice.</p>

            <p>I tried this but it didn't change anything. As soon as I pinned the required files to the quick start menu in Excel, even though I entered them in alphabetical order, they rearranged to the order of most recently used at the top down to the one that was
 last used furthest back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to me to be the word RECENT. It never used to be there and I simply had the large word EXCEL and underneath the word PINNED. But now I have RECENT in between them. So I need a solution to getting rid of RECENT. I have tried both left and
 right clicking on it but nothing happens. I have right clicked the Excel icon, but there is nothing that cures the problem. Could it be in the registry somewhere? I don't know, but hopefully someone does.</p>

            Sounds like you need to contact your local Nokia Care center. Sounds like it might be a hardware related issue. You might also want to contact your carrier to see if a SIM replacement helps.

    <title>OneDrive for Business says it&#39;s syncing, but it isn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason.clishe  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business says it&#39;s syncing, but it isn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>Device is a Surface Book running Windows 10 1607 and Office 365 Pro Plus installed locally, OneDrive next gen sync client 17.3.6688.1030.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I acquired the Surface Book in roughly March of this year. At that time, I installed Office and the OneDrive next gen sync client and began syncing both my personal OneDrive as well as my OneDrive for Business. It's been working fine ever since, until recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago I booted up Windows and received an error that OneDrive for Business crashed. When I launch File Explorer I see shortcuts for both OneDrive - Work and OneDrive - Personal in the left hand Navigation Pane, just like always. But ever since
 that day that OneDrive for Business crashed, my "synced" OneDrive for Business files no longer have the green checkmark badge to indicate that they're synced (But my OneDrive - Personal files still do have the green checkmark badge). It's as if OneDrive for
 Business simply stopped sync'ing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I right-click the OneDrive icon in the tray and go to Settings | Accounts, my OneDrive - Personal account is the only one listed. So I click Add an account, enter my Office 365 Corp ID, and it says "You're already syncing this account".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it seems like I'm in limbo. My OneDrive for Business files aren't syncing and that account isn't listed in the next gen sync client account list, but when I attempt to add it, the OneDrive sync client tells me I'm already syncing that account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I proceed? Is there any way to refresh or reset the sync client?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jason,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the new sync client, if you sync both consumer OneDrive and OneDrive for Business, there should be two sync client icons: a white one for consumer OneDrive and a blue
 one for OneDrive for Business. Please check if you can see the blue one, we check our work/school account with this icon.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To reset OneDrive, you can refer to Reset OneDrive section in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-sync-problems-83ab0d8a-8400-45b0-8dcf-dc8aa8a6bcf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>, and then see if there are some improvements. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may capture a screenshot of the task bar, we want to know how many sync client icons there are. Meanwhile, do you install other sync clients
 on your device (e.g. Dropbox)? Do you use the legacy sync client from Office 365 ProPlus to sync SharePoint Online team site libraries?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>

<p>Are you sure that messages can be read offline (while the phone is not connected to the computer)? I´m not so sure to be honest. I think all you can do is back them up with the Content Copier and restore them on a phone again. :)</p>

<p>no i am not sure but you should be able to see them once a back up has been created. i don't use pc suite for that i use zyb and syble to sync all my important stuff as well as ovi. i am not sure that ovi is compatible with your phone go to the ovi site.
 in ovi you can actually look up your contacts and stuff for sure. i am not sure about the text messages but contacts yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now there is no direct support for your phone as i can see, but you can also use a close alternate if there is any and it should work as well. until my n85 became supported i used it for n96. now this is not bulletproof as some users have reported that stuff
 went missing from their ovi sync.</p>

            yes you should be able to save the text messages through your pc suite, i am not certain if you will be able to read them on your pc that is my only ? when it comes to this. other than that you can select the data that you would like to back up and keep.
 this should be no problem.&nbsp;

<p>m8,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Text messages in symbian phones are in database format, the same&nbsp;way as the email in outlook/outlook express, &nbsp;only the application itself can open &amp; read it. AFAIK, there is no PC application that can open such file(read it)&nbsp;even it you've save it in the
 PC. Backup is the only way to go(&nbsp;&amp; what radical did for his)&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp; only the symbian os(built-in editor)&nbsp;can read it afterwards by phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the old days of monochrome phone(3210 era), there is an 3rd party connectivity&nbsp;application(for installing ringtones etc)&nbsp;forgot the name&nbsp;that can read it afterwards even if the phone is not connected, one can even change the logo of the provider. Todate
 I don't know since pcsuite is free, why use a 3rd party connectivity solutions.</p>

            I've just use backup &amp; restore when I do upgrade phones(7 total) much easy now since the new version of pcsuite support backup/restore to a different models. Just download a version that supports the N70 &amp; the phone your planning to buy.

    <title>Assigning keyboard commands for special characters does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nijolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assigning keyboard commands for special characters does not work</h2>
                    <p>Ever since buying Office 2016 for Mac, I have not been able to successfully assign keyboard shortcuts for special characters in Word. To be clear, what I want to do is assign keyboard commands in Word so that no matter the style (normal, body texte, bullet
 lists, etc.) I am writing in, these commands work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MANY different problems occur when I try to do this.</p>
<p>1. I am able to assign them, saving to the Normal.dotm template, but then Word crashes while I am doing so and all commands are lost</p>
<p>2. I am able to assign them, but then the next time I open Word the Normal.dotm template cannot be accessed, and all manner of error messages come up</p>
<p>3. When I try to assign them, the Normal.dotm template does not show up as an option, so I cannot save them.</p>
<p>4. Constant error messages about "Word cannot open the existing template"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, to avoid crashing and constant error messages, the only thing I can do then is to delete the normal templates and use the cumbersome key commands via Mac OS (which involves pressing a key for several seconds, then a second keystroke to choose
 from various options - please note: I am NOT asking for help with these Mac OS commands. I do NOT want to use them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an extreme inconvenience for me and a major bug in Word 2016. I have been troubleshooting this for many months to no avail. I would like Microsoft to answer for itself and provide a reliable fix. Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

<p>The samy issue, windows button did work (i could see start metro style menu) , but now when I tap windows button &nbsp;I &nbsp;can feel only vibration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue, screen goes blank in standby the only way to see anything again on screen is to power down by power button and power up again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are only two devices with Windows RT: Nokia 2520 and Ms Surface 2 RTand neither Nokia nor Microsoft can fix that, I am not the only one... anybody from MS/Nokia reads this ?</p>

<p>I've had my 2520 for several months now with no issues. &nbsp;Recently however, I started experiencing the same problem where the Windows button just vibrates but doesn't take me back to the start screen. &nbsp;I have tried the easy fixes and am still seeing the problem.
 &nbsp;I don't have a problem with any other buttons, just the Windows button. &nbsp;Is there anything additional I can try to fix this? &nbsp;It's quite frustrating.</p>

<p>I had the same problem so I sent it for repair. It came back saying they didn't find the problem, but it worked again. Now the problem came back. Also sometimes the button presses itself, means the tablet vibrates and changes to home screen even without
 me touching it... Is there any solution? The tablet really gets unusable with that and I don't feel like sending it to repair every other month. Thanks for any response!</p>

            I was having the same issue. Turned out that I had "sticky keys" on by accident. Turning that off fixed it. Search for the work sticky in system settings and turn off what they call Filter Keys. That might help.

 email addresses have disappeared. This is incredibly frustrating as this has never happened in the 15+ years I have had this account.</p>

<h2>            Why are quotation marks being added to the Criteria field in Microsoft Access 2007&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Quotation marks keep automatically being added to the words I put in the Criteria fields. I have tried to remove them but it just comes up with the message 'Data type mismatch in the criteria fields'. I have seen some posts about this but everyone seems
 to be saying it's because either u can only add numericals or only 'Yes/No' in those fields. Well that makes no sense to me, ye I'm only just learning about this stuff but here's an example of what I'm trying to do.</p>

            The rules as regards delimiters for literal values of the different data types are as follows:<br />
<br />
Text:&nbsp; The values must be enclosed in single or double quotes characters 'like this' or "like this". &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Number or Currency:&nbsp; No delimiters are required.&nbsp; With currency values the currency symbol should be omitted.&nbsp; The Currency data type is really a number data type whose value is stored to a precision of four decimal places to avoid rounding errors.<br />
<br />
Boolean (Yes/No):&nbsp;&nbsp; No delimiters are required.&nbsp; The values are usually entered as the Boolean constants TRUE or FALSE.&nbsp; Under the skin Access actually stores these values as -1 or 0.<br />
<br />
DateTime:&nbsp; The delimiter is the # sign, and the value must either be in US short date format, mm/dd/yyyy, e.g. #25/03/2018# or an otherwise internationally unambiguous format such as the ISO standard&nbsp; of YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. #2018-03-25#.&nbsp; Under the skin date/time
 values are stored as a 64 bit floating point number, with zero representing 30 December 1899 00:00:00.<br />
<br />
As regards the problem you are having with your query, can you please copy and paste the query's full SQL statement into a reply here.&nbsp; In query design view, switch to SQL view to see the statement.<br />

            As written, that query assumes that the Cost column (field) is a currency data type, and the other columns are all of text data type.&nbsp; However, one possibility is that, when building the table you used the 'lookup field' wizard when assigning the data
 type of one or more of the columns.&nbsp; If so the actual values in the columns won't be the text values which you see, but will be numeric foreign key values referencing the numeric (usually an autonumber) primary key of another table.<br />
<br />
This sort of confusion is one reason why most experienced Access developers recommend that the 'lookup field' wizard be avoided like the plague.&nbsp; For reasons why see
<a href="http://theaccessweb.com/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://theaccessweb.com/lookupfields.htm&nbsp; </a>If this is the case what you need to do is join the table to the referenced&nbsp; table(s) in the query.&nbsp; Let's take a simple example in which the wizard was used when creating the Location column, and assume we want
 to return all rows from the table where the location is Malaga.&nbsp; The referenced&nbsp; table might be called Locations or something similar, so the query would be like this:<br />
<br />
SELECT Table1.*<br />
FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Locations<br />
ON Table1.Location = Locations.LocationID<br />
WHERE Location.Location = "Malaga";<br />
<br />
In this Location is the foreign key column in Table1, LocationID is the primary key of Locations and Location is a text column in Locations in which the actual location names are stored.&nbsp; You can of course design this query easily in query design view, rather
 than writing the SQL.<br />

<p>ty very much for ur indepth reply. I don't know if I mentioned it before but I'm using Access 2007. As for which type of query I selected I DEFINATELLY used 'Query Design' ONLY. I did not use 'Query Wizard' at all. Today I have seen my tutor though and she
 showed me that when creating my table in 'Design View' I seemed to have 'Primary Key' active in the blue area of the 'Field Name' to the left of my column labeled 'Holiday Number'. However when I click 'Run' the fields in the columns are blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE!: Did it again then it worked. Tried it again didn't work. no clue whats going on. I give up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ty for your time</p>

I didn't say anything about the 'query wizard'.&nbsp; What I was referring to is the 'lookup field' wizard, which is used when setting the data type of a column in table design view.&nbsp; This is what the link I posted refers to.&nbsp; If you and your tutor have not had&nbsp;
 a look at that link, I would strongly advise it.<br />

            Well, it seems they've removed all photo and video importing wizards from Windows 10, and I don't know if it's on purpose or not. &nbsp;It's really frustrating--and I'm on the new Build 10158 and it's about a month away from them releasing their final version
 and the basic functionality is still not there. &nbsp;If this is how the final build is going to be, I don't know how they honestly expect people to switch to Windows 10. &nbsp;Photo and video importing is a basic necessary function in an operating system--it seems
 strange of them to remove that kind of basic option.

            I guess specifically for smartphones, they've added a "Phone Companion" option in Build 10158 for when you plug in your phone. &nbsp;This doesn't help people who have professional cameras.

</p><p>I have been getting this same error every time I click the "MY WATCHLIST" link while signed in with my microsoft ID on MSN.com. (Started a week or so ago.)</p>
<p>It does not matter what computer, what OS version, what browser, or what domain I am logged onto (Work, Home, public private,etc.) It seems as though that functionality stored with my microsoft ID out there in the cloud somewhere is corrupt and I cant find
 where to go to edit it. </p>
<p>Is there some way to delete the old WATCHLIST and re-enter it? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I replied to the private msg from Babu V on July 7 and have not gotten a response as of July 14 when I saw this marked as answered. I just checked that private thread and&nbsp;no response there.</p>
<p>I also just logged into and confirmed the problem still exists. It does.</p>
<p>One new piece of info is I loaded the msn money app on my android phone, logged in with the problematic user ID, and was able to see my watchlist. (On the reply to Babu V I also indicated that I created a second user id which shows watchlist without issue
 on browsers as well.) The problem has to be somewhere in the user profile but how do I get someone at MS to take a look at it.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Is there any way to truly get this escalated to someone that can look at the user id. I respectfully submit that this is beyond what you can see. How do I get some help here?</p>
<p>Its answers.Microsoft.com for goodness sake. Is there no one that it can be escalated to that will reply? If the answer is, "Just quit using the Microsoft ID you've had for 20+ years and make up a new one" just say so. If the answer is "get paid support
 for $100 at XXXXXXXX" just say so. Is Babu V a ms person or what? </p>

<h2>            VBA - Check user permissions on folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got an excel macro that will be saving a worksheet as a PDF. It will save the PDF into a specific location. That part is fine, however, I'd like to test to see if the user in question has access to that folder in a Boolean method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do that? I don't want to use a Function because I'm only going to be checking for this one procedure. I just need something clean and simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If the user has access to the folder then it will mark "UserApproved" Boolean as True. If not, it will mark it as False.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            It's tough to get only that information, but a simple and clean way (and all programmers around the world do that) is to install an error handler.
<br />
<br />So if anything went wrong (invalid filename, access denied, disk full, disk write error, whatever), the code jumps to the error handler label and you can show a message, try again, whatever...
<br />
<br />Below is a sample code how to use an error handler.
<br />Don't run it! Debug it step by step and see what happens.
<br />
<br />Andreas.
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Option Explicit
Sub Example_ErrorHandler()
  On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
  Err.Raise 1, "Example_ErrorHandler", "Error description"
  
  Example_SubErrorHandler
  Application.EnableCancelKey = xlErrorHandler
  Do
    DoEvents
  Loop Until False
  Exit Sub
ErrorHandler:
  If Err.Source = "" Then Err.Source = Application.Name
  Debug.Print "Source     : " &amp; Err.Source
  Debug.Print "Error      : " &amp; Err.Number
  Debug.Print "Description: " &amp; Err.Description
  If MsgBox("Error " &amp; Err.Number &amp; ": " &amp; vbNewLine &amp; vbNewLine &amp; _
      Err.Description &amp; vbNewLine &amp; vbNewLine &amp; _
      "Enter debug mode?", vbOKCancel + vbDefaultButton2, Err.Source) = vbOK Then
    Stop 'Press F8 twice
    Resume
  End If
End Sub
Sub Example_SubErrorHandler()
  'Install a 2nd error handler
  On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
  'Something goes wrong:
  Debug.Print 1 / 0
ExitPoint:
  'Usual finish
  Exit Sub
ErrorHandler:
  Select Case Err.Number
    Case 123
      'We handle this error here
      Resume ExitPoint
    Case Else
      'Call the upper error handler with this error
      RaiseError ErrSource:="Example_SubErrorHandler"
  End Select
  Stop
End Sub
Sub RaiseError(Optional ByVal ErrNumber, Optional ByVal ErrSource, Optional ByVal ErrDescription, Optional ByVal ErrHelpFile, Optional ByVal ErrHelpContext)
  'Save the current error
  With Err
    If IsMissing(ErrNumber) Then ErrNumber = .Number
    If IsMissing(ErrSource) Then ErrSource = .Source
    If IsMissing(ErrDescription) Then ErrDescription = .Description
    If IsMissing(ErrHelpFile) Then ErrHelpFile = .HelpFile
    If IsMissing(ErrHelpContext) Then ErrHelpContext = .HelpContext
  End With
  'One level up (this clears the error object!)
  On Error GoTo 0
  'Raise it again
  Err.Raise ErrNumber, ErrSource, ErrDescription, ErrHelpFile, ErrHelpContext
End Sub</code></pre>

<p>I need to run a check before I go to save a file. This is integrated into a UserForm and the worse thing to happen would be to fill out all the relative information to then find that it's not possible to save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like the check to take place before I show the userform, that way if they don't have access to the relative folder then they can request it and come back to that part of the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            It doesn't matter where your code runs, an error handler works everywhere.
<br />
<br />If you don't like to perform the usual save, you can use VBA and create e.g. a simple text file in that directory to see if that works.... IMHO superfluous.
<br />
<br />Because even if you can create such a file: It is possible that the creation of the PDF file fails! Therefore, you must use an error handler, otherwise it is always possible you get a crash.
<br />
<br />Believe me, it's really hard to get the permissions of a user in a windows system, you need tons of API code and have to dive deep into the system... senseless.
<br />It is possible that a user don't have the permission to detect their own permissions.
<br />
<br />An error handler is really simple and easy to apply.
<br />
<br />Andreas.
