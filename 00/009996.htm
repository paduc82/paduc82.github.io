                    So how do you complain to Microsoft or do they think we don't have rights. Office 365 is an expensive program and to lose your emails&nbsp; and client seems&nbsp; a bit of a con to me.

            <p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unfortunately cannot tell you where to complain, but can you open Outlook in safe mode?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this via <strong>Windows-Key+R &gt; outlook /safe </strong>(please note there's a whitespace after outlook)<strong> &gt; OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Outlook open now?</p>

<p>Hi Mwandembo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would check to insure you have the latest version of Network+ settings app. This replaces the old calls+sms settings app. You can check with an app called LUMIA Pusher, availble in the Windows Phone Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!<br />

    <title>Removing Modern&#47;Metro&#47;Universal&#47;Windows Apps from Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan-at_work  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing Modern&#47;Metro&#47;Universal&#47;Windows Apps from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm looking for a good way to remove Modern/Metro/Universal/Windows Apps from Windows 10. In Windows 7 and below, there was this thing in Control Panel where you could "Turn Windows features on/off". You could get rid of things like Internet Games, Internet
 Printing, Games in general, etc., etc., etc. Whatever you didn't want, you could get rid of it with a simple click of the mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted, by the time Windows 7 rolled around the options to remove were fewer, but at least it was an option. Where's that option with Windows 10? And yes, the Control Panel in W10 still has that option, but it doesn't have an option to remove all of those
 **** apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are options to use PowerShell, but I'm a Systems Engineer. I'm not a developer and have no desire to be one. I have nothing against developers, it's just not my thing. It takes a different mindset to be a developer or an engineer. Kind of like some
 developers may be better in C++ and others may prefer Java. I prefer to take an OS or software package that a vendor provides, and make them fit our environment. You know, remove all of the excess stuff they are required to put in packages/OSs nowadays. For
 example, I remove all languages that are not needed in our enterprise, or lock down the app because we don't want to put our life story out in the cloud, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with PowerShell and all of those scripts is that those particular scripts require a lot of typing, or copy and paste, or having to figure out where all of those apps are stored and then insert their convoluted names&nbsp;into the script. For me, scripting
 is like programming. I have no desire to be a programmer/developer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want an option in Programs and Features to be able to turn these "features" off. We were able to do it in previous versions of Windows. If we didn't want Internet Games, we uncheck the box. If we don't want our users to be able to print documents
 over the Internet, we uncheck the box. And so on down the line for any other "feature" we didn't want our enterprise users to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, we could turn those features off using the System Image Manager. Now we have to write some convoluted script with even more convoluted commands for even more convoluted names for things we don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easier script in Windows 8.x was just "get-appxpackages -online | remove-appxpackages". That removed the majority of the apps for an individual user. The "remove-appxprovisionedpackage" command, with the convoluted name of the app, would remove them
 from the hard drive - one app at a time, but that doesn't work in Windows 10. At least I haven't found the right command to do it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, they also came up with a DISM command, but that doesn't work in Windows 10 either. I should say that with my limited developer skills I haven't found a way to make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I have no desire to be a developer/scripter. They are the same thing in my book. I'm a systems engineer. I do operating systems and re-package applications. I don't write applications.</p>

            So no one knows how to get rid of all Metro/Modern/Universal/Windows apps for enterprises? What a shame. I'd hate to go the route of IBM and move to Linux, or worse yet - Crapple.

<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought this great set Nokia E72. Almost everything is cool but there is an issue which is bothering me a lot. Around 3 out of 10 times when I receive an incoming call, the screen hangs on "ABC Calling" Status, and keypad goes dead.</p>
<p>I have upgraded my phone to the latest firmware but couldnt fix this problem. Restarted my phone. Uninstalled all the softwares (additional ones), did factory default. Anybody has any idea why is this happening. Looking forward for your help guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try the soft reset and a reformat of the memcard. This might clear up some glitches.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Minh Pham Cong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if the sender uses a font that you don't have yet on your outlook desktop app. For us to have a better understanding of your concern, we’d like to know more details
 about your issue. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can try to ask the sender to send you a test email and check if the same issue will occur. You may also check the message through
<a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.com</a> to see if you will see the same text/characters.</p>

<p>Hi Peng,<br />
<br />
We have encountered the same error before, and it occurs when another user opens or edits a file stored in the same folder.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the link below for more information:<br />
Error renaming folder within Sharepoint Document Library.<br />
<br />
Please make sure that no one is accessing the folder, and then try to rename your folder again.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, or if you are encountering a different problem, we would like to ask some questions to narrow down the issue:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are there any files inside the folder? If so, are any of them encrypted?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you able to rename other folders inside the document library?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you able to move the files inside the folder? If so, can you please move the files inside to another folder, and try renaming the new folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Sheen</p>

                    <p>I have Nokia Lumia 73 0 and from yesterday&nbsp;not even a single application is working properly.</p>
<p>1.My phone may be automatically &nbsp;updated ..</p>
<p>2.The preloaded aren't working either. I did not do &nbsp;a hard reset and downloaded a completely new app. But that new app is also not working.</p>
<p>3.I uninstalled all the same apps again and did a hard reset again. And downloaded a new app. But... same problem.</p>
<p>4. WhatsApp, OneDrive, Music Player,Video,etc. aren't working (after two hard resets)</p>

<h2>            Why isn&#39;t their a simple highlight straight tool&#63;</h2>
                    An no, the line tool isn't sufficient. &nbsp;The resolution is so low that I am always highlighting the bottom or top of my line, not the whole thing. &nbsp;
<div>Suggestion being: Holding ctrl makes it go straight? </div>
<div>Is there something obvious I am missing?</div>

            No - Pressing shift de-selects highlight tool. &nbsp;It'd be&nbsp;beneficial&nbsp;to have a single tool capable of either "non-straight" and straight highlighting.

            <p>1. In the "Draw" tab - go to the "Insert Shape" section.</p>
<p>2. Click on "Color and Thickness", select "Highlighter" and then an appropriate thickness.</p>
<p>3. Select the&nbsp;<em>Straight Line</em> tool from the "Insert Shapes" section.</p>
<p>

<p>I guessed that I might have a partial install of some office product so uninstalled all and reinstalled - still&nbsp;got same&nbsp;error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that this meant I had some corruption in a registry somewhere - but no registry cleaners had any effect whatsoever.</p>
<p>In the end I had to restore my system image back to the original and then the install completed without fault.</p>

    <title>How to Apply Formula&#39;s to Drop Down Menu Selections - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Apply Formula&#39;s to Drop Down Menu Selections</h2>
                    Hey all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I run a youtube channel with three different people, and we have to split the earnings based on how much our videos make. So if one of my videos makes $5, I get that $5 since it's my video. We see that to be fair as oppose to splitting it 3 ways regardless
 of whose video makes what.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have almost 1,000 videos, so it's a pain in the butt to go through and figure out who gets what. So I decided to make an excel sheet where I can just copy and paste the name of the videos in one column, the money it made in the next, and a drop down
 menu next to that to select whose video it is.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I would like to do is have a formula that changes based on what name(s) I select. So if I select "Player 1", it will add the sum of the money made for that video to a cell that is for Player 1's pay, etc. Also, if there is a video with more than one
 player, like 2 or 3, then another formula will make it so it will split it between the 2 or 3 players for their respective cells. So if I select from the drop down "Player 1 and Player 2", it will split that evenly and be summed up in their respective cells.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked everywhere online and I can't seem to find any formula to make this work. All I keep finding is how to make more drop down menus from other drop down menus. Does anyone know a way to make this work, or know another method?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should also mention with our network we get a 80/20 split (we get the 80%), so that is a factor in the formula.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I didn't explain it properly, I can provide a picture once I return to the office.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>
                </div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>the table in the first three columns is an excellent starting point. You don't need to pre-fill empty rows, though. Delete the empty rows, then click any cell in the first column and click Insert &gt; Table. Now Excel will automatically put the drop-down
 in column C into any new row that you add to the table.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can then use this data to create a pivot table. In my screenshots I have used this data:</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2fdf57f-f6a4-4f21-a845-55a38d51c66b" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click any cell in the data table and then Insert &gt; Pivot Table&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</li><li>In the dialog, select "Existing Worksheet", click in the Location field and then click cell F3. Then hit OK. (By selecting cell F3 the pivot table will have the same location as in my screenshot)<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e561d7cd-6cd7-49d7-9c29-4d9f2bf52a1d" /><br />
<br />
</li><li>In the Pivot Table panel on the right, drag "Who" to the Row Labels and "Earnings" to the Values. This will result in a pivot table like this:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e249557b-00fa-44fb-a0fa-fd86b1323c96" /></li></ol>
<div>The row labels will show all the values that are in the "Who" column and the Sum of Earnings will show the total for that person or group. Next you need to work out what each individual person has earned.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For Casey you need to add the values for Casey, half of the values for Casey+Elsie and Casey+Rob and a third of the value in "Everyone". Also, since the network takes a 20% cut, Casey will get 80% of that. The formula looks like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6ce06508-411d-4aa3-9975-8978b34ba67f" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>=(G4+(G5/2)+(G6/2)+(G8/3))*0.8</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, take Casey's value in cell G4, add to that half of the value in Casey+Elsie in G5, add to that half of the value in Casey+Rob in G6, add to that a third of the value for Everyone in G8. Multiply that total by 0.8 to return 80% only.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In a similar way, calculate the earnings for Elsie and Rob. The formula for the Network takes the Grand total in cell G11 and calculates 20% of that by multiplying with 0.2</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a check, create a sum of the Pay table. It should return the same value as the pivot table grand total.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if this works for you.</div>

<p>Hi Axxys,</p>
<p>I'm afraid there is no other choice from the online side. Perhaps, you can backup the items by exporting them into PST files as a workaround.&nbsp;See:

            The only difference i can find is the version of word. The one that works has Word 2010 and the one that doesn't is Microsoft Office Word 365&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>ProPlus. The document is located on a

            <p>When there are no obvious differences between the computers, it is very difficult to find the underlying cause. Ensure that you have updated Windows, Office and your browser.

            <p>It seems that Google Chrome is Update. Though i have 20 optional updates waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Silver Light</p>
<p>1 Windows 8.1 Driver&nbsp;</p>
<p>18 Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what i don't understand is that. One of my co-students whom I'm working with, can open the same document on his Word which we both got from our school. Does this not indicate that there is something wrong with my word?</p>

    <title>Side-by-side installation for release version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuck heatherly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Side-by-side installation for release version</h2>
                    I see from the initial post about Office 2016 Preview that it does not allow side-by-side installation with a previous version of Office. Will this requirement be lifted for the release version? I know side-by-side isn't officially supported, but I'm a
 software tester with a MSDN Premium subscription and have automated tests for many past versions of Excel for compatibility with my company's BI products. Officially supported is one thing, but for the installer to disallow side-by-side is another entirely.
 All past versions use the same COM coclasses, so what is the reason for disallowing side-by-side?<br />

            <p>Yeah, thats because Pro Plus 2013 is available as an MSI, but this Office 2016 is only provided as a Click To Run, there is no offline MSI or ISO you can mount and install like older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that requirement is just for the preview and will change closer launch. I notice its not MSDN either.</p>
