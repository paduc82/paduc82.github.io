                    <p>Original title: How do I know which program to open a .cpl file with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;one of the files&nbsp;(.cpl)&nbsp;on my computer is opening with Java Oracle which has nothing to do with the file. It is like opening an MP3 file using Microsoft Word. It doesn't even recognize it. I see how you change the program you want it to open
 with, but I don't know which program to use. What do I do?</p>

            <p>Hi JonathanOakes, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1. Which file are you referring to?</div>
<div>2. What exacty are the programs that you are unable to access apart from Control Panel?</div>
<div>3. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?<br />
<br />
Some of the components of the Control Panel are special system folders but many are determined by a group of files with the extension CPL. I suggest that you try to access the source files of the control panel tools using the .cpl from the control panel and
 then try to associate the files.<br />
<br />
Here are the commands to access the tools using command prompt.</div>
<div><br />
appwiz.cpl - Add/Remove Programs<br />
nusrmgr.cpl- User accounts<br />
<br />
Try to access the tools using the command from either command prompt or Start- &gt;Run.<br />
<br />
Refer the following methods:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>You may also scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of virus, spyware, and other malicious software.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires after 10 days from the date of installation.</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>If you are able to access the User accounts using the files, I suggest that you create a
<strong>new user account </strong>and check if still have the issue.<br />
<br />
Here is an article that will give you information on how to fix a corrupted user account:<br />

<br />
<br />
You can also go to Programs using the command.<br />
<br />
Try to create file associations from Default programs. Here is an article that will give you information on creating file associations:<br />

            Thanks for the reply!
<div><br />
<div>So I watched the video on changing default programs and it all makes sense accept for one thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The ".cpl" files that I am trying to open will not open with command prompt because I do not know which program to choose it to open with? Which program should I choose to open a ".cpl" file with?</div>
<div><br />
<div>The file that I am trying to open is "sysdm.cpl"</div>
<div><br />
<div>It currently opens with notepad and comes up as a code of scrambled numbers, letters and symbols. Which program would I open this ".cpl" file with?</div>
<div><br />
<div>CPL files are the only ones I seem to be having trouble opening. My computer has not had any changes or anything happen to it so I do not understand why this is&nbsp;happening.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, another program that will not open is the Date and Time Settings. If I go into control panel, I can open them. However, if I try to use the shortcut link from the clock gadget on the bottom right-hand of the toolbar, the Date and Time Settings open
 with Java Oracle. I am not sure if this is also a ".cpl" file, but it is an example of another program I cannot open/do not know what the right program to open it with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any more suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi JonathanOakes, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Did you try the methods mentioned in my previous post?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After trying the methods mentioned mentioned in my previous post try these steps:</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Fix broken desktop shortcuts and common system maintenance tasks </strong>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/system_maintenance_for_windows/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/system_maintenance_for_windows/en-us</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>1. Click on <strong>start</strong>, type <strong>run </strong>in the start search field.</div>
<div>2. Enter <strong>sysdm.cpl </strong>in the run window and hit enter.</div>
<div>3. Check if you can open the <strong>System properties window</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please reply after performing the methods mentioned so that we can provide some more steps.</div>

            I did try both methods.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The scan did not fix it, and when I tried creating a new user, the new user account would crash when I logged onto it. However, I have just wiped my hard drive by&nbsp;re-installing Windows 7 and all the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;drivers and that seems to have fixed everything.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, thanks for your help! &nbsp;</div>

            <p>BCC Code 116 is usually a video driver problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find what to do by reading this wiki article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/bcc116-bcc117-your-video-driver-has-stopped/fba02c53-7796-4166-83a2-9c44865c13af">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/bcc116-bcc117-your-video-driver-has-stopped/fba02c53-7796-4166-83a2-9c44865c13af</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't figure it out from there you need to provide some more information (some you did) and make a few adjustments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the search box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configure your system so when there is a crash it generates a crash dump file instead of restarting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Desktop right click Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings and make it look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1846c190-a123-4853-a2b2-6cc724851ae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e571e144-0134-446c-a3b5-27acb92d5c7a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to create the Minidump folder as Window will create one if it needs to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click OK enough times to close all the dialog boxes and restart your system for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; After rebooting you can go back and check the settings again to be sure the adjustments "stick".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you accumulate a few (about 3) crash dumps this wiki article has a section that tells you how to upload them so we can take a look at them with the Windows Debugging tools:</p>

            <p>Another cause of BCC Code 116 crashes is overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This usually happens during video intensive things like playing games or watching videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes there is no warning - the system just shuts down and it might not restart right away until it has a chance to cool off a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any of that sound familiar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you say there is anything in particular you do to make the system crash and if so what would that be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a free program you can use to monitor your system temps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you download the free version of Speccy you can see what your temperatures are and also monitor them while you are performing video intensive things that might cause a BSOD:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.piriform.com/speccy</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can uninstall Speccy later if you don't like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Speccy is running temperatures in green are good and temperatures in red would be bad (in this example everything is green=good - red=bad):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a69242ae-4dca-4421-af8e-e708107c5b31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a69242ae-4dca-4421-af8e-e708107c5b31" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you minimize Speccy to the system tray the average temperature will still be displayed next to the system clock so you can keep an eye on it and if it gets into the red, you have a thermal problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e235079a-a679-4200-a7db-52b7eb0e19ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e235079a-a679-4200-a7db-52b7eb0e19ae" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can reproduce the BSOD while Speccy is running and showing the temperature of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is any temperature getting into the red?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep an eye on the temperature while you are doing whatever you do that causes the BSOD.

            <p>Hi Kris,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for your suggestion. I did update some of the software recently and tried to uninstall &amp; reinstall back the software that I'm using. After doing what you &amp; ElderN had suggested, I did not turn on the PC for almost 2 days and since then my PC has
 not crashed yet (hope the problem doesn't reoccur again). I think the main problem was the video driver had overheated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Once again....thank you for the help.</p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I followed your suggestion and I think you are right about the video driver being overheated. Although I do not play games on this PC but does watching video on youtube can possibly make the video driver overheated? Anyway thank you very much for the
 help &amp; I hope the problem does not reoccur again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>In my first reply I requested additional information and you have chosen not to provide the requested information but maybe things are running better now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that watching videos on YouTube and cause an overheating problem - anything that is video intensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my second reply I demonstrate how to use the free version of Speccy to monitor the system temperatures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of wondering if the problem might be a thermal (heat) problem Speccy will tell you for sure so I suggest you download it, run it and see what the temps are when the system is mostly idle...&nbsp; then perform a video intensive operation like watching
 a YouTube video and you can see if the temps get into the red (red temps are bad) or if the system crashes.</p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought my PC is going good but after a few days of non-crash operation...my PC suffered the same problem again!! As suggested by you, I've installed Speccy to monitor the temperature. However, the display temperature did not even go more than 75 degress
 celcius even when I watch youtube video. Below are the additional information as requested by you on your earlier post.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You have no crash dumps to upload following the previously posted directions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the error is 116 I suspect video drivers but the crash dumps will help pinpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system has an ATI Radeon HD5570 video device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First open Device Manager and write down the video driver version you have now (that is the suspicious one):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cb13ebc-5f8d-422d-98d3-35ec8d63564b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cb13ebc-5f8d-422d-98d3-35ec8d63564b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If/when you update the video driver and restart your system go back to Device Manager and make sure the version has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if after updating the video driver if things are worse you can choose to roll back to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would start by getting the drivers from the Acer support site but you need to know your serial number or SNID:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/ID/content/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.acer.com/ac/en/ID/content/support</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You could go to AMD site and use the Automatic detection program which is here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a></p>
<p><br />
Start with the driver that Acer suggests.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Video Player rewind&#47;fast forward shortcut&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone figured out shortcuts to fast forward/rewind on Win10 video player? I noticed you can use the left/right arrow key to jump forward/backward by 30 seconds. The problem I run into is that the control/seek bar then doesnt disappear after you are
 done seeking unless you go back into full screen view or double click on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 was better as it only moved the video by 15 seconds and didnt run into the seek bar staying in view when you moused out.&nbsp;</p>

            It seems the only way to make this work is to press the tab key (or shift+tab) until the seek bar is highlighted, then use the arrow keys to move forward/backward 30 seconds, then press ESC key to make the highlighted seek bar disappear.<br />

<h2>            Skype calls to GSM in Singapore - Bad audio quality on my end</h2>
                    <p>I have a skype plan for free calls to landline and cell phones in Singapore. Before the update to skype 8.1, everything went well and was ok. With the upgrade things have changed. Whenever I call a landline or cell phone, my counterpart can properly hear
 and understand me, but I can not. The audio channel back to me makes a conversation almost impossible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am calling the same person on the same mobile device skype to skype (data connection, no gsm involved), the audio connection is just perfect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder, why the free service is working properly, while the service that I am paying for is almost not usable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whom can I contact to get this solved? If this continues I will just cancel my paid subscription and go skype to skype only.</p>

<h2>            Almost every new window open half size, requiring a click on the &#39;full screen&#39; icon. How can I set the system to open every window in full screen.</h2>
                    When I click to open another window, the new window is now opening at half size, instead of full screen. This has only happened recently as, previously, most windows (Paint being the exception) opened 'full screen' automatically. How do I set the system
 to change the way in which a new window opens.

            <p>Further to my earlier reply. Since downloading&nbsp; <u>IE New Window Maximizer</u>, all the problems have been resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should point that, on my screen, the top bar had vanished but with a bit of searching with the cursor, I persuaded the bar to reappear and I was able to minimize, reduce the page as well as access the other facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again. I have printed off these instructions. Won't be troubled with this problem again.</p>

    <title>Surface Hub wireless casting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Hub wireless casting</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we just installed an 84" Surface Hub, updated to the latest Windows 10 Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm trying to project wirelessly through Miracast, I have Windows 10 laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On the laptop side, Ctrl+K is working fine and I can see the Surface Hub is the list of wireless displays.</p>
<p>The thing I do not get is that, whether connected to office WiFi or to an ad-hoc link with the Surface Hub, the display should provide me with a PIN code to be able to first couple the casting&nbsp;laptop.</p>
<p>Though the "Connect" screen on the Hub is just reading "Ready for incoming connections..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Either with or without the specific admin setting to require a PIN for wireless screen casting, the "Connect" screen is not providing any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Andrea</p>

            Just for testing purposes, disable the firewall(s) and try to reconnect. I have to do this on my Surface Pro to use Miracast. &nbsp;Good Luck.

<p>
</p><p>What kind of Miracast?&nbsp; MWDA?&nbsp; What firmware level? &nbsp; Have you used the MWDA app to try to update that?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I was going to say first that there must be something wrong with your firewall because I have not had a problem with mine but then I realized I don't use a PIN; otherwise except for the atrocious usability the MWDA works OK for me.&nbsp; OTOH after a recent
 Windows update I did have a problem with both Mouse Without Borders and Remote Desktop Connection and they were both probably due to security/obscurity in the firewall.&nbsp; For example, in the Mouse Without Borders case I noticed using Resource Monitor that its
 "Listener" was marked "Not Allowed".&nbsp; It turned out it was easier uninstalling the product and updating it than trying to figure out what exactly had happened in the firewall.&nbsp; The troubleshooters will be useless for fixing this--in fact worse than useless
 because they were reporting things that weren't problems and otherwise actively interfering.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I don't know what the Listener for MWDA looks like.&nbsp; I think we can see the output side by using PowerShell&nbsp; Get-NetAdapter&nbsp; (e.g. for&nbsp;Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter) but don't know where to look after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm...&nbsp; a couple of trace possibilities perhaps?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I may try tracing mine to try to figure out more about how it works (without a PIN).&nbsp; No promises.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This second mention of PIN has made me think of the new <em>Projecting to this PC</em> feature, which can be entered from the Win-k dialog too.&nbsp; That can involve a PIN from the start.&nbsp; Perhaps it would provide a better simulation of what you are hoping to
 see?&nbsp; I don't have it working properly but I once saw a PIN from it.</p>

    <title>Just bought keyboard and there isn&#39;t a dongle in the box - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Just bought keyboard and there isn&#39;t a dongle in the box</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just purchased a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop.</p>
<p>This is the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">wireless </span>(USB) keyboard, mouse and number pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the box, and it was one of those wonderful "Apple packaging-like" experiences where you sit back and say "Wow, this is great!" &nbsp;At first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beautiful layout with the keyboard, the mouse and the number pad. &nbsp;But there wasn't a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">dongle</span>. &nbsp;Not only wasn't there a dongle, there wasn't even a space that looked like it SHOULD have contained the dongle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chatted with Microsoft customer service (not helpful) who after 10 minutes had me call the "stores department" at Microsoft.</p>
<p><em>Sidebar: &nbsp;I know that customer service just is never helpful, but really? &nbsp;Customer service that makes ME (the customer) navigate through multiple Microsoft departments to try and get an answer? &nbsp;How. exactly, is that customer SERVICE?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I digress...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talked to the stores person (855-425-8769) who wasn't going to help me because my employer purchased the laptop somewhere else than the Microsoft Store (I'm a work at home employee). &nbsp;I pointed out that it was a Microsoft product, in a Microsoft box, with
 the Microsoft seals still on the box. &nbsp;So it shouldn't matter WHERE I purchased it. &nbsp;I asked him to tell me WHERE in the box that the dongle was SUPPOSED to be located. &nbsp;He couldn't tell me. &nbsp;Then I said that while there isn't a picture of the dongle on the
 box, it seems like if Microsoft was going to offer a product and then not include a part that was necessary to make the product work, they ought to have a pretty big warning on the box that the purchase of an additional item was required in order to make it
 function. &nbsp;His only recommendation was that I return it (because he clearly didn't know if the dongle actually was supposed to be included or not). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really Microsoft? &nbsp;All of that work to completely knock my socks off with the packaging? &nbsp;And then to not include a part that is critical to the actual USE of the product? &nbsp;Was it really worth that to save money on not including a dongle? &nbsp;And if a dongle
 really SHOULD have been included in the box, then why was all of the packaging SO WELL THOUGHT OUT, and yet there wasn't an obvious spot for the dongle to have been? &nbsp;I can't think of any scenario that makes this all make sense...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm supposed to ship this all back to my company, then get another one (that will likely have the same problem), then go around and around in circles until i give up. &nbsp;That's the customer experience that I am 99% sure I am headed for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I totally mistaken? &nbsp;Did someone get this product and actually GET &nbsp;the dongle? &nbsp;If so, where in the packaging was it located? &nbsp;I've pretty much torn open all of the wonderfully crafted little boxed areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Barb</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;Can't seem to actually find an appropriate "Category" to post this under (required by this site). &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;Guess I'll just pick one of them and hope for the best.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Most mice today have the receiver in the battery compartment.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Store is a retail store and&nbsp;is not the warranty or replacement arm for any Microsoft Product.<br />
<br />
You need to work with the support at the store where you purchased the mouse or with Microsoft Hardware Support.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Here is the error I get. I can't seem to remove the pop up windows on my laptop that say I my Windows 7 isn't genuine. I've had this laptop for 6 yrs and this has never happened. It came installed, brand new with Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my laptop automatically tried to install Windows 10. Ive read so many bad things about it, that I had already made the decision, long ago, to stick with W7. So I immediately turned the computer off. When I rebooted, I now have all of these errors.
 I ran the diagnostic tool and here is the report.</p>

<p>To assist you better, please provide the information:</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the Computer prior to the issue?</p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also, I suggest you to try to reconfigure the slide show list of pictures and check if it helps. Also turn off

<p>I experienced this too, however Iiked the album-type presentation very much (i.e. where the screen was filled with a variety of apparently randomly chosen photos from my "Pictures" folder). The difficulty I have is the opposite of Dorothy Roger's -- because
 I would like to recover that multiple-image presentation; and I cannot find a way to generate it. I had hope that the "shuffle" option would do it but it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, thank you.</p>

<h2>            PC connected to router, says no internet but other ones are online</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Win 7 64 bit.&nbsp; I have 2 identical computers, both with same wireless card, OS, etc.&nbsp; One (A) is connected to the internet via my wireless home network, but the other (B) says there's a problem with my router or cable modem.&nbsp; COmputer B&nbsp;says
 it's&nbsp;connected to the wireless network, but that the wireless network is not connected to the internet.&nbsp; This is just not true, as I've tried with the 3 other computers in the house and they all get internet via the wireless network.&nbsp; I've rebooted modem,
 wireless router, and computer multiple times.&nbsp; Any ideas what I should try next?&nbsp; One thing is that this particular machine has poor signal strength (2 bars of 5) while all of the other machines are closer to the router and have excellent signal strength.&nbsp;
 Could weak signal strength cause the problem I'm having?</p>
<p>THanks in advance for any insights.</p>

            A. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of current Skype client. There should be an option to No auto login or vice versa. This is a feature which has been demanded by many persons as it does expose your Skype if somebody logs in to your computer.
<br />
<br />B. What you can do is to install application locker from Microsoft Store and use that to lock Skype. So that nobody else can start Skype unless the person knows the password.
<br />
<br />App Lock (App Protector) - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/app-lock-app-protector/9nblgggztqp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/app-lock-app-...</a>
<br />
<br />C. May I request a small help from you? These forum posts are not read by Microsoft engineers. This feedback should go to Microsoft engineers for them to consider this. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>

            Hi  reg.reg,
<br />
<br />Sorry for inconvenience. Unfortunately, the newer Skype does not have an option to disable auto log in at this time. It is a highly requested feature. 
<br />
<br />I encourage you add your voice to list so the engineers can consider implementing a solution in a future release.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea8b168a-1bc1-4d50-a2ff-3a742759772e?upload=true" />

<h2>            The system tells me there is no validated product ID to activate the OS.</h2>
                    <p>Ref: Dell Inspiron N5030 Laptop, Original OS Win 7 HP, Pentium Dual Core T4500 @ 2.30 GHz, 8 Gb Ram PC3 8500. This was a gift from an unknown source for our ministry. All that Dell had previously installed was present. After 6 months MS Win 10 was downloaded
 as a upgrade. After upgrade and using key finder, the product key mysteriously disappeared from the laptop. Now the system tells me there is no validated product ID to activate the OS. The system is operating great without the activation process, however every
 30 days the pop-up activation window come up.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>

<h2>            What can be done to allow a non-privileged user to connect to a Skype Meeting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>One of our clients has started using Skype as their meeting platform and for compliance reasons we do not allow our users to install applications on their Virtual Desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if we install the add-in on the golden image when joining the meeting the user is always required to re-install the add-in. We found this article about this and implemented this registry change but we are still being prompted to re-install each time.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether the add-in you mentioned is Skype Meetings App? According to my test, once the add-in has already been installed on PC, when join the meetings, click “<strong>Try Skype Web App</strong>” &nbsp;in invitation,
 it will automatically open the installed Skype Meetings App and needn’t to reinstall it every time.</p>

<p>Let me explain further. We are running Citrix Stateless Desktops. General users are prevented from installing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install the plugin on the golden image as an administrator it will open the Skype meeting just fine and the add-in shows in add remove programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I shutdown the master image and deploy it to the Citrix Desktops and general users connect to the desktops the add-in does not appear in Add Remove Programs. When the user tries to join the Skype meeting they are prompted to install the add-in, but
 of course they cannot because they do not have the rights to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we administratively install the add-in so that users can join Skype for Business meetings hosted by our clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made the registry changes outlined in the link provided and still have the issue.</p>

AFAIK, it isn't. You can only see it if you change the view to Small/Large Icons.

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 PC Crash, Stuttering, hanging, FPS drops, Unstable.....</h2>
                    
<p>My PC:<br />
Windows 10 Anniversary and everything<br />
i7 4770k running at OEM clock<br />
12GB DDR3 1600<br />
Geforce GTX 780Ti<br />
ASrock Z97 Extreme 4<br />
Xbox 360 Controller</p>

<p>I can't find how to run de game smoothly..<br />
<br />
On recommended settings with unlocked FPS I get between 40 and 80 FPS, but a lot of stuttering, crashes and unstability..<br />
<br />
When running 60FPS cap I can't get it to run smoothly, even at LOW...<br />
<br />
When I put Dynamic Control on LOW with the 30 FPS cap, it runs a solid 30 fps, but I get massive input lags in surfer's paradise and the game randomly crashes to desktop or sometimes the whole PC just freeze...<br />
<br />
It seems that the quality level won't affect the stability or the FPS I get, but rather how long I can play before everything freezes or crashes....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Come on Microsoft.... I paid freaking 150 $ CAD for that game, Why NOBODY can run it strong on their PC ???? Did you optimised the game for Titan X GPU or what ?<br />
<br />
Please help me... My drivers are all up to date and I tried every funny fixes being told on the forums... When is Microsoft's gonna say something about it ?<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>New Windows 10 computer very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindsay graham  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows 10 computer very slow</h2>
                    <p>I know there has been much discussion on this, but I can't find definitive answers relating to a new (ie, not upgraded) Win 10 computer.&nbsp; My Acer Revo One (i5 processor, 8GB RAM) came with Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; Compared with our 2 other computers (Win XP
 and Win 8.1), the new one is incredibly slow.&nbsp; It takes a minimum of 40 secs (and usually much longer) to get to the sign on screen and then a minimum of another 40 secs to get to the desktop.&nbsp; That's 1:20 minimum and usually 2-3 mins in total.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please how do I fix this?&nbsp; Or is Win 10 always like that?&nbsp; Maybe I should simply return the new computer to the shop!</p>

<p>Thanks for your help, Deepak.&nbsp; First, your questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Acer Revo RL85 64-bit with Win 10 Home</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yes, ever since we bought it less than a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Checked Acer drivers (no action as all drivers appeared to be quite recent) and Microsoft drivers (tried several, but the only one updated was Intel HD Graphics 5500).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Your link appears to give an incorrect description.&nbsp; I found Disk Cleanup by running cleanmgr -- as I expected, there was very little to cleanup, 36MB on C:/ and 0 on D:/.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Your access method did not work as described, but I found it and ran Maintenance Tasks -- no issues were detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pending updates:&nbsp; There were none -- all had been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: On one occasion I thought it had been fixed when I got 15 secs (from start to sign-on screen) and 5 secs (from password entry to populated desktop).&nbsp; But on 4 subsequent shut downs and starts (not restarts), the average times were 55 secs and 72
 secs.&nbsp; A right royal PITA wait!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Lindsay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have lot of applications/processes at start-up?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the Desktop system in Clean Boot and check the boot time. (This is to check if the third party applications are affecting the boot time.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This helps to eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

<p>Hi Marjie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting test mode watermark on Windows 10. I will certainly help you in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>test mode watermark </strong>may appear in the bottom right part of your Windows desktop, if you install an application whose drivers are not digitally signed by Microsoft and if they are still in the testing phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you to follow below steps to disable the test mode watermark&nbsp;and check if it helps.<br />
1. Right click on <strong>Start</strong>, click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
2. Type <strong>bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING OFF </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
(The TESTSIGNING boot configuration option is disabled through the above BCD Edit command)
<br />
3. Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, <strong>restart</strong> the system and check.</p>

<h2>            Traditional Chinese IME - Microsoft New Phonetic 10.1&#58; disable the shortcut key for toggling half&#47;full width &#40;Shift&#43;Space&#41;</h2>
                    Hi. I'm having this problem with Traditional Chinese IME. Back when I was using Office XP, the Chinese IMEs - New ChangJie and New Phonetic, would provide an option to disable the shortcut key for toggling half/full width (Shift+Space). There is no such
 option in New Phonetic 10.1 and I keep accidenally toggling the full width input mode when typing English with the IME. Is there any way to get around it?

            Thanks for the reply. I don't think this is it though, since my IME (which is in Windows 7) is not really a part of Office (not to be confused with the Office XP case I mentioned; that was far longer ago) and there is no command for shifting between half-width
 and full-width in the customize Ribbon shortcut dialog.

<p>@<span>nocturnal
 YL</span> &nbsp; Quite right, this doesn't solve the problem.&nbsp; I've search through both the "Advanced Key Settings" which is where the toggle existed in XP, and throughout the the Advanced Tab on th 10.1 IME Settings, where some of the XP toggles have now been
 migrated to.&nbsp; The half/full width option is present in neither.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Umesh As you would probably know, Microsoft IME language input, whether Chinese, Japanese, Sanskrit (I use all of them) is a windows wide facility, and not limited to office.</p>
<p>This key is one of the most annoying things to type with in Traditional Chinese IME, and a real impediment to IMEｉｎｐｕｔ，　ａｓ　ｙｏｕ can see, it constantly trips one up when typing.</p>
<p>Umesh, can you please investigate this and get back to us?&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Umesh, I responded to this thread once, but maybe you didn't get my comment?&nbsp; This doesn't solve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you should probably know, Microsoft IME language input, whether Chinese, Japanese, Sanskrit (I use all of them) is a windows wide facility, and not limited to office.&nbsp; Thus your solution is misdirected.&nbsp; This key is one of the most annoying things to
 type with in Traditional Chinese IME, and a real impediment to IMEｉｎｐｕｔ，　ａｓ　ｙｏｕ can see, it constantly trips one up when typing.&nbsp; It is a real problem for Chinese (Simplified and Taiwan) users.</p>
<p>I've searched through both the Windows 7&nbsp; "Advanced Key Settings" on the Text Services and Input Languages window, which is where the toggle existed in XP, and throughout the the Advanced Tab on the 10.1 IME Settings, where some of the XP toggles have now
 been migrated to.&nbsp; The half/full width option was present in neither.</p>
<p>I have since installed the Microsoft Language Pack, and suddenly the half/full width options reappeared in the Advanced Key Settings window.&nbsp; However, although I have tried disabling them, enabling and re-disabling, and also changing the key settings for
 this option (both in Simplified and Taiwan Chinese), it just ignores those changes, and reverts back to the standard setting.</p>
<p>Umesh, can you please investigate this and get back to us?&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

            <p>I am using Windows 7 Ultimate, Microsoft Office 2010, and the Chinese (Traditional) Language Pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I switch to New Phonetic input (BoPoMoFo) and hover my cursor over the Character Width icon on the language bar, A note pops up telling me I can switch widths with Shift+Space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try that it works exactly as advertised. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have the character width icon displayed on your Language Bar? Click the down arrowhead and select it for display.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While IME is sort-of a windows wide facility, it seems to be intimately tied to which language packs you have installed. And, by extension, which keyboards you have installed using control panel and Region and Language.</p>

            <p>Yes, Advanced Key Settings do seem to revert to default at unpredictable times.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just put them back and go on. It doesn't happen all that often, just enough to be irritating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I have also noticed the commands to the IME will entirely stop working and I have to reboot to get them going again.)</p>
