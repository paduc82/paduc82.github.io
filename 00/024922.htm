<h2>            How can I restore my contacts&#63;  How do I reinstall Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My list of contacts disappared.&nbsp; When I select PEOPLE, all I get is the Red Bar that has People, a down arrow that returns you to the 4 icons, the messenger and the tools icon (Gear Box).&nbsp; All I can do is go from Mail to People but cannot add addresses.&nbsp;
 The Manage and other items are not on the red People task bar.</p>
<p>I was using IE 9 and then tried IE 10 but it didn't work either.&nbsp; I had to download IE 10 to use some business software.</p>
<p>Can you give me any advice?</p>

<h2>            Formatting in Excel workbook just won&#39;t save</h2>
                    When I make changes in my Excel workbook it just won't save. I've uninstalled and re-installed Office twice. Opened new workbooks and copied the info over, nothing works. Every time I try to make the changes I 'save' and when opening up the document again
 it reverts back to a previous version. I've spent the best part of a day trying to sort this out, and feel slightly desperate. The file is saved as a workbook.

            In fact, could it be the save button is not working? When I click it doesn't seem to do anything, you know usually it takes half a second for the doc to save. In this case it doesn't seem like it's doing anything.&nbsp;

            Following are possibilities -

1. Your Office may not be activated properly. Could you sign-out and sign-in again? Go to file &gt; Account and see whether it is asking for Activation..

Some help on activation

2. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough)

3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.

To start Excel in Safe Mode -

Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon
OR
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type ""Excel /s"" without quotes and enter.

<h3> andrewols  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Misplaced Sections&#34; in OneNote for iOS, Lost my note</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today I finally decided to start faithfully using OneNote as my primary note taking/organization app. I have Office 365 so I figured, why not. I got it set up on my Mac, my iPad, and my iPhone, and did most of my initial editing on my Mac. Then I
 decided to add a new notebook on my iPhone, which is where the problems began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully added a new Notebook on my iPhone, created a new new Category in that Notebook, and added a new note with both pictures and text. Once again, I did this all on my iPhone. I then got on my Mac and sure enough, it appeared on my Mac and I was
 able to further edit it more easily to look how I wanted it to look. Wonderful. Everything synced, I quit, and a few hours later attempted to open the same note on my iPhone again. Guess what? Not there. Instead it's in this weird notebook called "Misplaced
 Sections." And the file itself is Read-Only. Every time I try to move it to a real Notebook, it says it can't be moved. The best I can do is turn it into a PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe it's still on my Mac? Nope. It's like it never exited there at all. Ever. No sign of it. Not even a Misplaced Sections notebook. Nothing. Nada. Then on my iPad in OneNote, once again, nothing. Not even a Misplaced Sections notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am, stuck with a Read-Only version of a note that took me about 30 minutes to make, and it's stuck in a Misplaced Sections notebook that is only accessibly on my iPhone, and can't be moved anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas of what I can do to rescue this information? Exporting it as a PDF is really a last ditch scenario as that won't be editable in the future, and I genuinely need this note to exist in this Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a real bummer because I had such high hopes for OneNote, but now I'm terrified of losing even more data as time goes on due to weird synching glitches...&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Did you ever get this resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asking because I'm having the same issue and several months ago when I first started using it this problem forced me to abandon the use of OneNote, simply not reliable. &nbsp;Well about a month ago tried again and am all-in now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, on my iPhone having same problem. &nbsp;I had this issue on my iPad and was able to move the entire Section to another Notebook, yes, a life saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, looks like the documentation for the iPhone on the MSFT support page is incorrect for moving a page. &nbsp;It shows the Send-To arrow for moving which is incorrect. &nbsp;The Page has an ellipse (...) that provides all the features you'd expect such as Move,
 Copy, Rename, Print, etc.. In addition, if you tap a Section you can do the same....SUCCESS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, NOT for the Misplaced Notebook. WHY MSFT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So close but falls short. &nbsp;I have many pages in this notebook that I want to keep and not as a PDF; so, MSFT, what is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please respond with an explanation of the difference.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>MSFT Support Page, current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The below screen-shots from the iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.3, the latest and as you can see, I can move sections and pages but not via the above method, that button doesn't even exist. Also, great, it's possible but not from the Misplaced Notebook. &nbsp;And lastly,
 I am able to do so from OneNote for my iPad; so, the code exists for iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE: UNABLE TO UPLOAD IMAGES FROM MY PHOTO LIBRARY EVEN THOUGH THIS SITE LETS ME SELECT FROM CAMERA ROLL. STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE WHICH FORMAT IS ACCEPTABLE.</p>

    <title>AutoCAD 14 LT Not working with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabethjames-64  say:</h3>
<h2>            AutoCAD 14 LT Not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I had AutoCAD 14 LT installed and working perfectly on my laptop which was running Windows 8. I followed all the instructions to upgrade to Windows 10 and now my AutoCAD application appears to start, goes through the motions, then just turns off. No error
 message, no AutoCAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and then reinstalled but the new install does the exact same thing. Disappears after a brief start up screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to disappear when the system is checking for my license.</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>Thank you. I tried that, running in windows 8 compatibility mode and it still hangs up at licensing then just disappears. I am having a few other licensing issues since upgrading to Windows 10. My adobe suite is telling me that it won't run Acrobat unless
 I open another program in the suite. I open a program (eg. photoshop) and it opens fine, but Acrobat 9 still tells me that it won't work until I open another program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best bet seems to be to go back to Windows 8. Everything worked fine then. I just hope going back doesn't mess up even more stuff.</p>

            <p>Thank you Jovan YU1BCD,</p>
<p>I tried that as well. That didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty frustrating actually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what else I have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compatibility Mode in 8</p>
<p>Compatibility Mode in 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>UNINSTALLING and RELOADING about a million times in between all the tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling both using the uninstall that came with the AutoCAD Lt program CD and because the Uninstall with the program only removed some of the program, I then tried uninstall with the Windows Control panel uninstall .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all I can think to do is Uninstall Windows 10 and reinstall Windows 8, which will be a bear because I had Windows 8 automatically installed on my laptop and I don't have a "CD" for that to reinstall it. So now I have to figure out how to reinstall 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice to anyone upgrading to windows 10 is now: DON"T do it. It isn't worth this kind of hassle and what will surely become EXPENSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seriously thinking of dumping ALL for a good old fashioned pen and a piece of paper.</p>

            <p>You may be able to rollback to Windows 8.1 under Settings - Update &amp; Security - Recovery, if the AutoCAD website and support is also no help getting it to work&nbsp;in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to reinstall&nbsp;Windows 8.1, you can download the latest ISO for Windows 8.1 here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can put that on a 4GB or larger USB flash drive using the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool.&nbsp; Boot the laptop with that flash drive to reinstall Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To read your original OEM product key to activate Windows 8.1, use this command from an Administrator Command prompt.&nbsp; You can install it without a product key if necessary until you can use this command and then activate it, but it may work from Windows
 10 to read the key.</p>

    <title>Buy Lumia 535 in China - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisd.9792  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buy Lumia 535 in China</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently living in China and am considering getting a Lumia 535, but I'm wondering if there are any limitations to the software that would prevent me from successfully using it back in the US. For example, I've heard the store for Chinese windows phones
 removes access to certain social media apps. Is that true? If so, is the windows 10 mobile preview international? Would installing that allow me to change region to the US and use the US app store? I'm already using the preview on my old 928, so I, aware of
 what I'm getting myself into with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Please note that phones that are produced for Chinese market do not have the same functions that phones produced for US market have. Hence your phone in the US will not have full functionality.</span></p>

<h3> hh1985  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple &#34;AND&#34; statements in a multiple &#34;IF&#34; function</h2>
                    Need more help with a function. I tried several versions of =IF(K4="Y",IF(I4="Trans","$0.00",IF(AND(I4="Stay",E4="RPT"),"$500.00","$1000.00", IF(AND(I4="Term",J4&gt;=1),(F4*G4*N4*),"$500.00"))),IF(K4="N","n/a)) - moving around IF(AND statements, parentheses,
 etc but none of them worked.<br />
<br />
1. IF K4="Y", then a-e:<br />
<ul>
<li>a. IF I4="Trans", "$0.00"</li><li>b. IF I4="Stay" and E4="RPT", "$500.00"</li><li>c. IF I4="Stay" and E4 doesn't ="RPT", "$1000.00"</li><li>d. IF I4="Term" and J4&gt;=1, (F4*G4*N4)</li><li>e. IF I4="Term" and J4=0, "$500.00"</li></ul>
<p>2. IF K4="N", "n/a"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is it possible to have multiple "AND"/"OR" statements in a single function with multiple "IF" statements? If yes, what is the best way to order them? (if you have just an "IF" statement, then an "IF(AND", etc.)</p>
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Personally, I like to put the simple parts of the formula first, e.g.</p>
<p>=if(K4="N","n/a", &lt;everything else&gt;)</p>
<p>but that is just personal preference, I think it is easier to read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is one option (aircode):</p>
<p>starting with shorthand because it is easier to go keep everything in order and fill in the criteria afterwards-</p>
<p>=if(K4="N","n/a", if(I4 = "Trans","$0", if(and(*b*),"$500",if(and(*c*),"$1000",if(and(*d*),(F4*G4*N4),if(and(*e*),"$500","Not covered by criteria"))))))</p>

</p><p>I ran the recovery Assistant which told me that my admin had to change my password.&nbsp; &nbsp;He did, but I didnt know at first that I had to log-out of all client and Web Office applications for the change to take effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;My administrator walked me through it
 and we were successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix was to re-set my password.&nbsp; To improve this for others, the Help pages should recommend that you log-out of all MS Office services and log back in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Preface: I am not a Mac user.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my chapter on templates. <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/templates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Templates in Microsoft Word</a></p>
<p>That is a start but isn't about protection or restricting users. You do want to be using a template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The templates that you are seeing online contain <a href="http://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/content_controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Word Content Controls</a> , possibly <a href="http://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/mapped_content_controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mapped content controls</a> possibly created through <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/MappedControls.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Document Properties</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, these are still best developed or created in the Windows version of Word, even for use on a Mac. Most content controls will apparently work on a Mac but the tools for working with them or creating them are lacking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Text box" can mean many things. It can mean a graphical container for text which can be manipulated as a picture. It can mean an input box inserted as an ActiveX control. It can mean a legacy formfield. It can mean a content control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look also into the <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/fields.htm#MacroButtonField" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MacroButton Field</a> which can be used as a data entry point prompt in all versions of Word since Word 3 on the Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/tables.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Tables</a> and <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/frames_textboxes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Frames</a> (with or without borders) to hold and position input points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use protected forms to limit what people can do, but they truly do limit them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/forms.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Making Forms with Microsoft Word</a></p>
<p>Grouped Content Controls give much more flexibility, but again can only be created in the Windows version AFAIK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/download.htm#Templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Templates and Documents</a> portion of my downloads page is a template that contains Document Property Content Controls that I've been told will work on a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confident that eventually the Mac versions will have these abilities, but the Windows version has had them since Word 2007.</p>

            Hi Anil 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />On that page under your info, check the status of your subscription to Office 365
<br />
<br />If that checks out, click this link and run through the Office activation troubleshooter:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/unlice...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation, including activation . . .

                    <p>I'm aware that we can no longer manage custom domain accounts without upgrading to Office 365, but we need to delete or change password of one of our domain accounts since the previous user left our team and is now against us, so yeah we really need to do
 it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Can the Windows Live support do something please?</p>

<h2>            Globally changing attachment type settings for outlook web app in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>We are running office 365 with users having Office 365 Enterprise E3 licences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In outlook web app options, under Mail -&gt; Attachment Options -&gt; Attachment Preferences, each user can set if they wish to attach files as OneDrive files or as copies. We'd like each user to have this set to use copies as default for all types of files, but
 we have about 100 users so doing this manually for each user will take forever. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a global setting we can change, perhaps a powershell command like the one to turn off link previewer for all users?
</p>
<p>(<span>Set-OrganizationConfig –LinkPreviewEnabled $false)</span></p>

<p><span>There is no such a global setting we can change to allow users to have the “Attachment Preferences” setting to use copies as default for all types of files. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

            <p>Actually someone at Microsoft might have looked at my account as resolved it. Everything is working now. It seemed to be an account issue. I didn't perform any&nbsp;major changes and happened out of the blue continuously until today. Maybe this information will
 be helpful for others. I tested FF, Chrome, IE, and edge which all errored. The IOS app just stays on collecting data forever. If i try another Microsoft account or my work account, everything works.

<h2>            Won&#39;t open .doc as Word doc, even though I have Word as default program to open .doc</h2>
                    
<p>I re-installed my o/s last week to solve some other issues, took everything back to factory settings. When I go to open a .doc document online, I get a message asking if I want to save the file, or find a program online to open it. Three buttons are find,
 save or cancel. It used to give me the option to open the file directly. I have to save the document, then open it from the file location and it will open directly into Word. I know that I can use an online viewer program to view the docs, but I'm wondering
 what is causing IE to not be able to recognize .doc documents? I'd rather solve the problem that use a workaround. I'm having another off-topic issue with IE with my database that I wonder if it might be related to this issue, so I'd like to solve it.</p>
<p>I have gone in and reset IE back to default settings in the advanced tab. When I try to access the same document with Firefox, it gives me the option to open in Word.</p>
<p>My next step may be to re-install IE, but when I tried to download it, it said I already had it, and the only other options it gave me was for Vista and XP. I could un-install and re-install, but I'm worried I won't be able to get back to IE 8 for Windows
 7 based on their not being a link for that on the IE 8 download page I found. I can't do IE 9 because of a conflict with another program I use for work every day.</p>
