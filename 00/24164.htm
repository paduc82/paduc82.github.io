<h2>            Opening MS Word with empty document creates .CVR file in temp folder everytime&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The original thread is here, but for some reason i'm unable to reply there:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/office-2010-word-accumulating-cvr-files-in-temp/160c7354-bf40-47dd-b40c-210972d60cbc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/office-2010-word-accumulating-cvr-files-in-temp/160c7354-bf40-47dd-b40c-210972d60cbc</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem and cause</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>When i launch MS WORD 2010</strong></span> directly from Start Menu with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>EMPTY document</strong></span>, or when you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>create and run a NEW/EMPTY docx document</strong></span> by right clicking anywhere on desktop,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>xxx.tmp.CVR file is automatically created</strong></span> in "<strong>%temp%"</strong> folder, and it is NOT deleted after i exit MS WORD 2010. The size of CVR file is 0 (zero) kb. There happens many CVR files
 when you re-open MS WORD 2010 later again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the posts, the creation of CVR files is widely supposed by launch of MS OUTLOOK, but it happens when i launch MS WORD with empty document without touching anything related to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any confirmation and solution regarding to this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I also found out that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>xxx.tmp.cvr files are also created when you run "any" Office program</strong></span> like Excel, Outook and OneNote.<strong>..BUT they're removed automatically when you exit, except Word and Outlook</strong>. For example running Excel creates CVR file
 but it's deleted from temp folder just fine after exit. But Word / Outlook leaves CVR file there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call it a <strong>bug.</strong></p>

            To my knowledge, Office doesn't create CRV files. I suspect you have another app that has an add-in in the Office apps that are creating them, such as VCarve and VinylMaster Pro. There are others. You may want to do a search for "CRV file extension" and
 see which apps come up and if you have one installed.

<h2>            IE10 on Vista&#63;</h2>
                    I have been recieving a update for IE9 running vista but it fails with code 9C48. I tried all the things that it recommends but nothing worked. The next step was suggested that I uninstall IE9 back to IE8,but unfortunatly halfway through it says unable
 to uninstall all updates.It shows IE9 is still there in programs and features but when I click on the internet explorer icon there is no IE anything.No 9 or 8 which are still both listed.I'm using chrome which has no support anymore for vista users.I have
 firefox,but it's slower then a snail. I have a copy of Windows 7 64bit on my laptop and about 7 discs that I had to buy because the version on the sony vaio laptop crapped the bed and it cost me a extra $179.00 to get new software. I was informed 1 liscense
 for 1 computer so microsoft says I can't use my Win 7 disc. Has anyone got any good ideas to fix this problem? I'm on social security and don't have alot of money to buy even more software. I really don't mind Windows 7 but everyone I

            <p>Here is another thread/topic/question posted in April that is essentailly about IE9 and has received no answer from any of the Microsoft designated Special Help Staff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I can inform you, <em><strong>James</strong></em>, that you cannot install anything above IE9 on a Vista OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as troubleshooting what is wrong with your system and IE9, that is exactly what got me into this research -- it seems that none of the specialists are answering any questions about IE9, if the question is about keeping IE9 in a functional state on
 a Vista OS.</p>

            I find it very disappointing that no one is able to step up with any answers for all of us Vista users now that Mighty Microsoft has said no more to get us all to fork over big money for a operating system we may not need or want as I not even sure all
 the drivers and programs are there for this supposibly wonderful new OS. My Vista work just fine and though my computer is a little older it runs like a clock. All my drivers and programs work fine but the Microsoft updates are not installing properly and
 when you try to follow up on the error codes now we get you slap in the face answer of were not answering questions on Vista problems. So sorry but go out and buy a new computer with Windows 10 even though the computer you have works just fine or spend a couple
 hundred on a copy of win 10 to put on your older computer even though it's still working fine on Vista. Oh your disabled and live on a fixed income, well just skip groceries or medications and you can buy a nice a honey new copy if it wil

            <p>Well, <em><strong>James</strong></em>, there does seem to be one member of the volunteer staff, a
<em><strong>PA Bear</strong></em> that seems willing to answer some Vista related questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is also at least one staff member -- employee, I don't know -- that will go as far as delelting posts that are asking why the support for Vista is almost not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just don't know, <em><strong>James</strong></em>, something sure does seem odd.&nbsp; But I'm a stubborn old man that will go to great lengths, and expense, to get answers.&nbsp; And that deleting of my post really makes this company look really guilty of something.&nbsp;
 Just have to figure out what that "something" is.&nbsp; Good thing I do screen grabs of all my posts.&nbsp; Strange<em><strong>!</strong></em>&nbsp; Very strange<em><strong>!!</strong></em></p>

            In response to PA Bear I guess You've confussed me. On April 20 I was inquiring about a a code 9C48 that appears on a Windows update for IE 9 for Vista that is supposibly critical and fails to install. HMF47 responded on May 11 and then on May 29th witch
 had nothing to do with my question on April 20th. I can't tell if your giving me a hard time for asking a sincere question or not. Maybe confusion on both our parts. I really have a hard time following the codes that are given to fix Windows update problems.

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you receive an error saying "We're sorry, but Outlook has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly," then it's possibly due to missing Office updates. Now, to correct this error that you're getting when using Outlook, you can follow
 the resolution from this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/3091375/you-may-receive-an-error-when-running-office-2013-in-windows-10-we-re" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
You may receive an error when running Office 2013 in Windows 10:"We're sorry, but Word has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly."</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: This article applicable for all Office 2013 applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how this turns out. Send us a reply.</p>

            This does not work because I cannot get into the program to start an update. Upon starting the program I get the error box, my options are "fix problem"," Help" or "close" selecting any of the three closes the program. How do I download an update with
 out being in the program or how do I get into the program to update? Thanks.

            <p>Hello Gurungdibas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I understand you're having issues with the Microsoft Account on your phone, in particular, this 0x800048264 error.&nbsp; Let's go over a few things and get this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now just a heads up, this is actually the Windows Phone 7 forums, so you'll want to reach out to our Windows Phone 8 forum team.&nbsp; I'll go ahead and move this thread over to the correct area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we can try the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>On your phone, navigate to <strong>Settings&gt;Date+Time</strong>.&nbsp; Turn off <strong>
Set Automatically</strong> and make sure the date, time, and time zone are correct for the region you are in.&nbsp; Then turn the phone off for about two minutes and see if your account will now sync.</li><li>If this doesn't yield any results, then the phone will need to be factory reset.&nbsp;
<strong>Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset Your Phone</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from 7 stuck at 93&#37;</h2>
                    I joined the windows insider last night and upgraded my Dell xps m1210 laptop from Windows 7. Since last night is been stuck at 93%. What should I do? I tried to turn off the laptop and it doesn't. Contacted Microsoft directly and got told that since is
 an upgrade from the windows insider program I needed to make contact here as they don't give support for the program.&nbsp;

            I finally got it to turn off. When I turned it back on it went to a blue screen asking me to pick windows system. I tried that and contacted Microsoft again asking for help the guy tried everything he could think of and it still didn't work. The windows
 7 got erased somehow. He sent me an email with a windows file to download to see if that helps me. I don't have a second computer to download it so right now I'm on my way to my local library to do it and hope that works. I'm freaking out because this is my

<p>Sir first of all, please&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT </strong>Install Insider Builds on your Primary Computer, builds are unstable and contains bugs. problems may occur.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also If you are gonna do it anyway first of all back up your data. Thank me later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can you boot into UEFI mode or try any recovery options? and did you tried installing windows using an external flash drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and are you sure you don't have windows 7 in your device or you are just not able to boot i to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will recommend you not to go for insider builds on your primary computer, a public build can be installed using media creation tool that can be found here -&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck !</p>

<p>I did back up everything to my office 365. My previous laptop overheated the other day that is the one used for work. This one was my back up and just wanted the windows 10 on it as I missed upgrading it when it was free lol. I was going to use for work
 until I got the other laptop fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The guy from Microsoft walked me on trying all kinds of recovery methods and still was not working.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much better to store that in ONE field JobDateTime, and for display purposes format it as date or as time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The string can be parsed from the query by sending it to a custom VBA function that takes a string and returns a DateTime. Use functions such as InStr, Left, Mid, Replace to pick it apart.</p>

User Defined Functions (UDFs) are very easy to install and use:</p>
<p>1. ALT-F11&nbsp; brings up the VBE window<br />
2. ALT-I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALT-M opens a fresh module<br />
3. paste the stuff in and close the VBE window</p>
<p>If you save the workbook, the UDF will be saved with it.</p>
<p>To remove the UDF:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. bring up the VBE window as above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. clear the code out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. close the VBE window</p>
<p>To use the UDF from Excel:</p>
<p>=myfunction(A1)</p>

<p>hi robin,</p>
<p>i have removed the email account for protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>according to the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the expired password or the account you are trying signing in to doesn’t have an exchange online license. furthermore, i know you ran into the issue while you were signing in outlook web
 app (owa). if the situation is misunderstood, please correct me and provide more details for your situation so that we can better help you.</p>
<p>also, via checking the email account, i have found that it isn’t an admin account. so, please
<strong>double confirm</strong> whether it is an admin account. if so, you can try the following methods to narrow down the issue (if you are not an admin, you can ask for help from your admin via the following methods):<br />
1.&nbsp;change a new password for the problematic account.<br />
2.&nbsp;confirm whether the user account has an exchange online license. if the user has an exchange online license, it should be shown in “eac (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>)”&gt; “recipients”&gt; “mailboxes”. you can upload a
 screenshot like the following one for analysis:<br />

    <title>Microsoft Home Use Program and Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenpollard2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Home Use Program and Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I work at a school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently have Open Value Select licensing, which allows for staff to purchase Office at a favourable rate and install at home (HUP).&nbsp; They register for this using their school email address / domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are now looking to set up Office 365 (Education) for students, but when trying to set it up we get the message "Other people in your organisation have already registered up with xxx.school email addresses.&nbsp; You need to sign up too and then verify that
 you're the admin for the domain'.&nbsp; I guess this is because staff members have registered for the Home Use Program using their xxx.school email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be an issue if we were to set up Office 365 (Education) using a subdomain, for example O365.xxx.school?&nbsp; Would this impact our Home Use Program at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to explain that: when the first user in your school(student or faculty)&nbsp;apply for Office 365 account with your school'd domain, there will create a tenant that without admin. I'd like to suggest you check this article
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/become-an-admin-in-office-365-education-22d6591b-a5af-41f9-bc86-52f62e7aa400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Become an admin in Office 365 Education</a> to become the admin of your school's tenant. Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't become an admin successfully, please share with me your domain name to let me have a check.&nbsp;To protect your privacy, please share with me your domain name via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if you still want to apply a tenant with your subdomain, it is feasible to do that.If we have already added a domain contoso.com to tenant a, we can still add zxc.contoso.com to tenant b.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<br />
It is not possible to run Windows Phone on the iPaq 214. The software on the iPaq is not upgradable to any version higher than Windows Mobile 6. Therefore you cannot upgrade to Windows Phone.<br />

<h2>            Resizing Photos</h2>
                    Is there a way in Sway to resize a photo? &nbsp; When I add a photo as an image card, Sway automatically makes it a certain size. &nbsp; I know that on the image card I can select the emphasis to be subtle, moderate or intense. &nbsp;But even subtle is just way too big.
 &nbsp;Any help is greatly appreciated!

            <p>Hi Debra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest shrinking the image before you insert it into Sway.&nbsp; To do so, just open it in Paint and click the Resize button; then choose a percentage for the height and width that is the same to keep the dimensions the same.&nbsp; Try uploading that image
 into Sway and keeping it subtle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you may want to try out is the Focus Points feature.&nbsp; It allows you to specify the important regions of your image to focus in on.&nbsp; This may end up having the effect of making the image bigger though unless you choose the entire image is important
 option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Best way to quickly switch between PowerPoint in Presenter View and demoing another program</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I<strong> love </strong>presenter view - it's amazing.&nbsp; It's so useful being able to view my notes as well as the slides&nbsp;on my laptop screen and&nbsp;having it so that delegates can only see the slides without notes&nbsp;on the main screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However...I'm a systems trainer.&nbsp; So I often have to switch&nbsp;out of PowerPoint to demo other programs - IE, Word, Excel etc. a fair bit and then quickly&nbsp;switch back to my slides to provide additional info etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to skip in and out of presentations easily on a regular basis by using the Alt+ Tab keys.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try Alt+Tab when using Presenter View, I can only switch to other programs on my laptop&nbsp;monitor.&nbsp; The display for delegates remains on the slides only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the easiest and quickest way to switch out to another program on the delegate's screen (ideally mirrored with my laptop screen so I have a good view of the program too) while retaining your place in the slides in Presenter View in the PowerPoint window?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Emily</p>

                    I updated my computer with Internet Explorer 11 (Microsoft said it was an important update) and since then strange thins have been happening. The biggest problem is the left mouse button! I click on any thing, not just in explorer and it's like I taped
 the mouse a lot of times. At first I thought it was my mouse just getting old but two days latter I updated my other computer to explorer 11 and know it's doing the same thing. I uninstalled explorer 11 on both computers but still the problem remains. Tried
 adjusting mouse sensibility both ways but&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;work. Internet says not to install explorer 11 on windows 7 because it will cause problem's but I did not see this&nbsp;before I updated. And know need help!

<p>If you're implying that you are seeing that in your Help About display, I suspect that something's wrong.&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
