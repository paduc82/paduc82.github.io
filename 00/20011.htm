<h2>            nokia lumia 800 mms</h2>
                    I'm using an unlocked Nokia Lumia with windows 7.5, so far I am unable to send or receive MMS. I have the Network Setup pre-installed on phone but it has no reference to MMS at all. I have read another comment regarding installation of the Network Setup
 App will fix. Not sure if I have to re-install the App or blow it away and try again. New to smart phones. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Hi ChrisDuxson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution to the forums. When it comes to using an out-of-network phone, the most common issue with being able to send MMS messages is that your APN network needs to be manually entered. This varies based on mobile operator so you'll
 want to contact them for the information you'll need, but once you've got the address you can enter it under
<strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Cellular</strong>, and then <strong>add APN </strong>
at the bottom of the page. Once this is entered you shouldn't run into any more issues sending MMS messages, however if you do you'll want to talk some more with your mobile operator, as they're really the only ones that have any control over it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sam P.</p>

<h2>            Move messages from &#34;In Place Archive&#34; to Archive folder in main mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Using Exchange Online and Office 2016</p>
<p>I want to move all the messages that are located in a user's "In Place Archive folders" to the Archive folder in the main mailbox.</p>
<p>I can move a few at a time but cannot select "all" or other type of method to move from one folder to another.</p>
<p>I believe I have to use "migration" to set up a batch process to copy the folders to a PST file. I can then use Outlook 2016 to move the messages. Once moved in Outlook on the user's desktop the folders will sync with Exchange.
</p>
<p>I need specific instructions on how to successfully copy (migrate) the folders to the PST file while retaining the original folders online.
</p>
<p><br />
thanks</p>

<p>hi adam,</p>
<p>do you mean that you have assigned an office 365 enterprise e3 trial license to a user who have been assigned the office 365 business premium license before and now you want to change it back? if so, you just need to uncheck the office 365 enterprise e3
 trial license box and check the office 365 business premium license box in the <strong>
assigned license</strong> page (refer to the first point below to navigate to the
<strong>assigned license</strong> page).</p>
<p>if you encounter any problem during the procedure, we suggest you open a new thread with the points below in our forum since this query is different from your original one. this can also let other community members find the useful information quickly when
 they encounter the same scenario in the future. thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>1. a screenshot about the user’s license page. to navigate to the page:</p>
<p>a. login to office 365 admin center.</p>
<p>b. click <b>users</b>-&gt;<b>active users</b>-&gt;select the user.</p>
<p>c. click <b>edit</b> after <b>assigned license</b> in the right panel. the picture below is for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3861311-394d-4ba6-80ec-cd00658c3f01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3861311-394d-4ba6-80ec-cd00658c3f01" /></a></p>
<p>to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;the <b>use rich formatting </b>button in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<b>insert /edit media</b> like the picture shows below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40599ca5-f176-42a0-9edb-47fb7f4a0669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40599ca5-f176-42a0-9edb-47fb7f4a0669" /></a></p>
<p>2. the detailed steps about how you assign the office 365 enterprise e3 trial license to the user who have been assigned an office 365 business premium license before.</p>

            <p>Antennas in modern smartphones are in general not efficient, and typically have a loss of some decibel, not a gain. The specific design and manufacture vary and may be based on something like this Wikipedia article:<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted-F_antenna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted-F_antenna</a><br />
I'm not aware of the technical details regarding impedance, radiation pattern etc. ever made publicly available for any Lumia phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several other factors than the antenna itself are in play when it comes to holding a connection, or providing the best possible data speed. The mobile industry and government institutions in Europe cannot agree on common standards to measure mobile connection
 reliability and performance, after trying for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In everyday use, a hands-free Bluetooth or wired headset can make a huge difference in poor coverage. Also notice the antenna locations on the phone:<br />

<h2>            Word 2016 Delete Whole Line Cursor Jumps to End of Document</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if you could help me? I am having an issue with a document in Word 2016 (Windows 10)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a document with a lot of information filled in in text boxes and tables and when I try to delete a line of text, upon deleting the last character, instead of the line below moving up, the cursor jumps to the bottom of the very last page of the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? This seems like a bug but could be some miscellaneous feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t send attachments on Outlook.com using Chrome &#40;Mac OS X&#41;</h2>
                    I was able to send attachments using Chrome, but suddenly was unable to during the last week of March. It happened in the span of a few hours (was able to send in the morning, but not in the afternoon). &nbsp;As this is a work email, it's extremely frustrating!
 &nbsp;I've seen that other people have had this problem in IE, but no one seems to have mentioned using Chrome recently with this problem.
<div>Any advice?</div>

OP here - I still have the same problem, too. &nbsp;It must be a Microsoft issue. &nbsp;I CAN use attachments in Safari, but I prefer Chrome. &nbsp;Also, I have recently had issues with my email settings in Safari that I don't have in Chrome. All I want to do is be able to
 work, and unfortunately, work dictates using Microsoft Webmail.

<h2>            A trusted device, without its sim card, has to be given in for repair and I want to remotely close my outlook account on it and stop it sycnching</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two other trusted devices: an ipad and the one which is the problem - my samsung mobile. The mobile has crashed to point where I cannot even do a factory reset as no buttons work at all. It is going in for repair.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is I have about 8 different email accounts on it, including my hotmail account. Ideally I want to remotely remove them, but at very least I want to&nbsp;&nbsp; stop them synching. I have changed my password for hotmail twice today and my other trusted device
 immediately synched and has given me no prompt to update password. So this tells me that the mobile will have synched too, so I have no idea how to make my outlook mail account be unusable and unreadable to anyone who gets my phone working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed sim card, but I do not think that will stop the emails from being accessible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened to me before and I ended up just never having phone repaired to stop this happening.</p>
<p>Please can anyone help me to&nbsp; know how to protect my emails from being seen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much</p>

</p><p>As far as our knowledge goes, Microsoft doesn't have the ability to remotely remove your Hotmail account on your device. On the other hand, we recommend that you contact Samsung and check if they can access your device and ask them to remove your email accounts
 synced to your mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions, feel free to post it here and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have verified that Craigslist is not blocked from any of your Outlook.com settings, it may have something to do with the setup on the Craigslist email account itself. Are you the owner of the Cragslist email account? Have you received any bounce-back
 email notification on your Cragslist email account that an email was not sent successfully? Most of the email used for businesses do not permit sending email outside the network. You may have to check with your network administrator if this is the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            Hi. Thank you for your reply. If i post an ad on CL i get replies to the ad but if i respond to another ad, i dont receive replies. Ie if i respond to my own ad as an anonymous responder i receive it but if i reply to my own response the reply does not
 come through. It seems if an email has domain from pers.craigslist.org it comes through but craigslist.org does not. Neither domain is blocked in my settings.&nbsp;

            Assuming that you have not otherwise changed the configuration of your phone after the hard/soft reset, Marketplace maintains a record of all your prvious purchases/application installations and restoring them to your device should be straightforward.<br />
<br />
You did not mention which version of WIndows Mobile you were using, but assuming it in WM 6.5,
<br />
<br />
After resetting your device launch Windows Marketplace for Mobile. You may be prompted to update the Marketplace version. Once Marketplace is up-to-date, select Sign In from Menu and enter the Windows Live credentials used for you previous purchases. After
 Sign-In is complete, your previous purchases/downloads should be listed under My Applications\Ready to Install.

<h2>            Scanning and Editing in Word</h2>
                    Greetings! &nbsp;I have to edit a typewritten manuscript. &nbsp;I scanned the originals to PDF files, which I then converted to word files with Adobe. &nbsp;I knew that the text wouldn't convert exactly. &nbsp;The problem that I'm having is I can't seem to get all of the
 fonts the same. &nbsp;When highlighted it says they're all the same font type and size, but they appear very different. &nbsp;Any help greatly appreciated!!

            <p>You are asking a lot of OCR if you imagine you can get accurate font information from a typewritten document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best plan would be to select the whole document (CTRL+A) then apply the normal style and then click CTRL+SPACE and CTRL+Q. This will return the document to the underlying normal style. You can then apply whatever formatting you require to get a close
 match to the original.<br />
</p>
<p>That should keep you amused for a while :)</p>

</p><p>The sending email address is listed as trusted and I have no blocked addresses or message rules/forwarding. I have also not received emails from other Company email addresses (non-outlook) but they do occasionally come through.</p>

<h2>            How do I put a symbol in the subject line of an e-mail&#63;</h2>
                    For example, I am receiving e-mails with stars in the subject line for July 4th. I would like to be able to do that too, but when I am in the subject line Outlook won't display the symbols character set and a symbol font such as Zapf Dinbats doesn't seem
 to work in the subject line either. And yet, I can copy the star symbol in the subject line from an e-mail I received from an art supply company and paste it in the subject line of a new e-mail. How can I do this "from scratch" and with other symbol besides
 stars?

    <title>Using Bing Translator for RSS Feeds &#47; Yahoo Pipes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliestorey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Bing Translator for RSS Feeds &#47; Yahoo Pipes</h2>
                    I use Bing translator in Yahoo Pipes to translate RSS feeds, and then aggregate in the Feedly RSS syndicator. However, only the RSS feed header/title text is translated.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have a more elegant way around any part of this, ideally to produce fully translated news articles from the RSS?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

<h2>            Sorry, something went wrong and Word was unable to start. &#40;24&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get a free subscription to Office 365 through my university but after about a year, it was time to renew the subscription. So I went to do that through my college e-mail and it said that in order for me to renew it, I had to uninstall the Office 365 that
 I had. So I did all of that, reinstalled Office 365, and I thought that was the end of it.</p>
<p>However, I've been having a lot of trouble whenever I just <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hover</span></strong>&nbsp;over a Word or an Excel document. Without even opening the file, I get the "Sorry, something went wrong and Word was unable to
 start. (24)" error message. I never even clicked on the file to open it so I don't understand why the error message pops up anyways. And whenever I do have Excel or Word opened, the error message pops up constantly!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling all over again, I've ran the Fix-It tool, and I know it's not a problem with whatever add-ins Excel and Word have because I can open them up in Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it was time to renew my subscription to Office 365, I had just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any insight to this problem.</p>

<p>Hi Rosaelis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I notice that you could open the Office clients in Safe Mode. If the Office application starts in Safe Mode, the issue may be related to the add-ins, you may disable the add-ins one at
 a time and check the outcome. To do that:</p>
<p>1.With the Office application still in Safe Mode, click
<strong>File &gt; Options &gt; Add-Ins.</strong></p>
<p>2.Next to the
<strong>Manage list</strong>, click <strong>Go</strong>.</p>
<p>3.Uncheck one of the add-ins in the list and click
<strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>4.Restart the application (not in Safe Mode this time).</p>
<p>If the Office application starts, there’s a problem with the add-in you unchecked. We recommend you visit the company website for the add-in to check for an updated version you can install.
 If there isn’t a newer version or if you don’t need to use the add-in you can leave it unchecked or remove it from your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the detailed information, please refer to the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspXWhy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/why-cant-i-start-my-office-2013-application-HA104011864.aspXWhy</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issue is related to Office Clients and our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, I suggest you post a new thread on&nbsp;<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=word%2COffice2016setupdeploy%2Cexcel%2Coutlook%2Cofficesetupdeploy%2Cofficeitpro%2COffice2016ITPro&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;searchTerm=sorry%2C%20something%20went%20wrong%20and%20word%20was%20unable%20to%20start%20%2424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet

<p>Hi BarbaraHarellBA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to unsubscribe to email news letters or notifications you can go to:
<em>Settings on the top left (gear icon)&gt;&gt; View Outlook settings&gt;&gt;Subscriptions&gt;&gt; Click Unsubscribe&gt;&gt;then follow through the next steps</em>. You can use the screenshots below as reference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c868423f-76af-4ceb-8df6-09f2786d36d8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c868423f-76af-4ceb-8df6-09f2786d36d8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If can't unsubscribe from the email notifications, as a work around you can block them so that they will go straight
 to your Junk mail folder. You can go to: <em>Settings&gt;&gt; View all Outlook settings&gt;&gt;Junk email&gt;&gt;Under Block senders and domains&gt;&gt; Add the email that you want to block.
</em>You can check the screenshot below if you need reference. </p>

<p>Have you read those messages carefully? Have you, in fact, subscribed or are&nbsp;they simply&nbsp;scam/phishing attempts that outlook is now classifying as subscriptions? On one of my Gmail accounts, I receive many "Unsubscribe" emails for lists or services or sites

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the migration of Skype to Microsoft, &nbsp;we need to link the Skype account to a Microsoft account before we can proceed deleting it. And if you linked the Skype&nbsp;account to your e-mail address, we cannot unlink them, which makes it not possible to delete
 the Skype account without deleting the Microsoft e-mail address attached to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your question.</p>

<h2>            Emails does not reach recipient in Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: E-mails I send are not getting through and post master is not informing me of that as it used to do, Are they being blocked?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am convinced that e-mails I am sending out are being blocked for the longest while&nbsp;as quite a few people tell me that they have not received e-mails which required a response. I&nbsp;checked in my sent box and indeed the e-mails were sent to them. These are
 relatives and good friends of mine and they would not all be lying to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to test the theory further by sending out e-mails&nbsp;to contact addresses that no longer exist but I have stored on my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past postmaster would alert me to the
 fact that the contact address is a. no longer in use, b. message is&nbsp;undeliverable&nbsp; c.&nbsp; person's email box is full&nbsp;&nbsp;or d. the e-mail account does not exist with that provider. Now I do not even get any of those messages at all. I even made up a fictitious e-mail
 address and thought this would definitely bounce and I would be informed of such. It went and no message came back. What is going on?&nbsp; I am a technophobe and when I contact the helpdesk via e-mails they send me to links which do not in anyway address the problem
 which just adds to my frustration. Help !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

    <title>Outlook email does not sync through wifi - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook email does not sync through wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Nokia Lumia 1520 updated to the last SW available today. As required, I have an Outlook.com account as my main account, and I have an issue retrieving new mails that only happen when connected to wifi. I don´t receive push email, even though I set
 this option on settings. If I enter the email app and refresh, I receive all my email, but if I don´t do this, I don´t have any notification.</p>
<p>This doesn´t occur through my data connection, it's only through wifi. I've tried restoring the phone but it still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen some more cases after a search on the www.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to solve it? It's important for me to have push email notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I think the problem you describe is more to do with using a wifi connection exclusively on a phone for push email than it is for how outlook.com pushes email to the phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The nature of a wifi connection as it relates to a windows phone (or probably any other connected device) is that as long as the device is alive (not in sleep mode) the wifi connection remains active, but when the device goes to sleep or standby mode the
 wifi connection becomes inactive (or goes to sleep) and so any notifications that might be pushed to a device would be delayed as long as the wifi connection is inactive.&nbsp; Since an active wifi connection can be a power drain on a mobile device, most mobile
 devices suspend the wifi connection when the device goes into standby or sleep mode. A data connection is continuously connected to a phone (or at least as long as the phone is "in network range" of the cellular system's network), so the phone doesn't experience
 the same kind of notification delay it might encounter while only connected via wifi connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Phone 8 has an option that you can set that will keep the wifi on even after the screen on the device goes dark.&nbsp; This setting is turned off (by default) since turning it on can potentially drain the phone's battery.&nbsp; You can change the option on
 your phone by going to Settings &gt; wi-fi &gt; tap the "advanced" button &gt; place a checkmark in the box next to "Keep Wi-Fi on when the screen times out."</p>
