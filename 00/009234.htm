<h2>            outlook on IOS keeps asking for password</h2>
                    <p>I have 4 email accounts - one of them is an exchange account.</p>
<p>This has worked reliably for more than a year</p>
<p>With the last outlook update, outlook keeps asking me to re-enter the exchange account password</p>
<p>any idea what broke or how to fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Frank</p>

<p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if you have multiple apps running on your phone. I highly suggest signing in then close all the Office apps. You should not be getting a prompt after restarting
<strong>Outlook</strong>. If these steps did not work, kindly go to the settings, delete your email account, then add it back in.
<em>(<strong>Note</strong>: Do not change the email account to Outlook, it should be added as Exchange account.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the issue persists, I recommend posting it in the
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=exchangeserver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet forum</a></strong> where you can find IT professionals that can help regarding Exchange account/ server issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you need any additional assistance regarding Microsoft services, feel free to post your query anytime.</p>

<h2>            How Can I Untangle My Login Muddle - or A Little Knowledge Is A Dangerous Thing</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop Sunday, along with a licence for Office 360. The people I'm working with are comfortable with Windows 8 and Excel and it just seemed to make sense that I would try to make my configuration as much like theirs as possible. I went through
 what seemed like a very simple laptop setup and then 'installed' Office. I'm sorry to have to admit it, but I've used the remember me feature so long that I've forgotten the password to my Microsoft Account. I finally got a text code (the turn around time
 on that is incredibly long) that allowed me to reset my password. Still, I felt like the new work platform was ready for the week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Monday, &nbsp;I started up the laptop and the account that I'm asked to sign in to is a non-Microsoft email that had been set up as an alias. That password is not available, well the short answer is that I screwed up. Right now, admitting that my previous
 experience with just knowing enough about Windows (dating back to arguments over the GUI vs the Command Line), it feels like I've 'bricked' my new laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for pointers on how to get Windows 8 to let go and to set up a clean Office installation. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help out a disgruntled user with age and legacy software learning disabilities.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you mean by â€˜I started up the laptop and the account that I'm asked to sign in to is a non-Microsoft email that had been set up as an aliasâ€™?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you prompted to sign into the non-Microsoft email while accessing the Office applications or after starting up the laptop&nbsp;at the login screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which account is used to subscribe Office 365 (Microsoft account or the alias account)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To perform a clean installation of Office, you may deactivate Office 365 by signing into the My Account Page after which re-download and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To completely remove Office 365 on the computer, let us run the <strong>Fix it</strong> from the following article.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To deactivate Office 365, sign into <a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.office.com/myaccount</a> with the Microsoft Account that was used to purchase/subscribe Office 365. Here you will see the computer name registered. You may select the Computer name and deactivate it. For more information on the same, refer to the following
 link.</p>

<h2>            Office 2007 shortcuts</h2>
                    <b>Who had the brilliant idea of changing the old so common shortcuts?</b> How come my save command is now ctrl+F12 instead of ctrl+S, how come my ctrl-Z is now alt+BACK ??<br />
<br />
And most importantly - <b>How do I change it back??</b><br />

            The default shortcut assignments (in all versions of Word, as far as I'm aware) include the three combinations Ctrl+S, Shift+F12, and Alt+Shift+F12 for the Save command and both Ctrl+Z and Alt+Backspace for the Undo command.<br />
<br />
If the Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Z shortcuts don't work in your installation, it's possible that they were "stolen" by an add-in -- have you installed any new add-ins lately?<br />
<br />
You can restore them by clicking the Office button in the top left corner of Word, clicking Word Options at the bottom of the menu, clicking Customize on the left side of the Options dialog, and clicking the Keyboard Shortcuts: Customize button near the bottom
 left corner. In the Customize Keyboard dialog, make sure Normal.dotm is selected in the "Save Changes In" box. Then:<br />
<ul>
<li>With the "Office Menu" item selected in the Categories list, find and click on the FileSave item in the Commands list. If Ctrl+S isn't listed in the Current Keys box, click in the "Press new shortcut key" box and type Ctrl+S. Then click the Assign button
 at the bottom left.</li><li>Scroll the Categories list to the bottom and click on "All Commands". Then find and click on the EditUndo item in the Commands list. If Ctrl+Z isn't listed in the Current Keys box, click in the "Press new shortcut key" box and type Ctrl+Z. Then click the
 Assign button at the bottom left.</li><li>Click the Close button at the bottom right.</li></ul>
<p>When you exit from Word, if it prompts you to save changes to the Normal.dotm template, click Yes.<br />

    <title>Hotmail &#47; Outlook Email Logout Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stumpedalso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail &#47; Outlook Email Logout Problem</h2>
                    <p>I think there's a problem with the Signout button for Hotmail.com email for mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit the Signout&nbsp;button it appears to&nbsp;log me out, but when I want to log back in I get a "Bad Request" note.&nbsp; I have more than one hotmail account, so I have to try to&nbsp;log in to my other account in order&nbsp;to receive a notice that I'm already logged
 in and&nbsp;the system gives me two choices - &nbsp;I can either stay logged in to that account&nbsp;or I can&nbsp;logout from that account to sign in to another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to just be a problem with my mobile device.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far I haven't had&nbsp;this problem with my desktop PC.&nbsp; I've tried deleting my cache, cookies, history, etc, but that doesn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please fix the mobile&nbsp;program so when I Signout, I stay signed out?&nbsp; It would also be helpful if Microsoft eliminates the auto login feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            OWA &#40;ActiveSync&#41; Certificate problem on E72 devices</h2>
                    
<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a Portuguese System Administrator from Portugal that have a <strong>"nice"</strong> problem with
<strong>E72 devices</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My company have several Nolia E72 that are used to access our corporate email service using (Mail for Exchange) App - Microsoft ActiveSync. Last weekend we change the web server certificate of our OWA (IIS Server of the HUB Exchange Machine) because the
 previous one had expired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Since then all Nokia E72 devices cannot check e-mail.</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also tried to open in the default Symbian Web Browser the URL <a href="https://remote.companyname.pt/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://webmail.companyname.pt/owa</a> and the device reports that it <strong>"cannot establish a secure communication with the server".</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some troubleshooting we concluded that the problem is located on the certificate because is was issued by a Intermediate CA with a public key with a lenght of
<strong>4096 bits</strong>. Somewhere in the Internet we also read that the Symbian in E72 devices only support certificates with PK length of 2048.
<strong>This is true?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell us If there is an Symbian update or a patch to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note I&nbsp;</strong> : We try with Opera Browser and with it we can access the URL
<a href="https://remote.companyname.pt/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://webmail.companyname.pt/owa</a> but this is not a solution for our company</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note II</strong> : Exchange OWA service is published with ISA Server 2006 Web listener.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note III</strong>: For other brands (Apple Iphone 4/4s/5, HTC, Blackberry) this is not a problem because the activesync is up and running</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for you time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Luis</p>

<p>After installing that SIS file, and rebooting once, my Nokia E72 is able to connect to certificates which contain UTF-8 characters in the issuer field. Looking at the certificates you send me via private message, I guess this Unicode thing was the root cause
 of your issue.</p>

    <title>Find and Replace Macro that Changes Font color - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smooth813  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find and Replace Macro that Changes Font color</h2>
                    Hey all,<br />
<br />
I have a macro that takes the value in the current cell, finds that same value in other cells, and replaces all of them with one pre-set value.&nbsp; It goes like this:<br />
<br />
Sub Name()<br />
&nbsp;Dim strF As String, strR As String, WS As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp; strF = ActiveCell.Value<br />
&nbsp; strR = "My Name" 'Change this to be whatever you want to replace with<br />
&nbsp; For Each WS In Worksheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WS.Cells.Replace What:=strF, Replacement:=strR, LookAt:=xlWhole<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
I was trying to do a minor edit on the macro that would format the font of the pre-set value to a certain color so it would stand out. I don't know much about VBA, so I recorded a macro and tried to insert it in.&nbsp; When I did, it would only change the format
 of the current cell and not any other cell that was found, if that makes sense.&nbsp; Basically, If there were 3 instances of "X", and I wanted to replace with a bold red "Y", the macro below would replace all the Xs with Ys, but only the first Y found would be
 formatted correctly. Here is what I got:<br />
<br />
Sub AndrewF()<br />
&nbsp;Dim strF As String, strR As String, WS As Worksheet<br />
&nbsp; strF = ActiveCell.Value<br />
&nbsp; strR = "Andrew F" 'Change this to be whatever you want to replace with<br />
&nbsp; For Each WS In Worksheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WS.Cells.Replace What:=strF, Replacement:=strR, LookAt:=xlWhole<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
With Selection.Font<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Color = -16776961<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Font.Bold = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .HorizontalAlignment = xlCenter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .VerticalAlignment = xlBottom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .WrapText = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Orientation = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .AddIndent = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .IndentLevel = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ShrinkToFit = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ReadingOrder = xlContext<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .MergeCells = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
<br />
Andrew<br />

            <p>Hi oï¼¶eekâ—‹ÐžÎ¿H, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. We understand that your mobile data usage increased due to repeatedly sent email from your mobile device and that you also want a written document regarding the said issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry but we don't provide such information.&nbsp; There might be some problems with the synchronization that resulted to the email being sent multiple times.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can resolve this by removing and re-adding your account from the phone. Check out this link for the steps:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook-to-go#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mobile Outlook.com.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, ensure that the mail server settings are properly configured. Refer to this link for the values:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Send and receive Hotmail from an email app.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, please confirm if the said issue also happens via Outlook.com web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the above steps worked or if you have other questions that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue with my iPhone 6 Plus. &nbsp;I had spent over an hour on the phone with an Apple tech &nbsp;- deleting the account from my iPhone 6 Plus, re-setting my phone to the original manufacturing setting, and finally verifying the configuration
 on the mail account is correct per the link. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are next steps as I have tried to chat someone live in Microsoft chat but the window that popped-up said I was 87 in line due to high volume. &nbsp; I am now at the number 1 slot for over an hour and need to go home losing my position and elevating my frustration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never used to happen before. &nbsp;How sad that Microsoft has not found resolution as this issue will get bad publicity via Social Media, word or mouth in various forums on the internet and between friends/businesses which will quickly make it to Tech Mag
 Publishers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People need more than a generic answer or a piece of paper, people needs resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what the fix is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you<br />
</p>

<h2>            Outlook changing my recurring appointments and events into meetings&#33;</h2>
                    I use Outlook a lot and since switching to Office 365 at work, many of my appointments or events that are recurring items change into recurring meetings by itself! I have just found I can cancel the meeting and it seems to reset to a recurring appointment
 but this is getting ridiculous to constantly having to fix my calendar! Any help??

            We have Office 365 at work using an Exchange Server (screen shot 1) so I guess it is for Business. I use by going to the Web and logging into Office, I use it at work using Office Outlook on my computer, I use it on my cell, iPad, and Mac. I find that
 if I set up a recurring event or appointment, sooner or later it changes it into a meeting (see second screen shot). I can click on cancel and change it back into a meeting but this is most annoying as I have many of these scheduled on my calendar. This never
 happened until we went to Office 365 at my college that is what I meant by work, I use the application primarily through our college licenses. As an employee, I get access for my personal devices for free.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a82b6153-d8c5-4cf9-8665-43474b3115f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a82b6153-d8c5-4cf9-8665-43474b3115f8" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e14741a-5754-44b6-9576-9c42d8d6b2e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e14741a-5754-44b6-9576-9c42d8d6b2e6" /></a>

<h2>            Quick Steps in Outlook 365</h2>
                    Hello all~ I'd like to create a Quick Step in Outlook whereby I can reply to an email and have my REPLY go immediately to the deleted items folder, bypassing the Sent folder. I've tried various command under QS and I'm thinking it can't be done. I'm hoping
 that I'm just not getting the right combination. Does anyone know&nbsp; a solution&nbsp;using QS or elsewhere? I'm using Office 365 Pro Plus in case this matters. Thank you. Donna

<p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally understand that you want to quick steps or other option to let your reply emails go to Deleted Items directly (not go to Sent Items). Unfortunately, for Outlook, we have no such setting or option to archive it. In Outlook, when you reply emails,
 the replied emails got to Sent Items, it is normal. So, we also would love to invite you leave your thought on
<strong><em><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook UserVoice</a></em></strong>, our UserVocie team will notice at you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can also tell us why you want your replied emails go to Deleted Items directly? Maybe we can find another workaround or method to meet your need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Room Booking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamiewsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Room Booking</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added a room in O365 Resources as 'Meeting Room' with the purpose of creating a calendar so the meeting room can be booked by members of staff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the 'meeting room' calendar now on everyone's PC,&nbsp;and it works in the sense that the meeting room calendar appears as 'busy', but I would like it to display with the persons name, subject and times so it is evident who&nbsp;has booked the room without
 having to review other members of staff's own calendars. Is it possible to do this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried sharing my calendar etc but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

<p><span>According to my test, the room calendar events should exhibit the details (organizerâ€™s name, meeting start time and end time, location). The following screenshot is for your reference:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f2400ed-1ffc-4b87-8f6a-4eacf61ecbdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f2400ed-1ffc-4b87-8f6a-4eacf61ecbdd" /></a></p>
<p><span>In the above screenshot, we can see that the room calendar event (April 25<sup>th</sup>) shows most of the details except the â€œmeeting subject).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here, Iâ€™d like to say we can add the room calendar to the Outlook client directly as we can see the calendarâ€™s â€œfree/busyâ€ information in Office 365 by default. Under such a circumstance, the users wonâ€™t be able to see other details (besides
 â€˜free/busyâ€™ information). However, we can set the suitable permission (Owner, Viewer or Editor,etc) on the room calendar for the users. As a result, the users will be able see all the details but not the meeting subject. For assign the room calendar permission
 for the users, you can refer to (You may contact your admin for help as the following steps should be performed by an admin):</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a> via an
<strong>admin credential</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Run the following cmdlet</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><em><span>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity &lt;room address&gt;:\calendar -user &lt;user address&gt; -AccessRights Editor</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>After that, the users can add the room calendar. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above information doesnâ€™t meet your requirement, please upload a screenshot about the room calendar on the user side.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,<br />
Alan</span></p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've getting this error related to the TEXTJOIN function using Excel 365 latest desktop version . I tried an online repair without success. None of the latest functions such as TEXTJOIN, IFS, SWITCH work. They used to work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using version 1906 (Build 11727.20104 Click-to-Run). I can use successfully using Excel Online...</p>

<p>Hi Sukie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>I'm using O365 subscription and i've been using for years (as mentionned I've done it successfully in Excel Online which requires an O365 subscription). I had read this in many threads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only guess that the error happened after some Office update. It happened in all spreadsheet. So I guess an upgrade broke something. The repair didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, I uninstalled Office and reinstalled and it fixed the issue. Looks like Office gets broken a few times a year lately! When it's not Excel, it's Outlook or Skype for Business or Onedrive! When in doubt - reinstall!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Martin</p>

<h2>            E71 does not startup, battery charged, worked fine for 5 months.</h2>
                    
<p>My E71 has mysteriously stopped booting up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched my sim card over to check messages on my old number, when I tried to restart it wouldn't boot.&nbsp; Now doing the same with the original simcard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key lights come on.&nbsp; Screen light on, but the Nokia logo does not appear and the phone doesn't boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 30 Seconds the lights go out and the appear just appears to be off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery was fully charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried plugging in to recharge and exactly the same thing happens - ie. the backlights come on but the battery charging icon does not appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have removed battery and sim and checked for dust/dirt on the terminals.&nbsp; I have left out overnight, reinsterted sim and battery and still doing the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's about 5 months old.&nbsp; Never been dropped, got wet, got too hot etc etc.&nbsp; I have installed two additional programs the Scoot Skype application and the internet radio application.&nbsp; All else is standard.</p>

<p>The same thing happens to me also. Though I found out that if I start charging the phone, after ~5 min the battery bars appears and then I can start the phone. So the charger solutions is the only one I can use in order to start my phone up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that there is a file that you can flash your phone with - " <a href="http://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/attachment.php?attachmentid=186933&amp;d=1233663403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>If it's only with updating, it's probably not a huge issue. It doesn't take long for a device to update, so it doesn't sound like the end of the world. But, you could try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Search â€œ<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>â€ in the Cortana search box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select â€œ<strong>View All</strong>â€ at the top left.</p>

<p>Select â€œ<strong>Network Adapter</strong>â€ and follow the instructions. Windows will attempt to troubleshoot your issue.</p>
