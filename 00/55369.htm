<p><span><span><span><span>Windows Photo Viewer cannot be removed. It comes with Windows 7 by default.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Com surrogate Trojan removal</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; Ok all heres the Deal I have 2 com surrogates that seem to start themselves and when they get going my Fan kicks way up, and My Gaming Ping starts Spiking Like Crazy at times late at night It will be perfect and solid for hours . But, when my ping starts
 spiking i go to my Task manager and there are 2 Com surrogates running, within 5 seconds they Magically Vanish. If I am quick enough I can end process on them. Then my gaming ping suddenly evens out. it will spike up and down like Crazy and max out at 988.
 Thought i had this issue fixed my ping was solid for 2 weeks. Then When i woke up this morning. There was a Homegroup Icon on my desktop that didnt Belong there. I checked the settings they were off. I tried to delete the shortcut but to no avail.&nbsp; Then I
 decided to disconnect from the Wi-Fi and as soon as i turned it off the Homegroup Icon Vanished on its own the second I hit the switch... I have tried several malware tools. I installed Malwarebytes&nbsp; and Avira antivirus and on the first scan Malwarebytes detected
 5 Malware files and when i used the fix tool the Avira antivirus alerted me that there was something trying to access the registry. I blocked it. and the com surrogates went away for hours.&nbsp; I ran a scan with System Mechanic and it said there were 13 registry
 errors. I hit repair and restarted My Computer.&nbsp; afterwards My System was Fine for about 20 minutes. Then suddenly What do you Know they came Back, and now Malwarebytes says My system is clean.&nbsp; So I need help bad. I Cant afford any programs or the Microsoft
 service to remove this useless little piece of Negativity.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's making Me Really hate the fact that I CANT BOOT IN SAFE MODE with windows 8.1. And I wont update to windows 10 until I have this problem resolved. THIS IS A 2,000.00 laptop and I find it appalling
 that Microsoft has refused to check my system and remove it unless I shell out over $100. Because their firewall software cant even protect their own operating system. If this is not resolved I'm switching over to Mac.</p>

            <p>Hi Demos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <code><span>dllhost.exe</span></code> process goes by the name COM Surrogate and the only time you're likely even to notice its existence is when it crashes and you get the message COM Surrogate has stopped working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The COM Surrogate is a fancy name for Sacrificial process for a COM object that is run outside of the process that requested it. Explorer uses the COM Surrogate when extracting thumbnails, for example. If you go to a folder with thumbnails enabled, Explorer
 will fire off a COM Surrogate and use it to compute the thumbnails for the documents in the folder. It does this because Explorer has learned not to trust thumbnail extractors; they have a poor track record for stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer has decided to absorb the performance penalty in exchange for the improved reliability resulting in moving these dodgy bits of code out of the main Explorer process. When the thumbnail extractor crashes, the crash destroys the COM Surrogate process
 instead of Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform SFC (System File Checker) scan and see if it helps. </p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to try to run&nbsp;the system in&nbsp;a selective startup. You can start Windows 8.1 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>            fsx odd behavior since update</h2>
                    <p>numerous people had issues with fsx running after the fall update, the issue was described here</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054150/issues-when-windows-10-fall-creators-update-calls-createwindowex-for-s</p>
<p>
</p><p>however the "fix" seems to have created other issues</p>
<p>specifically, fsxinsider.com web content does not show when starting fsx, and more importantly (since i fly gliders exclusively) winch x
</p>
<p>http://www.luerkens.homepage.t-online.de/peter/</p>
<p>no longer loads. cumulus x runs fine but not winch x</p>
<p>manually running the exe i see it load in background apps using about 10&nbsp; m ram, after 20-30 seconds it simply disappears and never loads into active apps</p>

<h2>            Surface Book &#40;i5&#47;8GB&#47;256GB&#41; with NVIDIA GeForce GPU is not compatible with Windows Mixed Reality, Really&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I update my machine as soon as a new update comes in. Today I installed the Windows Mixed Reality PC Check app and found that this machine is not compatible. The GPU part is giving yellow exclamation with a warning, but the driver Graphics Driver 21.21.13.7667
 (WDDM) is not compatible with Red X. My machine runs on Windows 10 (1709). My 5 years old entry level Lenovo G520 is compatible with this and it has only Intel graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit disappointed and kind of puzzled. But, anyway, keeping rant aside, is there any update to the graphics driver coming for this from either Microsoft or NVIDIA?</p>

    <title>The &#34;pending&#34; problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jck535646  say:</h3>
<h2>            The &#34;pending&#34; problem</h2>
                    <p>Ordered an adapter from the Microsoft store three days ago. It has not shipped, I have not been charged, nothing has happened. When I order from Amazon, I get confirmation. I get charged by Amazon in less than a single day and the goods ship the next day.
 I get tracking. I get information. These things are good because customers like knowing that gears are turning. I guess Microsoft missed that memo though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The amount of posts I've seen with people complaining about orders stuck in pending is ridiculous for such a large company. Shipping an adapter the size of my pinky finger is NOT THAT HARD. Charging my bank account via PayPal is NOT THAT HARD. Responding
 to customer queries without copying and pasting the same basic response paragraph is really NOT THAT HARD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could probably drive to whatever fulfilment center this stupid adapter is located at faster than Microsoft would take to switch the status from "pending" to "shipped". This is pretty sucky, Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will I be charged? Will my order ever ship? Are orders supposed to start in "pending" for days on end with no updates whatsoever? If I get a copy/paste response, then at least I know I'm screwed here. Just GIVE ME SOMETHING. Give other loyal customers
 in the same circumstance something to go on. Act like the big boy company that you are, Microsoft.</p>

            Unfortunately, this is a billing issue, so, we can't provide much useful information for what you can do is call Microsoft support directly then relay your information to them.

<p>Then how about dropping me an email or a status update on the order page telling me THAT. TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR ORDERS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this really that hard to comprehend? "Pending" doesn't tell anyone anything, and if you don't check your order you'll never even know it's stuck in "pending". It really boggles my mind on so many levels how incompetent the system is here. Why can't an
 email be sent? I REALLY would like to know.</p>

            I definitely sympathize, but because this is a peer to peer forum (a fellow customer, helping a fellow customer). The contact us page would be the best way to make something happen.

<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by you have no start menu?</p>
<p>Does it not appear when you press the Windows button in the bottom left?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try booting into a recovery disk and running a reinstall but keeping your files.

            The start button only works on the right side but not the left. &nbsp;I have done a reinstall and this worked for &nbsp;a week or so and then it stopped working again. &nbsp;Also the reinstall meant that I had to reinstall all the apps that came with windows 10 which
 I do not want to go through again. &nbsp;There must be a way for Microsoft to fix this as there seems to be a lot of people who are having the same problem.

            I have scanned my PC with another virus protector - comes back no virus found. &nbsp;Tried using scannow and the message is 'did not find any integrity violations'. &nbsp;If I have to go back to Windows 7 again I think I would just keep Windows 7 as it always worked
 for me and I am not very impressed with Windows 10 on this point anyway.

It's probably telling ShellExperienceHost and Cortana need to be reinstalled. Here is how to reinstall&nbsp;<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/start-and-taskbar-stuck-windows-10-fix-shellexperiencehost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the

<p>Sorry, but support gives incorrect information about this. It's not possible to get a free name change. If you're being harrassed, you need to file complaints and block communications on those people. No one here can give you a free name change.</p>

    <title>Separate Skype from Hotmail Login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colincapelle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Separate Skype from Hotmail Login</h2>
                    <p>I had a Skype account linked to my old @hotmail.com address for years and never really used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, I created a new Skype account on my work computer using my work email address, so completely independent from the previous Microsoft login. I have the confirmation email from Skype to the work email address, with a new Skype account ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, at home on my home PC which I log into using the Microsoft account, I cannot access the new work Skype account at all. Similar on my Android phone. Even logging out of everything and separating my home PC login from the Microsoft account, it still does
 not work. If I use the work email address or the new Skype account ID to login, it just says "there is no Microsoft account with that name".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? I just want a different login and identity for work and personal use. Surely not too much of an ask?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Launch programs at startup VS. Launch Apps as Admin. Security policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexmcb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Launch programs at startup VS. Launch Apps as Admin.  Security policy conflict&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
I'm having a bit of trouble getting Windows 10 to behave as it ought.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a number of programs I need to have launch at login, without intervention from the user.&nbsp; Usually, that user is myself, using an account with Admin privileges, and the things I expect to launch are privacy and accessibility tools that I've purchased
 or written over the years, in trying to make my computers more usable for somebody without the use of both hands.&nbsp; I'm not a professional programmer by any means, but having built computers and worked in the tech field for ~15 years now, I think I'm justified
 in calling myself a power user at least.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only solution I've found to make these apps launch- since neither adding shortcuts in the shell:startup folder/start menu, nor MSCONFIG setup worked out of the box (for unsigned, 'you didn't buy this from a microsoft approved vendor' programs)- was
 to go into the Local Security Policy (Windows 10 Pro) setup, and disable the policy "Local policies-&gt;Security Options-&gt;User Account Control: Run All Administrators in Admin Approval Mode."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this promptly broke every App except Settings it seems.&nbsp; Launching the Store makes the screen flash once, and then the icon disappears from the Taskbar; whereas News, Groove Music, Movies &amp; TV, Money, Edge, etc. all state "This App Can't Open:&nbsp;
 &lt;app name&gt; can't be opened using the Built-In Administrator Account. Sign in with a different account and try again."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm signed in as myself, not under the Administrator account.&nbsp; Yes, my personal account is in the 'administrators' group, and thus has elevated privledges, but this seems a bit convoluted and problematic.&nbsp; I get that UAC is very useful for, say, 98%
 of users. But I have Pro for a reason, it shouldn't be SO restrictive that I have to start messing with Policies to get things to launch, and then turn right around and tell me 'oops! you've got too many priveledges! you're not allowed to do this, it might
 break something!'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Apps can't be launched by the Administrator, fine- no need to have knockoff 'SugarSmush' games with superuser rights- but if a member of administrators launches an App, why can't it just launch with 'default user' permissions or something? It seems rather
 backwards that somehow my use of an account in 'administrators' calls the disabled Administrator account, but can't call the equally disabled 'DefaultAccount' for reduced permissions?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just for grins, I tried a suggestion I'd found for solving the 'launching apps with elevated permissions' problem, which was to enable the local policy "Local policies-&gt;Security Options-&gt;User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-In Administrator
 account," but that policy seems to be hamstringed by the policy that allows the Startup folder to function uninhibited.
<br />
</p>
<p>I don't know if this is even worth asking, but is there a way to fix this? Either something that I can do or something that can be fixed in Windows 10 to prevent this apparent conflict?<br />
</p>
<p>I'd like to get more out of Windows 10 than just a pretty upgrade to windows 7 with better underpinnings, by being able to use the Apps that have been built for this platform.&nbsp; Until this gets sorted, I guess I'll just use it like I've used 7, with Programs
 only &amp; no Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts!</p>

            <p>PCR, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but your suggestion addresses a piece of 1/2 of the problem, but doesn't actually look at this security policy / app availability conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any suggestions or other areas where the same issue is being discussed?&nbsp; It seems unlikely that I'm the only person that is trying to run unsigned Desktop Apps at startup and still be allowed to use Windows Store Apps.</p>

            Sorry. I was thinking you might find an app that doesn't require messing with settings &amp; security.&nbsp;Good luck.

            <p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you&nbsp;want to block/remove some apps from kids reach, you can uninstall the App form the Start menu by right clicking on the app and selecting Uninstall. Not all apps have the option to uninstall due to the fact that they are necessary for windows to run
 smoothly, but most apps cannot be uninstalled. You can also uninstall application installed in the computer from Control Panel&gt;Programs and Features&gt;Uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/how-to-uninstall-windows-10-apps/e25945f0-888a-40b5-9d9a-0d8cb0183126">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/how-to-uninstall-windows-10-apps/e25945f0-888a-40b5-9d9a-0d8cb0183126</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can restrict certain apps from being accessed if you create a child account and add it&nbsp;to your computer. Refer the link&nbsp;below&nbsp;for more information.</p>

            <p>Hello Gerry,</p>
<p>i've updated the Realtek Lan-driver to the newest Version found = 10.3.723.2015 (Date: 23.07.2015)</p>
<p>The driver for the AVM ISDN-Controller FRITZ!CARD PCI is the last Version, i found.</p>
<p>It is installed during the Win 10 Installationprocess as it is recommended by AVM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this configuration the error reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next i try to deactivate the AVM-Driver to exclude this source of error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Klaus-G. Johann</p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Home, ver. 1607.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been trying update Windows using 500 different ways, tried many ways to fix, but nothing helped. My update is downloaded, but during install, at about 50% my PC restarts and shows "Restoring your previous version of Windows". After restore I receive
 error 0x8007001f FIRST BOOT MIGRATE DATA<br />

<p>I have tried installing, saving my private files. It failed. Seems I have to make backup of my files on pendrive and do the clean install. I can even make a recovery because I did my system backup when I bought this laptop but I will also loose my files
 so anyway I have to reinstall my Windows. I just wanted to save my files but seems it is not possible in my case.. that's sad.</p>

    <title>Activation problems with Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vladim57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation problems with Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I built a new computer recently and am transferring my registered copy of Win 10 Pro to the new computer. I copied the product id from the information on the old one thinking that was the Win 10 serial number but it is only 20 digits since I got the free
 upgrade from when I had Win 8.&nbsp; Now I am stuck with no way to activate it since what I found online instructing me how to transfer this way had me delete the old codes first from the old machine.&nbsp; Trying to get thru the auto phone call keeps asking me for
 some odd long number from the activation screen but I am finding nothing of the sort and I cannot find a way to actually talk to a live person. Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi vladim57 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />How to know your license type
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste and Enter 
<br />slmgr -dli
<br />It takes 5 to 10 seconds for the result to appear
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, for problems in activation, you should reach out to Microsoft Support for activation help. This is a live agent support not a bot support. They can work with you on this to resolve activation issues.
<br />
<br />By Live Agent Chat - <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />By Phone - You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi  vladim57 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Did you originally upgrade from an OEM or Retail Windows 8 license?
<br />
<br />If its OEM, its not transferable.
<br />
<br />If its retail license, try using the Windows 8 product key to reactivate using chat support or telephone. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also call support:

<br />
<br />If you don't have your product key or proof of purchase, you will unfortunately have to purchase a new full license.

Apparantly the "free upgrade" is not transferable according to the tech from Microsoft. The product key is also not maintained on my Microsoft account for either the digital upgrade nor the old Windows 8 I had. The Win 8 was purchased at a third party site
 as a hard copy.&nbsp; Now they want me to purchase a new digital copy from Microsoft Store then the product key will be stored on my Microsoft account. Not good news for an old fart that is skimping by on disability payments but that is how life can be. Thanks
 for the help though it at least got me to someone live to speak to and explain things in detail. &nbsp;

            That is strange, because, the source license for the free upgrade was your retail Windows 8 license, which should have transfer rights. 
<br />
<br />I would try installing the Windows 8 on the new computer and reactivate it then just do a direct upgrade to it from Windows 10 and it should activate.

            You can also try calling another support agent and explain to them and they might be able to activate it for you.

<p>I was specifically told that the "free upgrade" would only apply to a single unit. Since my laptop is 8 years old I build a new unit from scratch so supposedly the upgrade is not supposed to transfer.&nbsp; Also he said that 20 digit number I recovered from the
 old unit before I deleted the product code from it is called the product ID and will not work for Windows 8 it seems.&nbsp; That's what I get for following "advice" given on you tube videos I am guessing.</p>

            The product key is what would be your proof of purchase, not the 20 character product ID.

    <title>Dual Channel and Flex mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> presentelaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Channel and Flex mode</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know how dual channel and flex mode works. I think I do but need some clarifications please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 1x 4gb DDR3 and 1x 8gb DDR3 totally 12gb. So, CPUID says they are running in dual channel mode.<br />
</p>
<p>My questions are as following:<br />
Q1) 1x 4gb + 0.5x 8gb are running in dual channel; and remaining 4gb is running in flex mode. Is that correct?<br />
</p>
<p>Q2) If I consume over 8gb of ram then what happens? </p>
<p>a) 4+4 gb will be running in dual channel, and remaining 4gb running in single channel mode? Or,</p>
<p>b) the entire 12gb will be running in single channel mode?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Q3. Any difference whether I place my ram back or front? For example, 8gb in slot 1 and 4gb in slot 2; or reverse 4gb in front and 8gb in slot 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ve a Configuración-&gt;OneGuide y a Configuración de dispositivos. Ahí agrega la Tv solo poniendo el nombre en el cuadro de búsqueda y después te pedirá tu provedor de Tv, para eso necesita tu Código Postal y te aparecerán los proveedores de tu area. Click
 en Axtel Tv, y te pedirá el Nombre del sintonizador. Escribe "Kaon" y funcionará el cambio de canales. Hasta ahora Pausar y regresar no está disponible, pero ya se esta buscando en la solución para ese sintonizador.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 ethernet &#47; 3g wireless usb adapter issue.</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>I have an issue on a Windows 10 PC that I have not been able to solve.&nbsp; The PC is connected to a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) via the Motherboards NIC.&nbsp; The machine is running a SCADA program to monitor and control the process running in the PLC.&nbsp;
 When I plug in the USB 3g modem to enable internet access, the USB modem is detected and all appears fine.&nbsp; But if I open a browser all I get is the "no internet" message.&nbsp; If I unplug the ethernet cable, then I have no internet issues at all.&nbsp; Teamviewer
 etc all work fine.&nbsp; If I plug the ethernet cable back in I lose the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to manually set the metrics of each adapter, but have had no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Gav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there's a conflict between your PC's Ethernet and the USB 3G modem connections. Basically, Ethernet connection is prioritized for internet connection, which could be the reason why you're getting
<em>No Internet</em> message when the Ethernet cable is plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, is your PC automatically receiving an IP address from the PLC? If yes, then please try using a static IP on your PC. You can make use of the IP address that it automatically obtained, but just don't input the Default Gateway. Your PC should still
 communicate to the other devices locally while getting online through the USB 3G modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case this won't work, then I recommend that you post this concern in our <strong>
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft TechNet Forums</a></strong> for a more advance and in-depth assistance from IT professionals and experts&nbsp;regarding networking
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other Windows concerns, feel free to post it here in the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> asteffens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t create ESO account in Age of Mythology- Blank Dialog</h2>
                    I purchased two copies of Age of Mythology, one for my friend and one for myself. We both installed and started the game with no problem, but when we try to create a new ESO account to play the game online, a blank dialog box shows up, and when you click
 'Ok' it just goes back to the account information.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First off, I'd like to address the suggestion I have seen on countless pages on the internet. I have seen people say that the error is caused by a security question/answer that does not meet the length requirements. I have tried countless different questions
 and answers ranging from 5 to 50 characters in length, and the blank box pops up every time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second, I would like to confirm that both copies of the game and their keys are legitimate, and we have tried re-installing the game.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We do not wish to play with other players, so I understand direct IP connection would be the best option for us, however I cannot seem to get him connected to my game, using either my IP or Hamachi IP. I have also forwarded the ports for Age of Mythology
 in both my computer firewall and the router.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The following are my computer specifications, if needed:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 Ultimate</div>
<div>AMD Phenom II 3.3 GHz x 6</div>
<div>10 GB DDR5 Memory</div>
<div>ATI Radeon HD 6970</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My friend runs Windows 7 as well, though I am fairly sure the operating system is not at fault, seeing as the game functions perfectly, other than the online gameplay.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have caused due to some windows update crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Perform a
</span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> and check if the issue persists.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow: </span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when
 you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t resolve try with the next method.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>run an inbuilt troubleshooter</strong> which helps you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Refer:</span></strong><span> </span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-troubleshooter</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Windows update troubleshooter makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perform a Windows update and check if the issue resolves.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: If issue still persists I would suggest you to manually
<strong><span>reset Windows Update components</span></strong> and for that try to run the
<strong><span>fixit</span></strong> provided in the following article. If you had already tried the same fixit before I would request you to run the fixit again.</span></p>

            <p>I was told by an AnswerDesk tech that he received notice (while <span>
he was remotely controlling my machine</span>) that the 1511 update has been withdrawn again and an update would become available by Jan. So I might as well wait because I cannot tell if the problem getting the 1511 update for the last three weeks is resolved
 by following your suggestions if it is not currently available.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just had a similar problem while upgrading from build 10586 to build 14393 (1607/Anniversary Upgrade). After a few upgrade attempts, which ended with a STOP error due to hardware issues, Windows Update stopped offering the upgrade. Meanwhile, I fixed the
 hardware and wanted to try upgrading again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was delete the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade\Rollback\[build] registry key (actually, I renamed it) and restart the computer. After that, the next check for updates found the upgrade again
 and proceeded to install it.</p>

<p><span>Hi AnwaarYousaf,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer this question to get clarity on this issue:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you aware of any changes made to the PC prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Quick Access is a new feature in Windows 10 File Explorer navigation pane. This feature is useful, as it helps users quickly navigate to locations which
 are frequently used by you, as well those, which were recently used by you. If you have no use for it, you can however always disable Quick Access in the Navigation Pane of File Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods to check if that works for you.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: You may want to refer to the steps
 from this article to check if that helps. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Pin, remove, and customize in Quick access</span></strong><span>:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027032/windows-pin-remove-and-customize-in-quick-access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: Let us disable and enable Quick Access
 in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Open Folder Options. To do so, open File Explorer, click View, click the small down arrow icon just below the Options and then click Change folder and
 search options to open Folder Options dialog.</span></p>
<p><span>Under the General tab of Folder Options, select This PC from the drop-down box next to Open File Explorer to, and then click Apply button. This will
 ensure that the Quick access is disabled. </span></p>
<p><span>Follow the same steps again and this time Under the General tab of Folder Options, select Quick Access from the drop-down box next to Open File Explorer
 to, and then click Apply button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: If you notice that some weird issues
 related to Quick Access Toolbar, then you may want to reset them as it sets to the default state.</span></p>

            Hi Yatra.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See this tutorial for the ways to change User type:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you truly have Family and other Users missing then there are serious problems with Windows that need repair Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you need Admin permission to do these repairs and still cannot change User type, then enable the hidden Built-In Administrator account used only for emergencies following one of these methods:    <a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-ena...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Yatra24, this may work . .. 
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Then exit Command Prompt and restart
<br />
<br />Upon logging into Windows is the Built In Administrator Account available on the bottom left of the log in page - you might have to log out to see it.
<br />
<br />If that account is available, log into that account and you should then be able to change your account type using netplwiz form that account . . .
