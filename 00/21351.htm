<h2>            sharepoint online office 365 document library</h2>
                    I have a document library in sharepoint online office 365. In this I have a folder child count column. This column is visible in classic mode but when I switched back to online mode the column disappear automatically. I want to know is this the default
 behaviour of office 365 or. Is there some settings &nbsp;to make this column visible in online mode&nbsp;

</p><p><span>Hi Jack,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your confirmation. I’d like to explain that in SharePoint Online, there are some differences for the classic UI and new UI. Not all features are supported in both of them. Folder child count is a View features only supported in the classic
 UI. You may find that Item child count cannot be displayed in new UI either. To learn more about these differences, see

How do I get Word 2007 to automatically open with one column? Now when I create a new document, I have to go to Page Layout and change it to 1 column every time. When I send documents via e-mail, recipients can't see anything but the first page until they adjust
 their columns as well.

<h2>            Access database is way too big</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded one of my Access .mdb databases to Access .accdb database.&nbsp; The records contained an OLE Object field which contained Microsoft Word Documents.&nbsp; The file size was 625,500 KB before and after the conversion.&nbsp; After the conversion, I deleted the
 OLE field and replaced it with an Attachment field, but the file size did not get reduced.&nbsp; This file is 10 times larger than other files I have that have 10 times more Attachment records in them.</p>
<p>My question is:&nbsp; Is there a way that I can reduce this file to a respectable size?&nbsp; I have tried several different things such as copying and renaming, but nothing changes the file size.&nbsp; I am not in a space crunch, but it is just frustrating to see this
 one file so out of line, sizewise.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

<h2>            &#42;update&#42; Sort on a Form record source is not applying</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am applying a sort to the record source of my Form. The source is a query - when I change the sort row of a field in the Design and run the results, the results are accurate. However, after saving and returning to the form, the sort is not correct. "Order
 on Load" is set to "Yes" in the Form Properties, if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to use the sort options through the form (Advanced Filter), I can set up the design, however, when I hit "Toggle Filter", I am not brought back to the form. The screen just stays in the Advanced Filter. When I close that window, no sort has been
 applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorting individual fields, dates, for example, by using the ascending/descending buttons on the Ribbon does work. But, we require sorting fields that are long text, as well, which we cannot do without using the Advanced Filter or by changing the record source.
 Again, the results are accurate when I sort the record source in the query design, but those results are not displaying accurately after returning the the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had a problem with sorting, so this one is confusing me. Does anyone have suggestions on where else I should look for the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you require additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />
Tammy</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>**UPDATE** </strong>- the Record Source (query) of the form was based on three tables. When I removed two of the tables, the sorting returned to the way it has always worked. A field from one of the tables I removed must have been overriding the
 design sorting (but I could not figure out which field). However, I required a field out of the tables I removed. So, I created a second query - I used the original query as the source for the new query, added all of the fields from the original query to the
 design, and saved it under a new name. I changed the Record Source property to the new object and, now, the sorting is working properly.</p>

            Forms are sorted according to the Order By property. A sort applied to the Recordsource of the form may not carry over to the form. So you need to set the Order By property of the form. Filtering is not sorting.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for responding, Scott. I do realize that filtering is not sorting, however, using the Advanced Filter/Sort option (Home tab, Sort &amp; Filter group, Advanced button) is one of the ways to sort fields on a form. I am not filtering, I only want to sort,
 and have the records display correctly on the form. I do not use the Advanced Filter/Sort option&nbsp; as much to sort as I do changing the Record Source, though. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually go to the Design view of the form, go to the Record Source, change the sorting options there, save the change, and when I return to my form, the sort is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another database I run, I can go to the Record Source (query) of a form, change the sort options in the design &nbsp;of the query, and that sort is applied after returning to the form. In the properties for that form, the "Order on Load" property is set to
 "yes and there is no field in the "Order on" property. I've never had to enter anything in the "Order on" property to get forms to sort properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been sorting this way for years, therefore, my confusion as to why the sorts are not "sticking" after returning to the form for another database I'm working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, again!<br />

            Generally, if I want a sort to "stick", I'll put the field in the Order By property of the form. the form will generally follow the Sort order in the Recordsource, but it may not.&nbsp;

            I would recommend that you do not use a saved query as a form's RecordSource property, but its SQL statement.&nbsp; You can still build the query in design view; just don't save it, but instead simply confirm that you want the property updated when you close
 the query design window.&nbsp; That way the RecordSource property will be the SQL statement, not the name of a query.&nbsp; This way you'll get no interference from the OrderBy property of the querydef object which might inadvertently have been set during the design
 process.&nbsp; Why a query has such a property in the first place is difficult to understand.&nbsp; There'll be no performance loss doing it this way; the SQL statement will still be compiled.

            <p>Thanks very much for your response, Ken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my experience, using a SQL statement is not as flexible as creating a query for the object. I like having the tables in the design so that it's easy to add fields in the future, if needed. Also, the combo box wizard does not offer the third choice of
 "Find a record on my form based on the value I selected in my combo box" when using a SQL statement. You have to use a named object as the record source. We get a lot of use out of combo boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is the first time I've had this type of sorting problem, and I've been using Access since the '97 version, I think I'm good, but if it becomes an ongoing problem, I'll try your suggestion of sticking with the default SQL statement that is created
 automatically, if not saved as a query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, again, for taking the time to respond!</p>

            <p>Actually I believe using a SQL statement is MORE flexible than using named query. It allows you to modify the Recordsource on the fly for specific needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not a fan of using a multi table query as a Recordsource. Too often this results in an uneditable query. I prefer to use subforms to display data from mutliple tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I just learned something. I was not aware that the search combo option is not available in the combobox wizard when the Recordsource is not a named object. I just tested this and confirmed it. However, I think that is a minor issue because it is
 easy to manually create a search combo.&nbsp;</p>

            If you really have to use the wizard you can of course save the querydef object, create the combo box,&nbsp; paste the query's SQL statement in as the form's RecordSource property, and then delete the querydef object. Like Scott I wasn't aware of this strange
 restriction in the wizard, but in 20 years of Access development I've never had occasion to use the combo box wizard as it's so simple to hand craft it.

            <p>I agree with you, Scott, that using a subform to display data from multiple tables is the way to go. I use them, too. It wouldn't make sense, to me, to use a query for data entry, even though you are able to update records through a query in some cases.
 The record source of the <em>subform</em> is a multi-table query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The combo box option is great - we use it all the time, and find it very easy to manipulate through the properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing about Access is being able to use it in different ways. Everyone has their favorite ways of doing things, depending on their needs. I'm always learning new things from this discussion group, and really appreciate the responses I get from other
 members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, again, for your excellent input!<br />

<h2>            Trying to mail merge multiple tables using Next Record. Only first table works</h2>
                    I'm using word 2010. I am trying to create a document that has several tables using mail merge and the {Next Record} rule. The first table fills in without any issues. However, all other merge data after the last {Next Record} rule is blank. How do I get
 mail merge to recognize that I'm starting a new table or that I'm done with the first table?

<h2>            How to update Adobe Flash Player ActiveX for Internet Explorer &#40;to Secure version 26.0.0.151&#41; &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Secunia PSI indicates that Adobe Flash Player 26.x (ActiveX) for Internet Explorer is outdated. My OS is Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview Build 16281.</p>
<p>The installed version is 26.0.0.137. The secure version is 26.0.0.151. Microsoft generally takes between a few weeks until a month before an Adobe Flash Player ActiveX (IE) update is included in the next insider release.</p>
<p>The file name including the location is C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash\Flash.ocx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to update Adobe Flash Player ActiveX for IE? Secunia PSI indicated a high Criticality, so I prefer not to wait until the next Microsoft update. It should be treated just like Antivirus Definitions, which are released daily.</p>

<p>FP 27 for Internet Explorer - ActiveX is provided by Adobe, but only for Windows 7/Vista/XP. For Windows 10/Windows 8 this is not provided. This means people with older browsers have an advantage in this respect, because they can update quicker to the latest
 secure versions than people with the newest Windows versions. This doesn't make much sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe releases a new Flash Player ActiveX and Microsoft is supposed to include the new version. I don't know why it takes so long before the Flash Player is updated by Microsoft after it is released by Adobe. It should be released within a few days as a
 Windows update. And at least in the next Insider update on the Fast Ring.</p>

            You are forgetting that these are beta testing builds come out at a rate of about once a week, so it is not a priority to make sure 3rd party software is up to date with the current build as it might change on the next build, suggest that you do a dual
 boot with the current Public build for your everyday computing and keep the Preview for testing MS stuff as what the program is about, not for testing if 3rd party apps/software MS will worry about 3rd party when the RTM is released in a few weeks.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Once I have deleted that bar, there is another bar on the screen which is permanently there. It is stopping me getting to the scroll bar for scrolling emails sideways. It is titled "copyright 2014 Microsoft and on the right hand end "ad choices". How can

<h3> davidc_971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer settings not syncing on other machines or on Safari in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Are Favorites (Bookmarks)&nbsp; in IE No Longer Synced Across Windows Machines or with Safari via iCloud</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still use IE.&nbsp; (One reason for that is that the import function in Edge does not successfully bring in all my bookmarks from IE--despite multiple attempts and posts to Microsoft about the bad software.&nbsp; Another reason is that iCloud does not work with
 Edge so I cannot sync bookmarks from Edge to Safari on my iPhone.)&nbsp; But I write about something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently noticed that my IE favorites (bookmarks) are not syncing to other Windows 10 machines or to Safari.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that IE favorites are stored under the User folder--and are pretty easy to see/find.&nbsp; I know that Edge stores favorites in a different place.&nbsp; I can imagine that in&nbsp;focusing on Edge that Microsoft has somehow disabled the syncing I liked&nbsp;of IE&nbsp;favorites
 to&nbsp;other PCs or (via iCloud) to Safari.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone comment/confirm what I am seeing or give another explanation for why I am not seeing my IE favorites sync?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, David</p>

<p><span>The above issue might occur of you have not enabled sync settings from

<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Since when are you facing the above issue? Did you make any browser setting changes?</span></li><li><span>Which account are you using to sign-in into the computer (Microsoft account or Local account)?</span></li><li><span>Have you enabled
<strong>Sync</strong> option for <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> settings on the computer?</span></li><li><span>How many machines are you referring to when you say “not syncing to other Windows 10 machines”?</span></li></ol>

<p><span>If haven’t tried,
<strong>enable</strong> <strong>Sync settings</strong> for <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> option on the computer by following steps from

            <p>1.&nbsp; I have not made any browser setting changes (other than to turn off and turn on to see if that triggers a sync or update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I am using my Microsoft account--not a local account</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Yes I have enabled Sync option for IE.&nbsp; However, I notice that on my main computer (running Windows 10.0.10586 Build 10586) , the "Sync your settings" screen has the option under "Individual sync settings" labelled "Internet Explorer settings".&nbsp; On my
 other computer (a laptop running Windows 10.0.10240 Build 10240), that option is labelled &nbsp;"Web browser settings".&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why the laptop has an old build, but I am now downloading an update and will see if that fixes the issue between those two machines.&nbsp; I will post you on that.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone Comments, can I make them here&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm and insider and I'm kind of disappointed with Windows Phone Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the feedback so this phone works the way I want it to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Optimize this phone to play video. It plays slow</p>
<p>2. I need this phone to work. All these glitches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2a. The phone does these partial loads where the page shows up half way not all the way. I'll try to post a screenshot later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2b. I need this phone to not turn of or shutdown. I don't care about battery usage. I keep this permanently attached to a power plug.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2c. Make sure the camera works. I have a 521 and I sent it back 3 times and they never fixed the camera. The apps have work with the camera.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2d. Stop burying stuff in these menus. Put everything..especially Wifi</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2e. Drop of this "sense" less stuff. Storage, Wifi, etc. Delete it...delete it ALL!</p>
<p>3. Pay Mathworks(matlab) and FreePress Reader to put apps on this phone. </p>
<p>The FreePress reader is amazing...really amazing. Spent time and learn how powerful this app is. You should probably preload this app, http://www.pressreader.com/
</p>
<p>4. Fix Angry birds Roost...it doesn't work.</p>
<p>5. Let me install Skype for business!</p>
<p>6. Give me a chance to go back to OS before this one...</p>

                    I have a database that changes frequently of varying sizes and my problem today is I need to count the blank cells in a column but since it changes everyday I can't set a range. What formula can I use to create a dynamic range so I can count the blanks?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still exactly the same formula, we just have to reference another worksheet like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTBLANK(OFFSET(Sheet1!C1,0,0,SUMPRODUCT(MAX((ROW(Sheet1!C1:C10000))*(Sheet1!C1:C10000&lt;&gt;""))),1))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically all the formula is doing is finding the last row with data in and counting all the blanks down as far as that row. It currently works for column C on sheet 1 so change to suit.</p>

<br />If so, go to File - Options

<br />On the left click 'Formulas'
<br />
<br />On the right, under Worksheet Calculations, set that yo Automatic

<h3> sam497  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Outlook scan my emails and create task automatically and how can I turn this feature off&#63;</h2>
                    I can't seem to find any information on this. I just set up Outlook 2010 and it looks as if it has compiled a list of tasks from my emails, I don't see any reason for it to do this and would like to disable this feature (assuming it's normal behavior for
 Outlook) but I cannot find any option to do so. Is there a way to disable this while at the same time preserving my ability to create tasks manually?

            That makes sense for going forward, but I just barely set up Outlook on my computer (about ten minutes before I posted this question). The tasks don't correspond to any emails that
<i>I </i>marked for follow-up because I only just started using it. Why should any of my emails be marked for follow-up unless I marked them as such? Is there some tag in the email itself that tells Outlook to mark it for follow-up automatically (e.g. something
 that the sender specified before sending the message)?<br />

                    <p>Microsoft Win32/Open Candy is only partly removed by Microsoft Safety Scanner. I have now Microsofts safety programs but I think the infection was on my computer before I installed them.</p>

<h2>            Buying an &#34;unavailable&#34; Windows Phone</h2>
                    So I live in Canada, which to be honest has a very backwards selection of mid-tier to high end windows phones. If there is a certain windows phone (say the Lumia 830 or HTC M8 for Windows) that is available in the US but not in Canada then could i just
 buy the phone on an American site or through sites like Amazon or eBay?

            <p>American phones are locked to the carriers there. You would also have to try to get an unlock code for the device. Certain features may also be missing, as carriers like Verizon disable functions to prevent people from happily taking them elsewhere.</p>

<h3> vivsim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer Blank and Windows Live Mail won&#39;t load</h2>
                    <p>WL Mail won't load.&nbsp; The first screen comes up and says 'Starting' but it doesn't and I have to go to Task Manager to cancel it.&nbsp; At the same time, Internet Explorer started to malfunction.&nbsp; It loads a totally blank page.&nbsp; Typing in a web address has no
 effect, and Internet Options are greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These problems occurred when I downloaded a trial version of Office 2013&nbsp;from the Microsoft site, and tried to install it.&nbsp; I chose&nbsp;the install&nbsp;option to keep rather than replace my current Office 2007.&nbsp; The install failed, saying I already had some Office
 2013 components&nbsp;installed.&nbsp; I have never installed 2013.&nbsp; I checked for residue from the Office 2013 install but found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the install failed and, immediately afterwards, I started having the above problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems exist for only my PC account (I am the administrator).&nbsp; Both WLM and IE work perfectly on my husband's account on the same PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8.1, Windows Live Mail 2012, Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really need help with this one.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.
</span><span>However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><ol>
<li><span>Are you getting any error message/code while opening internet explorer?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue. It might be caused due to changes in Internet Explorer settings, some add-ons also may cause this issue. If the issue is specific to some websites then it might be due to compatibility.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First try to run the fixit provided in the following article and see if it helps you to fix the issue. This fixit diagnose and repair IE problems that make IE slow, not secure, unstable or crash, caused by add-ons not working or inappropriate security
 settings. </span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If Fixit doesn't help, lets try these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Let’s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer in
<strong><span>No Add-ons</span></strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can diagnose that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable the add-on. To open
<strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong> in <strong><span>No Add-ons mode</span></strong>, please do the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click the <strong><span>Tools</span></strong> button, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Manage add-ons</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong><span>Show</span></strong>, tap or click <strong><span>All add-ons</span></strong>, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click <strong><span>Disable</span></strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Close</span></strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></strong></li></ol>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the browser cache and check. Follow these steps to do so.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Start Internet Explorer 11.<br />
b. On the <strong><span>Tools </span></strong>menu, click <strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong>. If you can't see the Tools menu, press Alt to display the menus.<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab.<br />
d. Under <strong><span>Browsing History</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Delete</span></strong>.<br />
e. In the <strong><span>Delete Browsing History</span></strong> dialog box, click to select the following check boxes, and then click

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.&nbsp; Unfortunately, nothing has worked, and I have discovered that my problem is much bigger than previously thought.</p>
<p>MS Word gives an error code and stops, Excel comes up really slowly, a genealogy program I've used for years tells me I don't have the authority to open the database I've also used for years, and so on!</p>
<p>So, as my husband's user account&nbsp;seems to be unaffected, I assumed (hoped) that setting up a new user account for&nbsp;myself would be OK.</p>
<p>I've just done this and IE is working in the new account.&nbsp; Also, WLM has transferred&nbsp;the windows live mail folders from the old to the new account.&nbsp; Worked like a charm.&nbsp; It's such a pity, though, that it took hours to find out that WLM will actually do
 this for you, rather than you having to copy the files to the new user (I tried this first, but WLM wouldn't access the new files, even though I changed the mail store in the software).</p>
<p>I have my contacts and calendars on outlook.com.&nbsp; The contacts came up in WLM but, when I clicked on Calendar, I got an error message.&nbsp; Then when I signed out of WLM, it wouldn't let me sign in again - said my calendar file was corrupt.</p>
<p>Hours of searching the internet and finding many weird and wonderful solutions that didn't work, I came across a&nbsp;2011 message&nbsp;that&nbsp;advised deleting the Calendar folder from the Windows Live Mail folder.&nbsp; Worked beautifully (WLM regenerates it later), and
 now my Outlook.com calendar is showing in WLM.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm very relieved to be up and running again, although disappointed that I couldn't find the cause of the problems, and I very much appreciate your help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Again, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi jnwinf,<br />
<br />
<br />
1. If the file is accessed via the local drive, it does <strong>not Autosave</strong> and you may describe the feature of
<strong>AutoRecover</strong>. <strong>AutoRecover</strong> will protect you from crashes, power failure and some errors in program and all you have to do is opening the application again. It does no good at all if word exits normally, or if the user makes a
 mistake. However, I don't recommend turning it off, because on very rare occasions, it might help.<br />
<br />
Choose Word&gt; Preferences&gt; Save&gt; Save AutoRecover info every: 10 minutes. </p>
<p>(You can change the auto recover time as your need.)<br />
<br />
2. It is recommended that you store files in the OneDrive and SharePoint sites because history version will be created each time you save the file.<br />
For your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/save-a-file-in-office-for-mac-421a5172-9bc6-4ef0-b452-c0939bdce786?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#__toc282420495&amp;ID0EAACAAA=2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Save AutoRecover information automatically.</a><br />
<br />
Besides, I would like to explain that <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Support-is-ending-for-Office-for-Mac-2011-559b72b1-e045-4c73-bad3-d7f1841b9e8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support for Office for Mac 2011 ends October 10, 2017.</a> Continued mainstream support requires upgrades to Office 2016 for Mac applications as part of Office 365 ProPlus or Office 2016 for Mac.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />
<br />
We also welcome other community members who has some suggestion to share them here.<br />
<br />
