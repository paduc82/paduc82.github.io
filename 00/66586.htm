            <p>What is with the all uppercase lettering?</p>
<p>The wording of yor query is off.&nbsp; It's not whether or not Windows 7 is compatible with the Epson SX235W printer, but whether or not the Epson SX235W printer is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>All hardware support comes from the hardware manufacturer - including the software/drivers the manufacturer of the product provides (or chooses not to provide) to properly communicate with any given operating system.</p>
<p>Windows 7 works *just fine* without the Epson SX235W printer, but the Epson SX235W printer is likely severely limited without some software/drivers that work with some operating system; in this case, Windows 7.</p>
<p>So, visiting the Epson support web page is your best bet to get software for whatever architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) of Windows 7 you happen to have:<br />

<p>Download the software and drivers you need.&nbsp; Looks like a driver was released on October 17, 2011.</p>
<p>Do you have the printer configured so the computer can see it?<br />

            Well if you just bought the printer it would have been supplied with set up instructions and an installation cd, so I have to asume you didnt read the instructions and just plugged it in.

            <p>I have the same issue and have had it since installing the Windows RT 8.1 Preview.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Furthermore this issue has been reported many times on the internet from Surface RT and other RT tablet owners. In other words, this is a Windows RT&nbsp;<strong>software</strong> problem and not a
<strong>hardware</strong> or OEM software problem.&nbsp;To say that this is something the computer manufacturer has to (or can) fix is a copout on Microsoft's part.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My VivoTab RT reports on the 'Activate Windows' setting page that the error code is 0xC004C003: "<strong>The activation server determined the specified product key has been blocked.</strong>"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can this be a problem for ASUS to fix? They did not want to help me at all until I told them that a Microsoft support representative told me that it is a problem ASUS has to fix. At that point the ASUS support rep initiated a repair return to swap out
 the device (as in, they can't fix this software problem and would give me a new device) and continued to inform me that if it is determined that ASUS is not the cause of the problem that I would have to pay for the repair (<em>not to mention that I have to,
 anyway, pay for the shipping</em>).</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I can find no information on a company named Support4urPC at Microsoft so if they called
<br />
you then it is probably a scam.<br />
<br />
In USA you can contact FBI, State Attorney General, local law enforcement and consumer<br />
watch groups. Arm yourself with knowledge.<br />
<br />
No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors existed on your<br />
computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or worse to steal your identity.
<p>Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make unsolicited<br />
phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might or might not be a complete scam - in this case, that's hard to tell for certain.&nbsp; There are legitimate companies that do this as a business and some people actually welcome the service (while others feel it was as waste of money) - but they are
 NOT Microsoft if that's what you thought.&nbsp; I wouldn't sign up for any such service myself (assuming the company is legitimate and I don't really know how to go about checking that to be certain - especially since it appears to me they may be based in India
 - but that's a chance you either take or bypass or try to find some other way of checking them out - perhaps verifying their Microsoft Partner status using the ID they list on the site), but again, there are some who think it beneficial (as true Microsoft
 Support or even computer manufacturer support or other program support after the free support and/or warranty period has expired can sometimes be quite expensive unless you can find alternative sources that are free - like these forums for example - and if
 you run into problems these companies can sometimes prove to be useful).&nbsp; But again, I would never sign up myself (not because I don't trust this particular company because here I don't know either way - but because I'm certain I can resolve the issue on my
 own or with assistance from free sources without needing to pay for it), but for you the decision is really yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure it's entirely a scam; however, I'm not sure it's something you really need.&nbsp; If you think they are part of Microsoft, that isn't correct - they are a separate company (though they do appear to be a Microsoft Partner - which really doesn't
 mean much in terms of what they are offering).&nbsp; For the most part, you can get free help with a lot of that here (though not by remote desktop) in these forums (or others to which we can refer you).&nbsp; We can advise you how to protect your PC from malware and
 provide free sources where malware-removal experts will take care of almost any infection.&nbsp; Most of the rest is just a matter of asking the right questions in the right forums here (or where we direct you) or to the computer manufacturer or software vendor
 or whoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, for some people, knowing they can get assistance from people about all those issues by a email, remote assistance, or chat (which I notice is away at the moment - so that makes me wonder about the 24/7 part) can be comforting if actually true
 and it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For remote assistance they will need to access your computer remotely to work on it (but you'll be able to see what they are doing and can usually stop them any time you feel uncomfortable).&nbsp; If you don't want them accessing your PC, you're
 OK as you can see if they are doing so (it will show on the screen, usually in the lower right corner) and remote desktop requires you to authorize them to connect otherwise they cannot do so without you approving it on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've installed TeamViewer or LogMein already and don't want them anymore (just to be on the safe side so to speak), it should be a simple matter of going to Start / Control Panel / Programs and Features and finding the installed program and then right
 clicking on it and clicking uninstall and it will be removed.&nbsp; I've no idea if they installed anything else but suspect that's it given what they say they do.&nbsp; If they did, you need to find out from them what else was installed and then get directions to uninstall
 it or them or just uninstall it or them yourself if you know what it is called (or post back with the info and we'll help you get rid of them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure how else to help.&nbsp; Did you signup for the Trial plan or for one of the longer term plans?&nbsp;&nbsp; What's their cancellation policy?&nbsp; If you used a credit card, can you dispute the charge if they won't issue a refund?&nbsp; Those are more issues between
 you and them and not things we can really help you with.&nbsp; I'd contact them and discuss your concerns and get answers to what's already been done if anything to your computer (and how to undo it) and how to cancel if that's what you want to do and, if you want,
 have them try to prove to you that they are legitimate (if you care if you plan to cancel&nbsp;or to ease you mind if you decide to stay - which doesn't seem to be the case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back if you have further questions or if you think we can assist you in some way that's in sync with what we do and not with negotiating terms and conditions with them or having us check them out more for you (we aren't here to validate businesses out
 there that aren't obvious and overt scams -&nbsp;and this one isn't clearly a scam even if it may be less than you thought it was at first when you were convinced to sign up -&nbsp;and if you do want such a thing, there are possibly if not probably&nbsp;better and/or cheaper
 companies that offer the same thing and possibly with much superior service).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>

            That's actually up to the program's installation system. &nbsp;Many programs these days will ask during install if you want it for "all users" or "only me". &nbsp;Other programs
<i>always</i>&nbsp;install for just the current user: &nbsp;Google Chrome is like this--you can't install it system-wide at all. &nbsp;In the end, you're at the mercy of the people who built the program.
<div><br />
<div>However, like any other program that you guys share (such as Notepad or other built-in programs), he is free to delete the icon from his start menu. &nbsp;He'll never know the program is there.</div>

<h2>            Update make Windows unbootable</h2>
                    <p>Last month I had a automatic windows update. After the required restart, I'm not able to boot at all; I get to the BIOS menu directly. I told myself: "great the last update just scrapped my thing" I decided to reinstall Windows 10 from scratch with a 2015
 Windows 10 install CD. After the install, my PC had booted and the automatic update had launched. After the update had completed it had ruined it again. I don't know what else I can do since this update start by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I tried on an other PC and it work fine. So, I guess my update problem is related to my hardware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell which update version it is about because it start from itself, but I guess it is the Fall Creators Update 1709 since, everyone seems having problem with it...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a 2015 Windows 10 Home/Pro edition (yes, during install you can choose), I picked Pro, put the registration key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should get an other (sooner) release of Windows with all that package already included!?!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>but, I wonder if it could be hardware related, I mean maybe you don't support my GPU anymore, I don't know?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an installer that originally came with your device would usually allow you to reinstall the Windows 10 OS without any issues. But if the updates still persist even after you tried this method, we suggest that you follow the steps posted on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">

<p>
</p><p>Also, you can follow the steps posted by Paul Sey on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-clean-install-windows-10-on-a-pc-step-by/854fd140-385f-452c-ad52-548f2acb0d0a">
link</a> to perform a clean install of Windows 10 if the issue still persists. Take note that performing a clean install will totally remove any files you have on the drive where the OS will be installed.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Problem&#93; With explorer.exe in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I have installed&nbsp; MS Windows 7 x64 Home Permium on my new PC and after few days I have a strange problem with explorer.exe<br />
I don't know why but explorer is very often shuts down with no reason.&nbsp; <br />
Sometimes it's a few times in a raw. Even when I click on something with right mouse button.<br />
My PC specs: (Phenom II X4 955, DDR3 1600Mhz, MA770T-UD3P, ATI 4870, OCZ 550W.. etc)<br />
<br />
In my journal event i can read something like that:<br />
<br />
Application that gives error is : C:\Windows\explorer.exe<br />
Module that makes this error is&nbsp; C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll<br />
or<br />
Module that makes this error is also C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\msvcrt.dll<br />
<br />
Can I do with that something? What are these errors anyway.. It is realy fantastic to have these problems on the new brand OS

<p><strong><span><span>Hi Celdur,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
I would suggest you to perform SFC scan.<br />
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow<br />
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SFC /scannow<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time<br />
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue<br />
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"
<br />
5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

    <title>Connection Sound Bar Using HDMI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> backwoodsrt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection Sound Bar Using HDMI</h2>
                    
<p>I want to connect my Vizio sound bar using HDMI ARC. My sound bar has this option (two HDMI ports). I tried the optical connection first and it worked fine, but hooking everything up using HDMI is not working for sound, only for video. Here's my setup...I
 have a UHD Samsung TV, Cisco cable box, Xbox One, and a Vizio S5451w-C2 sound bar. Again, the Vizio sound bar has a HDMI ARC connection option. I have my connections set up as follows ALL WITH HDMI CONNECTIONS::</p>
<p>Cable box --&gt; Xbox One --&gt; Vizio sound bar (HDMI Input) --&gt; Vizio sound bar (HDMI Output)--&gt; Samsung UHD TV (HDMI ARC port)</p>
<p>I can get video just fine using this connection, but NO sound. My TV settings are good to go, but I'm wondering if there is some Xbox audio setting that is the final piece to this puzzle. Currently, my "HDMI audio" is set to "5.1 uncompressed" and "Bitstream
 format" is set to "DTS Digital Surround". Are these correct?</p>

<p>For reference, HDMI ARC is meant for a TV to send the sound it receives from something like its digital TV tuner "upstream" to your soundbar.</p>
<p>The way you have it set up physically is correct, just that its not depending on ARC (Xbox One audio gets stripped from the HDMI cable by your soundbar and sends the video onto your TV).</p>
<p>Try changing the audio setting on the Xbox One to Stereo Uncompressed, make sure the soundbar isn't muted, etc. Maybe your Soundbar doesn't support 5.1 uncompressed, but 5.1 compressed Dolby Digital or DTS.</p>

 and only keep photos that I transfer from my camera? &nbsp;Also, these photos repeat themselves multiple times even though I did not create copies. &nbsp; My picture file is enormous and I'm sure eating up memory.

            <p>I would suspect the unwanted pictures are in your <br />
Temporary Internet Files folder. When you access <br />
sites on the net that include graphics and pictures, <br />
they are loaded into this folder so you can view them.<br />
<br />
If you would like to view the contents of your<br />
Temporary Internet Files folder...try these steps...<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Run... Type or Copy/Paste...the following...<br />
<br />
%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files<br />
<br />
Press...Enter...<br />
<br />
Delete everything in the Temporary Internet Files folder.<br />

How to find your TIF ( Temporary Internet Files ) folder.<br />
<br />
Open a folder and go to...Tools / Folder Options / View tab.<br />
<br />
Tick..."Show Hidden Files and Folders" / Apply / OK.<br />

Now...you'll find your TIF folder at the following location:<br />

<br />
Do the unwanted copies have filenames with<br />
the prefix "copy of"?<br />
<br />
Example: Copy of IMG_1455.JPG<br />
<br />
If_yes_maybe the following tutorial will offer <br />
some ideas:<br />
<br />
Here's how to reproduce the unwanted<br />
copying...<br />
<br />
Hold your Ctrl key and select several files...<br />
<br />
Place your pointer on the selected group<br />
(still holding the ctrl key) and left click / drag<br />
the group even just the slightest bit...now<br />
release the mouse button.<br />
<br />
Oooops...more copies...<br />
<br />
Maybe the following info will help:<br />
<br />
It happens occasionally to most anyone who<br />
is trying to multiple select by holding the Ctrl<br />
or Shift key while left clicking to select the<br />
image files.<br />
<br />
The copies are created when you fail to<br />
completely release the mouse button before<br />
you move the pointer to another file. If a group<br />
of selected files is dragged...even the slightest<br />
bit...releasing the mouse button will produce<br />
copies of all the previously highlighted files.<br />
<br />
It's somewhat easier if you have your Folder<br />
Options set to Single Click...this way you can<br />
select/deselect a file with just a mouse over<br />
and you don't have to click. For multiples you<br />
still have to hold...Ctrl or Shift.<br />
<br />
No click...no drag...no copy...maybe that's<br />
your solution. To adjust for single click...<br />
Open a folder and go to...Tools / Folder<br />
Options / General tab...tick..."Single Click<br />
To Open An Item" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
If you wish to delete all the files in a folder<br />
you could try the following:<br />
<br />
Go to...Edit / Select All...or type...Ctrl / A...<br />
<br />
With all files selected...go to...File / Delete...<br />
or press your Delete key...or...right click the<br />
group and choose "Delete".<br />
<br />
How to search for and delete unwanted "copies"<br />
of your image files.<br />
<br />
Open the folder that the images are saved in and<br />
left click the "Search" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
(If you are viewing the files from within an editing<br />
program and do not know where the folder is...right<br />
click one of the image files and from the menu...<br />
choose...Properties. The path to the folder will be<br />
on the "General" tab at "Location".)<br />
<br />
In the search pane...select..."All files and folders"<br />
<br />
In the "All or part of the file name" field...enter...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Search" button.<br />
<br />
When the search is complete...go to...Edit / Select All...<br />
<br />
Then go to...File / Delete.<br />

<h2>            I&#39;m confused by the &#34;virtual desktops&#34; in Windows Vista. I&#39;ve searched for help and how-to, but can&#39;t find anything about it. </h2>
                    
<p>When I look at my "computer" in windows explorer there is a Main desktop (I guess), another one under the user name, another one under documents, and another one under THAT desktop. I guess I've created these by accident, but I'm really confused and would
 like to get rid of them so I don't have trouble finding shortcuts I thought I created on my "desktop"!<br />
<br />
If you can point me to the right article, I'd appreciate it.<br />

            OK, the term "virtual desktop" is really not what you mean. I'll give you a more detailed explanation of the file hierarchy in Vista and the recommended way to set up users below. But the first thing you need to understand is that each user has a User
 Profile under %systemdrive%\Users. The system drive is usually C:\. In each User Profile are other directories - Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Music, Favorites, etc. All other Desktops in your own User Profile are shortcuts to the original or mistakes. I am
 not sure what you mean by saying there is a "desktop" folder in the Documents folder and another one inside that. You may have inadvertently moved the real Desktop folder (which should be directly under %systemdrive%\Users\Your-Username) or created shortcuts
 to it. You'll need to provide some information about what you've done. You can tell if something is a shortcut because it will usually have a shortcut arrow. You can also right-click on the icon and then left-click on Properties and if it is a shortcut, it
 will say so. You can simply delete the shortcuts. If you have somehow copied the real Desktop directory, you can delete the copies as long as you leave the original (C:\Users\Your-Username\Desktop) alone. So tell me what you did and I can help you undo it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>Vista, like XP, is a multi-user operating system, no matter if only one person is using it. In all multi-user operating systems - NT, Win2k, XP, Vista, Unix, Linux, Mac OSX - there is the one built-in account that is "god" on the
 system. In Windows terminology, that is "Administrator". In the *nix world, it is "root". This is a necessary account and is not normally used in everyday work. You cannot delete the built-in Administrator account nor would you ever want to. In Vista, Mac
 OS X, and some Linux distros, the built-in Administrator is disabled by default. In Vista, even though you may be logged into an account with administrative privileges, you still need to elevate to "superuser" in order to accomplish some tasks. This is a security
 feature. Also in Vista, while you can work from a user account with administrative privileges, it is safer not to. You should be working from a Standard User account instead. Because the built-in Administrator account is disabled, it is wise to create one
 or two extra user accounts with administrative privileges. With luck, you'll never need to log into them.<br />
<br />
My Computer (XP) and Computer (Vista) - represents your entire computer, showing drives and directories on hard drives. Shared Folders (XP) and the Public directory (Vista) are folders where you can put files you wish to share with other users on the system.
 You don't need to use these folders if you don't want to, but leave them alone!<br />
<br />
Documents and Settings (XP only) - The "container" for all user settings. Each user will have [username] My Documents, My Music, My Videos, My Pictures.<br />
<br />
In Vista, the Documents and Settings directory has been replaced with the Users directory - just like in the rest of the grownup operating systems (Unix, Linux, Mac OS X). You will still see Documents and Settings in Vista, but it is a virtual directory only,
 there just to be backwards-compatible with older software that expects it to exist. So if you click on it, you will get "access denied". You can't "take ownership" of a virtual directory nor would you ever want/need to. Under Vista's Users directory you will
 see home directories (with subdirectories like Documents, Pictures, Music, etc.) for all the users in the system.<br />
<br />
Administrator - Built-in account - Leave alone! Do not use! Do not worry about it! You won't see this in Vista (see explanation above). In XP, the built-in Administrator account is only visible in Documents and Settings if you have XP Pro/Media Center. In XP
 Home, it can only be accessed in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
All Users - Section where items common to all users go. You have to "Show Hidden Files and Folders" (not recommended) in order to see the All Users directory in Vista, but it is a virtual directory and therefore not accessible.<br />
<br />
Default User (XP) and Default (Vista) - This is the template from which new user accounts are made. You will never put anything in any of those folders but they are needed to create new users. In Linux we use "skel" ("skeleton" - get it?). In Windows, the less-colorful
 term "Default User/Default" is used. Leave it alone! As with All Users, you need to "Show Hidden Files and Folders" in Vista to see Default. You will also see Default User, but like All Users it is virtual only and therefore not accessible.<br />
<br />
Your user account and other user accounts that *you've* created are in the Users directory. Sometimes there will be an Owner account, or something like "HP Administrator". This is the generic user created by the OEM ("Original Equipment Manufacturer; i.e.,
 Dell, HP, Sony, etc.) when installing the operating system. After all, the OEM doesn't know who is going to buy the computer. If you aren't using this OEM user account, you can delete it from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. It is not the same account
 as "Administrator".<br />
<br />
You will also see the Windows directory and the Program Files directory. If you "Show Hidden Files and Folders" and also uncheck "Hide protected operating system files" in Vista, you'll see a lot of other directories, too. The ones with the "shortcut arrows"
 are virtual directories. Again, the virtualization is there for backwards-compatibility with older software.<br />
</span><br />
</span><br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

            Hey, I had the same problem until I had a look around the operating system to find out even though I had installed it, it still needed activating...so I went to the notifications icon in the bottom right hand corner clicked it and then selected all settings.
 From here you want to go into <strong>update &amp; security = Activation = Activate.
</strong>Activating windows does not require a restart and once activated allowed me to download stuff from the store. If it helps let me know, but it helped me, good luck!

    <title>Well I guess ill post here&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harry bo21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Well I guess ill post here&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, im more than sure this isnt the right place. But I dont see an alternative and this was the great advice of a xbox live chat person to post here. So I will and expose his unhelpfull nature on they're own website!</p>
<p>I had been having connectivity issues for most of this months subscription, I checked all of my stuff and nothing had changed, and was all functioning properly.</p>
<p>I had even bought a new console not long ago, so I turned to xbox support.</p>
<p>I noticed it supports Live chat, so I thought "Great helpful techy guys yay!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had several chats with them, a&nbsp; good few of them disconnected without reason, or threatened with disconnection for rude or abusive comments when I had done neither. When I did finally get through to a few agents they all told me to do the same thing, when
 I contacted them again would you believe that they... told me to do the same thing again?</p>
<p>The main reason I contacted them recently was that all of a sudden I got disconnected from live. No other problems with my various laptops, pcs, playstation or wii. I thought how strange, must be a problem with xbox live I guess?</p>
<p>I dropped to the dashboard and was IMMEDIATLY reconnected to live.</p>
<p>So I was already pretty annoyed at spending 3 hours on black ops zombies: moon To be disconnected as I threw the final gersh device for the easter egg, but I thought "Hey my buddys still online, ill try again" and clicked to boot the game again.</p>
<p>TOTAL DISCONNECTION!!!</p>
<p>Eh? Ok back to the dashboard?</p>
<p>TOTAL RECONNECTION!!!</p>
<p>Repeat repeat. So I tested my network connection. All Ok on my end but a service message from xbox live saying some users may experience problems viewing messages? Check xbox live.com for details.</p>
<p>So I go to xboxlive.com to the service anouncements section and it says the same thing. I click "Contact us" and am met with a ton of webpage coding jargon. No error with me still, tried two different browsers and had the same problem, it was an issue with
 the page.</p>
<p>I went onto netfllix on my xbox and was disconnected again.</p>
<p>Gave up and went on my lappy for a while to see if I could find anyone else complaining of these problems. After an hour I only found one other post on some random forum, but it matched my issue. It said it was working again so I tried going on the xboxlive.com
 service announcments page again. Met with more website jargon code. Now even that wasnt working?</p>
<p>Went onto my xbox and was connected. Did the network test and it said all issues were solved. "Great, on to black ops!"</p>
<p>TOTAL DISCONNECTION!!!</p>
<p>Nope problems still there. About half hour later xbox.com started working again</p>
<p>I got into a chat on liveperson (I should probably have mentioned before but id had several disconnects over the last 2 weeks or so, I was pretty annoyed by now. Especially as one advisor told me my router was faulty so I pad for another, another advisor
 said my broadband was insufficiant so I upgraded to a new fibre optic broadband Of top notch quality which had been installed 7 days earlier with yet another router that was working perfectly fine with EVERYTHING else in my house, then told to get a new network
 card, which I did despite my XBOX SLIM being LESS than one year old with an inbuilt card (Another damn £50) and still not working properly. Id also deleted my cache and title updates about a thousand times. They even tried getting me to delete my savegames
 and start again but I only moved them Hell am I losing all that over potentially nothing! wired my connection bought new cables blah blah. Literally everything they told me to try).</p>
<p>This person told me to... yup you guessed it. Even though since deleting my cache and updates the only game I had played was BLACK OPS I was still told to delete my cache and updates YET AGAIN.</p>
<p>I did</p>
<p>Then I had a perserveering advisor absolutly convinced I hadnt deleted them even though I had like 3 times. Eventually while in the chat I got onto black ops with live. Just as I was about to say good bye to the advisor I got "Black ops servers are unavavailable".
 I check the black ops site, "All is Defcon Green sir!"</p>
<p>I look at my friends list, yup others ARE ON black ops as we speak</p>
<p>The lady cant explain and wont discuss it leading to yet another... TOTAL DISCONNECTION (Although this time from the advisor)</p>
<p>I get into another chat, im talking for like two minutes being told to repeat the same steps again. Although I did them, because I told the lady I already had about 20 minutes ago she started getting all shirty with me. So im like "Hey dude, I did what you
 asked now what?" She starts going on about me refusing to take her advice.</p>
<p>Im like WTF I just told you I did it, I was merly making a point that this would be like the tenth time I did it TODAY alone. All of a sudden no more responses from mrs agent.</p>
<p>On to chat number 3, very nice guy this time. Apologetic for the other people, asked me to clear my cache... Im losing hope now...</p>
<p>Wire your connection in... For the third time I am wired in, despite your previous advice of blowing another £50 on a wireless card to replace my perfectly functional internal wireless card... Next try...</p>
<p>TOTAL DISCONNECTION!!!</p>
<p>I could honestly cry by now. Cant get on black ops at all. I load netflix, servers are unavailable. I load Left 4 dead, servers are unavailable.</p>
<p>After an hour online with advisor number 4, He has me once again RETRY EVERY SINGLE USELESS STEP. Then starts telling me the BT homehub 3 (sepeciffically designed for gaming as advertised by they're company. How do I know they are not lying? Because up until
 a few months ago I worked FOR THEM.</p>
<p>The guy is absolutly determined the ports are closed on the router. Even though it happened the same way on the other routers too. I check the router and tell him the profile for xbox live is enabled and that the hub doesnt give you the option to specify
 the port numbers as they are grouped by relevance. So the 4 ports for xbox live will appear as merely XBOX LIVE in a dropdown box. Once again knowledge from working for them. But hes determined these ports are closed and that the massive xboxlive.com and xbox
 live faliures of merely a few hours ago couldnt possibly be the cause (He didnt even know they had occured when I asked him and could find no record of them).</p>
<p>So I spend another hour on the PHONE to a BT advisor in India trying to explain what a port is and get him to check the manual ports to make sure they are open. Safe to say I had to go through a good 6 advisors and a manager before I got to one that even
 knew what a port was. And yes they are indeed open. I could see this because he did it on MY computer screen.</p>
<p>Xbox live guy still dont believe me, so I have to ask him what hes got against poor new "Mr Router". He only got out of his box earlier this week and hes telling you what you wanna know but you dont believe him.</p>
<p>Im advised to call xbox support now. WTF why? You guys are tech support?</p>
<p>I ask him to just give me a month free to cover the troubles Ive been having.. all month. No, he cant do that here. Not possible.</p>
<p>Speak to a manager (Or allegedly a manager, even though it says "you are now connected to AGENT"</p>
<p>He refuses point blank to even achknowledge what I am saying, suggesting... yup you guessed it CLEAR MY DAMN CACHE</p>
<p>Im fuming by now. All I want is some recognition that it hasnt been working properly for a while now and my 3 hour long gaming sessions on zombies were ending in TOTAL DISCONNECTION!!! rather than a gruesome zombie death at over round 50.</p>
<p>Nope, nope, nope. Have I tried wiring my connection?</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>This conversation went on for another hour, he even tells me he cant give me a month free, live chat staff are not capable of doing this (Remember this for later :)) He refers me to the phone number again and then it comes up saying "thank you for contacting
 Xbox Support" and asking me to click the X!?!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>I give up and call the number. "Sorry but our offices are now closed please refer to xbox live.com to talk to an online advisor or find out the opening times for your area.</p>
<p>Are... You... kidding...</p>
<p>It refers me back to live chat or xbox.com</p>
<p>I go back, I get ANOTHER advisor and demand to know why I was told to ring a closed number. Im given, frankly, B****** that they didnt know and that I still needed to call tommorow. The main point im making now is that I want this logged on my account, that
 I was pushed away and FORCED to ring a number that wasnt even open rather than just advise me that I must call TOMMOROW between X and X. Never did get the opening times but I guessed 9-5 as most centres are.</p>
<p>I call and im asked TO CLEAR MY CACHE AND BLAH BLAH</p>
<p>So firstly I try, I really do, try to explain that the problem seems to have mysteriously resolved itself overnight with no action on my part. And that I believe this to have been an error with xbox live, or maybe my area within xbox live. I dunno, but definatly
 Xbox live. Also that im convinced that these steps are not helping, just eating up my download allowance on redownloading Title updates 50 times a day. Absolutly nothing to say other than Im refusing to do what they ask. Once again I plead with them that it
 seems to be working now, my issue is with the fact itll probably stop working 3 hours into a game again or that the problem was clearly they're doing. They probable "came accross" the fault and fixed it. Not bothering to inform us "Hey when was the last time
 you got an email from xbox live saying there was gonna be maintanence?" I havent, just sudden disruptions in service.</p>
<p>Completly uncaring advisor just says tough it must have been "electrical interference" or something in my house.</p>
<p>Well... Yes... Harry Potter did come over that month, stay all month casting lightning bolts through out my living room carefully aiming away from all my computers and playstations but directly at my xbox. I had to throw him out eventually y'know and tell
 him he was the cause of my "magical" faults"</p>
<p>So I leave it for a few days. Its working now, no problems so far. Black ops servers went down again. Although there website once again said there was no such problem. But this time my friends could not get on it either. Assuring me that this was actually
 Activisions fault (Another company that doesnt bother to update the stupid status page they REFER you too)</p>
<p>I notice some weird achievement problems like the 750000 score on guitar hero not popping despite me getting 800000. Wanted to ask about some games I bought that have online achievements but I was lucky enough to find out upon clicking multiplayer, that
 the servers had been closed down for these games last year.</p>
<p>I thought while im on there ill ask about the resolution to my earlier problems as absolutly nothing was done (Other than eventually getting the service working properly again).</p>
<p>I get a woman, who immediatly tells me she has to tranfer me to a "specialist". Great Start.</p>
<p>Shes a nice woman though, explains a lot about how microsoft has no power over either the achievements nor the publishers. Not impressed but I kinda guessed that already, we have a little discusion about it but she keeps me happy throughout.</p>
<p>I discuss with her about my earlier problems. After a while she offers me a free month gold subscription.</p>
<p>Im in stitches now because thats what I asked for to begin with, before bouncing round on the great Microsoft shunt ride! As a customer of 3 years I expected a little more I admit.</p>
<p>I ask her to get this looked into as this only covers the month the service was NOT functioning properly and I feel does not adiquatly conpensate me for the berating conversations whereby I was disconnected, insulted, accused, accused of lying, blamed and
 given poor advice that has led to me spending a large amount of money for absolutly nothing!"</p>
<p>She cant help, 400 points or the gold subscription.</p>
<p>I asked her:</p>
<p>David: Heres what I propose</p>
<p>Tara: I have sent the email to you, and the reference number is<strong> [Mod Removed - Personal Information]</strong>.</p>
<p>David: Can your manager gain access to the previous conversations I had with advisors?</p>
<p>David: thanks</p>
<p>Tara: If you were logged into your account at the time of the chat, and they gave you a reference number, it should appear on your account.</p>
<p>David: They didnt give me a reference</p>
<p>Tara: We do record all conversations though for quality purposes.</p>
<p>David: so he/she can find them</p>
<p>David: ?</p>
<p>Tara: Finding them if there wasn't an SR may be hard to find though</p>
<p>Tara: If you had the date, time and the person you spoke with.</p>
<p>David: But with perserverance it can be done</p>
<p>David: it was in the last 7 days</p>
<p>Tara: I believe so.</p>
<p>David: that should be enough to find it</p>
<p>David: So What I propse then:</p>
<p>David: Ill accept this offer from you for now as your the first person who has actually empathised and offered some sort of good will gesture</p>
<p>David: But would you pass this on to the manager for investigation and ask him to look into the previous conversations</p>
<p>David: Hopefully see if anything else can be done?</p>
<p>Tara: Sure.</p>
<p>Tara: I will definitely notify my manager for you.</p>
<p>David: And ask him to contact me back?</p>
<p>David: So I actually see a resolution</p>
<p>Tara: I don't know if he has the ability to contact you back directly. Chat support doesn't have the ability to make phone calls, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>David: I have email</p>
<p>Tara: One moment, I will inquire for you.</p>
<p>Tara: What I can do for you, as my own personal manager is not actually available at the moment, is I can make a note of speaking with you tonight. However, I am afraid I cannot promise contact back. If you would like to speak to someone regarding this we
 can find a manager for you, but honestly I don't believe it would be something that we would have the ability to research from our end.</p>
<p>Tara: I think if you are troubled by the support you have received, (and this is coming from someone who works internally) the best way to get the attention of head office is through the feedback link on the website.</p>
<p>David: I would like that, as he could at least pass it on</p>
<p>Tara: I know you're concerned it will not be addressed.</p>
<p>Tara: I just don't want to deliver false promises.</p>
<p>David: I know it will not be addressed</p>
<p>David: at most they are probably scanned by a computer system for keywords</p>
<p>Tara: I wish I could tell you for certain how they monitor that feedback. I know that feedback you leave for chat for me is read on a daily basis (by myself, and by my manager), though.</p>
<p>David: Soooo</p>
<p>Tara: And it is used to weigh my abilities as a customer support agent.</p>
<p>David: It wont get to head office</p>
<p>David: itll get to your manager</p>
<p>David: which I who im asking to speak to?</p>
<p>Tara: If you ever feel like the agent you spoke to was unhelpful, definitely leave it there as I can guarantee you it is not a system that looks for keywords but actual people who read them.</p>
<p>Tara: Yes he will be able to review it.</p>
<p>Tara: He has access to all feedback left from my chats.</p>
<p>David: im not saying your unhelpful, more pointing out that the others were unhelpful and repeatadly lied to me</p>
<p>David: I would rather speak to him to ensure I actually get a response</p>
<p>Tara: Oh and I can totally appreciate that. I guess my concern is that you don't rate the survey low based on your overall experience as it will reflect on me personally.</p>
<p>David: In fact it would reflect YOU very well in this instance</p>
<p>David: But then move on to loads of complaining about other people</p>
<p>David: Which will be refered to as "off-topic"</p>
<p>Tara: I will be honest, once again, and inform you that it is actually the end of the shift for my center and right now trying to find a manager at this hour will be difficult. We do have support all hours of the day, though. I don't know if you would like
 to speak to another agent and ask for their manager</p>
<p>David: My favourite phrase that companies use to get out of viewing the bigger picture</p>
<p>David: to have them deny me for another reason</p>
<p>David: Not really no</p>
<p>Tara: I'm really sorry, David. I'm trying to work the best I can with the boundaries I am given.</p>
<p>David: I understand that</p>
<p>David: But most of your collegues are not such inclined</p>
<p>Tara: I will definitely inform my manager on your behalf tomorrow, though. We will both be here, for certain.</p>
<p>David: Im not happy with that</p>
<p>David: /could this not be passed directly to a manager of another centre</p>
<p>David: Im starting to get the impression your manager is trying to avoid talking to me</p>
<p>David: I would assume he would be at a desk or at most helping one of your collegues nearby</p>
<p>Tara: Oh no, he isn't. As I said he isn't available right now. I'll see if I can find one for you.</p>
<p>Tara: One moment.</p>
<p>David: So what reason could he have for not speaking to me</p>
<p>David: By the way if you were interested about similar achievement problems</p>
<p>David: <a href="http://www.xbox360achievements.org/forum/showthread.php?t=299871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox360achievements.org/forum/showthread.php?t=299871</a></p>
<p>David: Just as a random note for ya</p>
<p>Tara: One moment, David. I have found an available manager. My manager is actually not on duty as of present. I have found a manager who is available to speak with though.</p>
<p>David: Ok</p>
<p>Tara: I can transfer you to him if you would like.</p>
<p>David: That page offers some fixes you guys could try offering</p>
<p>David: Thank you please transfer me</p>
<p>Tara: One moment please. I am just going to inform him of our conversation, ok?</p>
<p>David: yup sure</p>
<p>Tara: OK one moment while I transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, the girl was polite, helpful and assuring. But it was a blantent attempt to get rid of me in my eyes. I may be wrong but thats how it felt. After she enquired with her manager over one of our points it was all of a sudden closing time. Anyway I get
 through to Ben, a supposed manager here to uphold customer relations and help find a solution to this mighty problem!</p>
<p>Heres how it goes, watch how quick he changes subject back to gamerscore (ignoring all other points) and then suddenly decides he doesnt wanna talk to me anymore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please wait while I transfer the chat to 'Ben'.</p>
<p>Privacy Statement <br />
You are now chatting with 'Ben'.</p>
<p>Ben: Hello David, what can I assist you with?</p>
<p>David: Did the other advisor explain?</p>
<p>Ben: Sure, you are having issues unlocking achievements and getting reset is that correct?</p>
<p>Ben: David, are you there?</p>
<p>David: I meant the reason I wanted to speak to a manager</p>
<p>David: which was the previous service I have been recieving from this chat department</p>
<p>Ben: This is what I am asking, what can I assist you with?</p>
<p>David: Several of the previous chats I have had have met with immediate disconnection, lack of response, or threat of disconnection without reason</p>
<p>David: Several advisors had brushed me off with unfoundedadvice leading to me taking extreme measures</p>
<p>David: suchas upgrading my home broadband and replacing my consoles and routers</p>
<p>David: ridiculously long phone calls with my ISP about opening ports which I already told them were open</p>
<p>Ben: Aww man, I am truly sorry to hear that. As you may know we have many call centers and each center has its own agents and managers, so I can only speak on behalf of my own team, however I do understand your concern and I can assure you these transcripts
 are reviewed daily.</p>
<p>David: despite me telling them the ISP doesnt even know what they are, and that I used to work FOR that ISP therefore I know how to check</p>
<p>David: Telling me that nothing could be done about a month extension on my live account as it has been buggy and disconnecting for over three weeks</p>
<p>David: When the last advisor in fact gave me that pretty much straight away</p>
<p>Ben: I am sure you exhausted all troubleshooting as it seems you are on top of things, however we are limited in the information we have for gamerscore and achievements.</p>
<p>David: Multiple refusals to take this higher</p>
<p>Ben: I am glad she was able to provide you with helpful information.</p>
<p>David: And refusal to even admit for a moment that the problem could be on your end</p>
<p>Ben: And glad you took the time to let me know.</p>
<p>David: Which in my eyes the last issue definatly was</p>
<p>David: I was getting disconnected randomly and whenever starting a game</p>
<p>David: And being told that every games servers were unavailable when people on my friends list and my neighbour were playing those games</p>
<p>David: Service alerts on your website earlier that day</p>
<p>David: And problems with xbox.com for the better part of the day led me to that conclusion</p>
<p>David: It was demanded to me that this was all fixed and it was all my problem all of a sudden, ignoring the earlier perils on your end</p>
<p>Ben: As I stated thank you for letting me know, I have noted your account and recommend you review our forums for gamerscore corrections.</p>
<p>David: But magically all started working again the next day</p>
<p>Ben: I'm glad it started working.</p>
<p>David: but my point is nothing has been done for me</p>
<p>David: The month extension merely covers the period where the service was not functioining properly</p>
<p>David: It does not cover my troubles and wasted hours</p>
<p>Ben: Gamerscore corrections are an enforcement action taken by our enforcement team. The only place for more information is our forums, would you like the link?</p>
<p>David: As a three year customer of no complaints until now I would like some kind of gesture of goodwill from you</p>
<p>David: I would</p>
<p>David: Gamerscore corrections?</p>
<p>Ben: I do apologize David I cannot assist you further with this issue.</p>
<p>David: Well I want it escalated to someone who can</p>
<p>David: without having to keep explaining all over again</p>
<p>David: and again</p>
<p>David: etc</p>
<p>Ben: I do apologize you spent so much time on chat, the people who can handle your request is our enforecement team.</p>
<p>David: on this problem yes and I will speak to them</p>
<p>David: I am talking to you about a blatent lack of service or care</p>
<p>Ben: Ok sounds great, anything else I can assist you with?</p>
<p>David: You are trying to get rid of me</p>
<p>Ben: I made a note on your account David.</p>
<p>David: Ive told you what I want help with several times</p>
<p>Ben: I am unable to assist you further.</p>
<p>David: a "note" is not good enough</p>
<p>David: There should be several "notes" apparently</p>
<p>David: Nothing has been done with these "notes" so far</p>
<p>Ben: That is all I am able to offer.</p>
<p>David: Your not offering me anything</p>
<p>Ben: I suggest addressing your concern on our forums.</p>
<p>David: Which is moderated largly by users</p>
<p>David: And i am not going to post on the forums about issues I have experianced with the live chat</p>
<p>David: The forum is for the actual xbox and its games</p>
<p>David: not your poor service</p>
<p>Ben: I feel we have addressed both of your issues to the best of our ability and within the support boundaries offered by chat. The forums is your only option for further information.</p>
<p>David: but the forum is not FOR THE SERVICE I RECIEVED</p>
<p>David: and once again you have not addressed anything</p>
<p>David: just directed me elsewhere</p>
<p>David: just like I said would happen to the last advisor</p>
<p>Ben: David, our forums is a great resource, and it has many places you can contribute and address concerns, There is a specific section, moderated by our enforcement team for gamerscore issues, there is also another spot just for&nbsp; complaints if you so wish.</p>
<p>David: Yeah about the games and console</p>
<p>David: Not shoddy service from you guys</p>
<p>Ben: And your complaints about our service.</p>
<p>David: I have used the forums before you know</p>
<p>Ben: I am sure you have, you sound like a hardcore gamer!</p>
<p>David: ...</p>
<p>David: and thats supposed to mean?</p>
<p>Ben: Like you know what you are doing.</p>
<p>David: Yea I do, us "hard core gamers" make up the bulk of xbox lives revenue</p>
<p>David: and as such I deserve to be helped with my problems</p>
<p>David: not refered elsewhere everytime</p>
<p>Ben: Yes we value your service and that is all we are trying to do is get you to the absolute best place to address your issue. I am not sure where the confusion is.</p>
<p>David: Gee I dunno</p>
<p>Ben: I have told you forums is the place to address both of your issues.</p>
<p>Ben: Not sure what else I can say.</p>
<p>David: maybe looking at the previous conversations</p>
<p>David: And if you find that the advisors did just what I said they did</p>
<p>David: offering me something for the trouble it has caused mwe</p>
<p>David: Hell previous advice has left me with new BB which costs a further £15 a month that I didnt need</p>
<p>David: and now cant downgrade</p>
<p>David: as well as the £40 I spent on routers</p>
<p>David: And £200 I spent on a new xbox</p>
<p>Ben: I do apologize for any confusion which is why you asked to speak to me. I am offering you the best solution for your issue. I do understand your concerns and want you to get your issue resolved.</p>
<p>David: Like I saidthat issue is resolved</p>
<p>David: And I believe it was a fault at your end all along as I have done nothing to fix it</p>
<p>Ben: I may have been and if so the enforcement team can resolve it for you.</p>
<p>Ben: *it</p>
<p>David: A goodwill gesture to say "sorry we messed you around when It was something at our end all along" would be the only acceptable resolution</p>
<p>David: No thats for something completly seperate Geez are you listening at all</p>
<p>David: ?</p>
<p>Ben: If that is the case I am sure they will!</p>
<p>David: Forget the gamerscore thing</p>
<p>David: Who will!?!?!</p>
<p>David: Your refering me to a PUBLIC FORUM</p>
<p>Ben: David your issues have been addressed.</p>
<p>David: How?</p>
<p>Ben: Thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. To end your chat session please click the X above the chat window:</p>
<p>David: Oi!</p>
<p>Chat session has been ended by the agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lol look at that, I say "How!?" and he says "Bye", charming</p>
<p>Like I said there is NO apprpriate section on these forums to complain about service recieved and nor did I expect this would be. If not clearly written, witholding bad language and insults it would merely be taken as slander and removed by the powers that
 be.</p>
<p>I just wanted to pass this on to you guys so that you know what your in for if you try to get any help or anything back for having to put up with soooo many problems for a pretty long period of time. I expected more, especially from watching they're big
 bosses at things like games conventions going on about how "Its all about YOU the gamers" and we wanna make xbox live a "great place for YOU". Its bu**. Once your payment for that month is made they tell you to go and stick one.</p>
<p>Now im left with crazy expensive Broadband, 2 xboxs a unneccesary wireless card at £50 a ton of games that I cant really play because ill probably just&nbsp;get kicked off again and overused keyboard on my poor lappy.</p>
<p>If youve had similar problems id love to hear them, if this page even makes it on to the forum at all</p>
<p>Cheers guys</p>

<p>Although it seems to work (for now) i get the picture that he doesn't have high expectations that it will work this time either. For his sake i really hope it will work considering all the effort he has put into this.</p>

<p>On the console that you are getting disconnected from when playing BlackOps .. check your storage device(s) in the games folder then the folder of the game it's happening on and check for corrupt content. &nbsp;Sometimes on COD if you back out of a online match
 without exiting properly it will cause files to become corrupt which will then give what looks like connection issues. &nbsp;Not always but it's something to check and see if there are any corrupt files.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion but as I said, there are no corupted files as at some point i completly removed my HDD (They wanted me to delete the info, what would have been the point, especially as they were wrong lol)</p>
<p>Also this would have been corrected after a successful match as it would overwrite.</p>
<p>Im not too sure that zombies saves anything anyway.</p>

<p>That depends on what you need help with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to create a new post on this forum, simply use the "Ask a question" link at the very top of the page, where it says "Microsoft | Community", then "Categories" and at the end of that top menu bar, you should see the "Ask a question" link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on that, write a title for your post with a rough overview of your issue (for example a good title would be "Trouble connecting my Xbox One X with my Netgear WiFi", whereas a bad title would be "I need help!")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in the body of your post, describe in much greater detail your issue. If you have trouble with network devices, make sure you also provide the make and model of your network hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally choose that it is a question, not a discussion, and select the <span>
(most) </span>appropriate categories for your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps you on creating your own post that we can then help you with.</p>

<p>Strange that it would prompt you for a product key. I remember after 2003, my Office 2000 Premium SR1 stopped checking for qualifying media and performed full installs directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download a copy of Office 97 from winworld PC, burn it to a CD or extract it to your hard disk and use it to bypass the qualifying check.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Computer Will Not Stay Asleep or Stay Shut Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cdmwolfspade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Will Not Stay Asleep or Stay Shut Down</h2>
                    <p>My desktop (It's an Acer, about three years old, but that's the most I know of it) has recently refused to stay asleep for longer than a few minutes (anywhere from 5-10 minutes, give or take a couple), and would only stay shutdown anywhere between a minute
 to 15, until just these past couple weeks (now, it won't shut down at all, but rather it will attempt to shut down until it eventually goes to sleep, causing me to have to unplug it or force-shut down to get it off of the shutdown screen). When I bought it,
 I ran Windows 8, and since then have upgraded to Windows 10, but I've been on Windows 10 for so long that I can't seem to think that's the problem. My brother's computer (like a two month old Lenovo) began having the same problem a few weeks after purchase
 (whereas mine began about four weeks ago, nearly a month after his did) and his came with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reason to believe that the problem came from a traffic light USB port that we each got for Christmas. &nbsp;Upon plugging it in, my brother's computer had the problem the same night, but when I plugged mine is, I had no problems until the following month
 or so (sorry, I may be getting my dates jumbled, but the idea remains the same). Even after unplugging these USB ports, however, the problem persisted. Both computers are all-in-one desktops, and both run Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my power settings for issues with the timers and all, but there was nothing out of the norm. This is all I've checked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix this? I hate to see the computer continuously sleep/wake up back and forth over night, and I'm worried it may do further damage if I leave it untreated.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and detail description of issue you are facing.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be an issue with the corrupt power plan settings. This issue might also occur due to outdated display driver or some other devices are responsible to keep it sleep or shut down. Also as you have mentioned it occurs with traffic light USB.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the Methods below and check.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 :</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to <strong>run the troubleshooter:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: Power troubleshooter </strong>helps to fix any issue with the power settings of the computer.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Type “Troubleshooting” on the Search bar.<br />
b) Press “Enter”.<br />
c) Click on “View all” on the left panel.<br />
d) Click on “Power”.<br />
e) Click on “Next” and follow the onscreen instructions to troubleshoot the issue using the Power troubleshooter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>restore default settings of power plan</strong> and check if it helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press Windows + X, and select the option Control Panel (Classic View).<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on the Power Options icon. <br />
3.&nbsp;Click on Change plan settings.<br />
4.&nbsp;Select the option “Restore default settings for this plan”.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists try method 3.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Create a power plan </strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Type Power in search box <br />
2.&nbsp;Select "Choose a Power Plan" <br />
3.&nbsp;Click where it says "Create a power plan" in the area on the left side of the Power options window.<br />
4.&nbsp;Select a power plan to start with such as "Balanced" or "High performance" and then click "Next."<br />
5.&nbsp;Select a number of minutes you want both the display and the computer sleep mode, and then click "Create."<br />
</p>

            <p>Hey Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the assistance. Method 1 worked wonders. Had I thought to take a screenshot of the diagnostic report, I would have, but long story short: it worked. Something or other having to do with my screensaver timer and my sleep timer. They weren't altered
 in the settings but something about them was apparently off (for lack of any descriptors).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, the same issue, or anything similar, failed to show up on my brother's computer. In a way, it helps in that it confirms my theory of two different issues branching from the same source. I will try the other methods and keep you posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Disable or uninstall third party anti-virus software and check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any third party software installed on the computer, then I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if the issue resolves </span></span><strong><span><span>performing a clean boot.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state </span><strong><span>and check.</span></strong>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us informed if the issue is resolved. We are glad to help you further.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Viahub3.sys PAGE FAULT IN NON PAGED AREA - drivers causing bluescreen, how to remove completely&#63;</h2>
                    I have been getting blue screens while playing far cry 3 for the past few weeks, reinstalling&nbsp; the game and my graphics drivers did not help the issue. I ran WhoCrashed which is a program that analyses system dumps and it found that the problem was viahub3.sys.&nbsp;
 I realised that it is from the drivers of the via usb hub adapter that I installed this year as the dates information for it matches up.<br />
<br />
After running the uninstaller there were still files left on my computer including the culprit viahub3.sys file. How do i completely delete the drivers from the C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\viahub3.inf_amd64_neutral_0ef5d1e2eb04e604 folder?
 and is it safe to simply delete these files manually?<br />

<p>Hi, I'm an engineer on the 3D Builder team. I'm not familiar with Source FilmMaker so I don't know what formats they open, but you can export things in 3D Builder through the "Save As" option. You can export things in 3MF, STL, OBJ, and PLY. Again, I don't
 know what formats SourceFilmMaker supports but the 3MF, OBJ, and PLY should retain their colors if FilmMaker opens them and supports the file types correctly.</p>

<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do

<p><span><span>Error 651 indicates The Modem (or other connecting device) has reported an error.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are some additional things you can try to fix the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1: Uninstall and reinstall the Modem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Go to Start &gt; Control panel &gt; Phone and Modem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Check if correct modem is installed. If not then remove modem. Refer:<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-or-remove-a-modem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Install

<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Re-install the modem. Refer the article above.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2: This problem can also occur because the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) tries to create a host route and then detects
