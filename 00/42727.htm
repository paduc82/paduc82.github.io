<h2>            Opinions on Microsoft recently</h2>
                    
<p>I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way, but to me, Microsoft seem to have really gotten on my nerve lately and just seem to be going down hill. TO start, Windows 8... Well, and I know this has been disscused before but this is my view, I hate the
 Metro UI and it just... doesnt make a PC, well a PC anymore. The concept was good. FOR TABLETS, not PCs with a mouse and keyboard. And whilst I appreciate some aditions like ISO mounting and such, it just doesnt feel like Windows anymore, I'll think I'll stick
 to Windows 7 for the foreseable future, heck, not even the ¬£25 Pro version deal will tempt me. And I mean it goes onto the Server version too, 2012. The whole concept would be great for touch screens&nbsp;but why make it mandetory..&nbsp;Next, Facebook on Xbox and IE.
 I get why IE was included and I throughly love it. But... Forcing you to use it for Facebook and Twitter? It just seems unfair. I downloaded the App months ago and now I cant use it. Not only that but I can't redownload it. I mean all I wanted was to have
 the acheivements and updates get posted but doesn't look like I can do that now, and the Xbox dashboard... Metro works, eh, ok, but it feels it's getting worse, and heck, I was biased to the PS3 before owning a 360, and whilst I try to stay loyal, I just can't
 help but feel that Microsoft will mess something else up. I heard mixed opinions on Halo 4 but I'm not going to start on it since I haven't completed it yet, I just hope it's not another thing to complain about, altough the limited edition box seems cheap
 compared to the rest. I also heard about Windows 8 Phone doing the same thing with IE which again I find ludicrous and unfair, plus the app licensing thing, it's like Apple..</p>
<p>I know it's only a few things and I may seem like Im ranting, but it just doesn't seem or feel good to me.</p>

<p>I disagree with your first sentence, they don¬¥t go down the hill, they climb it up very well.
</p>
<p>Cheap material or not, first. everything will get lighter, less material and different. That is normal, they walk forward not backward. Why should they stick with old stuff? I like the Windows 8 Interface. Just can¬¥t get it yet.
</p>
<p>"Forcebook"? Twitter? No thank you. YOu got the IE. For people like me who dont use i, it seemed very disappointing to have it on the app marketplace. You see it everywhere, I don¬¥t wanna see this virus on my Xbox.
</p>
<p>Thats my opinion sorry. </p>
<p>As long as I see that Microsoft work out new ideas, concepts and isn¬¥t scared to walk step forwards, I¬¥ll always say go for it!</p>
<p>Things change every day, if Microsoft would always stay with old stuff just cause people are used to it, we won¬¥t even have Windows XP. Probably we would be stuck with my best friend DOS.
</p>
<p>I understand that you don¬¥t feel well with changes but that is normal.</p>
<p>Someone have to be the visionary and I¬¥m happy Microsoft don¬¥t dare to become that one.
</p>
<p>You are sceptic now but later you will love it ;) Give it a chance. </p>

<p>Microsoft is great! All glory to the Microsoft!</p>
<p>All kidding aside, I think that Windows 8 is indeed more touch oriented, and it's because they're thinking in the way of the future, when touchscreens on laptops and PC will pretty much be the norm, many models are doing it already.</p>
<p>Still, you can use it perfectly while staying in desktop mode and skipping metro altogether if that's what you desire.</p>
<p>By the way, before you start calling me a fanboy, I'm a proud Macbook Pro user for several years now and never looking back, but still have a windows partition for the odd thing or two.</p>
<p>On the Facebook thing... don't you think it's kind of a *** move to share every little achievement on FB? If a friend started doing that I'd unsubscribe in a heartbeat. Using it for beacons is just the amount of interactivity I need, and I think they did
 it just right.</p>

<p>Fair point guys and gals, just was in a bit of an off mood. Altough, even if Metro is the "future", callme old fashioned, but I really wouldn't wanna use it. I mean, everything I'd need a touch-based OS for I have my good old Galaxy S so wouldn't need it.
 And I know about Desktop mode, but that's not my point, and you can't entirely dismiss it in Windows 8, like, where's the start menu I so miss gone? Also in a buisiness sense, Metro would seem to me to make things worse productivity wise.</p>
<p>And I don't wanna brag about acheivements, just I'd like that option. Whether my friends like it or not is entirely their choice BUT they can turn off those messages being sent to them.</p>

<p>Microsoft are a really good company and I disagree with you on some points and not to be mean or anything if you are saying stuff about microsoft saying you don't like some of the stuff they do well if you think you can do better you have a reason to post
 this thread but if you cannot do better then don't bother posting because Xbox will ban you for saying stuff about the Company and also Microsoft is not a company all about money they are a company which offer the experience to people around the world to have
 the internet they are the people who originally had the idea of the computer, without Microsoft the PC wouldn't be good and also if there was no Microsoft there would be no consoles around because they create the technology for you to have a console so stop
 saying stuff about microsoft when they are epic </p>

    <title>Adding extended desktop display shifts icons to the left - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelonesoldier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding extended desktop display shifts icons to the left</h2>
                    I am having a problem where activating extended desktop moves my icons and prevents me from placing icons along the right edge of the screen.<br />
<br />
I have a laptop PC that I often hook up to a second&nbsp;monitor when I am at home. I use "extended desktop" - the second monitor is above where my laptop screen is so in the "Screen Resolution" window I have the #2 monitor above the #1 monitor. The number 2 monitor
 is much higher resolution than the #1 monitor.<br />
<br />
I always have my desktop arranged so that there is&nbsp;a single column of icons along the left edge and a single column along the right edge so I can better view my wallpapers. The problem I have is that in every recent version of Windows (XP, Vista, 7) as soon
 as I plug in the extended monitor, all of the icons on the right side of the screen are shifted one column to the left and Windows does not let me shift them back to the right. These are all icons on the #1 monitor, I don't place icons on #2 since it's not
 always plugged in.<br />
<br />
I thought this problem would be fixed by now, but then I thought there would be a "lock desktop icons" feature by now. Is there any solution for this problem? I apologize it is very difficult to explain in text and very easy to explain with an image but I can't
 attach an image.

<br />
I just have this problem and came across your post. Thought I would give you an answer finally, of sorts...<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was obvious that <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a39f1ed4-deea-4f4e-a8f5-80d6fc308e51">
Grzegorz</a> didn't understand your problem exactly but I do. <br />
<br />
Symptom:<br />
<br />
you extend your desktop (usually to the left for this to happen) and any icons you have on the far right of your main screen will nudge to the left about an inch for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
why?<br />
<br />
well it seems that it happens with the second monitor having a lower resolution, and windows being a bit funny about that situation with some alignments.<br />
<br />
solution:<br />
<br />
Easy. Using the windows resolution applet, drag the second monitor from the top left of the main screen, to the bottom left of the main screen and apply. For some reason using the bottom left alignment does not result in the icons being moved and still allows
 you to have your extended monitor on the left.<br />
<br />
I hope this makes sense. When you first move the second monitor over to the left side, it sometimes defaults to the top left position (i.e. with the tops of both screens running in a line), you need to move the second monitor down so that the bottons are in
 a line and the problem is solved.<br />
<br />
hope this helps you and antone else who has this unusual issue.<br />
<br />
safe surfing.<br />

            <p>Thank you... You should frame this!&nbsp; If you knew how many other useless suggestions I have seen for solving this problem - Anything from reinstalling the graphic driver to doing a system restore??... but I wouldn't buy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's so simple to resolve, when

</p><p>I wonder why Microsoft doesn't provide this information in their instructions? - I guess, it would be too easy, they prefer hiding&nbsp;their 'dirty' little secrets!</p>

<p>Hi LoriWells1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may not determine the cause of the issue yet until such isolation or workarounds are performed. However, this issue is most likely related to files settings which are possibly set incorrectly. Kindly verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>Have you made any recent changes to your computer like installing updates?</span></span></li><li>What seems to happen when you try to open the file?</li><li>Are you getting any specific error message? If possible can you send us a screenshot?</li><li>Were you able to open those files on a different program aside from the one that you mentioned?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may also follow these steps: Search <strong>File Explorer Options</strong> in Cortana's search icon &gt; Click
<strong>View</strong> &gt; under <strong>Advanced settings: Files and Folders</strong> &gt; uncheck
<strong>Display file icon on thumbnails </strong>&gt; click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we have a codec pack that's ready for download. The Microsoft Camera Codec Pack allows you to view variety of device-specific file formats. You may check this

<h2>            file is downloading as .aspx and for &#39;type&#39; it says &#34;unknown file type&#34; need to change how it downloads</h2>
                    at work I'm able to download from a website and it comes in as 'name:&nbsp; viewdocumentfragement.tiff' then 'type: microsoft office document imaging file, 56KB (or whatever the size is of that document), then 'from: www.leeclerk.org'<br />
<br />
but when I try to open it here at home it comes up as 'name: viewdocumentfragment.aspx' 'type: unknown file type' 'from:
www.leeclerk.org'&nbsp; and the only way i can open it is to download it my desktop, change the file extension to .tif and then I was opening it my Windows Photo Gallery, but I found out and just added the Microsoft Document
 Imaging file today, it didn't install when I installed MS Office 2007 Ultimate... I thought when I 'fixed' MS Office 2007 to put in the document imaging it would fix my problem, but it hasn't.

    <title>Not receiving instant messages from a selected contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanislavsbuls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving instant messages from a selected contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Since I upgraded to the a new Skype two weeks ago, I no longer receive messages from randomly selected contacts. I doo see the "typing..." notification in chat window when they type, but do never receive message itself. On their side message gets stuck as
 "sending...", forever. It has nothing to do with the internet connection, it happens on both desktop (Mac) and mobile (Android) and on different internet connections (different Wifi and mobile networks). All apps are updated to the latest versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do realize that Im not the only one with that problem in this forum and if someone from Skype replies, he does it once and then fades away. So, please, be so kind and do not refer me to the&nbsp;<span>https://heartbeat.skype.com,
 it is not an answer.</span></p>

<p>Hi All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting steps&nbsp;for both sides, kindly uninstall and reinstall the Skype applications.&nbsp;Then, to further isolate the case, try to send messages and check if the issue will be fixed or you will get the same behavior.
</p>
<p>

<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help, as I previously explained the issue goes across platforms, I don't think it is a specific app issue. Messages are lost or still on the way somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Current app versions: on Android ‚Äì 8.12.0.14 and on Mac ‚Äì 8.12.0.14<br />

<h3> computorjacked  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot up from bios</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10 after being badgered by the icon for the longest time I kept turning it off but kept coming back so I said fine I will install . It worked for 2 weeks turned off the computer when I turned it back on it said failure to boot
 missing or corrupte files . So I asked a friend to help me and they said they would send me a recovery file on a flash drive popped it in and no dice come to figure my bios won't recover from usb drive so asked a neighbor to switch it to a disk for me . I
 get the disk and it says no operating system found . This is getting frustrating and I have now involved 2 friends to help and still nothing . I have a older computer but have never had any problems till now is there any thing I can do to fix this . I am a
 novice at best and don't know terms well so the easiest explanation would be helpful in dummy terms thanks

            I have unplugged all external devices still won't load desktop. Then loaded recovery disk and went to advanced bios options for CD-ROM boot priority and when I open the cd rom boot priority it shows a DVD is in the drive but there is nothing to select
 I just hit enter on cd rom boot priority and just shows its in the drive so I save with f10 and when I restart it says no operating system found .&nbsp;

                    I was successfully able to download Microsoft 7 games to Windows 10 but after a (very lengthy) upgrade they stopped working. I clicked on them and nothing. Also unable to download them again. Any way to keep the games after the upgrade? Thanks!

<h2>            Sign-in&#58; password &#38; Cotcha authentication</h2>
                    I forgot my password, so changed it but only after entering the wrong password multiple times. The Skype app on my Mac is now asking for my password and the Cotcha code (to prove I'm not a robot). IT fails to recognise my new password, however. I have
 tried deleting the App and downloading it again, but the problem persists. I have no problem logging into my account via Skype.com or on my iPhone with the new password. Any advice?&nbsp;

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ee1cb703-577d-4f32-b6b3-201daaac0494" title="O Balch">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you signing into Skype using an email address, a Skype Name, or a phone number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot recall your sign-in details, please refer to this support page for help:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA109/i-ve-forgotten-my-skype-name-or-password?q=forgot+username" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most probable reason why you cannot access the application is because you've reset the password for a different account. Having said that, I strongly suggest to please reset your password again by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">Click here</span></strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;the Skype name, email address or phone number&nbsp;of the account you are trying to recover, and hit
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Look for
<strong>Reset password</strong> button and click it. </span></li><li><span>You will be routed to Microsoft's website for password reset.
</span></li><li><span>Click any radio button, and hit
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the "<strong>Recover your account</strong>" page, please make sure that the Skype name of the account you are trying to recover is listed on the first box.</span></li><li><span>Type the characters (CAPTCHA) shown into the second textbox and click Next.</span></li><li><span>Verify&nbsp;the account.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Evolve game progress resets due to data not syncing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jyxa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Evolve game progress resets due to data not syncing.</h2>
                    
<p>This issue is only seen on the Xbox One. You try signing into Evolve, and the game tells you it is syncing data and it fails to do so. Eventually after a few tries I was able to get into the game, only to see that all of my progress (levels, unlocks, etc.)
 was reset. This issue seems to be on Xbox's end, considering the game data is unable to sync as opposed to an in-game error.</p>

            Hi Rohit,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answer.<br />
I do not have access to windows store from my PC. I want to buy a tablet with option to installing marine charts. I know that there is many maps both on apple store and adroid market (for example Navionics).<br />

            <p>This is a poor and self serving answer from Microsoft. The answer is no. They need to get their act together and start getting more adult apps as promised when we bought the machine.</p>

<h2>            Mi consola no detecta los MB que tengo contratados &#161;AYUDA&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hola comunidad, he buscado por todos lados soluciones pero no hay mucha informaci√≥n(o tal vez no s√© buscar bien), ayuda por favor.<br /><br />El problema est√° en que desde hace un mes, mi xbox no detecta los MB que tengo contratados, tengo 30 MB por fibra √≥ptica y cuando hago la prueba de velocidad en un celular o una computadora los detecta sin problemas pero cuando lo hago en el xbox s√≥lo me detecta 3 MB(con suerte) y me va con un lag horrible, cuando antes me detectaba entre 25-30; inclusive si lo conecto a cable lo m√°ximo que detecta son 3-4.</p>
