<h2>            Missing apps</h2>
                    <p>Compared to ios and android devices why windows is lacking behind when it comes to simple application which are so easily available on other platforms for eg instagram a widely used app still windows have a beta version of it and there is also no snap chat
 as well for window's</p>
<p>
I love my phone but windows should start looking at these small issues as well</p>

            <p>You think Microsoft doesn't want those apps? You think they didn't contact the developers? It is the developers' decision not to develop those apps for Windows Phone. Just search online about Snapchat and Windows Phone.</p>

    <title>print a single record from a subform - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anneg3  say:</h3>
<h2>            print a single record from a subform</h2>
                    <p>I have a form with two pages. The first page is linked to table 1 and the second page has a subform which is linked to table 2.&nbsp; Table 1&nbsp;has details of a book collection&nbsp;and Table 2&nbsp;has names and addresses of borrowers.&nbsp; I would like end users to be able
 to print a report from a single selected record on this subform, in other words, the name and address of the current borrower with the title of the borrowed book.&nbsp; Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Before looking at the question of printing a report, you say you have two tables, but for this situation you'd need three, e.g.<br />
<br />
Books<br />
....BookID (PK)<br />
....Title<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
Borrowers<br />
....BorrowerID (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....LastName<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
and to model the many-to-many relationship type between Books and Borrowers<br />
<br />
Withdrawals<br />
....BookID<br />
....BorrowerID<br />
....DateBorrowed<br />
....DateReturned<br />
<br />
The primary key of the last table is a composite one made up of BookID, BorrowerID and DateBorrowed.&nbsp; The Withdrawals table would be the RecordSource of your subform.<br />
<br />
So, assuming the above model, firstly create a report based on a query which joins all three tables, Borrowers to Withdrawls on BorrowerID, and Withdrawals to Boooks on BookID.&nbsp; Return the relevant columns from the tables which you want to see in the report,
 but be sure to include BorrowerID from Borrowers and BookID from Books, but not the columns of those names from Withdrawals. You don't need to show these two key columns in the report however, just include them in the query.&nbsp; How you proceed then depend partly
 on how the subform is set up, so I'll assume that, in addition to controls bound to the two date columns, it contains a combo box in which to select the borrower, set up as follows:<br />
<br />
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cboBorrower<br />
<br />
ControlSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BorrowerID<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT BorrowerID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName FROM Borrowers ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm;8cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the last one.&nbsp; The important thing is that the first dimension is zero to hide the first column and that the second is at least as wide as the combo box. Borrowers
 is the name of the table and BorrowerID its primary key.<br />
<br />
You then have a couple of options as to how you open the report filtered to the current borrower: and add a button within the subform to print the subform:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Add a button to the subform, which of course means it must be in continuous forms view rather than datasheet view.&nbsp; This can be in its header or footer, or you could have a small button at the end of each row, e.g. with a printer image.&nbsp; Either way the
 code in the button's Click event would be along these lines:<br />
<br />
Const REPORT_NAME = "Your report name goes here"<br />
Dim strMessage As String<br />
Dim strCriteria As String<br />
<br />
If Not IsNull(Me.BorrowerID) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "Print details of " &amp; Me.cboBorrower.Column(1) &amp; "'s withdawal?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMessage, vbQuestion + vbYesNo, "Confirm") = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "BorrowerID = " &amp; Me.cboBorrower &amp; " And BookID = " &amp; Me.BookID &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And DateBorrowed = #" &amp; Format(Me.DateBorrowed,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Dirty = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport REPORT_NAME<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "No borrower selected."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox strMessage, vbExclamation, "Invalid Operation"<br />
End If<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The alternative would be to have the button on the main parent form, in which case the code is very similar:<br />
<br />
Const REPORT_NAME = "Your report name goes here"<br />
Dim strMessage As String<br />
Dim strCriteria As String<br />
<br />
If Not IsNull(Me.BorrowerID) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "Print details of " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.YourSubFormControl.Form.cboBorrower.Column(1) &amp; "'s withdawal?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMessage, vbQuestion + vbYesNo, "Confirm") = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "BorrowerID = " &amp; Me.YourSubFormControl.Form.cboBorrower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport REPORT_NAME<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "BorrowerID = " &amp; Me.YourSubFormControl.Form.cboBorrower &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And BookID = " &amp; Me.BookID &amp; " And DateBorrowed = #" &amp;&nbsp; _ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(Me.YourSubFormControl.Form.DateBorrowed,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "No borrower selected."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox strMessage, vbExclamation, "Invalid Operation"<br />
End If<br />
<br />
In this code YourSubFormControl is the name of the control in the parent form which houses the subform. Remember that if you've used spaces or other special characters in object names (not recommended) they must be wrapped in square brackets, e.g [Book ID].<br />

<h2>            Cannot Delete Comments from Comments Pane</h2>
                    Hello. Ever since I upgraded my computer with a new version of Office 365, I no longer see the 'x' symbol in any of the comments boxes in PowerPoint on the Comments pane. I can still delete comments if I manually use the Delete button on the toolbar but
 I can't delete the comments in the pane through the 'x' symbol or if I left-click on them.

<p>Hi Brandon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>According to my test, I can delete the comments via the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-change-hide-or-delete-comments-in-a-presentation-A8F071FA-6E5D-4C37-A025-1CF48A76EB38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add, change, hide, or delete comments in a presentation</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can’t delete it, I suggest you try John’s suggestion to check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can use online repair to check:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information for further analysis?</p>
<p>1. The version of Office. (Click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p>2. The screenshot of Comments.</p>
<p>3. Check if all files meet the issue.</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem since Windows 10 initiated a major update when I logged in over the weekend of 18th/19th June - it took nearly an hour and several restarts, very frustrating when you're waiting to begin work! Since then a number of settings, which I
 painstakingly applied, such as items pinned to the Task Bar and Shortcuts on the Desktop,&nbsp;have been reset, including all my Internet Explorer Favorites disappearing from my Favorites list and my Favorites Toolbar.&nbsp; My Favorites, and Favorites Toolbar, are
 all still present in my User Profile but it seems Internet Explorer doesn't recognise them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestion of clicking Start but was unable to find "Computer" - good start! I eventually displayed my User Setting in Windows Explorer and followed your suggestion - no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable, I've spent the morning trying to get back to where I was before the update, this should not happen after an update, this is my PC and I should decide how it's configured, not Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how I relink my Favorites with Internet Explorer.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
How about changing the browsers? The <strong>Windows 10</strong> installation comes with a new speedy browser by Microsoft,
<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>. You may easily download and install it from the official website. Then you open the new browser, find the
<em>Settings</em> menu (click the <em>ellipsis</em> at the top right ), choose <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>Import favorites from another browser</em></span> and just import them. There should be the current Internet Explorer on the list of web browsers. Saved web pages will appear in a special section:&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Thanks for feedback. Seems to be just too many complicated steps for doing one thing. Each new browser has its own way to do a simple task. I just want to hit&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Favorites button and find what I saved, whether its IE, MS, MS Edge, Bing, Google... enough with the switching from this to do that and then import or export. I feel like I'm trying to get into Fort Knox to find a shoe favorite, pretty ridiculous.</p>

<p>After the automated update on may 11th, to my Windows 10 phone build xxxxxx version 1709 a set of apps is not working. The message is "the app cannot be opened.Possible there is an update in the Store". As I checked, no updates are being processed or in

<p>The following apps have this problem: Google !!, Spottify !!, Wordfeud, Parkmobile, 9292, Duckduckgo browser, NOS, NOS teletekst, 3FM, Accurate Tuner free, Flashlight, Funda, Imdb, Yelp, Weerplaza, TVgids.nl.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Gerard, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be a possible software issue. Since most of the apps are not working properly, it would be best to perform a hard reset. This method is will remove all the files, apps, messages, photos and other data. Make sure to

<h2>            merging multiple Excel calendars into one and&#47;or merging multiple Outlook calendars into one</h2>
                    I am trying to figure out the best way to manage multiple Excel Calendars by having them merge into one calendar.&nbsp; We are using different versions of Microsoft Office - and Outlook does not have enough room to enter all the data.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<h2>            What&#39;s really going on with error 805a8011&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read through all of the posts I can find with this error code.&nbsp; So far, I'm not seeing a real diagnosis, just some suggested things that might or might not work for you.&nbsp; When someone suggests doing a hard reset without providing me a very good reason,
 I'm very skeptical.&nbsp; And that what it appears gets recommended most of the time.&nbsp; So let me provide a bit more information, and maybe someone who knows more about the internals of the system can help us all figure out what the problem really is, and how to
 fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>0. I bought some music last week using the Music Discounts app.&nbsp; Too much, phone was below 300 mb overnight.&nbsp; Deleted some music, other stuff, got over 2GB free.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I use Office Lens heavily.&nbsp; A week after being over storage, and having fixed it, suddenly&nbsp;OfficeLens stops being able to save a page, saying Error (Tap to retry).&nbsp; But no matter how many times I try, it doesn't do anything.&nbsp; Did find anything in answers.microsoft.com
 on this one.&nbsp; OneNote works just fine otherwise, the notebook it goes to is there and can be modified and isn't too large.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I try to use the Store.&nbsp; I get this charming error message:</p>
<p>"Inquiring minds may find this error code helpful: 805a8011"</p>
<p>That's when I hit answers.microsoft.com again, and saw advice ranging from sync my account to soft reset to hard reset.&nbsp; Tried all but hard reset, no joy.&nbsp; (See above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Someone mentioned a possible connection to Xbox.&nbsp; Well, could be -- the music I bought was from Xbox.&nbsp; Followed suggestion to go to the games app and try to connect.&nbsp; Got an account error:
</p>
<p>"Sign in at Xbox.com to fix it. (0x805a8011)"</p>
<p>Interesting, eh?&nbsp; Same error code.&nbsp; So this looks like an account glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. There are several things people suggested to crack this error: Making sure that your Microsoft and xbox account were linked, contact and billing information all filled out, and so on.&nbsp; All of these things were already true of my account -- correctly linked,
 filled out, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What does all this mean?&nbsp; To me, it looks like there is an authentication issue.&nbsp; Maybe cached credentials get corrupted when there isn't enough free memory for some process that uses them?&nbsp; In that case, if there is some operation that could clear that
 cache, the problem would be solved.&nbsp; (Doing a hard reset might well do this, but&nbsp;that's like using a nuclear weapon to crush a cockroach.&nbsp; Overkill, inelegant, and requiring a boatload of cleanup and restoration work afterwards.)&nbsp; Does anyone have another
 diagnosis?&nbsp; Or a better way to fix the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken</p>

            <p>Hi Ken!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have understood the issue, there are several problems affecting your phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of them could depend on the fact the Microsoft Account is not syncing. Complete the email account setup as Microsoft Account on Settings&gt;Emais+Account.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi, Salvatore.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my Microsoft account has been syncing just fine.&nbsp; I went through all of the steps in the page that you sent.&nbsp; There was only one missing piece of address information (zip code), filled that out.&nbsp; Still no joy.&nbsp; It is especially
 annoying when I click on the Xbox link under games and it says "There's a problem with your account.&nbsp; Sign in at Xbox.com to fix it (0x805a8011)" -- because right now I
<em>am </em>logged in at xbox.com, and as far as it is concerned, there is absolutely no problem.&nbsp; Suggestions?</p>

<p>H, Salvatore.&nbsp; I already did all that.&nbsp; And yes, I know that a soft reset will do amazing things to the date and time -- my phone has an affinity for 7/1/14, 3:35pm after each soft reset, for some reason.&nbsp; The problem still manifests (i.e. Store doesn't
 connect, logging into Xbox from phone app tells me that I need to log in to xbox.com -- which, as per history of this thread, I've already done multiple times.).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on the road in a couple of hours so I'm not about to do a hard reset.&nbsp; I also think that is a really bad idea, because often it doesn't fix the problem, and many hours get wasted reinstalling stuff.&nbsp; Without knowing what the problem is, it's also hard
 to make sure that it doesn't happen again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you r Microsoft Account syncs fine, you can make a backup copy.<span>&nbsp; </span>
In this way you will be able to recover apps, games, SMS, settings etc. Click on the link below for more information:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry, but your "answer" isn't an answer.&nbsp; It's the same process I've already done.&nbsp;It didn't work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose I do a hard reset, and the problem goes away.&nbsp; Sounds good, right?&nbsp; But in addition to all the time spent getting the phone set up again, since there is no explanation of what is causing the problem, I have no way to know how to avoid it in the future.&nbsp;
 That seems like&nbsp;a serious problem to me.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Ken. Were you able to find any solution or had to hard reset in the end. I am also facing same problem from many weeks and could not find any good solution.
</p>
<p>also feeling very bad at my decision of buying windows phone. It seems Microsoft does not care about it's consumers seeing so many people suffering from a long time and still no solution even on Microsoft's useless forms if they don't care to resolve the
 problems.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5500 Cover Problems</h2>
                    My Nokia 5500 Cover has completed peeled off and I currently am holding it together using an elastic band. This is a phone whose selling feature was it durability as it was a 'sport' phone.<br />
<br />
After minimal usuage first the battery cover at the bottom and now my keypad.<br />
<br />
Took it to my Nokia Support Centre and they said will not replace for free and said they haven't seen this before and made me feel like it was my fault.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem ?

            The peeling keypad was a well known fault in the earlier versions of this model. The care point your tried must have really out of date info.<br />
<br />
Do you have the option to try another care point?<br />
<br />
If not try contacting nokia using the "contact us" link at the top of the page.

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to ask a few questions for clarification to know the best possible resolution to offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the domain of the account you are trying to add into your Outlook.com?</li><li>Were you able to add or connect the said account before the Outlook.com migration?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Jarius, thank you for your questions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The domain I am connecting to is VISI.COM using pop3mail.visi.com and smtpmail.visi.com as instructed by the provider.&nbsp; I tried both ports 110 and 995 for POP3 and 587, 465, and even 80 as SMTP ports.&nbsp; Outlook always changed this back to 587 when I went
 in and edited the connected account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your second question, as stated in my original note, I was sending messages through the same account for a year-and-a-half before the Outlook migration.&nbsp; I used the "Send Only" option which I am told no longer works.&nbsp; I received mail by having
 it forwarded to my account instead of pulling it as was recommended.&nbsp; I tried the "Send Only" option after the migration and that did not work.&nbsp; Therefore, I tried setting the connected account up as pop3 and SMTP and received the errors.&nbsp; The same settings
 continued to work with other email programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I received a note saying I needed to reconnect to this OUTLOOK.COM account from the desktop version of Outlook.&nbsp; I had done this already, and it happened again when I moved from Office 2013 to 2016, but I did it again anyway.&nbsp; I don't know if
 this means there is more migrating going on or not, but I don't look forward to doing all this again without some knowledge of what changed with the migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p />

            <p>Steve, we would like to recommend that you follow the steps below and check if it will help you connect your account in Outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your email domain and change the configuration as IMAP</li><li>Try to clear all the cache and cookies of your browser</li><li>Try to use a different browser to check if the issue would still persist.</li><li>Try to connect your account again as is.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try to connect a different account first and try to add the VISI.com domain as a connected account instead in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address your other concern with the option to set your account as <strong>Send only</strong>, we would like to inform you that this is no longer available. We would suggest that you use the feedback in Outlook.com by clicking the question mark icon (<strong>?</strong>)
 on the top right. You can add your suggestions regarding the <strong>Send only</strong> option in Outlook.com.</p>

            <p>Jarius,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of your suggestions and learned a little in the process.&nbsp; Using IMAP instead of POP3 did not make any difference.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I don't see how the browser could affect communication between the OUTLOOK.COM server and the VISI.COM servers, I did try using Chrome without any different results.&nbsp; I also cleared cookies and tried all options I tried before without success.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I learned, though.&nbsp; When I happened to try sending email with the VISI.COM address but using the OUTLOOK.COM server option, the problem disappeared and the account was connected.&nbsp; This is not really a good alternative, though, since the inconsistency
 between the from address and the headers can increase the chance of a message being filtered out as junk from what I have read.&nbsp; It does seem to indicate that the problem is with the SMTP connection and not with the IMAP or POP3 connections.&nbsp; It should have
 been possible for OUTLOOK.COM to have displayed something indicating this message was related to the SMTP connection, allowing concentration on the real source of the problem.&nbsp; Again, though, this isn't really a solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To repeat, the settings I have used on other email programs, including with OUTLOOK 2016, have continued to work as expected, including SMTP settings for VISI.com, and I have not changed these in some time.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I do not understand your suggestion that "You can also try to connect a different account first and try to add the VISI.com domain as a connected account instead&nbsp; in Outlook.com."&nbsp; Since I am logged into the OUTLOOK.COM website, I am logged into an OUTLOOK.COM
 account and do not believe there is a way to connect another account without involving an OUTLOOK.COM account.&nbsp; If after all I am writing here, please help me understand this if you think this still seems to be worth pursuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a little of my own frustration is showing here, and I do not mean to take it out on you.&nbsp; However, when reading in other forums, I see that similar problems to mine have been regularly reported with the new OUTLOOK.COM migration and there is now another
 person here experiencing something like this.&nbsp; Further, it came up in the OUTLOOK.COM preview phase as well, and when following through the threads, Microsoft generally asked to be contacted privately and the threads died without explanation.&nbsp; I only read
 those preview messages and was not part of the preview program.&nbsp; It seems likely that someone in the OUTLOOK.COM sphere knows why something that worked but has stopped working with at least some SMTP servers since the migration has occurred.&nbsp; I don't want
 to spend time trying to make something work that is known not to work.&nbsp; I have appeared to have done just that with my experimenting with POP3 and IMAP, although I assume your best intentions in having me try that.&nbsp; Surely the error code in the subject of
 this conversation has a specific meaning to people that understand these types of protocols that might allow me to ask the right questions of my email provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the "Send Only" option remains available, but I learned only by digging that this option no longer works.&nbsp; I can work around this option not being available, but what is upsetting is that it remains an option and that Microsoft has not generally
 indicated that it does not work.&nbsp; The option should be removed or a warning that it is temporarily unavailable should be right on the web page.&nbsp; I do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to look into this and have confirmed this is the case, though.&nbsp;
 Further, the fact that you have taken time to tried to address my concerns is very much appreciated.&nbsp; Would you do what you can to get clarification from the appropriate places in Microsoft as to what might be happening?</p>

            <p>Having the same issue.</p>
<p>The real problem is a bug at Connected accounts, where it is not possible to change the SMTP port to something different than the default 587.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connected accounts -&gt; Other email accounts -&gt; Manually configure -&gt; IMAP/SMTP or POP/SMTP and try to use a different SMTP port (e.g. 465 which is very common).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to change the port when choosing only 'SMTP send only connection settings'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this. I cannot use Office 365 because of this bug.</p>

            <p>Tom and all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that your observation about Port 587 is correct.&nbsp; I tried 465 but OUTLOOK.COM seems to change it back to 587.&nbsp; In addition, when connecting to my email provider directly from the Outlook software on my computer, I can connect with 465 but not with
 587, even though my provider does indicate that 587 should work.&nbsp; There must be something different about the protocol assigned to that port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was my understanding that the Send Only option does not work after the new Outlook.COM version, and I did not see a place to assign the port.&nbsp; I could live with the Send Only option.&nbsp; Tom, would you confirm that it still works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the option of sending from the Outlook server with my providers email address but got a message that I did not have permission to send with that address.&nbsp; Since I have also read that some services might well block such a message even if I did
 send it that way, I am not going to use that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked privately by Microsoft for more information so that this issue could be escalated and I did that.&nbsp; However, I have not heard anything further, and I frankly don't have more time to spend on this.&nbsp; Unless the send only option now works, which
 I'll check out, I am going to abandon this approach that had worked for over two years.&nbsp; Email is too important to have such an approach work for two years or more and then stop working with no solution in sight.&nbsp; Even if I get it working now, there is clearly
 no real priority being given to this inasmuch as I saw this same problem on Outlook preview forms.&nbsp; If Tom is right about not being able to change Port 587, that is a pretty simple matter to correct or to explain to us why it is more complicated than that
 if it indeed is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, while I am frustrated and believe that somebody within the OUTLOOK.COM team likely is aware of this problem, I thank Darius for attempting to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve Jacobson</p>

<p>Yes I did check the touch settings and they are on</p>
<p>So what I am wondering is what is causing this?</p>
<p>Is it something that Nokia and AT&amp;T is doing to get ready for the 8.1 and Cyan update?</p>

<p>You may try to press and hold the power and volume down buttons for about 10-15 seconds until the phone vibrates. Release the buttons and the phone will restart properly. Once done, you may have to reset the time by going to Settings &gt; date+time. If the
 “Set automatically” option is on, turn it off and set the correct time, date and your current time zone. Tap on back to save the changes. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>You have already tried the Soft Reset (that doesn't wipe out any data) without success .. so the next step is either do a Hard Reset (settings--&gt;about--&gt;reset your phone) or the Nokia Software Recovery Tool. Both will erase all data. The difference being
 with the earlier, the system will reset while with the later, the complete software will be re-installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>.. so you may try the Hard Reset first .. but no way to do that without erasing all data. Anyway, the contacts and other back-up that you have with your live account will get back onto the phone once you resetup with the same id. Any media files need to
 be backed up on the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, if the issue is not that of a big concern.. leave it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though its of personal likes / dislikes, many users had actually requested for the option to turn it OFF ..</p>

<p>So what you are saying is if I use the Nokia Software Recovery Tool what ever I have backed up on my live id will be restored after reset but hear is the other thing I have already tried the process of doing a hard reset by going to the phone settings and
 restore phone now if I do the Nokia Software Recovery Tool will that reset my phone to factory defalt settings and will that mean i will have to re update my phone to get it back to GDR3 and Black update or will those still be intact?</p>

            Hi Dennis &amp;&nbsp;captain carib,

<div>Outlook for Mac only allows for a cached mode. This means that Outlook keeps a local copy of everything inside Outlook, no matter what type of account you have configured.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, it's not possible to prevent Outlook from creating local copies of these files. If this is a feature you'd like to see in future versions of Office for Mac, be sure to send your feedback by clicking

 says that the protocol handler should be here C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\VFS\ProgramFilesX64\Microsoft Office\Office16\Interceptor.dll, but there is no such file in my system.&nbsp; Apparently it was not installed. The folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft
 Office\root\VFS\ProgramFilesX64\Microsoft Office is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question is how to install this Interceptor.dll to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found this file in this location "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\Interceptor.dll". Changed the (Default) value of the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{F8E61EDD-EA25-484e-AC8A-7447F2AAE2A9}\InProcServer32 key from&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\VFS\ProgramFilesX64\Microsoft
 Office\Office16\Interceptor.dll to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\Interceptor.dll. The error is no longer appearing in the Event Viewer.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Techzone Solutions Inc.<br />
A California based support org. with no real information about them available.<br />
<br />
Techzone IT Solutions <br />
Its an off-shore technical development and support org. <br />
<br />
However I do not know if either is legitimate. As Shenan said if they called you it is more than likely a scam.<br />

Its a total scam. Uninstall their software and then run a System Restore back<br />
to before you installed it. Change all your sensitive passwords on all sites - <br />
email, bank, credit cards and others. (Do not do this on the compromised <br />
computer and it would be best to do on the phone or in-person.)<br />
<br />
You may even want to revert your system back to factory fresh to be sure <br />
their software is&nbsp;not breaching your security. (Means to re-install Windows <br />
Clean - removing everything on&nbsp;the drive so backup any data before hand.)<br />

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any <br />
errors existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your <br />
money or worse to steal your identity.</p>

<p><strong>Do these thoroughly :<br />
</strong></p>
<p><br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will <br />
allow you to do a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load <br />
of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the <br />
malware and maybe harder to detect as the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added <br />
that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to <br />
detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to <br />
pay the high price later. Check with these to an&nbsp;extreme overkill point and <br />
then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however <br />
you should also run&nbsp;them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on <br />
it - RUN AS ADMIN it will show any infections in the report after running - if <br />
it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether<br />
it finds anything or not does not mean you should not check with the other <br />
methods below.<br />

            Hi StylianosAxiotakis 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Use this link to reactivate Skype credit - <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit...</a>
<br />
<br />One of the major causes why people don't see reactivate Skype credit is not to use right login ID and password. You should use your Skype ID and password rather than mail ID as mail ID may have more more than one Skype IDs attached.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Thanks, it seems for some reason my it appears as if I gave no credit at all, even though I had 9 euro. So I guess Skype has taken my 9 euro. Just because they can.

One of the major causes why people don't see reactivate Skype credit is not to use right login ID and password. You should use your Skype ID and password rather than mail ID as mail ID may have more more than one Skype IDs attached.

<p>The link did indeed work--thank you! However, why is the link not available in the email sent to me notifying me that my credit has just been inactivated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Skype's "HELP" protocol so literally BAD? Essentially, they provide a "do-loop" os options and selctions that send the uninitiated in circles indefinately?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really frustrating. I am grateful you can provide a link, I truly am. However, Skype is a big company. What could it possibly take to update their website to include the actual solution to problems instead of the insanely incompetent protocol that now exists?</p>

                    Several times a week, when opening IE, I get the above message box. How do I get rid of it? The only way I've found is to restart the computer. The computer does open the IE webpage even though it says it won't.

            <p>Hi Flipwilly2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior ro the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>I would suggest you to run Internet Explorer in No add-ons mode and test the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Use the Internet Explorer (No Add-ons) mode</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Point to <b>All Programs</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Point to <b>Accessories</b>.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Point to <b>
System Tools.</b></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Click <b>Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this resolves the issue, follow these steps to isolate the browser add-on that is causing the issue:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click
<b>Internet Options. </b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Programs</b> tab, and then click
<b>Manage add-ons</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click an add-on in the <b>
Name</b> list, and then click <b>Disable</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Repeat step 3 until you identify the add-on that is causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>I would also suggest you to refer the link and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Navigation is canceled when you browse to Web pages that are in different Internet Explorer security zones</b></p>

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me along with a couple of my office mates have been experiencing this problem with Outlook. I use an Outlook 2010 on a Windows 7 system and the other guys use Outlook 2003 on Windows Vista. What I typically experience is when I start to write an
 new mail or reply to the mails, Outlook crashes and restarts again. I also face this when I have already typed the mail and am about to send. I tried reinstalling it but it didnt help. I "heard" that it is a problem because we use Yahoo small business mail
 id with our Outlook. It it true? Please help me resolve this issue. Its been so frustrating that I cant write one email without the outlook getting crashed.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thanks in Advance.</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Outlook Suddenly Not Sending My Emails</h2>
                    <p>Today, March 4th, I realized that my "sent" emails in Outlook have not been received by recipients. &nbsp;It appears they always appear to be sent, but no one has received them. &nbsp;My internet provider, Cox, troubleshooted their end for me, and it is not on their
 side. &nbsp;I've tried everything I know to do and have had to resort to my Gmail account to apologize to those who thought I was AWOL because they haven't received replies, my group lists did not receive reminders of meetings, etc. &nbsp;Can someone please help me?</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Search filter works but fields are blank</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am using Outlook 2016 on Windows 10. The first time it was installed, when I would search through my emails, the email list would appear but the from column is blanked for some emails (not all). When I click on the email, it's easy to see that the
 from field does actually have a value. Tried rebuilding index multiple times and nothing would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to reinstall Windows for some other reason and then we reinstalled Outlook and everything was fine with the search until two days ago. This problem is now back again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a business email account and everything is in the cloud. Exchange server at Microsoft. Using Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>See example screenshot from my inbox (of course I blurred the text):</p>
