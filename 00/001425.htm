<h2>            Office 365 with Exchange &#61; Perfect PST Sync Solution &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have read several post on issues related to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was posted almost 18 months ago<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2003-outlook/looking-for-the-perfect-clientcloud-email-solution/3fb3e3ac-7771-4fb3-aed5-6ddc5b53c21e
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this myself a few days ago <br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/sync-single-pst-file-from-outlook-2013-across/62137616-e487-47f6-9928-9db70f932bc0?rtAction=1395754754361</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue to be surprised at how awkward the solutions are, but I think I might have arrived at the appropriate solution and I want to be sure so that is why I have started this seperate post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like if I pay for Office 365 Small Business package that includes Exchange, I can have all my email accounts sync on all my devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use IMAP on all my accounts to a local PST file or files.</p>
<p>2. Then, use Office 365 Exchange services to sync local PST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is truly a sync solution and I am paying for one user license.</p>
<p>1. Can I use multiple PSTs on the Exchange Server or do I need to use just one ?</p>
<p>2. If I was to say for example, sync my yahoo calendar with my Desktop Outlook connected to Exchange would this work as well ?</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, that is not how it works. Exchange server would host your email address (assuming you own the domain, otherwise it's more complicated) and you'd set all of your devices and other outlooks to connect to the Exchange mailbox. The mail, calendar,
 and contacts would be stored in Outlook in an offline folder (*.ost) and changes sync back and forth to all devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other addresses, you can keep the accounts in outlook like you have now or&nbsp;they could be connected to the Exchange account - Exchange, not outlook, checks them for new mail. (My preference is to have Outlook check for mail, especially if the
 accounts support IMAP - if you send new messages from the address, it's easier IMHO.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>1. Can I use multiple PSTs on the Exchange Server or do I need to use just one ?</p>
<p>2. If I was to say for example, sync my yahoo calendar with my Desktop Outlook connected to Exchange would this work as well ?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have as many pst files or email accounts as you need in Outlook, along with the Exchange account. It won't change how outlook works - it just adds another account to the profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can subscribe to the yahoo calendar but it won't sync back to exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Mostly the ability to sync calendar &amp; contacts to other outlooks and smartphones. There are a lot of little things that make it better, but I'm not sure its worth trying to make it work with imap accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>RE: ost / pst: you'll have the ost on your computer. If you want anything archived long term you'll need to export to a pst.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are you syncing the yahoo calendar? Outlook doesn't have a native way to sync it - if you use a utility that drops it in the mailbox, then it will sync up. But if you subscribe to an icalendar, it won't sync.

            <p>OK So I do remember that using IMAP alone will not sync Calendars and Contact, thats one vote for using Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe sync&nbsp; is the wrong word for Yahoo calendar, and what meant was shared calendar. I know I can share and that feels like sync to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So OST would be my new PST, and PST archive is still my PST archive ? Is that kind of what its like ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I started using Exchange. Why would I continue to use IMAP to Outlook Desktop, rather than configure Exchange to connect to my different online accounts ? Is that just not possible, or is there a downside ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I am using Microsoft Outlook client on windows pc. I also have access to the Outlook Web App. I only have one accoutn which is my personal account. I have a shared mailbox given by my IT team, with a specific email address. I can send
 emails to multiple clients through outlook client but, each of them see the other sender's name also in the email.</p>
<p>I would like to personalize it for each client so they only see 1 common sender(my generic email address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Win Phone 10&#58; Late August 2016 update, Messaging and Maps lost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reed scarce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win Phone 10&#58; Late August 2016 update, Messaging and Maps lost voice input option, microphone choice next to clip board missing</h2>
                    <p>During the week of August 26, 2016 a pushed update on a Windows 10 Phone (upgraded and stable July 10, 2016) caused microphone use to be unavailable in the Messaging and Maps apps.&nbsp; In Messaging two components are known to be affected: the choice to use
 microphone input is lost because the microphone icon is missing from beside the clipboard icon, and the choice of a "voice attachment" is now missing from the menu accessed by the paperclip attachment icon.&nbsp; In Maps the microphone input choice icon simply
 no longer exists.&nbsp; Keyboard input is still available.&nbsp; To help pin down the exact Windows Update that triggered the loss: the loss of function coincided with a complete makeover or re-paint of emoji.&nbsp; That statement is to help define the date of the Update
 generation and push installation and it is not meant to indicate new emoji art has affected microphone use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a workaround, a preference, a tool, to address this loss of function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't find anything for Lock but I fixed the microphone issue.</p>
<p><strong>Settings --&gt; Privacy --&gt;Speech inking and typing --&gt; [toggle Get to know me button]</strong></p>
<p>Prior to that I turned off Messaging's privilege to the mic and I turned it on before I tested it.&nbsp; I doubt that's necessary for the fix.&nbsp; The mic icon appeared in Messaging and Maps after the steps.&nbsp; A privacy issue, an interesting place
 for them to be concerned about privacy.&nbsp; At least it wasn't AT&amp;T fudging with the terms of service.&nbsp; FWIW FitBit seems to have a separate privilege channel, raised and fine-grained location access, perhaps that affected why its mic never went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: A new choice: Under your keyboard steps above, the gray/white selects changed: now white: dictation, still white: ...emoticon, still gray: language switching key.&nbsp; Obviously dictation is now toggled on, ...emoticon remained on.&nbsp; And there is a new (I
 think) check box&nbsp; Under 'Text suggestion improvements header: "Send Microsoft info about how I write to help improve typing and writing in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I come across something about the Lock issue I'll update the thread, maybe start a new one and link to it here, KWIM.&nbsp; --R</p>

    <title>How to stop Word 2010 document spreading across two monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelhoward_637  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Word 2010 document spreading across two monitors</h2>
                    I started using a second monitor two months ago so that I can go back and forth quickly between two or more Word 2010 documents. The only hiccup has been a frequent tendency for a file to suddenly and spontaneously spread across both monitors, forcing
 me to drag the right side back so that it is contained within one monitor. The same file will subsequently re-spread at some point (sometimes when I open a new document), forcing me to again drag back.&nbsp; Is there any way to stop this happening?

            No, I am using an ordinary mouse on my desktop computer (2 years old), Windows 7. The main monitor is a Samsung (purchased 2 months ago) and the smaller second monitor is LG (purchased about three&nbsp; years ago). My IT help desk suggested I check if I need
 updated drivers for the monitors and also a VGA driver but I have not looked into that as yet.<br />

<p>It sounds to me at first glance that it may well need to uncheck Advanced Network Functionality.&nbsp; Take a look at this piece that Chris DeHerrera did on Pocket PC FAQ:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/usb-advanced-functionality.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/usb-advanced-functionality.htm</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not familiar with your deviec so I cannot tell you exactly where to find it.&nbsp; Usually it would be found by going to START/SETTINGS/CONNECTIONS/USB to PC (on a touch screen device).&nbsp; You will have to search on your device to find it (if it is there).</p>

<p>NicciP,</p>
<p>Are you synching wirelessly?&nbsp; If so try connecting via USB cable and see if that helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've plugged in keep an eye on the screen to see what happnes next, you may see info that will help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've been using ActiveSync 4.5 on my XP SP3 computer to sync to various WM5.0 devices for a long, long time with no problems at all.&nbsp; I don't know of any compatibility issue with AS 4.5/XP/SP3 &amp; WM5.0 (or any other version of windows mobile for that matter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've already performed a hard reset of your device, reinstalled ActiveSync, and turned off Advanced Network Functionality, but have you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to sync after disabling your computer's firewall &amp; antivirus software to see if you get a better result?&nbsp;</li><li>Tried to sync via Bluetooth connection?&nbsp; </li><li>Tried using a different USB cable? </li><li>Does the computer make any kind of tone at all when you plug the device up to your computer?</li></ul>

            You can try Classic Skype. Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.
<br />
<br />You can download Classic Skype and use that.

            I would suggest you look into the menu system of the fone to see if there is one of the menus that need adjusting or you could try a factory reset.<br />
<br />
If this fails it cant hurt to talk to your network or the shop you purchased it from.<br />
<br />
or drop it into a Nokia Repair centre fr them to check it out.

<p>Hello Ellison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when "<strong>Pin to Start</strong>" is greyed out, it's because that app or file is already pinned to the Start screen. Let's work this out by providing the information below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the OS build currently installed in your Lumia 950? To check, go to <strong>

            Build is 10.0.14393.1066. The issue started when trying to open&nbsp;photos from tile. My finger lingered for too long and the tile opened the option to unpin or resize. I tapped the tile again to close out those options, but thought I must have hit unpin because
 tile disappeared. When I&nbsp;tried to repin from all program file that's when I discovered greyed out pin to start button. I did try restarting then a soft reset but neither worked. Then I thought about deleting&nbsp;and adding photos but that can't be done from the
 all programs list.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>We suggest that you double check all the tiles pinned to the Start screen to make sure that it's not misplaced in other folders. If the issue persists, you may need to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset your phone</a></strong> to get this resolved. Reset process will return your phone to the same state it was turned on and
 will remove everything in it. Make sure to check or create a backup before proceeding to avoid data loss.</p>

<p>Hi Harold,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use the <strong>Get-Mailbox</strong> cmdlet in on-premises Exchange environments to view the quota settings for a mailbox, you first need to check the value of the
<strong>UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults </strong>property. The value <strong>True</strong> means per-mailbox quota settings are ignored, and you need to use the
<strong>Gat-MailboxDatabase</strong> cmdlet to see the actual values. If the value is
<strong>False</strong>, the per-mailbox quota settings are used, so what you see with the
<strong>Get-Mailbox</strong> cmdlet are the actual quota values for the mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation you mentioned above, you the users are using Office 365 E3 or E5 subscription, they size of the mailbox should be 100 GB. Please use the cmdlet in that article Monique provided to set the right quota for those users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a specific environment in your organization such as Exchange hybrid, please feel free to post back with detailed information of your environment. We will help you fix the issue further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gay&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Ads and Pop-Ups in Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riamau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ads and Pop-Ups in Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    Hello. I've been using Windows 10 since the free upgrade and I really love it. I also really love Microsoft Edge. It's a great improvement over Internet Explorer. The only thing that concerns me is that there seems to be no way to remove these ads I'm
 getting. I'm 99% sure they're from some sort of virus I contracted onto my computer last week. I had my brother over here to clean it off my main computer and uninstall any unwanted programs, etc. However, there are still a bunch of ads on my browser. Every
 time I try to click something I have to try 5 or 6 times until it lets me click it without just opening another tab or window with ads. A thing in the corner shows up saying "ads by lasuperba" if that helps, along with a bunch of floating ads around the screen.&nbsp;
 I would really like some help figuring out how to get this stuff off my browser. I would hate to go back to using another browser. Thank you.

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Open Edge (internet) indirectly, that is from say an email link as an example. Then at the top tabs, the first one is the offending one, DO NOT OPEN IT, just delete it by clicking on the X at the right of that tab, while you have&nbsp;the
 screen&nbsp;of the site you were able to access indirectly on.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Now go to the EDGE settings, top right corner of&nbsp;screen,&nbsp;click on the three ... which stand for "more" there on the sub-menus click on Settings and clear the browser data.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Close Edge and re-open; the offending site should be gone. It worked for me.</p>

                    <p>Is there any update to the problem with the Band app logging out when trying to use the myroundpro Golf? &nbsp;i understand from previous posts this is a compatibility issue with iOS 10.3.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This prevents using the Band for golf which was the sole reason I got it so I am hoping there is an update coming.....</p>

<h2>            Help&#58; Your digital id name cannot be found by the underlying security system.</h2>
                    
<p>I have Outlook 2007 on Vista 32 bit Business. Recently I have this problem where if somebody sends me an encrypted e-mail I cannot decrypt and open it. When I try to open it I get the error message "your digital id name cannot be found by the underlying
 security system". This happens with 2 different e-mail addresses which have their own separate digital certificates. I cannot read incoming encrypted e-mail on either of them. One digital certificate is a few weeks old and the other is 11 months old. Both
 have worked OK in the past. It seems to be an Outlook problem. It's like Outlook cannot find the private key installed. When I set up my e-mail account and digital cert on Thunderbird, everything works OK.</p>
<p>I've tried to remove and reinstall the digital certificates on Outlook but I'm not sure if I did it right. I went into Internet Explorer and under Options/Content/Certificates and removed the digital cert. I couldn't find a direct way to remove it from Outlook.
 Then I reinstalled the digital cert from backup. It's didn't work, the problem still exists.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; I tried the following and all failed to the fix the problem:</p>
<p>- Uninstall the recent&nbsp; Office/Windows updates from Dec 16, 2010</p>
<p>- Remove and reinstall the digital certificate. There seems to be nothing wrong with the digital cert because it works in other applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been experimenting with other e-mail clients (Thunderbird) using digital certificates and many e-mail accounts.</p>
<p>- I have concluded that based on my experiments that the problem occurs when 2 conditions are met: 1) a @yahoo.com sender tries to send an S/MIME encrypted e-mail, and; 2) the recipient is using Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>- There is a problem with the interaction between @yahoo.com encrypted e-mail and Outlook 2007 which causes Outlook not to recognize recognize the valid digital key pair and decrypt the message.</p>
<p>- It doesn't seem to matter what the recipient's e-mail domain is. If the sender is an @yahoo.com address and Outlook is the recipient's client, it fails to decrypt the message. However if Thunderbird is the e-mail client, it works OK.</p>
<p>- It only seems to happen to @yahoo.com senders. Hotmail, Gmail and other e-mail senders work fine in Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Unable to send emails on hotmail account from iPhone</h2>
                    I am able to receive all the emails from my hotmail account but I can't send any via my iPhone 5s. I am able to send them &nbsp;on my iPad and my computer. When I try and reply to an email or send a new one, I get the following error message. &nbsp;Cannot send mail.
 &nbsp; The user name or password for " *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is incorrect. My outgoing mail server is smtp.live.com and I have re entered the password a hundred times. &nbsp;I have deleted the account and re entered it. I get the same results as I am unable to send any emails.
 I can't remember the last time it worked - months ago. Any suggestions as I want to use this mail account. I am using the apple mail app as I want all of emails in 1 place. Thanks for your time

<p><span><span>To assist you better, please provide few details.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you, tried logging in to your account using web browser and check if you are able to send the email. If
 everything seems ok through browser, then it might be an issue with the Mail app. Try uninstall the Mail app and install it again on your iPad.

<h2>            SharePoint not syncing - STILL AN ISSUE</h2>
                    
<p>I use Office 365 Enterprise E3, running Windows 10 Pro 64Bit</p>
<p>Seems I have the same issue as countless others. Really hoping this can be resolved.</p>
<p>I am trying to use the SharePoint sync, to sync a copy of the data on my sharepoint site to my onedrive and visa-versa. OneDrive starts the sync and then fails and tells me I need to enter my credentials. I've removed re-installed office no change, tried
 as&nbsp;a different user no change, deleted cache files&nbsp;no change. I don't even get a prompt to enter my credentials when I view the OneDrive sync problems. When I click on the item, it takes me to the sharepoint site.</p>
<p>The last suggestion to this in that there was a known issue with SharePoint showing in the Office 365 ( which there was ), but, now its showing as healthy and its still not syncing and says "Credentials Needed - Please Enter Your Credentials" but I have
 no way of entering my credentials. I've removed the sync'd folder on my desktop and re-established the sync, and its still failing.</p>

<p>For the love of everything living, can someone please help and actually get a resolution to this problem??</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I want to optimize the duration of project's tasks according to minimize total cost, for this aim I need to run genetic algorithm to change duration of each task randomly, if i can write this algorithm with visual basic in microsoft project, MSP will level
 resources based on new duration of each task and by new total duration of project, I can calculate the new cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are vba genetic codes available for optimization in excel, is it possible to write the same code in VB of MSP ?<br />
</p>
<p>if it is not,&nbsp; what about exporting data from MSP and importing them to excel for running the algorithm and then at the same time importing that data to MSP again ?</p>
<p>

<p>Sounds like an interesting academic exercise.&nbsp; I recall having read a couple papers about genetic algorithms for schedule optimization, though I've not seen any attempts to mix a genetic optimizer with Project's heuristic leveler.&nbsp; It's not obvious to me
 that the two approaches would play nicely together....</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, you can probably do all the heavy lifting (including the schedule mutations and re-calculations) using Project vba alone.&nbsp; Excel would be useful for handling input and output tables and graphics for multiple scenarios, but you'd want to minimize
 the back-and-forth data exchanges between Project and Excel.&nbsp; I'd advise getting Rod Gill's book on Project VBA if you haven't done that already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, tom&nbsp;</p>

<p>MaziyarKhadivi,</p>
<p>Okay, so you have an academic exercise. Have fun doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project has several number, cost and text fields that you can use to store your own data but unlike Excel, using that data in customized reports or graphs is very limited. When I need custom reports I export Project data to Excel using VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as generating random numbers, VBA has a Rnd function that will generate random numbers. You can read about it in the VBA help file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2>            Onedrive Error - &#34;An error has occured while attempting to synchronize this document library. Please get in touch with your helpdesk&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>We use Sharepoint 2013 and use Onedrive to sync the documents to our machines. &nbsp;Yesterday morning when turning on my machine a number of files across 5-6 libraries were syncing with no changes having&nbsp;been made to any of the files recently (in some cases
 they were very old files).&nbsp; The sync has not completed and&nbsp;6 out of 8 libraries are showing as unsynced with the following error:&nbsp; &nbsp;"An error has occured while attempting to synchronize this document library. Please get in touch with your helpdesk".&nbsp; In all
 but one case all the files within seemed to be synced fine.</p>
<p>I have used the easy fix&nbsp;tool (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738</a>) which has not resolved the problem and only found a very small number of files with
 minor&nbsp;issues which were deleted.</p>
<p>Is this an issue that others have seen recently?</p>
<p>I should add&nbsp;Onedrive for Business was installed as part of Office 2013 and the currently installed version number is 15.0.473.100 and&nbsp;I have checked sharepoint file and folder limits and these seem to be within tolerances.</p>
<p>Any input, suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>hi gurprit,</p>
<p>about the issue, can you try the following steps to see if there is any improvement?</p>
<p>1. update the onedrive for business client to the latest version. if it is installed together with other office applications, please open any office application<strong> &gt; file &gt; account &gt; product information &gt; update option &gt; update now</strong>. if it is
 a standalone version, please download from the link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984</a>.<br />
2. stop syncing your current onedrive for business libraries via right clicking on the onedrive for business icon and selecting
<strong>stop syncing a folder</strong>.<br />

&nbsp; <br />
3. exit the onedrive for business sync client. <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7f0f12d-c992-4420-874f-a6085beaaef4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7f0f12d-c992-4420-874f-a6085beaaef4" /></a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
4. use the<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> “fix it” tool
</a>to clear the cache, then delete or rename the current local folder where you synced the library.
<br />
5. go to the library in the browser and re-sync it.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, can you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. did you run into the error message as below? <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10f2188a-c326-48f1-ae5c-a768bc2e0ef2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10f2188a-c326-48f1-ae5c-a768bc2e0ef2" /></a><br />
2. does the issue occur to other people when syncing the same libraries?</p>
