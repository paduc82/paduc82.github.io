            You cannot delete the local Tasks list but you can hide it.

<p>I had some issues with wifi connections. After a while and some research on Windows Mobile 6,&nbsp;I was able to connect successfully. However, I can't seem to browse the web through the IE..Though I can see my wifi is
 on and signal is good..Tried everything that HP and Windows mobile site recommended, but to no avail..I will be very relieved if someone can direct me on how I can succesfully browse the web using my phone's wifi..&nbsp;&nbsp; Hp Ipaq 510....</p>

I might have a solution available for you but it is not perfect: just remove all GPRS connection settings you have got from your provider (or make a hard reset and DO NOT install any settings for GPRS). As soon they contain some proxy information IE gets crazy
 and cannot use wifi anymore. It is a nightmare indeed!

            ok i might have a solution, i faced the same exact problem and this is what i did. by the way i'm translating from my french WM6 to english to my words might not be exactly the same as in your phone but i'm sure you'll get through. first press start, go
 to settings. then go to connections. then go to either modify my proxy server, or set proxy server. once u r in ther should be 2 options with check boxes next to them. uncheck the 2nd box where it says: this connection connects me to internet via a proxy server.<br />
hope i translated right. this worked for me hope it works for you. goodluck<br />

</p><p>Since this morning I have been unable to send or receive any e-mails from my hotmail.com account. I am sending emails to myself to check regularly but the messages are sent to drafts with a message "something went wrong and we haven't been able to send your

    <title>Annoying behaviour with multiple monitors with different scaling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrwinniethepooh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Annoying behaviour with multiple monitors with different scaling &#40;using Windows 10 build 10074&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am using dual monitors (1920x1200 with scaling set to 100%, and 3840x2160 set to 200%).&nbsp; The monitors&nbsp;have the same physical height.&nbsp;I don't think that one can expect a totally perfect user experience with such disparate monitors, but Windows 10 actually
 does pretty well (provided that you&nbsp;do not&nbsp;attempt to have windows crossing the monitor boundary).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the one behaviour that I have found really annoying is the movement of the mouse across the monitor boundary, with an empty desktop. What is clear is that Windows maintains the pixel offset of the mouse pointer when crossing the monitor boundary.
 This means that moving the mouse laterally&nbsp;from the bottom of the 1920x1200 monitor takes you to half way up the 3840x2160 monitor. In the other direction, moving laterally from the bottom of the 3820x2160&nbsp;monitor to the 1920x1200 monitor you run into a 'brick
 wall', which extends half way up the screen. To move the mouse from the 3820x2160 monitor&nbsp;you have to 'climb over' this brick wall. I find this really annoying - what would be nice on an empty desktop is to be able to move the mouse smoothly between monitors
 - without any jumps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that this would imply suddenly changing the mouse pixel co-ordinates at the monitor boundary but (at least on an empty desktop) it would provide a more satisfactory user experience. I also realise that there is a dependence on the physical size
 of the monitor - if my 4k monitor&nbsp;was twice as high, physically, as my HD monitor then the current behaviour would be fine. I am only experiencing the problem because the monitors are, in fact, of the same physical height.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that this is all rather a big technological challenge, and that the Windows 10 developers have already considered these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Later update) Having said that Windows 10 handles the dual monitors (1920x1200 and 3840x2160) quite well, I have found that, following a reboot, the UI elements have now become a bewildering mixture of 'large' and 'small' on both monitors.&nbsp; Everything was
 fine before the reboot, but somehow the reboot caused problems for the scaling algorithms - and these problems persisted even after a second reboot.&nbsp; The only way I found of getting back to sensibly sized UI elements was to replace the 4k monitor by a 1920x1200
 monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly the support of mixed DPI monitors is still a work in progress.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925</h2>
                    <p>I am an Indian and user of Nokia Lumia 925. i bought the expensive handset and the device is not working at all now. Neither the device fell on the ground nor any other incident happen. Despite repeated efforts, the device is not starting. Nokia service
 centres in Hyderabad, India mentioned that the motherboard of the handset is not working and needs a replacement. Sadly, they mention that they do not have the motherboard to get it repaired. How can I get the phone repaired. What is the use of service centres
 if they cannot cater to the needs of the people who own nokia phones? Why does the Company sell so expensive phones when it cannot have good quality hardware in it? &nbsp;Any idea how I can get the phone repaired?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Hotmail access problems with MS Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesdee83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail access problems with MS Edge</h2>
                    I have a new HP Laptop with preloaded Windows 10.&nbsp; I cannot access&nbsp;any Hotmail sign-in/logon page to access the account in my usual way (using Google as my search engine) - it goes into search mode but never delivers.&nbsp; I've tried it via various links thrown
 up when searching for Hotmail, or Hotmail sign-in etc.&nbsp; I can get limited access to my Hotmail account via the Win 10 app tile but this doesn't allow me to access my address book or open more complex emails and has only a limited level of historic emails to
 hand.&nbsp; I have perfect access to Hotmail using IE on my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; Is there a simple solution to this or is it an inherent Windows 10 problem?

            <p>Have followed your instructions clearing the history, &nbsp;cache and cookies, but still&nbsp;have problems&nbsp;signing into Hotmail.&nbsp; If I type Hotmail into the search engine I do get the usual series of Hotmail links.&nbsp; If I then click on one of the "Sign in" links nothing
 happens other than the circular searching dots rotating at the top left hand of the screen - I get no error message it's just the little dots doing their circular dance for several minutes then I may get the Microsoft account page and the password box waiting
 ready for filling.&nbsp; On&nbsp;entering the password&nbsp;and hitting "return" I then wait for several more minutes before I actually get into my email account, or eventually get the error message "404 - File or directory not&nbsp;found".&nbsp; When I did get into the account the
 "sign out" process then took minutes again.&nbsp; It's like the pre-broadband bad old days
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've no problem signing into my Sky email account and I've even tried using the Ethernet link rather than the wireless connection but with no better results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss to understand why this is happening.&nbsp; As I've already said there's absolutely no problem accessing Hotmail using my&nbsp;Windows 7 PC which of course has&nbsp;IE rather than Edge.&nbsp; I'm completely new to Windows 10 and have some limited experience of
 Windows 8.1 so have that rather helpless feeling of lack of in-depth knowledge.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice to try using Windows 10 IE - have now tried this without success.&nbsp; Just as when using Edge I still have to wait for several minutes to complete each step to get into my Hotmail account.&nbsp; I get the IE notification&nbsp;"waiting for Live"
 etc for several minutes till eventually I get into either the sign in page or, at the&nbsp;later stage, &nbsp;the emails.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accessing your suggestion from the link in the&nbsp;email (informing me that there is an answer to my query) is pretty much instant if doing it from my Windows 7 PC, &nbsp;but once again takes several minutes if doing it via the laptop which is a brand new HP 255
 G4 - AMD A6-6310 1.80GHz, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD,&nbsp;Windows 10 Home 64 Bit preloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that anything which is an MS site has this built in severe delay, yet everything else I search for or open is delivered quickly and efficiently, including my non-MS email account.&nbsp; It's a crazy situation when the system is MS yet it's blocking its
 own sites.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;just glad that I haven't yet upgraded to Windows 10 on my PC.</p>

            <p>Oh dear - I'm really starting to lose heart now.&nbsp; I followed instructions to add Outlook to compatibility mode. I then Googled Hotmail.&nbsp; I then tried various links for the&nbsp;sign-in page with nothing happening other than it being stuck in "<strong>Waiting
 for.." </strong>mode.&nbsp; I finally decided to use the <strong>MSN.COM</strong> link and time it till it either came up with "unable to connect" statement or took me into the sign-in page.&nbsp; After
<strong>3mins 40sec </strong>it threw up the <strong>Outlook sign-in page </strong>
which stated "<strong>Because you're accessing sensitive info you need to verify your password</strong>".&nbsp; I entered the password and started timing again.&nbsp; After
<strong>4mins 20secs </strong>I gained access to my email account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironically at the top of the inbox listing was the latest email with the&nbsp;title "<strong>Welcome to Windows 10</strong>".&nbsp; If you've seen the Hunger Games film - that welcome&nbsp;feels rather like the "Welcome, welcome"&nbsp;statement that the character Effie Trinket
 gives prior to selecting the pair of individuals who have to fight to the death.&nbsp; It's rapidly sending me into a "mortal combat with Windows 10" mental state.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reiterate - I can blast straight into my Sky email account, my Gmail account and pretty much anything I search for except for MS sites. I'm at a total loss.</p>

 trying to negotiate a return and replacement.

    <title>HTML Emails Don&#39;t Sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archsgro  say:</h3>
<h2>            HTML Emails Don&#39;t Sync</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ArchSgro Here once again. I now have another strange problem that may be related to my other posted and unresolved &nbsp;issue (Items Made By Filling In Outlook Forms Don't Sync). I just noticed that emails that I receive&nbsp;which are in HTML format will not sync.
 I believe it used to convert&nbsp;HTML emails&nbsp;to plain text when it worked. Plain text email&nbsp;will sync no problem though. I think something is going on with the way Activesync converts the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my symptoms are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Items Made by Filling In Forms Don't Sync</p>
<p>2. Emails Received that are in HTML format Don't Sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its almost like ActiveSync can't handle or convert the formats. Am I missing a configuration setting? Help please or I may go "iPhone" on you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Dell Axim x51V with Windows Mobile 5, Windows XP Professional, Outlook 2007, and Activesync 4.5.

<p>It should be synchronizing. Do you have issues synching Contacts and Calendar? Connect your device, open Activesync on the PC and click Tools - Options. Uncheck Email and let AS save your new settings. Check Email
 again. Let us know if this helps.</p>

<p>I unchecked email, let AS save the settings and checked again. Still not working. Yes, I am having problems with Contacts, Calendar, and Task items. I posted&nbsp;that problem&nbsp;before and it is still not resolved. Here is the link to that post.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens there is any item I create in Outlook by opening up a form to fill out, either by clicking "New" or double clicking&nbsp;on a blank area of the window,&nbsp;will not sync. However, if I am in a view in Outlook&nbsp;that lets me just start typing on a blank
 line to create a new item, the item will sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can the two be related? Is there a shared process that Outlook runs through for both&nbsp;Forms and HTML messages? &nbsp;Is there some kind of corrupt form? I don't know what to do. I tried uninstalling Outlook but I don't think it is fully uninstalled
 because when I reloaded it, my settings and email setup came back. I didn't have to configure anything except import back my items. Before I imported back the items though&nbsp;I checked to see if I could sync with the clean install. The problem still existed.</p>

<h2>            Unable to install WIndows 10 Tech Preview and getting an error 0x8024201c</h2>
                    <p>"&lt;Original Title:error 0x8024201c&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to complete the install due to error 0x8024201c. &nbsp;In reading through other posts for this error, disabling third party anti virus was the fix. &nbsp;I have tried this several times with no luck. &nbsp;I believe the install creates log files. &nbsp;Where might
 I find these and under what names so I can continue investigating what is causing the error. &nbsp;My system is a HP XW8600 populated with two separate processors of 4 cores each. &nbsp;Are there any known hardware issues with two processor workstations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Kid&#39;s Corner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siddharth bahuguna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kid&#39;s Corner</h2>
                    <p>Dear Developers</p>
<p>Among many shortcomings in the windows phone (Windows 10 too) I would like to point to Kid's Corner.</p>
<p>The main idea behind having Kid's Corner is that others have access to certain apps on your device and in the mean time you can rest assured that they are not accessing your Private/Sensitive information and apps.</p>
<p>The whole concept is brilliant and makes me comfortable sharing my device.</p>
<p>But the annoying part is the password setup for Kid's Corner.</p>
<p>There are two suggestions which will improve this glitch and I guess that this is the corner of many Window Phone users.</p>
<p>1.) Remove the password for the Kid's Corner</p>
<p>2.) Enable setting a different password for the Kid's Corner</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I give my phone to others, I have to open the password and give. Suppose by chance they close it then again I have to put the password for them. If I tell them the password they can access my main account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I pray you to fix this. It will be a great help and improvement. And many Window Phone users will be pleased with the added functionality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope to hear some good news soon</p>
<p>Siddharth Bahuguna&nbsp;<br />

<p>As for Kid's Corner, it will be removed in the upcoming Anniversary Update and will be replaced by App's corner.</p>

    <title>How to view recent history in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirill shilov  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to view recent history in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my Outlook.com account was recently hacked (well accessed without my permission) in my school because I forgot to logout. My emails got deleted. Luckily, all the computers in my school recieve their own public IP address. A similar thing happened
 when I had Gmail but I found the person that did it thanks to "Recent History" on the bottom of Gmail.com. That gave me recent activity on Gmail with the computers public address, the web browser that was used, and the OS that was used, and I was able to find
 the person that was sitting at that time that computer thrue looking at the history and he got in trouble. Where is recent history on Outlook.com? I need at least the IP address of the computer. Something that looks similar to this:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It's been a while since this topic was started but considering I came across it while searching for exactly this feature, I've discovered it in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the "Settings" app, select "System", select "Tablet mode", and turn tablet mode on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will cause all apps - even "legacy" (non-Ã∂MÃ∂eÃ∂tÃ∂rÃ∂oÃ∂ Modern) ones - to display in full-screen mode. It also brings back the full-screen Start menu (which looks much more polished than the one that shipped with Windows 8, too!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>I've been struggling with this issue for a while but think I've figured it out.</p>
<p>I'm now running Windows 10</p>
<p>If you put a metro app into fullscreen for a windowed state, close and open it again it will open in a windowed state</p>
<p>BUT..... If you put a metro app into fullscreen from a maximised state, close and open it again it will open in fullscreen.</p>
<p>Try that, it it working for an app called Plex for me but not on other apps so there must be something else going on as well</p>

    <title>Get Media Content Now Nokia Lumia 1020 error message - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Get Media Content Now Nokia Lumia 1020 error message</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're phone won't display or send pictures in text messages, I've found the solution.&nbsp; First let me say I am no IT expert, far from it, but I've been playing with this for a while now and I finally figured it out.&nbsp; Ensure that your carrier has MMS set-up
 for you before you proceed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Data HAS to be turned on.&nbsp; MMS only sends over a data network, not over wifi so if you have Data turned off to save on your usage you'll need to turn it on if you want to receive/send text pictures.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp; If you're a "text hoarder", delete all your threads to free up some space.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this really helps but it couldn't hurt.</p>
<p>3.)&nbsp; Search the web for "Configure Nokia Lumia 1020 APN settings for (name of your carrier) in (country)".&nbsp; Keep this page open, you'll be referring to it as you go.</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp; On your phone go to Settings&gt;mobile+SIM&gt;SIM settings</p>
<p>5.)&nbsp; Enter the information you found on the web page you found in step 3 and click save.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it should work.&nbsp; Apparently with the Windows Phones (any make or model)&nbsp;you have to configure these settings manually in order for the MMS to work, especially if your phone is unlocked.&nbsp; Not all carriers will upload this information to your&nbsp;phone automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention, my phone is unlocked and I use Bell in Canada so my search was "Configure Nokia Lumia 1020 for Bell Mobility in Canada".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>HI v.t.c.</p>
<p>Unfortunate up to now the only updates for your device are coming from either your carrier or the manufacturer of the device. With Windows Phone 7coming up this will change a bit. MS will be able to update all users directly. Just like on the desktop right
 now.</p>
<p>So for now please check with your carrier or device manufacturer for updated rom's and fixes</p>

    <title>CONTIONAL SUM WIZARD DISCONTINUED IN OFFICE 2010 AND THE SUMIF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hollyschamp  say:</h3>
<h2>            CONTIONAL SUM WIZARD DISCONTINUED IN OFFICE 2010 AND THE SUMIF FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK</h2>
                    <p>I am totally frustrated.&nbsp; I used the conditional sum wizard for a lot of my projects.&nbsp; I have tried a lot of times to use the sumif formula and it does not work.&nbsp; What I am trying to do is get information to transfer from a bank statement to a bank reconciliation
 sheet.&nbsp; So I put in the whole worksheet for the first section then for criteria I put in cash deposits, then for the column to add I put in the column it is supposed to add and it always comes back with a zero total.&nbsp; Is there any way to get this to work or
 get the conditional sum wizard back without having to go back to excel 97.&nbsp; I am temped to go back to excel 97 because I am totally frustrated having to add everything together to put on my worksheet.&nbsp; I even tried the sumifs function and that didn't work.&nbsp;
 Is there any other functions I can try or am I totally screwed?&nbsp; Someone please help, I work from home and this makes my job a lot harder when I have to add everything up and put it on the worksheet when it was done for me in excel 97.&nbsp; I think it was totally
 stupid that they discontinued the conditional sum wizard, because it was very helpful.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<h2>            Batch Files&#63;</h2>
                    Ok... I would like to know if there is a way to creat batch files or a script to perform multiple commands.<br />
<br />
Examples would be:<br />
<br />
Something to delete specific file(s) (such as the contents of a cache directory or old log files) and then start a program.<br />

            There is probably something you can create to do it ... but that question should probably be asked over in the MSDN forums.&nbsp; SOmeone into developing small programs might be able to stear you in the right direction....

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>if this started recently (say in the last week), try rebooting your computer (which should install any recent updates (for device drivers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also sound controls (looks like a loudspeaker) on the Video (well actually they are Flash controls hosting video content) on youtube videos. Click on them and ensure that the video sound level is set at the appropriate level.... youtube uses cookies
 to save your preferences for viewing videos on their site, so each video you view will use the settings that you set when you previously viewed a video.</p>

    <title>Comment disappears, but is not deleted, when text associated with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamontoast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comment disappears, but is not deleted, when text associated with comment is deleted &#40;Word 2016 Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We are a magazine which uses Word's track changes to go through the editing process with writers. Sometimes stories are thousands of words and an early round of editing can have dozens of comments and changes. We recently realized that some comments that
 we thought had been deleted have not, in fact, been deleted causing confusion and extra work for the writer and/or editor. We think we've figured out the situation. Here are screen caps to illustrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Test file with three test comments. We can see the comments in both the left and right hand sidebars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Same test file with the words "those drunks could" deleted. You can see from the left hand panel that the comment is still there, but it has disappeared from the right hand side. You can also see the subtle little blue line in the middle of the paragraph
 indicating where the comment "sits".</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are my settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58be0d4d-63a1-481d-9243-99c44d93044e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58be0d4d-63a1-481d-9243-99c44d93044e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have messed around with every track changes setting I could find and nothing helps.&nbsp;<strong>Is there some way to make these disappearing comments show up in the right hand sidebar?</strong> It is very frustrating to have these comments persisting from
 revision to revision confusing the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do realize one work around to this is to delete the comment before you delete the text, but there are several reasons this is not going to solve our problem, the primary one being that we have no control over how our many, many writers use Word, so even
 if we "solve" the problem through our behaviour, a writer could still cause comments to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Hi Jamontoast,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that after you delete the comment in the article, the comment still displayed in the Reviewing bar, but there is no comment on the right side of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the problem, we'd like to confirm some information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does this problem happen to all the Macs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If you delete the comment by using
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41bd8137-1aca-4b9a-8ae8-a01584b43662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41bd8137-1aca-4b9a-8ae8-a01584b43662" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Please provide the Word version, you can check it in
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tisky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said:</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that after you delete the comment in the article, the comment still displayed in the Reviewing bar, but there is no comment on the right side of the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, we are not deleting the comment in the article. We are deleting the text associated with a comment. So, if have a paragraph and the word "dog" was commented on, if we delete the word "dog" and replace with "duck", the comment disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Yes, to all Macs. We have no Windows machines to test this on.</p>
<p>2. If you delete a comment, it does disappear.</p>
<p>3. Here is our version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I understand that if you replace the word in the article, the comment will disappear. Based on my test, if you replace the word in the article, the comment will not on the new word, but the comment still exists. To move forward, we‚Äôd like to confirm
 more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How you replace the word in the article? By selecting the word then type in the new word or deleting the word first?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. We found that you are not using the latest version of Word, we suggest you update your Office 2016 for Mac to the latest version and check whether the problem still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gone through the thread again, I noticed that you actually want the comment stay in the article when you replace the word. While it is a normal behavior that when you delete or replace the word, the comment will be deleted. We welcome and encourage you to

</p><p>But the comment IS NOT being DELETED. It is DISAPPEARING. There is a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was being deleted, that would be fine. But what is happening is people using different versions of Word will see the comment that we no longer see and that has caused a lot of confusion.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I may neglect some information in my last reply, I noticed that you have enabled Track Changes when you edit the article. We'd like to explain that the behavior is normal if the Track Changes is enabled when you edit the article.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to be confused by the modifications, you may enable <strong>
Insertions and Deletions</strong> in <strong>Markup Options</strong> beside <strong>
Track Changes</strong>.</p>

            Enabling Insertions and Deletions does not make comments reappear (or not disappear in the first place). All it does is show Insertions and Deletions. It does nothing to solve this problem.

<h2>            Error code C101A1FC when changing familiy settings in zune</h2>
                    Need to change Family settings to allow my child to buy apps to the Windows phone 7. Try to do this via Zune (should really have been possible directly in live, but I can't figure out). When I try to activate the changes in Zune, error code C101A1FC comes
 up. Should I&nbsp;do this somewhere else?
