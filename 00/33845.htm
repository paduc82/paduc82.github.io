<h2>            Windows 10 puts wrong user name - Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Every time I fresh install windows and set it up using my Microsoft account login the last couple of letters of my account name get cut off and I'm stuck with a user account linked with half a name
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already know the "Fix" is to create a local account, delete the Microsoft account and link your email to the local account with the correct name</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to fix the root cause that is to change the name that syncs to all new installs or delete that name and retype the name to create a new sync</p>
<p>
</p><p>plus pretty much all links in other posts explaining how to change this redirect back to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows?os=windows-10 and does not help at all</p>

            Hi Jayden.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I brought this issue to Windows 10 developers awhile back and got a reply that they intended to leave it the way it is.  So when one sets up a MS Account during install and it cannot connect to your online account to read the Display name given there, it will truncate the email address to the first five letters.   
<br />
<br />The way to avoid this is to set up a Local Account first during install and then later convert it to a MS Account:
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to change the account name now see here:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-account-username-in-windows-10-when-signed-in-using-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-account-us...</a>
<br />
<br />This will not change the User folder name which needs these extra steps:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/89060-change-name-user-profile-folder-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/89060-chang...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>App Hang issue with Steam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomastew  say:</h3>
<h2>            App Hang issue with Steam</h2>
                    I keep receiving app hang error with Steam.exe in under 10 minutes everytime I start it. I have had an open ticket with them for 2 months now and they are not even trying to help. I believe they outsource their customer support. I have done all of the
 troubleshooting methods for the Steam client and updated all of my drivers and BIOS etc. Now all that's left that I can think of is to ask you guys to see if anyone can interpret the app hang error message details.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Description:</div>
<div>&nbsp; A problem caused this program to stop interacting with Windows.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched for the hang signature and hang type and found no concrete results on the Internet. This has been very frustrating the past two months I have been unable to play any of the Steam games that require an online connection (basically all games).
 There is no results in the Event Viewer regarding the crashing of steam, I assume because it soft crashes unless I force it to close, in which case I get the app hang error; but nothing very detailed. I do however have frequent "Dhcp-Client", "Kernel-PnP",
 "WLAN-AutoConfig", and "e1cexpress" error/warnings in Event Viewer. Two of which are seemingly related to my Internet connection, but I never lose connection to the Internet. So I am confused by those errors and don't believe they have anything to do with
 Steam failing.&nbsp;</div>

            Thanks for answering so quickly Vikrant.
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I log on as administrator, I only have one Windows account on the PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have (per steam customer support) disabled all security software (I use Kaspersky, used to use AVG but found it was the cause for my computer randomly crashing); and I have performed the clean boot method as well. I have also re-installed Steam several
 times (once using the steam recommended method involving the use of Windows Installer CleanUp Utility<font color="#b0aeac"><span>)</span></font>, even doing repair installations and all of their troubleshooting methods such as deleting the files and forcing
 steam to re-download them. None of these methods have prevented Steam from crashing in under 10 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I came here hoping that someone may be able to interpret the error message and give me a possible reason (with Windows and not the Steam client) as to why it crashes. It is the only program I have issues with other than iTunes; which when I close it, I
 receive two consecutive error messages that the program did not close properly which points to the reason being an nVidia .dll file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>*note: I've been using steam for several years on several PC's. On this particular PC I had no problems with the program until they updated it with their "Big Picture" feature. I am not alone in this issue, but it seems the number of people affected by
 it are&nbsp;minuscule&nbsp;enough that Valve is ignoring it. Whether the problem lies solely with their client or something in the way my Windows may be set up I do not know. Steam Customer Support has had my msinfo32.nfo file for a month now and have not given me any
 answers, instead they send me in circles.</div>

    <title>Downloading Japanese DLC for Japanese Fable III on British XBL - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Downloading Japanese DLC for Japanese Fable III on British XBL</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox Forums,</p>

<p>I recently had someone travel to Japan and buy me a few games, all of which where region-free. Amongst them, was Fable III Limited Edition.</p>
<p>As for the code that came with it for the Limited Edition, that works. The person who went to Japan had confirmed that the DLC code was working and LE content was present in-game. But as for British Language/Audio, there was none.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my luck, I found a article on the internet mentioning that it would be possible to download a English Audio Voice-Over as a extra, but not compulsory add-on, which for me is very helpful.</p>

<p>The DLC is available on the Japanese Xbox LIVE site, infact, it can be reached by clicking
<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Fable-III-English-Voice-Over-Audio/41351f23-bac8-4a25-a403-9e22fb356fab?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (NOTE: The page is infact in English - You can change the language by replacing the ja-JP to en-GB for Britain or en-US for North America)&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will give me a "Offer not valid in your region" error when I try to download it, and once when I tried to create a Japanese Xbox LIVE account, it asked for a credit card to "pay" for a FREE DLC!</p>

<p>I contacted Xbox Support, and this is what I recieved;</p>

<div>I need help, I can't download the DLC. I have asked them to add it to my download que, purchase history, nothing works...</div>

<div>Serves me right for importing games, but I need help, and account migration only works for the new countries that have arrived to Xbox LIVE.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Any help moderators, admins or Xbox Support?</div>

<p>ngocphi, no you don't. As the DLC code that came with it worked and downloaded on a British XBL, and LE content was present in my friends PAL copy of his game on my Xbox 360. Suprisingly, saves from my Japanese copy worked with his British game! Also, online
 forums have confirmed DLC aren't locked for most official first party Microsoft games, including Fable II, III but not Forza Motorsport 3 or 4!</p>

<p>If your looking to download this voice over pack from the Japanese marketplace, then you need to do this with a Japanese gamertag. Simply put, if you want to download something form a region's marketplace, you need to use a gamertag from that region. However,
 if you download something from another region's marketplace on your xbox, you can use that content on any other gamertag, as long as it's on that xbox. I've used this before to download a game (Bubble Bobble) from the Japanese marketplace, and play it on my
 US gamertag.</p>
<p>As far as needing a credit card, I've never had this problem. I've heard of people experiencing this when they add it to their queue on xbox.com. Have you tried recovering this Japanese account on your xbox, then adding it to your queue?</p>
<p>And If you need a walkthrough on creating an over sea's gamertag, here's one:</p>

<h2>            Why do I have to sign in twice on brand new PC&#63; Password is correct.</h2>
                    <p>Every time I sign in after sleep must sign in twice. First says incorrect password. Other times says use your Microsoft account password. Other times says use the last password you signed in with. The second attempt signs in always.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new computer preloaded with 10 &amp; updated. This was happening before&nbsp;anniversary update. Up date changed privacy settings.
</p>
<p>Bluetooth and other settings without my knowledge. Don't know how long I was unprotected before I learned settings and APPS</p>
<p>&nbsp;reconfigured. Example went from private with fire wall to public&nbsp;no fire wall. I never know what I will find on a daily basis. Changes to system. Account passwords ( email , Apps don't work or have been added. Clearly registry errors at times other times
 is not clear because IP shows 2 IPs from my IP.&nbsp;Stuck after 2 months of this daily annoyance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In a normal boot post a screen shot of your Task Manager, here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system is performing slowly and you look at the Processes tab in Task Manager (press Ctrl-Alt-Del), switch to the Processes tab and with the "Show processes from all users" checked click the CPU column header to sort highest to lowest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a screen shot (or two...) and post them in your next reply.</p>

</p><p>The System Idle Process is the amount of "free time" your CPU has so the more of that the better.&nbsp; If you see some other Process that even momentarily consume large amounts of CPU capture it in your screen shot or tell us what it is.</p>

<p>Post a list of your startup items - here's one way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and install the free version of CCleaner from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner</a></p>
<p>When installing uncheck most things leaving just the Desktop Shortcut (which you can delete later).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbe745e1-1787-4727-a487-8b7a3c0f9194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbe745e1-1787-4727-a487-8b7a3c0f9194" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then uncheck the box to view Release Notes (nobody reads that stuff) and Launch CCleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner will let you manage most Startup items and also do some other cleanup oriented operations.&nbsp; Some people will recommend you not to use the registry functions in CCleaner so avoid those features for now.&nbsp; I have no issue with it myself, but it is
 sometimes a contentious issue I prefer to avoid whenever possible!<br />
<br />
You can uninstall CCleaner later if you don't like it.<br />
<br />
You can disable startup items, see how things look and if you want - totally delete unneeded startup items, or just leave them disabled while you continue troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Note that disabling things does not uninstall anything and if there is a problem, you can just enable the item again.&nbsp; If you are sure you don't want it at all, then you can delete it.<br />
<br />
After launching CCleaner and seeing what startup items you can disable/delete if you still are not sure about your startup items, do this:<br />
<br />
Launch CCleaner and choose Tools, Startup and in the bottom right, click the "Save to text file" button to save the Startup information to a text file on your desktop or someplace you can find it with a name you can remember - something like startup.txt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e3ea1a6-5ea3-4f74-b243-129a723cba1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e3ea1a6-5ea3-4f74-b243-129a723cba1e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Save the startup information text file to your desktop (or someplace you can find it) open the text file with a text editor (notepad or WordPad), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the highlighted text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and then paste
 (Ctrl-V) the contents of the startup list back here in your next reply and perhaps somebody can tell you other things to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner will install a monitoring startup task that you can disable by going to Options, Monitoring and uncheck the two monitoring options and acknowledging in the affirmative their warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dec5935e-ccc0-48cc-b02a-309341d803c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dec5935e-ccc0-48cc-b02a-309341d803c2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see your startup list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's mine:</p>

            <p>Good job. &nbsp;Now we know a lot of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We see that you are not running Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 - do you know why SP1 is not installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of your msinfo32 looks "normal".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 95% free CPU so that is good and since there doesn't seem to be a svchost Process running amok (at the time) your system might not be afflicted with a known problem with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several odd things enabled in your Startup that I don't understand:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35217802-3fda-464f-ba68-9203568c7e69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35217802-3fda-464f-ba68-9203568c7e69" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Canadian Tech And Greg Carmack can help us understand what those are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good thing about CCleaner is that it shows the startup items in an easier to read format than what you see in msconfig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your uTorrent is already disabled - good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have the ability to right click an item and Enable/Disable it which does not delete anything so you can do one item at a time, restart and test your performance and maybe isolate a startup item that is a troublemaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing there are some things you can right click and Disable (don't choose to delete them yet) right away:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner monitor &nbsp;(leave this disabled forever)</p>
<p>GrooveMonitor</p>
<p>Onenotem.exe</p>
<p>LightShot</p>
<p>HotKeysCmds</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what those red ones are all about - they don't make sense to me but they might to CT and/or GC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be because you don't have Service Pack 1 installed yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes (to me) it is not worth doing much troubleshooting until SP1 is installed since it could contain many fixes and patches that your system is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a screen shot of this other message:</p>

            <p>I suspect your system is rather elderly if it still does not have Service Pack 1 installed.&nbsp; Can you tell me exactly how old this system is and whether it is a laptop or desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you brought it to me and I had it on my desk, my first action would be to wipe the hard drive and re-install Windows 7 SP1 and then do all the updates.&nbsp; Following that re-install the programs you actually use and your data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would likely produce a dramatically improved PC.&nbsp; It would be a virgin clean system.&nbsp; Cost is zero since you have already confirmed a good disk drive is installed.&nbsp; It would take an elapsed time of about 12 hours to do this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like specific instructions on how, I can provide you with a step by step.</p>

Can you be more specific about your example?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. at the bottom of the page, in a group titled Top Sellers?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you hover your mouse over whatever it is that you see there and get a more precise rating value that way?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. for one which has 4 gold stars
 I observe its hovered rating is only "3.9 out of 5 stars".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

<h3> mcdonalds977  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual boot&#58; GRUB error&#58; no such partition. Disc drive doesn&#39;t work and can&#39;t create recovery USB.</h2>
                    sorry it's hard for me to capitalize letters on this keyboard.<br />
<br />
the reason i'm getting this error is because i installed linux a while ago as a dual boot but didn't use it and needed free space. my computer used to boot and it´d ask me if i wanted to run windows or linux. so i deleted its partitions using the same windows
 partition program i used to create dual boot. i added the free space to my windows partition and restarted. and then i got a GRUB error: no such partition. i didn't delete any windows files though. so i'm trying to use the recovery disc i downloaded which
 is an ISO and put on an USB to fix it but i haven't been able to boot from it. my cd drive on that computer doesn't work. i'm running windows x64 ultimate on that computer but this is an XP computer.<br />
<br />
i tried using a program called UNetBootin after i formatted the usb drive and it started to boot but it said "NTLDR is missing". i can't follow the directions with "diskpart" on it because when i use diskpart it only shows ONE disc drive which i think is C:
 even though my other one is connected.<br />
<br />
i don't know what to do i just want my windows computer back. :( i have all my childhood photos and pics from this year and school stuff on it.<br />

    <title>Consent issues with Xbox enabled games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smithprb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Consent issues with Xbox enabled games</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've been running Windows 10 since the preview and have now run into a horrible problem when playing Xbox enabled&nbsp;games from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally have 9-10 Xbox games installed at once and often switch between them. After a few days I am randomly signed out of Xbox on all&nbsp;games and have no way of signing back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remedy the issue I've tried logging in and out of the Store, reinstalling the games, resetting the Store cache (wsreset.exe) and changing my profile&nbsp;from a local to a Microsoft account. The only thing that seems to work is backing up my saves, deleting
 my Windows 10 profile, and creating a new local profile (or logging in with my Microsoft profile). Even when deleting my local profile and starting over, after a few days the issue hits again and the process repeats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message in Make it Rain and Tiny Troopers is 'Sorry, but without signing in and giving consent, you won't be able to use Xbox services.' Other games give similar messages. Between the games working and not, I have not changed any privacy, Xbox
 or Store settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only game that seems to consistently work is Microsoft Solitaire Collection. I imagine this is because it seems to use the Xbox app to log in to Xbox Live whereas the other games do not. The Xbox app has not ever been an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it odd that I haven't been able to find anyone else with the same problem. I'm really bored with creating a new Windows profile every few days. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m having an issue with windows mail (windows 10, gmail account). Any time I send an email, two instances of this email will pop up in my inbox. Is anyone else having this issue? How can it be fixed? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. But your suggestion is not working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of this problem, now I´m also having sync issues. Mail refuses to show new mails in inbox or even display my sent mails. My windows phone is syncing it just fine. I can send emails with my pc, and when I check my windows phone´s outbox, they are there.
 But&nbsp;refuses to&nbsp;properly sync&nbsp;on pc.&nbsp; If I want to see new emails on my computer, I have to remove the account completely and add it again, and it works. But after that it just freezes, refusing to sync again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to check the version of "Mail and Calendar" or Outlook or what it´s called. But when the problems started I did an update which didn´t fix anything, but it should be the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There&nbsp;are no error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think we can narrow down the problems to the pc app itself, since&nbsp;the syncing is working perfectly on my windows 10 phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooting link you provided was not helpful.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is no&nbsp;Outlook folder in my AppData/Local/Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Sound performance and system lag experienced on upgrading to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Cannot Resolve High Time for Resolving Latency, Sound Popping, and System Lagging (LatenyMon Log included)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having this problem with my sound ever since I upgraded to Windows 10. Every so often, my sound will just cut out or pop and it gets more and more regular the longer the PC is on. My PC will also start to slow down and lag. I've searched tirelessly
 to fix this issue and I have no clue what to do. It's making it very frustrating to watch videos, listen to music, or use Skype. As a note, this issue never occurred on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying many solutions, I've decided to come here for help. I hope someone is able to help me. I found a program called LatencyMon and I've done a test to put on here. It's a three minute test and during the time it ran, I experienced several pops and
 the sound cutting out. Here is the log from it:&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/DigitalStuffMan/e099ba27ba34d36f149c65f880ae2440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LatencyMon Log</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know too, I have already run SFC, DISM, and the troubleshooters built in Windows. All finding no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anything else I can provide, I will happily do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The above issue might have occurred due to non-updated/incompatible audio drivers or if third party applications/programs are conflicting with the audio drivers installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>How did you upgrade the computer to Windows 10 (via Media Creation Tool or Windows Updates)?
</span></li><li><span>Which are the troubleshooting steps apart from SFC and DISM scan have you performed to resolve the issue?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error code or error message when the issue occurs on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: <strong>Update</strong> the audio drivers manually from
<strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Device manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>Sound, video and game controller</strong>, right click on the audio driver and select
<strong>Update this software</strong> from the context menu. </span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the drivers to update.</span></li><li><span>After the update is complete, close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li><li><span>If the issue persists, download and install the latest and most compatible audio drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, boot the computer in
<strong>Clean boot</strong> state and check if the issue is caused due to installed third party applications.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting the system in <strong>Clean boot</strong> will enable the computer to start using minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;for
<strong>Windows 10</strong> from the article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</strong>from the link above.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of sound performance issue and system lagging after upgrading to Windows 10 on the computer in the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we
 assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry for the delayed response. I've been fairly busy the past week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I updated to Windows 10 through the media creation tool.</p>
<p>2.) The troubleshooting steps I took were really just all of the built-in troubleshooters you can find in the control panel. I did the ones related to sound, hardware, system, and internet.</p>
<p>3.) No, I do not have an error. All that happens is the sound cuts out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first method did not help at all with the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second method did seem to help at first, but the sound did cut out after extended use. It only happened once though versus before where it happened very often. What I've noticed is that in LatencyMon, the driver ndis.sys has a really long execution time
 when it does happen. For example, when it last happened, ndis.sys had an execution time of 49.5 ms, which is obviously really high for drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I was doing during the time of the high execution time:</p>
<p>I was using Skype and playing an online game on Steam. Nothing else was running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurs on a USB headset, one I use all the time, and it does work properly on another computer running Windows 10 so I can tell it's not the headset. This computer was also upgraded from Windows 7 using the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can guide me on where to go next. Thanks in advance! :)</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t boot passed the windows logo screen</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to boot my computer, however it keeps going to the windows logo screen (without the spinning dots) and then resets and does the same thing over and over. I&nbsp;have tried to use a Windows 10 ISO file on a USB as a boot, then it gets to press any
 key and when I do it just continues to the logo again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an MSI motherboard and a 120Gb Kingston SSD (boot drive) and a 1Tb WD Blue.</p>
<p>Both are recognised on the BIOS and the boot SSD is relatively new. </p>

 but the files were gone and the "paste" option was grayed out. &nbsp;Please help me find my files!!! &nbsp;They were really important audio recordings of classes I needed. &nbsp;Any recommendations would be GREATLY appreciated!!!</span><br />

            <p>Good afternoon Eugene S,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your message &amp; your assistance.&nbsp; After not receiving my emails through Window Mail for about 18 hours, they all of a sudden began streaming in on Sunday morning.&nbsp; I don't know what had happened, but I had tried all of your suggestions,
 but everything had appeared to be in order &amp; had nearly given up.&nbsp; I am confused why this happened in the first place, but my Windows Mail is now operating perfectly again since mid-Sunday morning-- I had made no changes on my end when my mail all began streaming
 in on Windows Mail.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jon_95866</p>

            <p>Good evening Cesar E,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment, but I didn't refresh anything.&nbsp; All of the settings, etc.,&nbsp;after observing&nbsp;that they were&nbsp;already set they should be,&nbsp;were left untouched.&nbsp; The problem was not on my&nbsp;computer, but was further down the line.&nbsp; My inclination is&nbsp;to
 credit this problem as&nbsp;server generated.</p>

<h2>            Changing the status of my Homegroup network</h2>
                    I have an HP laptop running windows 7 and an HP desktop running windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; My homegroup connection was working just fine until today but for some reason my homegroup local&nbsp; wifi network is not connecting me to the internet. I have a strong connectivity
 to the router and the direct internet to the Desktop and router is fine, but I am not passing thru to the internet from the laptop thru the homegroup connection with the router and my desktop.&nbsp; I suspect that I have some settings wrong but can not seem to
 find a way to change them. My desktop settings shows the network set to private, but my laptop shows it set to public.&nbsp; I want to change the laptop to private, but I can find no function that allows me to change from public to private or vise versa. I&nbsp; seem
 to be stuck.

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi Robert,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With the description, I understand that you want to change your laptop settings to private or vice versa on home group using Windows
 7 &amp; Windows 10 operating system. I will certainly help you in getting this issue fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To change the network settings to Private from Public, you may refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">1. Press
</span><span>Windows key</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">+ R</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
 and put<strong><span>regedit</span></strong> in
<strong><span>Run</span></strong> dialog box to open
<em><span>Registry Editor </span></em>(if you’re not familiar with
<em><span>Registry Editor</span></em>, Click ok
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">2. In the
<em><span>left</span></em> pane of <em>
<span>Registry Editor</span></em>, navigate to following registry key:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">3. At this registry location, expand the
<strong><span>Profiles</span></strong> key in the left pane. Then you’ll see long sub-keys with different
<em><span>Globally Unique Identifiers</span></em> (<em><span>GUIDs</span></em>). The number of sub-keys here equals to number of networks you’ve joined till date and each network
 has a unique sub-key. In the corresponding right pane of sub-key, locate the <em>
<span>Profile Name</span></em> registry string. Its
<em><span>Value data</span></em> should correspond to the name of respective network. So in this way, select the
<em><span>GUID</span></em> for your network and in the right pane, look for
<strong><span>Category</span></strong> named registry
<em><span>DWORD</span></em>. Double click on it to modify its
<em><span>Value data</span></em> and so the location type:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">4. In the above shown box, set the
<em><span>Value data</span></em> to <strong>
<span>1</span></strong> for
<strong><span>Private</span></strong>,
<strong><span>0</span></strong> for
<strong><span>Public</span></strong> and
<strong><span>2</span></strong> for
<strong><span>Domain</span></strong> network. Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong> after making the registry manipulation and close the
<em><span>Registry Editor</span></em>. Restart the
<em><span>File Explorer</span></em> or reboot to make changes effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Canon IX6550 print spooler issues after hibernating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan-p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon IX6550  print spooler issues after hibernating</h2>
                    <p>I've just got a new printer, a Canon IX6550 which&nbsp;initially performed perfectly. Following a hibernate of the laptop I could not access the printer. Devices and Printers would hang as would any program which tried to access the printer. Reboots made no difference
 and a re-install of the driver had no effect. I could get the printer to work by manually stopping the print spooler then starting it from Services (it is set to automatic startup) but this had to be performed for every access to the printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I applied Microsoft rollup update for core printing components 2647753 and following this everything works after a re-boot&nbsp; but if the laptop is put into hibernate the same issues occur, any access to the printer from an application causes the application
 to hang and Devices and Printers does not open (progress bar turns green and stays like that with blank window). As before, a stop and start of the print spooler causes things to work but only for that access to the priner, I have to do this for every print.
 A re-boot clears the issue until the next hibernate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer driver is the current version for Windows 7 and says it is compatible with 64 bit which this version is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Event logger is showing the following warning which appears to be associated with the time that an application, in this case Word, tried to access the printer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the printer troubleshooter and check.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> the article is for Windows Vista but the steps apply for Windows 7 also.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the steps do not help, proceed to method 3:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable power management of the USB hub
</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note
</span></strong><span>If you perform the following procedure, you may also reduce the battery life on a portable computer.<br />
<br />
To disable power management of the USB hub, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Devmgmt.msc</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. The <strong>Device Manager</strong> window opens.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Expand
<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click a USB Root Hub in the list, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. The <strong>USB Root Hub Properties</strong> dialog box is displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the
<strong>Power Management</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click to clear the
<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span>6. Repeat steps 3 through 6 for each USB Root Hub in the list.</span></p>
<p><span>7. On the
<strong>Action</strong> menu, click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>. <br />
Windows 7 recognizes the new device.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Close the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> Window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t work, follow the

            This is a non-MSE issue.<br />
<br />
This would actually depend on the type or brand of router you are using. I would suggest to follow the provided documentation on the router.<br />

            Are you asking about how to logon to perform setup and administration of the router, or how to allow only specific users access to your router?<br />
<br />
Users do not "logon" to the router, per se.&nbsp; However, you can control which users are allowed access to the router, whether wired or wireless.<br />
<br />
Again, as Aiscer said, this is a non-MSE issue.&nbsp; The best thing to do is to download a manual for your specific router.&nbsp; Once done, look at how to logon to the router to perform administrative functions.&nbsp; Once you have accomplished that, you need to understand
 how you want to handle wired users (via MAC address), or wireless users (via MAC address and/or WEP key).&nbsp; If wireless, you will want to understand the wep key and other protocols that can be used to secure your wireless network.<br />
<br />
You may want to try contacting DLink for help.&nbsp; Also, look here for the manual:<br />

Good luck.<br />

            <p>Hi Carolyn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Perform a clean boot and then check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure that you perform “step 7” in the link mentioned above to boot your computer normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:
</strong>R<span>estart the Volume Shadow Copy service and SPP services and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Administrative Tools by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Administrative Tools</strong></span><span>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click <strong>Services</strong></span><span>.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the <strong>SPP</strong></span><span> service is disabled, double-click it to open the service properties.</span></p>
<p>
<span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If <strong>Volume Shadow Copy</strong></span><span> service is double-click it to open the service properties
</span></p>
<p>
<span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <strong>Startup type</strong> list, click <strong>Automatic (Delayed Start)</strong>, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under <strong>Service status</strong>, click <strong>Start</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
