    <title>Word is VERY slow to save document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warren982  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word is VERY slow to save document</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10, 64bit, 4mg RAM laptop. Since the Windows 10 upgrade, and maybe just since I upgraded to the Professional Version because of its BitLocker feature, saving a document has been painfully slow. I just timed it with a stopwatch and it took
 105.2 seconds to go from pressing the "Save As" button to having saved a 3 page document. I tried the same with a 32bit Windows 10 Home laptop with 2mg RAM and it saved far more quickly though not as quickly as it had with Windows 7 in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of the delay seems to be the attempt to synchronize though I don't synchronize anything, saving everything to USBs and an online storage (not MS). I looked at every setting that might have turned a synchronization on and can't find any. Maybe I should
 be glad that documents are eventually saved for I do get work done and I do value the BitLocker feature. But it is frustrating to see the continual "Word has stopped operating" with the associated fear that it has crashed permanently and things are lost even
 if I have autosave set for every 5 minutes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending a document to the printer is also slower than in the past, but not so painfully slow. Help is appreciated. Thanks to all.

<p>The problem is only with Word. When I save a document or from one folder to another using File Explorer the saving occurs almost instantly. I checked for Add-ons and the only one is OneNote, which I've never used. The problem seems to be an intermediate
 page that loads when one presses "Save As," there then occurs three options, after which the page goes to saving to the Documents file and one can press the "Save" button. Once, this intermediate page didn't occur and the saving was rapid but that only happened
 once. In the Word options I have it set to save to the Documents folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest updates and already reinstalled Office 2016 once, Word being the only part of it that I use. I only save about 4 documents/day using Word so this problem is tolerable. If I were in a conventional office setting though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll likely re-install the Office again this weekend and see if that makes a change, but I'm not hopeful.</p>

<p>I tried to repair Office but this operation froze, the message being that I should try later. When I did the next day, I found that Office had disappeared. I went to my account and re-installed Office 2016, finding (surprisingly) that my setting (to auto-save
 every 5 minutes) and recent documents were still in Word. The program now seems to "Save As" more quickly but Word still freezes. The problem seems to be the intermediate page which asks where of three places to save the document. Word freezes before this
 page and then after. Perhaps if the coding were changed to automatically "Save As" to the Documents folder, and after this to be given an Option of saving elsewhere (if this were previously set up). My Option is set to save to the documents file automatically
 but this seems not to override the production of that slowing-down page. In my other Windows 10 laptop, with just 2mg RAM in place of this laptop's 4mg RAM, the "Save As" operation goes far more quickly, that laptop having the Windows 10 Home and not Professional
 version with BitLocker being used for encryption.<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Update: For whatever reason, though the laptop and apps are the same, Word is now saving documents more quickly, in less than half the time that I reported (now about 30 seconds), and occasionally far more quickly, though not as fast as when saving a document
 from Notepad to the Documents folder when it is nearly instantaneous.<br />

<p>Update: The two laptops that I complained of working painfully slowly with Windows 10 have died. The first,about 7 years old, had given the warning of a hard disk failure but I thought this might have been a Windows 10 error. When it died, I managed to use
 the restore disks that I had bought the time of its purchase and restored the laptop to Vista, which I never had problems with. Everything went fine for a few hours. The laptop downloaded updates and worked well--until suddenly giving the notice that the hard
 drive was dying and then it did. Alas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second, 5 1/2 year old laptop, Windows Pro, died within days. The fan works but it won't start, so I'll be using this one to play around with and attempt to resurrect. The problem likely is the hard drive but I received no warning so... But I had been
 getting odd startups, it starting-up in what appeared to be Windows 7 mode which disappeared when I restarted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now using a 15 year old Thinkpad which was optimized for Windows XP and I upgraded to 1.5GB RAM and first Windows 7 and then Windows 10. Admittedly, it's under-powered and had been operating slowly with odd startups but, for whatever reason, after a
 few days it began operating much better and Word saves documents far more quickly (5 sec or less) than my previous laptops (which had taken up to 1.5 min). So I wonder if the past Word problems might not have reflected that the hard drives were failing. Who
 knows. But, to avoid future worries since my work life depends on a well-functioning computer, and because this computer does operate slowly if more than one app is open, I've ordered two Thinkpads which will arrive today. They are very sturdy machines with
 great security features. </p>

            I also have the same problem. Its taking ages while opening and closing a word file of hardly any Kbs. I am running W10 pro 64. My RAM is 16 gb and recent 7700HQ processor. I tried your option. It is only opening and closing a bit faster but the background
 processing is still happening (not showing) and I can not use word for some time even if it is open until it finishes its hidden background processing.&nbsp;

<p>If you did not remove them from the Website they should be there.&nbsp; If you do not see them, look in the ARCHIVE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Items deleted from a device are automatically moved to the archive.&nbsp; I'm guessing that when you performed the archive then installed and ran the MyPhone application, it saw it as if your deleted the pics from your device so it moved them to the archive.</p>

<h2>            Will Nokia ever do a Iphone and give a free upgrades with the N97&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So many complaints over the N97 than maybe any other Nokia release.</p>
<p>So many disapointments, So many faults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple have won the loyalty from customers from the first Iphone release by allowing them to upgrade for free or on the cheap, Will nokia ever follow this loyal approach in a bid to win the customers back that they will lose over such a poor release?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I for one would pay £100 for an upgrade</p>

<p>Well the thing is, Apple did that along with AT&amp;T. Since Nokia isn't partnered with any one cell phone company (unlocked Nokia's aren't subsidized by the carrier, unlike iPhones), they probably can't afford to do something like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without getting into the issue as such, Nokia could definitely afford it, if they wanted. They are, by far, the largest phone maker in the world, and they are profitable. "Can't afford" is not exactly the phrase I would ever put in the same sentence as "Nokia",
 ever. :)</p>

<p>All you can do on Iphone is doable on S60 3rd FP2 in one way or another.</p>
<p>You dont need a special program to load up your Nokia&nbsp;phone with apps/music/movies and so on and you can do it from any computer or download it from internet directly to your phone.</p>
<p>Nokia follows standards like Upnp, DLNA and WebDAV.</p>
<p>You dont need to send away you Nokia Phone&nbsp;around the world to get a new battery. You can do it your self.</p>
<p>You get better services on the web like OVI, sportstracker,&nbsp;viNe and&nbsp;N-Gage&nbsp;with a Nokia Phone.</p>
<p>Nokia Maps are better then Google Maps.</p>
<p>Nokia dosent controll what you are able to install on your phone.</p>
<p>Symbian are an open platform.</p>

<p>Hi ChinnusamyA,</p>
<p>Here are the information:</p>
<p>1. If we have Office 365 ProPlus/Office 365 Business/Office 365 Small Business Premium license, then we can install Office suit which includes the Outlook client from Office 365 portal on Mac or PC.</p>
<p>2. For the Office 2010, I would like to explain that it is not provided any Office 365 anymore and starting<b> October 13, 2015</b>, Office 2010 enters extended support. For Office 365 Subscribers, it is recommended that the customer uninstall Office 2010
 and install the latest Office 365 client subscription available to them. See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/lifecycle?wa=wsignin1.0#gp/gp_msl_policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/lifecycle?wa=wsignin1.0#gp/gp_msl_policy</a></p>
<p>3. For Office 2011 for Mac, I would like to explain that, after version 10.10(Yosemite), there is no Office 2011 for Mac. Instead, it is Office 2016 for Mac. The license it needs is the one I mentioned in point 1.</p>
<p>4. For Office 2016 for Windows, I would like to explain that, if you are using Office 365 Business plans (Office 365 Small Business Premium, Business and Business Premium), and you have the license that I mentioned in point 1, then you can download the Office
 2016 from Office 365 portal. If you are using Enterprise subscription, you need to enable the First Release first (in Office 365 Admin center-&gt;Service Settings-&gt;Updates),wait for 24 hours, then go to Office 365 portal to install Office 2016. Or using Office
 Deployment tool to install.</p>
<p>Please let me know if we can discuss further.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Iris</p>

<p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>In this situation, we cannot configure Office 365 account in Outlook client 2013 with the Office 365 Business Essential licenses.</p>
<p>If we want to use Office 365 account to activate the Outlook client which is installed from the Office 365 portal page, we need to own the related Office 365 plans which includes Office applications first. For example, Office 365 ProPlus, Office 365 Business
 or Office 365 Enterprise E3 plan etc.</p>
<p>For more details, you can refer to the following article:<br />

    <title>Default Endnote Numbering Style From Roman to Arabic Numerals - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenmetz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Endnote Numbering Style From Roman to Arabic Numerals</h2>
                    <p>For 20 years I've been writing to Microsoft telling them that making roman numerals the default endnote numbering style is moronic since no publication or organization on earth uses it. &nbsp;I just installed Office 2016 and see that not only is that design flaw
 still there, but Microsoft decided to make it even harder to correct their error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With older versions you could open the normal.dotm and correct the error, then save the normal template. &nbsp;Then future documents would number endnotes like every publication and organization on earth does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there doesn't seem to be a normal.dotm than I can find in Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can manually change it every time I start a new document but is that really the solution--that Microsoft not only builds a design flaw into Word but now makes it impossible to fix? &nbsp;If that's the case, I guess I'll roll back to an earlier version
 of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions</p>

            <p>To add to what Doug has said, the Normal.dotm template does not exist (except as a concept in the mind of Word) until you modify it. If you save some other modification (modify a style, save a macro, etc.), then you should be able to find the template where
 Doug specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to open the Normal template (and this might work even if it hadn't been created) is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Word, press
<strong><span>Alt+F11</span></strong>; the Visual Basic Editor opens. Press
<strong><span>Ctrl+G </span></strong>to activate the
<strong><span>Immediate </span></strong>window. In that window, type (or paste)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>and press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>. Normal opens, but note that it may not be on top of all windows. You can close the Visual Basic Editor. Make the desired changes to the Normal file, and then save and close it.
 If the changes you have made have not been recognized as changes (the <strong><span>Undo
</span></strong>button is not activated), press <strong><span>Spacebar</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Backspace </span></strong>to “dirty” the file, thus ensuring that the template will actually be saved.</span></p>

            <p>You will find the Normal.dotm template in the C:\Users|[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use File&gt;Open and then navigate to that folder and open the Template and then change the numbering format and then click on apply, and then to make sure that Word thinks that the document (ie the Normal.dotm template) has been changed, add some text
 and then delete it and then Save the template, the changes should be retained.</p>

</p><p>Of course, if your document is being created from other than the Normal.dotm template, you would need to make the change in that template rather than the Normal.dotm template.</p>

<p>Kedves Közösség!</p>
<p>Egy kis , de nekem megoldhatatlan ügyben szeretnék segítséget kérni. Sajnálatos módon nincs egy e-mail cím, vagy telefonszám az egész MS 365 szupportban, amelyen át megkérdezhetném, hogyan módosíthatnám a kártyaadataimat. Megváltozott, emiatt nem tudja a
 rendszer leemelni a soros havi díjat a számlámról. Kaptam felszólítást, de az abban küédött link, és bármely más ilyen link mindig a levelezésembe vezet, ahonnan meg nem lehet feljebb lépni ilyen jellegű adatmódosításhoz. Azt különösen ízléstelennek találom
 egy nem informatikus felhasználóval szemben, hogy a megküldött azonosítók a vele küldött linken elérhető felületen nem használhatók. Mint, hogy nem tudok semmit tenni, még visszajelezni sem, bármelyik pillanatban letörölhetik a levelezésemet. Egy&nbsp; 7 éves honlapomat
 egy másik ilyen cég nyomtalanul letörölte. Minden segítséget előre köszönök.</p>

<h2>            MYOB Security message</h2>
                    For every single email that MYOB sends via Outlook a security warning appears from Outlook telling you that "a program is trying to send a message......." and then you have to click on allow for each email, which is quite painful when sending hundreds
 of statements via email. It seems to be the same over different versions of Outlook (ie. 2002,2003,2007). Is there any way of changing the security settings to make this warning go away? Apparently MYOB beleive you have a program update to fix the issue, however
 I can't find it.

            <p>I know this is an older post, but for anyone else who is experiencing this now, or who may down the road, I've found that that it seems to be an issue with the COM Add-in for "Microsoft Access Outlook Add-in for Data Collection and Publishing".&nbsp; (ACCOLK.DLLL)&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I know I didn't have use for this add-in, so I disabled it and it resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found that most "Call Errors" in Office desktop apps have to do with their add-ins.&nbsp; I am not a programmer, so maybe it is only add-ins that throw this message?&nbsp; I do not know for sure, but that's where I would look.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your affected Office program, go to Options, &gt; Add-Ins &gt; Manage: "select" COM and click GO.</p>
<p>First make a list of every COM add-in that is enabled.&nbsp; It's important that you do this!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then turn all of them off at once. (just the COM add-ins)&nbsp; Restart the program and one by one reenable them, restarting the program after each one.&nbsp; Don't skip restarting the program after each add-in is enabled. Eventually you should find the add-on that
 throws the call.&nbsp; Ether disable it, or investigate whatever that add-in is trying to do but cannot.&nbsp; Don't forget to enable the rest of your COM add-ins from your list.</p>

            Hello Herman,<br />
<br />
<br />
Unlike lines and shapes, the option to set a default picture line width is not available in Word. However, what you can do instead is to duplicate (copy and paste) an image that already has a line width of 1pt, right-click on the duplicated image, click on
<strong>Change Picture</strong>, then select the image that you want to use. For suggestions and feedback about Word, you may post it on
<strong><a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word UserVoice</a></strong>.<br />

Let us know if you require further assistance.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used this same file on another machine and it runs fine. When I double click on the file a window flashes on the screen for about a second. I can just about make out that it says "extracting files, Please wait" But nothing happens.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.Com is displaying wrong name</h2>
                    <p>Hi to all respected Gurus and members of this community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Uzair Awan from Pakistan, an Oracle Programmer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me tell you the story from scratch so that I could get help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long ago I created an email id on "Hotmail.Com" as "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" with display name "Muhammad Uzair Awan" and that was working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I switched / converted my account when "Hotmail.Com" given the option to switch the account onto "live.com" so my account was in access and visible to everyone as "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" with display name "Muhammad Uzair Awan" and was working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later on again I switched / converted my account when "Live.Com" given the option to switch the account onto "Outlook.Com" and again my account was in access and visible to everyone as "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" with display name "Muhammad Uzair Awan".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since last 6/7 months I am noticing that the display name of my email account is appearing "Hamid Ali Awan" instead of "Muhammad Uzair Awan". I tried a lot but failed to find the reason of this error while in "Settings" my display name is correct but
 whenever anyone send an email to me the display name appears as "Hamid Ali Awan" which is wrong".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Attached are two images for further detail.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />

</p><p><br />
Please help me to resolve this issue.&nbsp;<br />
With best regards and thanks in advance.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Janice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the most common scenarios with users who are missing their contacts is that they are not signed in to the correct account. Skype contacts are tied to your account and are saved on our servers. They will not be removed from a user's account
<strong>unless </strong>the user removed them. It might be possible that you are accessing a different account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you sign out and sign back in using the credentials you used to
<strong>initially </strong>create your account. Sign in with a Skype Name if you created your account using a Skype Name, same goes with accounts created using an email address or a phone number. You can use the Microsoft
<strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Accounts Diagnostic link</a></strong> to determine whether you have multiple accounts or not. Enter the email address associated with your account and click
<strong>Continue</strong>. We'll give you the list of accounts that are under your email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find additional information in this FAQ. <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34814/why-are-my-skype-contacts-or-credit-missing?q=lost+contacts+and+skype+credits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why are my Skype contacts or credit

<h2>            Nokia 7210 &#40;non-supernova&#41; factory preinstalled files</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, could someone share Nokia 7210 (non-supernova) model factory preinstalled files? Including Gallery: Pictures &amp; Ringtones, Games and Applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted the files from my phone, and thought that they were recoverable when doing "Restore factory settings". But they were not.</p>
<p>From internet I can find all kinds of files (wallpapers, games etc.), but not the original ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really <span>appreciate</span>, if someone could share the original files. Because Nokia don't support the phone anymore, and therefore do not have the files. Thanks.</p>

            Hi,<br />
You can reinstall entire firmware or phone software without any help.<br />
Do this,<br />
<br />
Install Nokia suite and restart your computer,<br />
now connect your phone to your pc via usb cable and start Nokia suite and click on software update.<br />
If new software available, then click on update and if not available, still you can reinstall the current phones software by clicking on reinstall.<br />
<br />
This brings back all the apps, games, wallpapers etc.<br />
<br />
Backup your important data before software update or reinstall using backup and restore in settings.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>Actually, the 7210 phone is so old, that the firmware update must be done by Nokia Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regular USB-cable (DKU-5 etc.) will not do that, nor any PC-Suite.</p>
<p>And Nokia won't even offer NHL-4 firmware to end users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you are right, that the firmware-update brings back all original files. The Nokia Service points have only quite high repairing prices. And there isn't anything wrong with the phones current firmware, so the update would be unneccessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be easier (and cheaper) if someone could copy the original files with PC-Suite or MobiMB, then I could install the files by myself. I'm sure, that somebody still have a 7210 in use or unused in a desktop box.</p>

<h2>            Set Control Source using VBA in Report</h2>
                    Can you set the control source of a field in a report to something else based on a field in the report using vba? Will I need to create set reports for the different control sources? Here is an example of what I am trying to do, I have a report that has
 a field called type (Book, Movie, TV Show, Music), based on whatever the type is of that record, the control source of another field (duration) will change. Is this possible or would I need to create different reports with the different control source?

    <title>How to unload&#47;unlock the ActiveX &#40;OCX&#41; file from IE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shailendra moyal  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to unload&#47;unlock the ActiveX &#40;OCX&#41; file from IE process &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a ActiveX control developed for using it in Internet Explorer. When the page loads, I want to detect that the ActiveX requires an upgrade and then if it is required, open a new window where the upgrade occurs. I have been able to detect the ActiveX
 using either "new ActiveXObject" or by embedding it in the page (program/declarative) and then call a getVersion function implemented by ActiveX.</p>
<p>The challenge that I am facing is that when I embed the plugin in the new window for the upgrade to occur. The install prompt is shown but seems after the plugin is downloaded it fails to write to the OCX file and hence popups up the system dialog saying
 "You must restart your computer before the new settings will take effect ...". So, I understand that this issue occurs because the OCX has been loaded by the IE process when its instance is created in the main page (for detecting upgrade) and now when the
 upgrade is occuring in the new window, it fails to write to the OCX file as it is already locked.</p>
<p>What I want to know is that, <strong>is there any way I can get the OCX file unlocked from the IE process, when I destroy the last instance of ActiveX Object ?</strong> Getting it unlocked from the IE process will help me get my upgrade work seamlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : The issues applies to all IE versions.</p>

<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Is there a way to design a multi-column report?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; </div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;My data is small enough to fit on one or two pages, as long as I print in two columns. In other words, rather than printing down one long column, taking up perhaps four sheets of paper, we would like to cut that in half by printing down two columns, on
 any single sheet of paper.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; </div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Thank you for any insight that you can lend. </div>

<h2>            How to remove unknown version of Word off my new laptop</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new HP laptop.&nbsp; I had horrendous problems getting my Microsoft Office 2013 installed, but after everyday for almost a week and more than six hours of International long distance phone calls, I finally found someone who knew what they were doing
 and finally got it installed for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silly me, the eternal optimist, I thought my problems were solved.&nbsp; Now if I right click on a doc file and select Open With, there are two options for Word.&nbsp; I inserted a screen print so you can see.&nbsp; If I click on the Word (desktop), the file is opened
 with Word 2013 which is what I hoped for.&nbsp; However, if I click on the Word option, the file opens but then it says it's an unregistered version and it wants me to sign in or create an account and then it wants the product key.&nbsp; I tried entering the product
 key I have for Office 2013 and it says that's a product key for another version of office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get rid of this unknown version of Word and/or Office off my laptop?&nbsp; I went into the Control Panel and looked for Office 365 or Word 365 or any other versions of Office other than the 2013 which I own.&nbsp; I heard that new laptops with Windows
 10 sometimes come with Windows 365 already installed.&nbsp; If that is the case here, I want it gone.&nbsp; The list in the Control Panel only shows my 2013 version.&nbsp; So how do I get rid of this unknown version of Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Can't find Microsoft Office in your list to uninstall?<br />
You may have pre-installed Microsoft Office StoreDesktop Apps (Centenial Version). This version doesn't appear in the Control Panel (nor is there a Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app for Outlook in this release)<br />
<br />
Go to Settings --&gt; <br />
Apps --&gt; <br />
Apps &amp; Features --&gt; <br />
scroll down the list looking for &lt;Microsoft Desktop Store Apps&gt; --. click on it --&gt; uninstall

<p>If you have no intention of using Xbox, then yes you can uninstall those applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list of installed applications and you'll probably find more apps you don't need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also look through the list of all programs in the Start Menu. There are a bunch of programs there that you most likely don't need. Many of them are "Store apps" that don't show up in the Control Panel Program list.

<p><span>#5<span>&nbsp; </span>I've am just learning about the "CompactOS" feature.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is a feature that allows you to install Windows in a compressed format.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Depending on the specifics of your installation this can save up to 5GB of space.</span></p>
