            <p>Yeah! I finally found my question all by myself!</p>
<p>I don't know why there is no knowledge about it on the net! (even in microsoft support section)</p>
<p>It's a hardware combination:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hold down both volume up and volume down keys (right side of my HD7)</p>
<p>while holding them down, press and hold the Search hardware button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BING!!!</p>
<p>now the dedicated bing app will start again whenever you press the hardware search button!</p>

    <title>Word keeps applying Heading formats to bolded lines - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> royalf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word keeps applying Heading formats to bolded lines</h2>
                    <p>I'm am so frustrated with all the new poorly implemented additions to word and excel.&nbsp; I'm about to give up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an 84 page word document.&nbsp; I am not using word's&nbsp;HEADING#&nbsp;but created my own, which are used in a custom Table of Contents.&nbsp; &nbsp;I occasionally saw this intermittently in the last few weeks but now it is constant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I highlight a line of NORMAL Style, and click BOLD, it applies that direct formatting.&nbsp; When I move the cursor to another line the line gets reformatted.&nbsp; Word changes my&nbsp;paragraph in a random HEADING# style or a Random TOC# style.&nbsp; It then puts that
 expand/collapse arrow on the side.&nbsp; And my line gets 15-18pts paragraph spacing before and after.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a complex formatted document arbitraily&nbsp;assigning styles and different spacing without the Human's permission is very&nbsp;bad. It messes all sorts of things up.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is occurring&nbsp;in Print Layout, so it is officially auto-applying random Styles to my text
 and won't stop.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've made heading 1-9 and toc 1-9 restricted from use in the document--and Mircosoft ignores that setting&nbsp;and uses them.&nbsp; I've hidden the styles.&nbsp; I've tried modifying the headings to not disrupt my formatting, but changing one style line
 in a block of Normal triggers spacing from Normal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Arrgh.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there some magic checkbox that says stop re-writing/auto-applying styles because every time Word does it, it is wrong.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally turn many of these "helpful" "let me change what you're&nbsp;typing because obviously, you did not mean to do that" features.&nbsp; There are a number of them in Excel and Word that are just nuisances&nbsp;for power users with complex documents that are not
 "a Letter" "a Memo", etc.&nbsp; I feel like&nbsp;MS has crossed a line with these products where trying to appeal to the laziest consumer who makes little effort to learn how to use software is making the products too frustrating for those of us who learned&nbsp;to be a
 power user decades ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;They aren't getting better.&nbsp; It is just changed for the sake of saying you changed something, now pay us for an upgrade.&nbsp; &nbsp;I stayed with 2003 for over a decade and moving to 2013 and 2016 has been far more negative annoyances and
 stumbling&nbsp;blocks in creating content than anything helpful.&nbsp; I think my level of pain may have reached the point where I just have to bite the bullet and move to a product that puts the quality of features and output over making things simple for the lowest
 end user.&nbsp;<br />

            The thinking that some installs require anti-malware to be suspened is not necessary with anti-malware that use the APIs available today.&nbsp; Also, some anti-malware products have not updated, and application providers do not know what anti-malware you are
 running, so the "safe" statement from them is to "disable" real-time protection.<br />
<br />
However, if you feel you must suspend MSE, open MSE, go to the Settings tab, select Real-Time Protection, and uncheck "Turn On Real-Time Protection".<br />
<br />
Just remember to turn it back on.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this happens, you need to verify you're a human being and not a spambot by entering random characters displayed on screen in your browser.&nbsp; Apparently, the phone's browser is incapable of displaying this properly.&nbsp; Just click the link on a PC instead,
 and enter the characters from there.&nbsp; Once you've done this once, you shouldn't have to do it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, why are you using the browser to send email on your phone instead of the email client?</p>

</p><p>If you always want to work with a cell in A1, you can keep the cell reference from changing as you drag/copy/fill the formula by making it absolute or part absolute &amp; part relative:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example, you always want to reference cell A1 specifically and not another cell as you fill the formula, then:</p>
<p>=RIGHT($A$1,8)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you want to always reference the cell in column A but let the row number change as you copy it down the sheet, then</p>
<p>=RIGHT($A1,8)</p>
<p>would do it.</p>

<h2>            Uninstalling Window Preview</h2>
                    <p>I am needing some advice cause I am wanting to uninstall the insider preview. I have come to find out my system&nbsp; image and my windows backs for my system will not work so I can not go back to window 8.1 and then install window 10. I truly need some help
 in completing this task because the recoveries as I know them just keep failing can anyone tell me how too go back to my system recovering so I can do a clean install. It is like my cd rom doesn't work outside of window etc .</p>
<p>Thanks so much&nbsp;</p>

So what you are telling me I can install Window 10 Home overtop of Window 10 Insider Preview and that will not cause an issue and will&nbsp; get rid of the Windows 10 Insider Preview ?? I have already made the ISO disc and it is ready to pop into the cd rom drive
 I am just a little nervous about doing this so confirmation please and thank you&nbsp;

<p>You can also do it by clicking on the ISO in File Explorer and on Setup.&nbsp; When asked Keep nothing. This should clean otu the System (C:) drive.<br />
Before doing the Clean install if you have not cleaned out the Download Folder make a copy to another drive or USB drive then after the Clean install use the copy to install your programs rather than wandering all over the Internet and re downloading them.

            <p>I think you needed to be on 10162 (prior to 29 July) at the time 10240 (final) came out to get the upgrade to 10240. You could have downloaded&nbsp;10162&nbsp;as an ISO to create a DVD but I would imagine the download location has been removed now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try the official download of the RTM release and do an update, but I don't know if it will work.</p>

            <p>If your Build 10041 Pro&nbsp;is activated, it should also upgrade to activated Build 10240 by Windows Update or by running setup.exe from the official Windows 10 Pro ISO.&nbsp; If you have Insider Preview Home version, you have to use the correct ISO to match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do run setup.exe to upgrade, choose to keep Windows settings and do not enter any product key during or after the upgrade, or Windows 10 build 10240 will not auto-activate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's simple.</p>
<p>All you have to do is:</p>
<p>From MENU goto SETTINGS, When there scroll down and select 'Restore Factory Setting'.</p>
<p>There are two options in there:</p>
<p>"Restore Settings only"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"Restore all"</p>
<p>Select "Restore All"</p>
<p>When done the phone will delete every thing on the Phone memory(C:\)(contacts,picture,messages etc)</p>
<p>and also restore phone to its original settings and will restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This proceedure is mostly common on S40 phone.</p>
<p>Hope this explain and solve the problem. :)</p>

<p>Put 1 in the first cell.</p>
<p>Then right click on the small fill handle in the right lower corner of the cell and drag the mouse over the cells that you want to fill.</p>
<p>When you release the mouse button you will get a popup menu where you can select Fill Series.</p>
<p>Hope this helps / Lars-Åke</p>

    <title>Motorola Q Synched__Now it Doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gjpundsack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Motorola Q Synched__Now it Doesn&#39;t</h2>
                    
<p>Everything has worked fine to sync my Motorola Q phone with my&nbsp;laptop running Windows Vista...until last week. Now the contacts, notes and tasks I enter on the phone or the laptop no longer sync with the other device.&nbsp;
 They recognize each other on connection and the laptop and phone both show that they are synchronizing, but it never does. What could possibly be wrong?</p>

<p>I'm not sure why the issue exists gjpundsack.&nbsp; If there were no issues flagged with Office Diagnostics adn you tried what Linley suggested, I would have expected it to sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it were mine, I might consider backing up my device then performing a hard reset.&nbsp; Often times it is the quickest way to resolution....</p>

            I have EXACTLY the same problem!!! Wlan is working perfectly but using given on the internet recepies(which work for others owners of e51) i can not establish voip connection at all.<br />
Problem can be the setup of public networks which i try to connect to: for example maybe port 5060 udp is blocked ( i need it in voipcheap.com).I try to negotiate with administartors to open it.After that i tell you what is going on...<br />
<br />
P.S. Is posssible such situation when wlan is working well but voip functionality of cell phone is corrupted (from hardware point of view-not setup of software)?<br />

            In the begining I had the same problem with my wifi router, I have a siemens gigaset SE361, I just could not connect, or would<br />
connect after a long delay. Finnaly I fall onto to vyke.com a voip provider that sends you a setup script when you register,<br />
which make the connection work like a charm. Unfortunately at<br />
some point I decided to upgrade the firmware of the wifi router and since then I cannot connect anymore. Note that from other wifi networks it works with no problem, so the problem is on the<br />
local configuration of my wifi router, however did not manage to<br />
find yet what is the problem.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Ok, I just managed to correct it. Apparently in my case it was a problem of the Native Address Translation, a protocol that allows<br />
many local clients to connect behind a single access point, using only a single IP address, which can create problems for a number of applications among which voip (more on NAT at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/support/upnp01.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/support/upnp01.mspx</a>)<br />
<br />
Anyway what I did to solve the problem was to setup my wifi router to directly detect and manage UDP connections over the 5060 port (this is what my voip provider uses, and I think most of the voip providers) through the port triggering interface of the device.
 The settings I put were<br />
Local Protocol : UDP<br />
Local Port : 5060<br />
Public Protocol : UDP<br />
Public Port : 5060<br />
<br />
Quoting the manual on port trigerring:<br />
<br />
"Port Triggering<br />
<br />
Special applications on clients in your local network can also use the Internet connection on your device with the assistance of Port Triggering. These applications would normally otherwise require direct access to the Internet. Triggered by data that a client
 sends to the Internet, certain incoming traffic from the Internet can also be permitted over the Internet connection on your device and forwarded automatically to the correct client. Information on which protocols and ports can be used by your application
 for transferring data can be found in the appropriate documentation."

            ALKAL: this is not real solution for users e51.It looks like only one way to use voip is to change setup of any wifi network in town!It is impossible.I can not convince my admin in my own work to check and open port udp 5060 so how you want to use voip
 in town?<br />

            It is true that the voip setup could be a little bit???<br />
more user friendly, not requiring to setup all these parameters<br />
on servers, proxies, ports etc etc... Is Nokia listening?

            Hi alkal,<br />
<br />
Iam also supporting your views.<br />
It should not be complicated for Normal user.<br />
We can change Router settings only our Own Wi Fi.<br />
But Opened or Public Networks, how we will change.<br />
<br />
Nokia should consider this and upon Automatic detection<br />
of Lan Networks, it should work Sipps correctly as inNormal Pcs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your Post..

<p>Hi Drew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error will occur if you are using a third-party <span>utility or an antivirus program interferes with the installation of Windows OS or a Wi-Fi Protected Access
</span><span>requires is manually modified. For us to better isolate the issue, we would like to know the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>When did the issue first occur?</span></li><li><span>What is the Office application that installed on your device?</span></li><li><span>Are you getting the same issue when trying to access other Office applications?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any recent changes before you get the error?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we would suggest that you check the programs installed on your device through your Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Hidden email in outbox continues to send</h2>
                    <p><span>Another problem with Outlook has occurred.&nbsp; When a new email is generated and is sent, the program goes into an endless
 ‘send/receive’ mode always indicating it is sending one additional message more than is indicated in the Outbox.&nbsp; Ultimately, the only way to send the new messages is to completely reboot the computer and opening Outlook, then is sends the messages, but to
 try another new message results in the same problem. </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Just closing Outlook doesn’t do it, in fact, if I close Outlook it will not open again without rebooting &nbsp;computer.&nbsp; The
 other thing that has been noticed since this problem occurred is that a warning that there is a high CPU usage occurring in Outlook…something that has not been indicated before.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I went on the help site and found the question has occurred to other users, and the site recommends using MFCMAPI program
 to rid the problem.&nbsp; I can open the file, but going through step ‘2’ I get the following message:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Error: Store does not support the IExchangeManageStore interface</span></p>

<p><span>Can anyone offer suggestions to fix problem?</span></p>

</p><p>Logged into office portal, navigated to team sharepoint site and clicked on sync icon. OneDrive for Business reports that it not syncing any libraries, however an empty SharePoint folder exists with the company name and a red X over the icon. This folder
 cannot be deleted. OneDrive for Business app can't repair, manually sync&nbsp;or stop sync because it does not recognize as syncing a library. A sync error exists indicating that it having a problem syncing this folder and I should try to manually sync, but can't
 because the button is grayed out as OneDrive for Business seems sort of stuck in initial set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using 64-bit Windows 10, 32-bit Office 365. I am able to sync my personal files using OneDrive (white cloud icon)&nbsp;and corporate OneDrive files using the newer 2016 OneDrive (blue cloud icon build 2016 - 17.3.6720.1207), but sharepoint is looking to sync

            <p>Hi JohnBajkowski,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try to unsintall your OneDrive for Business application? Then download the next generation preview build for OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download and install the preview build, follow the procedure on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-syncing-SharePoint-sites-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-Preview-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once installation is successful, the screenshot below should be the same as your OneDrive for Business application when you click on the blue cloud icon.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ff1ca39-e623-436f-82c8-2b5878d6b225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ff1ca39-e623-436f-82c8-2b5878d6b225" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, can you send a screenshot of the error? As well as the steps you did on how you encounter it.</p>

</p><p>Quick question, how does one uninstall the OneDrive for Business app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see it listed in the programs and features segment within the control panel, unless the name is somewhat different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to uninstall the Onedrive App, but not the Onedrive for Business app which is GROOVE.exe in the \Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\GROOVE.exe.</p>

            <p>Hi John Bajkowski,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you try updating your Office applications to the latest version and then check the outcome? To update, open Word/Excel then go to File &gt; Account, then click on update now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try clearing the cache of your OneDrive for Business using the Easy Fix Tool. Follow the procedures on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> to download and run the tool. Try resyncing all your libraries and then share with us the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, provide a screenshot of the error you encountered on the View Sync Problems, for us to verify if there are filenames that are invalid, making the application unable to sync. You can
 check the restriction and limitations on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>1) Checked the office update&nbsp; and it reported my version of Office was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I applied the OneDrive for Business Easy Fix Tool to clear out the cache. Restarted the computer and the sync error went away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only syncing my folders now using the preview sync tool that unifies the SharePoint and OneDrive for Business folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help in resolving my sync error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
