    <title>How do I login without a password&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epic_geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I login without a password&#63;</h2>
                    In windows 7 I have a computer named Hal. Hal has an account named Dave which has the password Daisy.<br />
<br />
On Hal I share a folder, In the sharing options I allow "Everyone" read/write access. Dave remains Owner and is unchangeable.
<br />
<br />
On another machine I try to access Hal, it requests credentials to access the share. I already stated that I want Everyone to be allowed without a password, but it still will not let me access the share when I type "Everyone" as the username. It will only let
 me access the share if I use Dave/Daisy but this is a problem as I would then have to disclose my personal password to everyone.
<br />
<br />
That is issue number one, issue number two: <br />
<br />
I have remote desktop setup to access PC2 from PC1, PC2 has a username and password Dave, and Daisy<br />
I can access remote desktop this way but I decide I would rather just be able to login to remote desktop without the use of a password. I disable Dave's password and try to login but it tells me that I cannot login with blank passwords " Login failure: User
 account restriction. Possible reasons are blank passwords not allowed, logon hour restrictions or a policy restriction has been enforced."<br />
<br />
Why are these annoyances in place and how do I disable them so that I do not require a password for the simple act of sharing folders and logging in via remote desktop?

<br />
That's correct. "Everyone" is not a user account; it is a local <br />
security group to which all user accounts belong.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; It will only let me access the share if I use Dave/Daisy but this is a <br />
&gt; problem as I would then have to disclose my personal password to everyone.<br />
&gt; <br />
<br />
You need to create other local user accounts and grant those account <br />
access to the target share. These accounts will need to have the same <br />
name/password as those used by the other people on their computers. <br />
(I'm assuming you have a workgroup vs. a domain, but you haven't said, <br />
and it makes a great deal of difference.)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It's not an "annoyance;" it's a basic security precaution. You can't <br />
disable it.<br />

Are you sure you are microsoft support? <br />
Surly you must know what I have just discovered on my own. In Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Network and Sharing Center\Advanced sharing settings there is a simple radio button "Turn Off Password Protected Sharing" I do not need to create a new account
 on each machine I need to turn off password protected sharing. <br />
<br />
Why is it I continue to find the real answer when Microsoft Support reps cannot give me the straight answer?
<br />
<br />
Also, an annoyance is determined by perspective and point of view "It's not an "annoyance;" it's a basic security precaution. You can't
<br />
disable it" and so I say, it is an annoyance and I will find a way to disable it just as I found a way to disable password protected sharing.
<br />
<br />
You guys seriously! I should be working in your place for Microsoft :O <br />

<h2>            Windows Updates downloads 14 GB and fills drive</h2>
                    <p>I had 13.4 GB free on my system drive, but Windows updates continue to fill up my C drive. I'm careful to add new files and programs to a D drive. I had to download a special 1607&nbsp;anniversary update file to an external drive to install it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I woke up to my C drive being full again.&nbsp; I went to C:\Users\{myusername}\AppData\Local\Temp\ which and found 2,276 folders with time stamps over 4 hours yesterday and started downloading more today.&nbsp; It finally stopped with
<strong>13.7 GB (14.0 on disk) -- 254,3231 files in 4,488 folders</strong>!&nbsp;&nbsp; Has Microsoft completely forgotten that customers have small laptops? My Acer Aspire SW3-013 has a 32 GB SSD and updated fine until recently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Microsoft Updates catalog <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com</a> and search for <em>Windows 10 1607</em> and found nothing new.&nbsp; I have KB3216755 installed - again after deleting the temp folders and manually downloading the update to another drive to run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: With a <em>32-bit </em>operating system on a <em>64-bit</em> processor, I installed the standard KB3216755 update - should I have installed the one for
<em>x64-based Systems</em> ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We strongly recommend using 64-bit operating system on a 64-bit processor for an optimal performance. We also suggest upgrading your hard drive. SSD is good and fast, but it has low storage. Kindly upgrade to 120 GB storage so that you won't be encountering
 this issue again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post if you have more concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>I can't expand it - I would need a new laptop. My laptop has RAM 2gb&nbsp; SSD 32gb&nbsp; It originally had Win8 and upgraded to 10 and ran surprisingly well -- until the anniversary update.
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>In a FAQ it said <em>Windows 10 uses approximately 10 GBs of disk space.</em><br />
<em>Windows 10 can upgrade such systems with as little as 8.5 GB of free space.&nbsp; </em>
This is misleading. Win10 it has gotten bigger and updates seem to need a lot more space (and no option for moving download location). I had 14 gb free space when something (assume Win10 update) filled it up and notified me I was out of space. In the list of
 updates for Win10 version 1607 I cannot even find an update that applies to this system...</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done so far:</p>
<p>I run Ccleaner and Windows Disk Cleaner (cleanmgr) regularly. I set settings to store&nbsp; personal files on an external SD-card. I've disabled Hibernate and indexing of C drive. I reduced the paging file. I uninstalled a few programs that were stored in C.
 I have found www.catalog.update.microsoft.com so maybe I can keep going by manually updating.<strong>

            <p>The solution was the one thing left to try. From my downloads I noticed the update
<strong>KB3216755</strong> had <strong>x64 </strong>in the name so I uninstalled it and installed KB3216755 with no descriptor (x86 in the name). After rebooting I ran "check for updates" and everything looks good - until next time (<em>March Update Tue. March
 14)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for taking the time to keep me checking things.&nbsp; I had asked in several forums which update I should download for my 64-bit processor with 32-bit Windows 10 -- the one that says "<em>x64-based Systems</em>" or the one that doesn't. x64 normally
 refers to the processor, but in the Update Catalog it might not. An answer would have been great to save us time. So would the catalog listing "64-based operating systems".</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am working with an end user to resolve an issue with an icon that appears in the hidden tray. The icon appears
 when the the application is launched and for some reason, when the end user is running automated tests, the icon will begin to morph into multiple icons which impacts the tests. If you connect to the PC, you can hover over the multiple icons which will force
 them to disappear but this is far from being an ideal workaround.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I've attempted to resolve this issue by going into Settings/Personalization/Taskbar/ but most of the options apply
 only to icons that appear on the taskbar and not within the hidden icons section. I can drag/drop the icon directly onto the taskbar from the hidden icons section but when I go back to the "Select which icons appear on the taskbar" section, it reappears back
 within the hidden icons section.</span><br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Over Heat When Sleeping &#38; Charging</h2>
                    I have an i7 256 GB Surface Pro 4 and have the latest updates as of 7/19/2016. Every time I put my surface to sleep while it is charging, the fans get very loud and the back of the device gets very hot. This only happens when charging. Is there any fix
 for this?

            Thank you&nbsp;for replying. I have already checked that my Surface Pro 4 has the latest Windows Updates as stated above in the content of my question. This does not solve the issue since I have the latest updates already.

            <p>My Surface Pro 4 has gotten very hot mainly in 1 spot(guessing that where the battery is) when charging. i have unplugged and it's still HOT till the battery runs out and the screen blanks off like its dead.
</p>
<p>Once the battery runs down, it comes back on after charging it does fine with no issues.I'm not seeing anything on complaints like this. Unit has done it 2-3 times already and is about 2 months old.</p>
<p>Have to say for $1700.00 not impressed on that &nbsp;</p>
<p>but like the devise overall .</p>

                    I can't log in in to my laptop because of this problem. I tried following every single solution like going to Safe Mode and going to the old version of windows. But still have the same result. I'm also not able to connect to the internet, even my WiFi
 was beside my laptop. I a lso try using an Ethernet cable but still have the same result.

<h3> serville  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Connectify Miniport in Win7 Home Premium x64</h2>
                    Hi , <br />
I installed Connectify several months ago, and uninstalled it.<br />
I didnt remember whether the uninstallation was successful, but I just notice today that there is still "Connectify Miniport #6"&nbsp; under Network Adapter in Device Manager.<br />
I've tried to uninstall it, but it wasn't succesful.<br />
When I choose Uninstall,&nbsp; nothing happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is still there unchanged.<br />
I've tried in safe mode....same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's still sitting there laughing at my useless attempt without giving me any error message.<br />
When I click "Driver detail"&nbsp; , Windows says "No driver files are required or has been loaded for this device".<br />
Even if it doesn't load anything,&nbsp; how can I remove this useless entry from showing up in Device Manager ?<br />
Please help.&nbsp; Thanks<br />

            Solved finally.<br />
I tried to reinstall &amp; uninstall Connectify, but the problematic Connectify Miniport seems untouched by the uninstall process.<br />
Someone suggested me to find the word "Connectify" with regedit &amp; delete all references with Connectify.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found many.&nbsp;&nbsp; After reboot, the miniport has really&nbsp; gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I'm so happy I finally deleted this parasite port that has been plugging on my Device Manager for months.&nbsp;
<br />
THank you <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to remove all the external devices from your computer and check the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the below methods and check the issue:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Test the issue in Safe Mode
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let’s boot from the Windows 8 DVD and login in Safe Mode</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Boot from Windows 8 DVD.</span>
</li><li>
<span>After you see a Choose an Option, click on
<b>‘Troubleshoot’.</b></span>
</li><li>
<span>Now click on<b> ‘Advanced Options’
</b>and then on <b>‘Windows Startup Settings’.</b></span>
</li><li>
<span>Use your arrow keys to go to ‘<b>Safe Mode’
</b>and hit enter.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persists in safe mode then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps
 in eliminating software conflicts. </span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Perform clean boot and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the
<b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click
<b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the <b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one startup item is selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the latest graphic card and motherboard chipset drivers and check if that fixes the issue. Visit the manufacturer’s website
 and install the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the above information helps you.</span></p>

    <title>Activate Windows Error Message after latest Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tandemtandem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Windows Error Message after latest Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p><span>My problem was previously addressed but the post does not reflect whether the suggested solution worked??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now have an Activate Windows notification that will not go away.&nbsp; When I try to&nbsp;Activate I get the error code below
 which tells me to contact my System Administrator!!&nbsp; I do have a valid Windows&nbsp; Product Code on the Notebook and this system was upgraded to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>So, is the answer just to Change Product Key and just reenter the Product Key??&nbsp;&nbsp; The Product Key number on error message is NOT my product key number??&nbsp; So maybe the system did somehow get the
 wrong Product Key??</span></p>
<p><span>Appreciate guidance.&nbsp; I am only mildly "techie" and I don't want to make my problem worse by changing the Product Key if that is the wrong thing to do!!</span></p>
<p><span>Also am getting a notification that says ..."Your Outlook settings are out of date." ??? I don't even use Outlook.&nbsp; Any suggestions on what to do to fix that?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>First, thank you for your prompt reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the date and time on my tablet are correct.</p>
<p>Windows Defender is the only antivirus on the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I ran the activation troubleshooter and it just came back and said that I needed to contact my system administrator!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did connect with the chat, but they wanted to take control of my computer and I am just reluctant to do that. &nbsp;Is it safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I saw your response and I knew that I had my Product Key ... and the Product Key template that comes up when I am on the activation page shows *****-*****-*****-*****-QRYS1 &nbsp;and I know that those are NOT my last 5 characters of my product code ... I
 just thought that maybe I could do exactly what you suggested and just "change" the product key code? &nbsp;I just didn't know what the potential negative impacts could result from this, if ANY? &nbsp;There was no positive or successful response ... "solved my problem"
 ... on the previous post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, by the way, I was able to resolve the Outlook problem. &nbsp;I rarely use my Microsoft account. &nbsp;So, on the tablet, since Outlook had updated along with Microsoft Edge and the rest of the software platform, the system just wanted me to rekey in my password,
 etc. and now I am not getting the Outlook error notification. &nbsp;But the "general" Windows Activation error is still there. &nbsp;And yet, the computer is still working and successfully doing upgrades, etc. &nbsp;I just can't seem to make the Notification disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your comments would be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Problems opening Ubuntu via Wubi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itskieran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems opening Ubuntu via Wubi</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows XP, inside BOOTMGR (I don't know why it isn't NTLDR, the PC just came like that), and have installed Wubi, a way of side-loading Ubuntu (a popular Linux Distro) with Windows, without having to repartition the disk. When I boot
 up, BOOTMGR (Windows Boot Manager) still shows only Windows and System Restore, same as it did before, and times out after 5 secs.</p>
<p>What my question is, is how do I get Ubuntu to show in that list?</p>
<p>I have asked on the "Ask Ubuntu" StackExchange site and they directed me here as they couldn't find the root cause of the problem, and believed that Microsoft themselves would know more about the Windows bootloaders than them.</p>

            I would really like to run using the Wubi installer, if possible, instead of re-partitoning C:
<div><br />
<div>Wubi works as a Virtual Disk inside C: (hence the reference to C:\wubildr in the boot.ini), so that you don't have to repartition your HDD. It is, unfortunately, sensitive to hard shutdowns, and has the unfortunate problem that if you lose your C: drive,
 you will lose Ubuntu, but it is really designed for testing out without a Live CD or VM. I believe this is mentioned in the Wubi wikipage you linked to in your original reply.</div>

    <title>Erratic video playback. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jredmiles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Erratic video playback.</h2>
                    When I play videos from Youtube or various news web sites I notice that the picture will seize up momentarily while the sound continues.&nbsp; Then the picture will jump ahead to match the sound track.&nbsp; I can go to another computer and play the same video without
 this happening.&nbsp; Have tried updating the driver for the audio card but this did not help.&nbsp; Both the machine that has the problem and the one that works fine are running Vista.&nbsp; I just applied service pack 2 to the problem machine and this did not make a difference.&nbsp;
 Would appreciate any suggestions.&nbsp; The machine with the problem is an HP Pavillion Entertainment PC.<br />
<br />
The problem is confined to web based video.&nbsp; I can play prerecorded DVDs just fine.<br />
<br />
Also, it does not seem to be a bandwidth problem.&nbsp; The bar indicating download progress stays well ahead of the marker that indicates playback position.

            Hi JRedmiles,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!<br />
<p>You may have an old version of flash player so I'd suggest you to uninstall the older version&nbsp;and&nbsp;install the latest version and play it via Internet Explorer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Possible solution :</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
For Windows Vista users: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the Flash uninstall / reinstall does not work this maybe due to a Microsoft Windows Vista permissions issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please use the Windows button at the bottom left then the search function:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Go to: C:\Windows\System32\Macromed\Flash\. <br />
2) Right-click on the following file: FlashUtil9b.exe or FlashUtil9e.exe. <br />
3) Select "Run as Administrator" and install the update.. <br />
4) Restart your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may also want to reset Internet Explorer to default settings.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the link to reset Internet Explorer 7 : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Reset-Internet-Explorer-7-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Reset-Internet-Explorer-7-settings</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the link to reset Internet Explorer 8 : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Reset-Internet-Explorer-8-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Hope this information helped!<br />

    <title>Is it possible for Google earth to corrupt my user profile, and can I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shoepuppy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible for Google earth to corrupt my user profile, and can I do anything about it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Win7 and MSE. Also Firefox 6, Chrome 13, and IE 9.</p>

<p>(I use all three browsers regularly for different purposes.)</p>

<p>I have several user accounts. In two of them, I had occasion to open Google earth.</p>

<p>I noticed today, that when I closed Google earth, the orange calendar gadget had gone blank again. It was working when I opened Google earth. I know this because, having repaired
 the calendar recently, I watch it really close. </p>

<p>(It responded to the “repair user profile” link.)</p>

<p>Also, the first time it failed was in the time period when I first started using Google earth on this computer,
</p>
<p>though I do not have precise records.
</p>

<p>(I will have from now on, as they can be invaluable.)
</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>So after logging off and then back on, the gadget works again. I went to check my other profiles, especially the one where I used Google earth the
 other day. </p>

<p>It had gone blank, and continues to be blank. The other accounts where I had not used Google earth were not affected.
</p>

<p>I have all my records from the last repair, about ten different procedures, all of which seem to work for some individuals in differing situations, and I am going to do something
 about the corrupted account, or whatever it turns out to be this time, before school starts again on the 26. (Maybe I am obsessive?)</p>

<p>So I want to know if Google earth could cause this kind of corruption. Maybe I should dump it, and download a new copy, or could it have just been an unfortunate coincidence?
 Or maybe I&nbsp;will find a better replacement.</p>

<p>Thanxs, Shoepuppy</p>

    <title>BSOD Driver Power State Failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD Driver Power State Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just recently got a new laptop and the only problem I've encountered with it is a Driver Power State Failure BSOD when running certain applications. In particular, graphics intensive applications like games consistently cause this problem although it also
 occurs when doing things like generating plots in MATLAB. I suspect that the cause is with the installed NVIDIA graphics card and its drivers but I don't have any experience interpreting dmp files, so I thought I'd get some advice here. Specs and dmp files
 below.</p>

<p><span>Hi Harvdoc,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is your monitor a dual monitor?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you install Windows on a computer that is using an unsupported video adapter, Windows Setup installs a standard VGA
 mode driver. However, after you install Windows, you may be able to obtain and install a Windows-compatible driver for your video adapter from an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing updated driver for your device, if you face issues like system using VGA drivers to display, you may
 disable it from System Configuration.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open System Configuration by clicking on Start, type msconfig.exe and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Boot tab, you will find Base vide, disable it and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Base video</span></strong><span>. On startup, opens
 the Windows graphical user interface in minimal VGA mode. This loads standard VGA drivers instead of display drivers specific to the video hardware on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>For reference see the link below,</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Jigsaw on Windows 10 Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rolanddcat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw on Windows 10 Problems</h2>
                    <p>Beginning in the middle of February 2018, Microsoft Jigsaw often freezes while loading and I have to close the window by clicking the "x". My points usually don't show and instead displays the whirling "loading" icon where the points should show. The few
 times I am able to play one of the collection puzzles, the points don't show in the total and the screen freezes (again having to click the "x" to close). Daily challenges seldom load (about one in ten times) and it is "hit or miss" whether past days are shown
 as completed or not. I have played Microsoft Jigsaw without problems for the last few years and this problem has just begun in the last week or so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to the cause and/or possible fixes? Don't want to loose my accumulated score or history if at all possible. What happens if I reload the game? What happens if I uninstall and then reload the game? As mentioned, I don't want to loose my
 history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This solved one problem and created another. I un-installed Jigsaw and then re-installed from the MS Store. Now Jigsaw works great except all the HISTORY IS GONE. My downloaded puzzles are all gone and my points are now negative (I had over one million before
 and all the puzzles to date)! I am logged into my account but the history didn't follow. Solution is as bad as the problem so I don't recommend anyone else do this unless you want your history and saved puzzles to vanish.

<p>Update... it took some time but my points history finally returned but the saved puzzles are still missing. I'll give it more time but it is beginning to look like I will have to download all of the puzzles again... and play them all again... that sucks!</p>

<p>I've deleted and reloaded MS Jigsaw a number of times. The points and completed games eventually show up but cannot play any new puzzles and the screen locks up before a new game show up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there is a serious flaw in this program. I've given up trying to play jigsaw as it isn't worth the trouble of trying to figure out what the problem is. Maybe it just gets stupid after you hit a million points?</p>

<p>Thanks for the input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a million points, but I agree it's a&nbsp; serious flaw.&nbsp; It seems that it began near the time that I downloaded a new version of Windows, coupled with logging in at different locations in Asia and then different places in the US.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Microsoft doesn't appear worried, but then it is just a casual game.<br />

<p>No. All Microsoft jigsaw puzzles I have finished or currently working on are under see all collections.</p>
<p>When they are called up they downloaded but are not. Click on one the puzzles and it says download.</p>
<p>When you click on download it says it is downloading but nothing happens.</p>

            I cleared my cache and removed and reloaded the game.&nbsp;A few days later all my previously removed collections were again available for download with no charge and all of them included the 'grand master' puzzles.&nbsp; My points were updated to include all the
 daily puzzles that I'd don't though at the time of completion, no points were visible.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
All seemed to turn out fine and everything seems to be working now....ALSO, now I have more than a million, too.

<h2>            A Guide to Using Windows Search&#59; Two Alternatives to Windows Search</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p>Technical Level: Basic &amp; Intermediate </p>
<p>Applies to: Windows 7, all Editions; Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>This guide explains how to use Windows Search and then introduces two useful alternatives.</p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 240, 1)"><span>
<p><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 240, 1)">1</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Using Windows 7 Search</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Many people regard Windows search as unreliable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They say that even without any known problems in <em>indexing</em> it can fail to find what it is supposed to and that it can be useless one minute &amp; well-behaved the next.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are many threads in this forum about search problems.<span>&nbsp; </span>
For all but the very simplest of searches, I avoid possible confusion by using the NirSoft utility
<em>SearchMyFiles</em> instead [see section 2 below].<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 7 searching relies on the <em>Indexing
</em>function, which can be found in the <em>Control panel</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If there is a problem with indexing then searching will be unsatisfactory.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It does take Windows quite some time to settle down enough to complete its index in new or updated systems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are many threads in this forum about indexing problems.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 240, 1)">1.1</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Simple searching in the <em>Start menu search box</em></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you are looking for an application or utility that appears in the
<em>Start menu</em>, <em>All programs</em><span> list</span> then search for it by entering part of its name or common abbreviation in the
<em>Start menu search box</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>You can also use the <em>Start menu search box</em> to search for other files if you really want to.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Set this up by right-clicking on the <em>Start menu</em>, selecting <em>Properties</em>, then selecting
<em>Customise</em>, scrolling to near the bottom of the list &amp; setting <em>Search other files &amp; libraries
</em>to either <em>Search with public folders </em>or <em>Search without public folders</em>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will only search indexed locations - generally, this means all folders within the
<em>Windows explorer</em>, <em>Libraries</em> area.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><em>Start menu search box
</em></span><span>searches exclude network locations because they exclude all non-indexed locations.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, for Windows 7 Professional Ultimate &amp; Enterprise Editions,
<em>Start menu search box </em>searching can be extended to include network locations see
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2268596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The
<em>Search programs and files</em> box on the Start menu does not search files on network locations that are not indexed in Windows 7</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><em>Start menu search box</em></span><span> searching is not as flexible as searching with
<em>Windows explorer</em> so it is not referred to again in this article.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 240, 1)">1.2</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Simple searching with Windows explorer</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you are looking for a file or folder, open Windows explorer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Select the folder that you want to search in by clicking on it in the left-hand [<em>Navigation</em>] pane or by opening it in the right-hand pane.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click in the search box in the upper right corner of the window &amp; enter the search word or words.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No special syntax is required - just put in any words you want to search for.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The search results will be displayed in the right-hand pane.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>To avoid confusing results from your searches, check your search settings at<span>&nbsp;
</span><em>Windows explorer</em>, <em>Organize</em>, <em>Folders &amp; search options</em>,
<em>Search</em> tab.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure that you have set the checkboxes for
<em>Find partial matches</em> &amp; for <em>Use natural language search</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span>When you complete a search &amp; want to do a new one or just realize you have mistyped a search &amp; want to start again, clear the decks by clicking on the x at the right-hand end of the search box.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>The search box can get really awkward if you try to edit anything that’s already in it so starting again can often the easiest thing to do - click in the search box then press your keyboard’s
<em>Escape</em> key twice to clear its current contents.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span>Windows only looks for the search terms at the start of words.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will not find the search term if it only appears later in a word.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, if you enter <em>bert</em> in the search box then it will find
<em>Bert </em><span>&amp;<em> Bertie</em></span> but not <em>Albert </em><span>or <em>
Ethelbert</em></span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, if you enter <em>*bert</em> in the search box then it will find
<em>Bert</em>, <em>Bertie</em>, <em>Albert </em><span>&amp;<em> Ethelbert</em></span>.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span>These examples also illustrate the fact that simple searching is not constrained by capitals / lower case letters.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Searches will also list folder names &amp; all the files within those folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So a search for <em>bert</em> might list the folder called <em>test bert names</em> and every file within that folder i.e.
<em>Bert,</em><span> <em>Bertie</em></span><em>,</em> <em>Albert </em><span>&amp; <em>
Ethelbert</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This can be a bit confusing and can make you think that you don’t understand Windows Search or that Windows Search is not working correctly.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can search for all .jpg format files, just for example, by entering
<em>jpg</em> as your search term.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Windows can have difficulty with common keywords being used in searches &amp; can behave inconsistently.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This behavior is a by-product of having the <em>Use natural language search</em> selected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you want to search for <em>search </em><span>or for<em> kind</em></span>, for example, don’t - search for
<em>"search"</em> or “kind” instead.<span>&nbsp; </span>Similarly, if you want to search for
<em>(1)</em>, search for <em>“(1)”</em> instead.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Separate words in the search term are searched for independently.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, a search for <em>advanced "search"</em> will find <em>Search syntax.xlsx</em>,
<em>Advanced Query Syntax.mht</em> &amp; <em>Windows 7 (advanced) search pane.mht</em>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, I have seen inconsistent behavior with multiple search words so I only use one word as my search term unless I use the methods explained in section 1.6 [Advanced searching, para 5] below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<em>indexing options</em> &amp; at <em>Improve Windows searches using the index</em>].<span>&nbsp;

</span>So, just as an example of this, I can search an individual shared drive or I can search the network location
<em>DellXP</em> thereby including all its shared folders &amp; drives within a single search.<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There is also a method of searching that is similar to using Windows explorer but is not restricted to any particular folders that you select.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Instead it includes all indexed locations on the system - by default, this includes all folders that are in your Libraries.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you really have no idea where you might have put a particular file then it is not inconceivable that this method might come in handy.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Start it by pressing the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows key</span> &amp; the F key [not the Ctrl-F combination that you might be used to using within many applications].<span>&nbsp;
</span>A search window opens that looks like a blank view of Windows explorer &amp; you can click in its search box to use it in pretty much the same way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You will be offered other built-in search filters with this method but those filters can change when you start typing in the search box.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Some guidance on using Windows key F searching is available in Windows Help at
</span></span><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Find a file or folder</span></em><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The search results will normally be presented using the same view as the folder you started the search in.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this is not useful you can change it using the <em>Change your view</em> control in the upper right of the
<em>Windows explorer </em>window.<span>&nbsp; </span>Choose the <em>Details </em>view if you want to see specific information about the files in the search results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then right-click in any column header &amp; select any additional columns you want [either from the list presented or from the
<em>More... </em>entry].</span><span> <span><span>&nbsp;</span>These selections will be used when you run another search in the same type of folder [folder types are General items, Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos - see Windows Help at
<em><span>folder type</span></em> &amp; at <em><span>Change folder options</span></em>].</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can sort search results by any of the columns in those results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Displaying the column <em>Folder path</em> to your results list can be particularly useful as it will allow you to sort the results by their paths and this can often help you to make sense of searches when there are lots of sub-folders involved.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can right-click on any entry in the results &amp; select
<em>Open file location </em>to see that file &amp; the other files that are in the same folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In addition, if you want to get ready for any later work you intend to do in that folder, you can right-click on the folder name &amp; select
<em>Open in new window</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can return to the search results by clicking on the
<em>Back</em> button in the top-left corner of the original <em>Windows explorer </em>
window.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You might want to save some or all of the list of files presented in the search results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To do this, select the files concerned then press &amp; hold the <em>Shift </em>
key as you right-click.<span>&nbsp; </span>Release the <em>Shift </em>key &amp; select <em>
Copy as path</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then open <em>Notepad</em><span> or any other text editor</span>,
<em>Paste</em> then <em>Save</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This preserves a list of the file names [and their paths] returned using that particular search on that particular occasion.<span>&nbsp;
</span><em>Copy as path</em> cannot do any more than this.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You will be taken to C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Searches where you will be able to choose a name for the search.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You do not see the search definition when you run the saved search later so you need to give the search a fully descriptive name that includes the search terms used and the folder that it searches.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>You will see that you are now in the C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Searches folder rather than your original folder and your search results are still being shown.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The search name you have chosen is presented as if it &amp; its results were in sub-folders of C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Searches but this is merely a means of presentation - the files in the results have not been moved at all.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span>What you have saved is a search definition not a set of search results.<span>&nbsp;

</span>If you want to delete the search definition later on then you can do so safely as all you are doing is deleting a search definition not the search results files themselves.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you do this, make sure you select the search definition in C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Searches rather than any of its results.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<em>Favorites</em> entry [it has nothing to do with IE <em>Favorites</em>].<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>3<span>&nbsp; </span>You can also use the constraint
