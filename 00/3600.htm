<h2>            Excel 2008 always shows &#34;Read Only&#34; after upgrade to OS X ver. 10.7.2</h2>
                    Using Excel 2008 for Mac. &nbsp;Upgraded to OS X version 10.7.2. &nbsp;Now every time a start a new Excel file, save it and when I go to reopen it a dialog box says it is being modified by another user and to select Read Only or Notify. &nbsp;No matter which I select,
 I get in a loop and cannot save it. &nbsp;I am NOT on a network, and I am the only user of this computer in my home. &nbsp;Thanks

            Had that problem just today. I actually upgraded to Lion about month ago. But today, I started naming some Excel 2008 files with a "/" in the file name such as "10/2011_payments" and I received the message. After trying some things, I deleted the "/" and
 the message went away and they opened up like any other files. Strange.

<div>Thanks very much for this. &nbsp;Your solution solved my problem as well. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also noticed that now, when I go to the FILE menu and check on PROPERTIES, the "Read-Only" attribute is UN-checked. &nbsp;With the "/" in the filename, the attribute "Read-Only" had been checked. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In BOTH cases, however, both attributes "Read-Only" and "Hidden" remain grayed out and unselectable.</div>

            <p>ASFIK without reinstalling Office you cannot change the license of Office 2016.</p>
<p>You need to completely uninstall and then reinstall Office 2016 license on the computer.</p>
<p>While uninstalling and reinstalling Office you will not lose any data saved on the computer.</p>

<h2>            10158 Stuck at Dell Logo, will not boot into Windows</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to the newest build and hoped that would eradicate all the Nvidia problems but now I don't even have access to Windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It downloaded and installed and upon reboot hangs at the flash logo screen(dell in my case). If I power off by holding down power and try F2 for setup I get a black screen. If I try F12 for boot options I get a black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im trying to reboot in safe mode to uninstall Nvidia which, on the previous build, I had to do this every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't boot, safe boot, refresh or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can Fn + power into a hardware test and my hardware is all working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if if I had the previous build ISO on a USB I can't, as far as I can see, change boot to USB anyway because I get a black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically my new laptop appears bricked now and I'm hoping for some help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for&nbsp;your interest in&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. <span>Windows&nbsp;10&nbsp;Insider Preview</span> is&nbsp;still in the&nbsp;testing&nbsp;phase, so there might be some features which might not work as expected. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should
<span>back up everything</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you restart the computer, do you see the Recovery environment with Windows Technical Preview and Windows Roll Back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see these options, I suggest you to select Windows Roll Back. One you click on Windows Rollback in previous, you‚Äôll receive ‚ÄúRestoring you previous version of Windows‚Äù screen. Wait for few minutes, and the Windows 10 will be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to go back to your previous operating system, you might be able to create a USB recovery drive. For more info, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a USB recovery drive</a>. If you didn‚Äôt create a USB recovery drive before you installed the preview, you can
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create installation media for <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span></a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the results. We will be happy to help you.</p>

</p><p>At present there is nothing other than the Dell logo. It sits on the Dell logo and longest I left it was 4 hours and it did nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two options F2 and F12 and clicking both returns a black screen. I cannot roll back, refresh or restore because I cannot get to those screens because the screen goes black.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to the club! &nbsp;I have the same problem! &nbsp;10158 bricked my drive also. &nbsp;You have to disconnect power remove the battery, press the power button for about 30 seconds then reinstall the battery and plug in power. &nbsp;Then you can boot to F12 and try to
 boot from your USB iso and attempt to repair the OS. &nbsp;Didn't work for me. &nbsp;I ended up using another drive and clean reinstalling 10130. &nbsp;I am going to install the bricked drive in a USB external enclosure and repartition and format the drive. &nbsp;I see no other
 solution. &nbsp;I am assuming you are using a laptop as I am. &nbsp;Dell 7737. &nbsp;Good luck!</p>

            <p>Solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've fixed the issue no thanks to Microsoft or Dell(No warranty left so can't blame Dell) and Nobody supports Win 10...................not even Microsoft over the phone who are next to useless.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a 14z Dell knocking around and thankfully both Hard drives were interchangable(it was risky) just had to change over the drive bracket(2-4 screws).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beware dismantling Laptops and they can be tricky. I actually worked for Dell assembling Laptops years back so was a little ahead of the game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the 14z was put into the 15R it believed it was downgrading itself to Win 8.1 so installed correct drivers for the 15R. I put the Hard drive(suspect one)from the 15R into the 14z and it proceeded to load itself as a new installed operating system with
 10.1 downloading drivers etc for the system it was now in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When both were finished, I swapped the brackets back over and put the Hard drives back into the systems they came from and It's back to Normal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I any the wiser of what happened? Nope</p>
<p>Have I switched Preview Builds to "Slow"? Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were all my files safe and secure when I got back to normal? Thankfully yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those with the same 7537 Inspiron with an Nvidia Card, this is the common issue I have. Anytime I get an update and it won't load I load into Safe mode, uninstall the Card/Driver and restart and it works again. I nearly have to do this every time the
 system restarts. </p>

            <p>I have a Dell Inspiron and I have the same issue.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop Details:</strong></p>
<p>Model: Dell Inspiron 15 (7537, Mid 2013)</p>
<div>
<p>BIOS: Version A13</p>
<p>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4500U CPU @ 1.80GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 8 GB (DDR3 in Dual Channel Mode)</p>
<p>Display: Full HD Screen with NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M + Intel HD Graphics 4400</p>
<p>HDD: Seagate SSHD 1TB (ST1000LM014-1EJ164)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been on the insider program since the beginning &amp; was running Windows 8.1 (x64) &amp; Windows 10 (x64) Build 100130 on a separate partitions on the internal HDD.</p>
<p>While running Windows 10 it downloaded the update to Build 10162.</p>
<p>It installed the update &amp; rebooted and got stuck at the Dell Logo. </p>
<p>I was not able to enter UEFI BIOS Setup (F2) nor did it allow me to choose a Boot Device (F12).</p>
<p>So I drained the battery to 10% (before that I tried removing the battery &amp; pressing down the power button for a few seconds &amp; also removing the CMOS Battery to see if that would reset the BIOS and allow me to enter the BIOS Setup but to no avail)</p>
<p>So once at 10% battery it allowed me to enter the BIOS Setup &amp; so I changed the Boot Order to boot from USB.</p>
<p>I had a Recovery USB made via Dell Backup &amp; Recovery Software &amp; another made via the Windows in built tool.</p>
<p>I tried to use the DBAR made USB &amp; it was not able to Refresh or Reset the laptop so I used the Windows made USB and it helped me RESET the laptop to Factory State. (it was not able to REFRESH)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the above I made a Bootable USB of Build 10162 (using the ISO &amp; verified SHA1) and tried to do a clean install and again I had the same problem.</p>
<p>I used Diskpart &amp; did a CLEAN ALL on the HDD and tried again but still the same result.</p>
<p>So I did the Thorough ePSA System Test (System diagnostic for Dell computers) and it showed a failed HDD. Though it did not show the failure of HDD on the Short System Test.</p>
<p>So I got the HDD replaced and now I am gonna try to do a Clean Install again.</p>
<p>Hope it works out this time.</p>

<p>I upgraded to the newest build and hoped that would eradicate all the Nvidia problems but now I don't even have access to Windows&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It downloaded and installed and upon reboot hangs at the flash logo screen(dell in my case). If I power off by holding down power and try F2 for setup I get a black screen. If I try F12 for boot options I get a black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im trying to reboot in safe mode to uninstall Nvidia which, on the previous build, I had to do this every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't boot, safe boot, refresh or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can Fn + power into a hardware test and my hardware is all working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if if I had the previous build ISO on a USB I can't, as far as I can see, change boot to USB anyway because I get a black screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

<p>In case you have not solved the problem, the fix is to turn off Secure Boot in the BIOS settings. &nbsp;My Dell was doing the same thing and that solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, Microsoft changed the install to be compatible with a new UEFI specification and Dell has yet to update the firmware to meet the new spec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you out. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm afraid that person would be unable to do that because they cannot access boot settings, F2 or F12 because it just generates a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try this. Hold D whilst pressing power and it runs into a screen test(multiple coloured screens) and here you will be presented with the option(after the test) of F2 and F12. Try it there and if not then my solution was the only one that worked
 for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the hard drive in another computer(where possible), changed the boot settings to remove safe boot and put the hard drive back and start again. This is how I got my 2 Laptops(both dell) working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are now on the most recent 10240 Windows and running fine even if my 14z is having a disagreement with the AMD Chip.

<h2>            Count Unique Values in an Excel Range</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Need to find the&nbsp;count of unique numbers in the Range A1:C5 below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c7ba089-a4d5-49eb-aaf6-9cd3f17f0200" /></p>
<p>The answer is 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The formula will be D1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a couple of suggestions in previous posts here using Frequency &amp; Match functions but could not get them to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The values in the cells will always be numbers.&nbsp; Some numbers as in B2 go out to one decimal place.&nbsp; There will be empty cells as shown here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Range is actually larger on the real sheet A:1:C100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to explain this as simply as I can.</p>

<h2>            HTC Touch Pro 2</h2>
                    Is there any way to UNjailbreak a phone? I bought a unlocked HTC Touch Pro 2 on ebay and whoever did it disabled all of the apps. The only things that work are the phone calls, texts, and Internet Explorer. I have been unable to find replacement apps compatible
 with the 6.1 or 6.5 its running. I don't even know how to find out as Sprint will not look at it much less work on it cause its unlocked. Any thoughts or ideas would be welcomed.

            Hello. I have not encountered a way to disable apps in Windows Mobile Professional. Would need a more comprehensive history of the device, e.g. was it unlocked to flash custom ROMs or just to allow for use on different carriers? If custom ROM, was it designed
 specifically for TP2? Exactly what apps do not work? Some apps just don't work anymore because they are not supported. Have you done a hard reset? That can clear up operational problems. What kind of apps are you looking for? We can point you in the right
 direction. If you are not satisfied with the phone, contact the ebay seller and/or go through formal ebay channels for return.&nbsp;

            I am guessing that it is for different carriers because you can go into the connections and it has every carrier in the world to include international carriers. The apps that dont work are the ones that came with the phone new, facebook, sprint tv, navigation,
 NFL, Nascar, marketplace, and the Microsoft my Phone app. Its wierd because both internet explorer and opera work fine as well as microsoft office and the original games that came on the phone. Oh and my email cannot connect on wifi. If i go into my managed
 apps it says that nothing is downloaded to the phone. I cannot download anything from the internet like games, pics, videos, etc.

            Hello. The Facebook app does not work due to something Facebook did to stop the app communication with their servers. Mine doesn't work any more either. I would not expect the Sprint apps to work if unlocked. NFL and Nascar are not included with Windows
 Mobile so they may be Sprint bloatware. Marketplace and MyPhone are Microsoft services that have been shutdown so they won't work. There is a way to relock the device if it is still running the stock Sprint ROM but it is fairly technical and I wouldn't recommend
 it for just anyone. I don't think it is worth it. I'd return the phone first if you aren't happy.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If you need a navigation app, I would recommend <a href="http://copilotlive.com/us/personal/winMobile.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CoPilot</a>. For TV, I would recommend <a href="http://spbtv.com/pocketpc-software/tv/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SPB TV</a>. Good Luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not understanding about your Wifi. Are you saying it just doesn't work, e.g. email doesn't connect and you can't download anything? But you said that IE works? Make sure you configured your email settings correctly.</div>

            <p>Thank. This actually explains more about whats goin on with it than I could google or find on my own. I don't know what yours is but mine was originally a sprint phone, then it was unlocked. I don't know if when they unlocked it they may have deleted the
 program files for the TV and NFL. I don't know. Its a great phone especially for what I paid for it. $45 with free shipping. I got a whole lot more than I was expecting with it. Theres no other damage other than the unlocked issue.</p>

            Hello. Yeah, HTC made some great Windows Mobile phones. I never had a TP2 but always wanted one. They are in demand now because you can activate them without a required data plan. They don't have all the software that newer phones have but they still have
 a lot of features that set them apart. How do those Sprint apps behave? Do they open but don't log in? You might want to ask Sprint if they should work. It might be that they quit supporting them. You might look in your add/remove program list for .net framework
 compact 3.5. That has to be installed for some apps to work. Did you fix your email problem? Feel free to ask any questions. I don't think unlocking damaged the phone...it is just that the technology is a little old and things have just advanced.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This isn't too difficult&nbsp;with Windows 7.&nbsp; You can either:</p>
<p>Maximize both windows or</p>
<p>Drag each window to&nbsp;one side of the screen so it is automatically resized to half the width of the screen (this video demonstrates it:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf53zRfDH14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf53zRfDH14).</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/sf53zRfDH14?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/sf53zRfDH14?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div><br />
<br />
Or if you really want to set each window to a specific size and position, you can use VBA.&nbsp; Press Ctrl+F11, then Ctrl+G.&nbsp; Then, with one of your workbooks&nbsp;active and its window NOT maximised,&nbsp;type (into the Immediate Window that was activated by pressing Ctrl+G)
 the following, pressing enter after each line:</p>
<p>activewindow.Width=600</p>
<p>activewindow.Height=600</p>
<p>activewindow.Top=0</p>
<p>activewindow.Left=0<br />
</p>
<p>Activate the other workbook's window and click the end of each&nbsp;line of code and hit enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been the behaviour since at least Excel 2007.&nbsp; I can't remember what it was like in Excel 2003.&nbsp; Either way, as Grish says, there's no way to change this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except, you could run two separate instances of Excel.&nbsp; Have a read of <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2013/06/03/opening-workbooks-by-running-separate-instances-of-excel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.office.com/2013/06/03/opening-workbooks-by-running-separate-instances-of-excel/</a></p>
<p>and then simply hold down the Alt key while starting a second Excel form the Start menu.&nbsp; You should then have separate Undo lists, but remember that if copying ranges between separate instances of Excel only copies values, not formulas.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Can't use this as I disabled the "Auto arrange" when moving to edge of screen.&nbsp; This is a Windows 7 dislike because I hate the maximize when moving to top, but it at least I can disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Too much work.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestion #2-A - Instantiate a new Excel process</p>

</p><p>Well I made a "suggestion" but have no expectations on any change.&nbsp; If the Undo change has been there since Excel 2007, it's never going to change.</p>

<p>I did find a solution to create a new instantiation by creating a CMD/BAT file with:</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Clearly you've never used a macro‚Ä¶<br />
<br />
First, create your Personal Macro Workbook: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/copy-your-macros-to-a-personal-macro-workbook-HA102174076.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/copy-your-macros-to-a-personal-macro-workbook-HA102174076.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Then, Press Alt+F11, then in the top-left pane browse to VBAProject (PERSONAL.XLSB)</span></p>
<p><span>Select that and do Insert &gt; Module</span></p>
<p><span>Paste the following code in the space on the right of the VBE:<br />
<br />
Sub ResizeExcel()</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Application.WindowState = xlNormal</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
ActiveWindow.Width = 600</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
ActiveWindow.Height = 600</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
ActiveWindow.Top = 50</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
ActiveWindow.Left = 50</span></p>
<p><span>End Sub<br />
<br />
Close the VBE and return to Excel.</span></p>
<p><span>Now do File &gt; Options &gt; Quick Access Toolbar &gt; Choose commands from: Macros &gt; select "PERSONAL.XLSB!<strong>ResizeExcel</strong>" and click Add&gt;&gt;&gt;, OK.</span></p>
<p><span>There should now be a new button on your QAT.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Clicking it will resize the window of the active workbook.</span></p>
<p><span>Do that with two or more workbooks and Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab as required.</span></p>
<p><span>How does that work for you?<br />
<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Cheers<br />
Rich<br />
<br />
PS. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If you have set up Excel to always open in a new instance, you also need to make this fix from
<a href="http://superuser.com/questions/29524/open-multiple-instances-of-excel-without-personal-xlsb-lock-message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://superuser.com/questions/29524/open-multiple-instances-of-excel-without-personal-xlsb-lock-message</a><br />
<br />
Open one instance of Excel, do View tab &gt; Unhide.<span>&nbsp; </span>Select the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook&gt; OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Now do Review tab &gt; Share Workbook &gt; Editing tab &gt; check the option at the top to Allow changes by more than one users at a time. OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Now do View tab &gt; Hide, then close Excel.<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
<br />
You should now be able to open multiple instances of Excel without getting the "open read only" warning about the PERSONAL.XLSB file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Remember that you will need to unshared the PERSONAL.XLSB workbook to be able to edit the macros within it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you decide you don't want any of this, you can delete PERSONAL.XLSB from C:\Users\<strong>&lt;username&gt;</strong>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</span></p>

            <p>Me Too i hate the multiple instance. (i do not need side by side on different monitor)</p>
<p>In old 2010, when i want i do presentation and want to move multiple workbook from one monitor to another, I just need to drag the whole excel session and all my excel workbook(more than 10) will be move over to the external projector/monitor for presentation.
 When i finish a workbook, i can close that workbook and the excel session still maintain to show the next workbook.<br />
</p>
<p>But now i need to drag one by one from my desktop to the external projector.</p>
<p>-- Not sure if any people out there know of any workaround.<br />

<p>You cannot have both Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 installed on a system. If so, you either have an installation issue or are using the Click-to-Run version of Office 2010.</p>
<p>In the case of the first; completely remove Office 2007 and Office 2010 and then install Office 2010 again.</p>
<p>In case of the second; this is normal behavior as the Click-to-Run installation is a virtual installation which ActiveSync (and other applications) cannot detect. You'll need to have a direct install Office 2010 on your computer.</p>

    <title>N96 - White screen and SMS all gone&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simoespj  say:</h3>
<h2>            N96 - White screen and SMS all gone&#33;</h2>
                    I have the phone for more than 2 months now, and, aside from all the glitches that everyone complaints, the phone works great! Until yesterday! After turning it ON, PIN and Security Code, the screen went white, and only the top bar (operator and time)
 was visible! No shutdown from the button, I had to take out the battery. No good! Just the same thing. Until I left it with the white screen for about 1 hour, and after that it was OK. Sort of!<br />
I now have no SMS, received or sent! I had more than 1300 in Inbox, and probably 999 in the Sent Items.<br />
Anyone can help me recover them?<br />
<br />
Many thanks!<br />
<br />

            You should be able to restore that backup.<br />
<br />
White screen failures are generally not good news but your did recover. I would only be speculating if I said why it happened. The main thing is it did recover and you do have a backup you can use.

<h2>            Manage Junk Mail in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook. com account&nbsp; has started filtering out emails which are definitely not spam and which have until now been delivered to the Inbox correctly. So I tried to add the&nbsp; email addresses to the safe senders list only to find that I can not add to it
 or to the blocked senders list because it is all greyed out, see attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a browser issue as I've tried it on different browsers and also on my ipad and had the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also saw a suggestion that the mail account needs to be verified and I've done that with no change.</p>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the issue with missing feature like (Blocked senders) on Outlook web may arise due to an incorrect Junk email settings. To isolate the issue, we'd like to ask the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from using a different browser and accessing your Outlook over the phone, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer before the issue started?</li><li>Are you getting any error message when signing in to your Outlook account?</li><li>Have you tried manually adding the email address that you want to block? If yes, what happened?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Aside from using a different browser and accessing your Outlook over the phone, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>I re-verified the account.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer before the issue started?</li></ul>
<p>No. This is is the first time I've tried to manage junk mail for this account as I've recently started to get messages&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error message when signing in to your Outlook account?</li></ul>
<p>No</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried manually adding the email address that you want to block? If yes, what happened?</li></ul>
<p>Yes. I can't enter anything in the "Enter sender or domain name" box because nothing happens when I click in the box.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: I have another Outlook.com email address and I am able to add to the blocked and safe senders list for that account so it would appear to be an account issue rather than a computer or browser issue.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. Since you have tried to re-verify your account and deleting the browsing history, the issue may arise due to incorrect settings of your Outlook. We recommend changing the setting your Junk mail filter to
<strong>Exclusive</strong>, you may also create an email rule to delete automatically the incoming emails that you don't want to be in your inbox. To do so, follow the 3 methods provided by
<strong>Kiran Kumar R </strong>on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-ocleanup/unable-to-block-spam-emails-in-outlookcom/cc06b9e9-ec75-4c22-9f85-60ace3898a09">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>If I set the&nbsp;Junk mail filter to <strong>Exclusive </strong>then, as I understand it, all mail except those from my Safe Senders list will be treated as junk. However, since I'm not able to add addresses to my Safe Senders list this means that all emails
 will be treated as Junk which is not what I am trying to achieve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main concern is that valid, non-junk email, eg from an airline, has recently been diverted into Junk and I want to be able to stop this from happening. However I am unable to add anything to either the Safe Senders or Blocked Senders list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention "incorrect settings of your Outlook". What settings can I change to resolve this? If this is not a user configurable setting, how can I get Microsoft to change my account settings?</p>

    <title>Comments section shut down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherking3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comments section shut down</h2>
                    In my opinion the reason MSN shut down comments, after articles posted, because there was more conservative comment backlash than liberal.&nbsp; MSN didn't like the fact that conservative were more informed and commented more intelligently then liberal leftist.&nbsp;
 MSN is as anti-American and anti-conservative as all the other media outlets.&nbsp; If you don't like the answers you get and the amount of conservative support, you shut down the comments.&nbsp; Typical liberal leftist move.&nbsp; Stop hiding behind the "Comments were getting
 mean and offensive defense".&nbsp; You shut it down because conservative voices were louder than the leftist liberal voices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I disagree with you Christopher , I always found msn news items / stories very pro conservative and especially pro any tory government. The other side of the coin is they are very anti labour party , anti brexit and anti Jeremy Corbyn.&nbsp; Msn's anti brexit
 agenda is obvious for all to see , so much so it borders on what I would call attempted brain washing of Msn users. There is no balanced view what so ever. Again on the Corbyn issue it is obvious Msn have an anti Corbyn agenda and disproportionately support
 any attack on him . It is my belief that the comment section was discontinued because more people commented against the tory government and with out any shadow of a doubt many , many&nbsp; more were pro brexit and voiced their disapproval of Msn's pro EU agenda.
 I very rarely read anything on Msn as I believe they have abused their position as a media outlet.&nbsp;

    <title>Activating Microsoft Office on MacBook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating Microsoft Office on MacBook</h2>
                    
<p>Hello community,</p>

<p>I have access to Microsoft Office because I am a postgrad and staff member at a university in Ireland. I installed the 2011 version several months ago, following the steps in my student e-mail. Recently, however, it seems to have become deactivated. A black
 box pops up when I try to use Word or Outlook, requesting a product key or sign in... or to view documents for free. I have sign-in information but Microsoft isn't accepting it. I went to a help-desk on campus today and they spent 45 minutes trying to fix
 the problem. We even installed the 2016 version and the same issue arose. I have a Microsoft account but Microsoft won't accept my sign-in information on my MacBook. Has anyone had a similar experience and found a resolution?</p>

<p>Looking forward to getting some helpful responses. : )</p>

<p>Rachel</p>

<p>Activation of the software requires a valid Office 365 account. Does your university use Office 365? When you sign in with your Microsoft account, is this the university account? What happens when you try and sign in with your account to the portal site
 for Microsoft? I would suggest that you get the IT support at the university to check and make sure that your account is licensed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We are still in group chats with the rest of our team together and I can see our previous conversation and send her messages. But her screen says messaging disabled until request accepted.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;change is ridiculous. All initial contacts are from unknown sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes they are genuine people who have a good reason to connect to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>... Maybe you met them somewhere and gave them your details?&nbsp;</p>
<p>... Maybe a work colleague gave them your details?&nbsp;</p>
<p>... Maybe it's a long lost friend?</p>
<p>... Maybe it's just spam?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously you could have a quick chat before accepting a contact to find out who they are and whether you should add them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's a pure guessing game ... so potentially everyone gets declined ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please change it back !!!</p>

            do you have your phone updated to v11? that might have been the message. another firmware might be coming but nobody really knows that yet, as nokia does not make such information official.&nbsp;

<h2>            Re-enroll in Outlook Windows Application &#34;Coming Soon&#34;</h2>
                    <p>A few weeks ago, I reinstalled Windows, and along with it, Outlook 2016. When I started it for the first time, I saw the sleek new UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UI that I saw: https://icdn2.digitaltrends.com/image/outlook-for-windows-simplified-ribbon-microsoft-720x720.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a "Coming Soon" switch, and it was off. I turned it on, and then nothing happened (same look). So I turned it back off, and now I'm stuck with the old UI :(. I've already tried deleting/re-creating the Outlook profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I re-enroll in the "Coming Soon" feature? I am even willing to re-install Outlook, however I don't know if I need my original product key or something to do that.</p>

            It's not related to the profile. I know on new installs it can take a few hours or a few restarts for it to come up. 
<br />
<br />Are you using an insider build? Do you have all updates installed? Installing updates may trigger it to come back.

<p>1. No, but I used to have an Insider build and have a Windows Insider account. Also, the new UI showed up after I reinstalled Windows (not Insider).</p>

            Coming soon is an Outlook feature, not Windows. Check for updates in File, Office Account. 
<br />
<br />This is a home computer correct? There is a registry key that can turn it off, but you'd need to set it; on a work computer, a logon script would do it.

<p>I have checked for updates. I also changed my Insider level to "Monthly (Targeted)", and even to Insider. Eventually, I did the "quick repair" from Control Panel, then did the full online repair (which looked like it kinda-reinstalled Office). However, the
 "coming soon" button remains nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I am using Office Professional Plus 2016 on a home computer (Surface Pro 4, Windows 10 Pro x64).</p>

    <title>Unable to send newsletter as email - &#34;send current page&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kzgc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to send newsletter as email - &#34;send current page&#34; option is not available</h2>
                    <p>I am using Publisher 2013 at work for a team newsletter and I am trying to send the
<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">generic&nbsp;</span>newsletter as email (the entire newsletter in email body, not as attachment). &nbsp;But i found this option is not available and I only have "<strong>send as attachment</strong>" (as the only option
 in the <strong>Share</strong> tab).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I read about the help menu and there should be an option of "<strong>Email Preview</strong>" and there should be "<strong>send current pag</strong>e" - but they are not there on my publisher.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am currently using&nbsp;</span>Outlook2013 &amp; Windows 7 Professional and is this something related to my setting or my email client? If any one can help that would be good. This is a key feature i need to
 use and seems like no one can help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another piece of information could be useful - when I click "send as attachment", there is an error message :</span></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><em>Outlook Data File:</em></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><em>The file</em></p>
<p class="contentCodeblock"><em>xxxxxxxx.ost is in use and cannot be accessed. Close any application that is using this file, and then try again. You might need to restart your computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once i click away this error message, the email with attachment pops up. I am not too sure if this is the related to problem i mentioned about but I wish some expert here could help me to get the option of "send current page" back on to my publisher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks!!!!</p>

            <p>thanks for replying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i mean is , the "Send Current Page" option is not there at all, as if it has not been installed (not even being grey out, it's just not there). The only option i have is "send as attachment" - I can't see other options under "Share", seems like a lot
 of options were missing. &nbsp;Have anyone experienced this before? I hope someone can give me some pointer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with my Outlook (no problem with my emails, contacts, meeting requests etc), i can send email and everything without problem. the error message i mentioned above is purely related to MS publisher only. It only happens when I click
 "Send as attachment" - despite the error message, i can successfully sent out the file as attachment after clicking away from the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any suggestion would be helpful!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In theory as long as you use the same version of Outlook and Publisher then you should be able to send the Pub page as the message body. You are using the free standing version of Outlook and not the web based, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try doing a repair of both Outlook and Publisher. Uninstalling and reinstalling is not likely to help. You might uncheck Outlook as the default email client, reboot, recheck it and reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I think that even if you do get it to work that you are not going to be happy with the results. The layout will vary depending upon what email client views it. Personally I think that sending the Publisher newsletter as an attached PDF file is the only
 way to get consistent results.&nbsp; If you write a simple but effective introduction in the body of your email message and your message is of interest and wanted by the recipient they will open the pdf. If it is spam, then it won't matter whether it is in the
 message body or a pdf...it will be deleted. </p>
<p>
</p><div>If you must send html formatted messages then consider using specialty software such as:

            <p>Hi max green,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the answer. I had read similar in another post, but they said, that even though the update was uninstalled and hidden, it had reinstalled itself and the download started. Another said that you had to uninstall several other updates. Yet another
 suggested adding an entry into the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I had pressed the reserve button before notification from Sony, advising not to upgrade until such time as they had finished their own testing and suitable drivers are released</p>

            Try following one by one and see after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />3. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />4. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.

<p>Hello Eric, and thanks for the help.&nbsp; I've checked all of the options that E for Excel suggested, and none of them work, including doing a full repair on Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this might be an MS Update issue, as the latest update was on 26 Feb 2018.&nbsp; The issue is only a problem in Excel (no issue at all in Word, Powerpoint), and scrolling in Excel works fine except when in Edit (F2) mode.&nbsp; There is no difference in Safe
 Mode (exactly the same issue).&nbsp; I've tried to roll-back to the previous version of Office (16.0.8431.2215), and this process seems to start OK, but then I get an Office updates error message - 30125-27 (404) - suggesting there is a network error, when I know
 I have a perfect connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you offer any more specific guidance?&nbsp; Really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

<p>I also have the same issue, and believe it is a update that has broken excel scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I system restored a few machines back and excel works fine, (Early March)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to know which KB has broken it.</p>

<p>Hi AndewRobinson4:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were experiencing the same issue. So I checked out a few posts on this site and found that the Repair didn't work for me either. However,&nbsp;forcing an update to Office did. I would've thought these updates were included in the updates coming from Microsoft
 but apparently something wasn't working. Here are the steps that I followed: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it works for you too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joni</p>

            Hello all.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.&nbsp; I think there must have been a recent MS update that has dealt with this issue, because this functionality has been restored within the past few days.&nbsp; So, the issue is now resolved (for me at least).
