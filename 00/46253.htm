<p>I saw the following from a searching around, the one below seems to explain the issue and a solution.&nbsp; I did a backup of the file in question before over-writing.&nbsp; It worked and allowed the installation to continue; my system is a Toshiba AMD laptop with
 Win 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Lots of people having this problem, myself included. Looks like api-ms-win-core-libraryloader-l1-1-1.dll is a
<em>Windows 8</em> kernel dll (1-1-0 is the version on Windows 7). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody at MS screwed up the updater on the website, so we will probably just have to wait until they fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: A few minutes ago, someone at the linked forum suggested: </p>
<p>"Replace C:\Windows10Upgrade\wimgapi.dll with the one from C:\Windows\System32\wimgapi.dll"</p>
<p>I haven't tried this yet but I'm about to. I'll let you know if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: The suggestion appears to fix the issue. Update to Windows 10 in progress."</p>

<h2>            Will not Detect Second Monitor- Display Adapter&#63;</h2>
                    Back story- After windows 10 update last night my older second display stopped working, my LG was working just fine. I went through all the regular suggestions on this site and everywhere else on the Internet, the monitor was so old it did not have any
 driver to update, according to Acer. So I bought a new one! Now both monitors are on (just a copy of each other) but the system, in the device manager, only shows one display, the new one?! I can not find my original working LG anywhere. The Settings panel
 does not even "detect" a second display and I do not have the option of changing the resolution, it's grayed out. I have checked the adapter properties on that page and tried to update, the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter, but it all says its up to date, even
 tried through Windows updates. The one monitor that is showing up is all updated. I did notice that my display adapter as shows in Device Manager, shows a little yellow warning triangle and when I go in it says under properties, "W

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused by either an external device is not working when plugged to a USB port or
<span>all devices are working normally when plugged in, but the Unknown Device warning persistently pops up, and an Unknown Device is showing in Control Panel -&gt; Devices. Let's run the hardware troubleshooter to
</span><span>diagnose the cause and automatically troubleshoot the issue. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Key + R</strong><span>, type&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel</strong><span>, hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong><span>&nbsp;in the search box and select&nbsp;</span><strong>troubleshooting</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Hardware and sound</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Follow the onscreen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></li></ol>

            Thanks, but it didn't work.- basically got back the same message I saw in the device manager earlier today- that the
<em>Intel(R) HD Graphics </em>is not working properly. Earlier today I did a Windows update via the device manager and got back a message saying I already had the best version, even though it said on the previous screen that windows had shut it down because
 it wasn't working.&nbsp;I went to the Intel site to do a direct download of the&nbsp;update, but then the utility said I already had more recent update then they had. I did the update anyway, figuring maybe the older version worked better. No dice here either. Still
 shows up in the device manager as having issues. And I still only have one working display. It was all well before this most recent Windows update last night.

<p>Hmm. "No integrity violations", so files OK.</p>
<p>But I have been doing some poking around- here is what I have found: As mentioned the Intel(R) graphics adapter is buggered up. I have read in a few other forums that this happened to others during this update and Intel (maybe) has a plan to work on it.&nbsp;Who
 knows. So as a result&nbsp;Windows deployed a generic version to cover for the&nbsp;Intel that is not working, all of this is because I do not have a dedicated graphics card. Apparently I'm patched right in. So when the Intel adapter went down and Windows installed
 the generic version it could not handle two monitors. I have a pretty powerful computer so maybe that made up for the lack of a dedicated card, and I don't do any gaming. This is the best I can figure right now. Anyway installing&nbsp;a card tomorrow I hope. I
 am hopeful this will do the trick.</p>

<p>Hi Matt, <br />
<br />
<br />
Your device may become very warm during normal use. The device complies with the user accessible surface temperature limits defined by the International Standard for Safety of Information Technology Equipment (IEC 60950-1). You may check the guidelines below
 on how to reduce heat related concerns:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up your device on a stable work surface that allows for adequate air circulation under and around the device.</li><li>Use caution when operating your device on a pillow, blanket, or other soft material, because the material can block the airflow which may result in the device overheating.</li><li>If your device is on your lap and gets uncomfortably warm, remove it from your lap and place it on a stable work surface.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, contact our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />The printer should not be offline. 
<br />Right click on the Printer icon &gt; Select Properties
<br />Select Port Tab
<br />Type the IP address of the Printer You should get this by printing a configuration page.
<br />
<br />You may also assign it a Static IP address

            Hi Christina, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />When you open the photo in the Photos app, you should see a "Crap and rotate" button in the top-right. Click it, and you'll see the options to rotate the image,
<br />
<br />To make minor rotation corrections, grab the dot in the middle of the vertical line and move it up and down. This will slightly rotate the image so you can straighten it.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!       
        </p>

            Hi Colby
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703****09:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Colby.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

I hope following the below mentioned steps will resolve your shutdown issue<br />
<br />
1) open start menu and type "regedit" (without qoutes) and press Enter.<br />
2) This opens up the Registry Editor.<br />
3) Make sure to backup you Registry before you continue. (To do so, Click "File" and then "Export" and give any name to your backup file).<br />
4) Go to the following path:<br />
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager</b><br />
<br />
5) Once opened, on the right side , check for "BootExecute" entry. Double-Clcik on it.<br />
6) Delete all of its "Value Data" part and write the following into it:<br />
<b>autocheck autochk *</b><br />
and press OK.<br />
7) Now, "RESTART" (Dont press SHUTDOWN) your computer.<br />
8) After successful restart, press SHUTDOWN button.<br />
It should now shutdown you computer as before.<br />
Enjoy!<br />

<p>Everyone knows, by now, that XP Mode in Win 7 does not support 3D API - Direct X. Will someone please tell microsoft to upgrade its XP Mode so that it does !!! That way we dont have to throw away older XP versions of AutoCAD, 3DStudio MAX or SOLID Works
 3D etc... which would be nice. THx.</p>

            <p>just see ur language settings </p>
<p>because this feature&nbsp;works only with few language packs.</p>
<p>try US-English .</p>
<p>it works with that .</p>
<p>packs like English (INDIA), doesn't have this feature.</p>
<p>this is the same in PC , i think it will work in ur device too</p>

<h2>            Accidentally DELETED Marvell Avastar on Surface</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
So I accidentally DELETED Marvell Avastar off of my Surface 3 instead of uninstalling it. Does anyone have any idea on how I download the Marvell Avastar again? Of course, I have no internet connection on my Surface.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!<br />

            <p>If you have just deleted the card from device manager but did not tick the box to uninstall the drivers, just rebooting the machine should be enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have uninstalled the drivers then pick up the latest file from here: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49040</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can either pick up SurfacePro3_Win10_160128_2.msi if you want an automated install but that will reinstall pretty much all your drivers or you can pick up SurfacePro3_Win10_160128_0.zip and reinstall only the driver that you need manually. This assumes
 you're on Windows 10; if you're on Win 8.1 you will find the correct files on the link above as well.</p>

                    <p>Yes, Im having a problem with your developers. They are so incompetent that it takes several times longer to DISK CLEANUP after an upgrade to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One would think that an install takes a mere 15-30 minutes give or take, and disk cleanup specifically "WINDOWS UPDATE CLEANUP" is mindbogglingly stupid... it has been going for HOURS. Just delete the **** files you incompetent pieces of **** I have a
 computer I need to use!</p>

                    I bought a used Batman game and was given a story pack code card with it. Now when i enter the code it says it has already been redeemed. I called the store and they said nothing they could do about it, is there a way to get the code back?

            Sadly as already mentioned, no. If they guaranteed the code to work you may want to talk to them again. However if you bough the game used and the code was already redeemed by the previous owner there is nothing that can be done.<br />

            It's been used. They are a one time code. Sadly, the only way to guarantee a code that comes with a game is good is to buy it new.

<br />
<br />Are you using Skype on a Windows 10 PC or some other version of Windows?
<br />
<br />If you are using Windows 10, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy -  Camera
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your Camera' is turned on and make sure the Skype app is also set to On

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Click Machine name at the top
<br />
<br />Click the Action menu then scan for hardware changes then check if it shows up in the device tree.
<br />
<br />Also, click the View menu
<br />Click Show hidden devices
<br />
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver.

<h2>            You Tube video sound</h2>
                    My new Windows 10 computer does not play You Tube videos correctly- the sound is off, and I can only view the video - the sound is not in sync.

            I added a new user using my Hotmail e-mail&nbsp;account. But when I try to sign in with it, it just says "signing out" and goes right back into my original account. But that is fine. I do not want to have another account. Creating a new account was a solution
 someone gave me&nbsp;on a previous problem when I could not see my recent files, but later on&nbsp;someone else came along and gave me a better solution that worked while using my original account.&nbsp;Is there ANYTHING else I can try? Thank you.

<p>
</p><p>When I created the new user they were missing the same apps as my primary account, although the behaviour is slightly different. In the case of the new user they did not have the tiles. Among others they were missing the tiles for the Store and the Calculator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my primary account I do have the titles, from when the apps worked, but they show up with odds names such as @[Microsoft.WindowsStore....</p>

<h2>            Cannot play Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator WW2 Europe Series in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator WW2 Europe Series </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Help! Does anyone know how I can get my husbands' favorite game, Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator WW2 Europe Series to play on Windows 7???&nbsp; I've tried compatability mode and that didn't help.&nbsp; Yes, I know it's actually a Windows 95 game, which
 is making this so difficult. If we downloaded Windows XP onto the computer, would that work???? Any ideas and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Uninstalling Microsoft Security Essentials for Window 8 install</h2>
                    I am trying to install Windows 8 on my laptop. The process stalls at the point where I am&nbsp;asked to manually uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials. When I go to "Uninstall a program" through the Control Panel MSE in not listed as an installed program.
 I downloaded the Microsoft Fix-it program in the hope that it could find the MSE program but it could not find it either.&nbsp; I was able to install Windows 8 on another computer which also had MSE installed with no problem at all--the installation program didn't
 even ask me uninstall it. So, how do I uninstall a program that the system can't find?

    <title>Windows 7 will not install onto my SATA III hard drive even though - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thank the bear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 will not install onto my SATA III hard drive even though both the installer and the BIOS menu are locating it.</h2>
                    The controller is enabled for all SATA slots, and the hard drive is in one of SATA 3.0 gb/s ports, which I've heard is one way to get it through. However, this hasn't worked, either. Can anyone help?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's what I'm dealing with, put together just a few hours ago:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Intel DH77KC Desktop Board</div>
<div>- Intel Core-i7-2600K Processor 3.4 Ghz</div>
<div>- Western Digital Black 1 TB Hard Drive</div>
<div>- Corsair Vengeance 16 GB Ram</div>
<div>- Corsair TX650 80Bronze</div>
<div>- Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It boots, and then Windows 7 gets no farther as it will not install onto the Hard Drive. I can't make a new partition, either, nor can I format the disk from the Window. The BIOS settings don't exactly help, as I'm not using RAID and the IED didn't do
 it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Maybe there's something wrong.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            camera on webcam mirrors when pic. is taken</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My webcam on the camera app on the acer laptop mirrors pictures after the picture is taken. (so for example if i'm leaning to the left after the pic. is taken I would end up being on the right.) What do I do? Is there a way I can change the settings on this
 app? Or how can I resolve this issue? I would really appreciate if anyone could help me out.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Acer&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Probably a driver or control program issue.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Translate the Windows 7 methods to Windows 8 (there is little difference) :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually
<br />
included with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the delayed reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, the issue seems related to your network environment. Please make sure that you are able to connect to the endpoints described in the link below through
 the VPN connection:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#bkmk_lyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#bkmk_lyo</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have confirmed this, we need to collect some information below to troubleshoot it:<br />
1. The detailed version of your Skype for Business client such as Skype for Business 2016 MSO (16.0.7426.1015). To get this: Click the drop-down icon near the
<strong>gear</strong> &gt; <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>About Skype for Business</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you mean the issue only occurs in your home network with VPN connection?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are there any error messages when you cannot share screen? If yes, provide it to us.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Screenshots about the symptoms “<em>&nbsp;the screen cannot be shared or I cannot see shared screens</em></span>”.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

    <title>Ethernet and Wifi Networks running together&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ethernet and Wifi Networks running together&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to run an ethernet LAN for my printer and a wifi router for my internet.</p>
<p>Wifi router and internet are working fine.</p>
<p>When I plug in the ethernet cable to the printer and network adapter it comes up with "unidentified network" and "no network access"</p>
<p>I tried manually setting a different IP address and gateway ... didnt change the subnet mask from 255.255.0.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the LAN one need to be different to the wireless subnet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont have much network experience so any help to resolve would be appreciated</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

            Are you plugging the printer network cable into your router? &nbsp;That is where it should be connected.

            <p>I used to do that and everything worked fine.</p>
<p>However now the router and the printer are on opposite sides of the new house so I can only plug the printer into the laptop next to it. Im happy if I can only print from this laptop and no other computers in the house. &nbsp;Through the router like i used to
 before i know all computers can print but I cant physically connect them in the current setup. Just need one place to be able to print. Is it possible to configure the printer and the ethernet adapter on the laptop to communicate seperate to the router? and
 without conflicting?</p>

            <p>In order for the computer to be able to use the two network interfaces they need to be on different networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The router will most likely be issuing IP addresses to devices that connect but only on the network interface making the connection. It will not issue an address to the Wired LAN side of the Laptop or to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most printers have a USB port and as you want to connect the printer direct to the laptop that would be the most logical solution. However if&nbsp; you particularly want to use the LAN port then you need to configure an address on both devices and that must be
 on a different subnet to the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not only that both devices are client network interfaces and nominally transmit signals on the same pair of pins in the LAN cable i.e. the Laptop is trying to send data to the output of the printer not the input. More devices can auto sense the LAN interface
 but not all. To be sure you would have to either connect the two using a LAN crossover cable or fit a network switch between the computer and the printer.</p>

            <p>That was a great and very helpful post! Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have added a switch in between the laptop and the printer. I have put them both via cable into the switch. Both are showing lights on the switch</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the subnet mask and the IP addresses to different number sets than the ones used by the wifi router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is still saying "unidentified network" and "no network access"</p>
<p>Do i have to specify a IP Gateway? Does it have to be in the same number set as the IP addresses?</p>
<p>Does it matter what I change the subnet value to?</p>
<p>Maybe I am still overlooking something?<br />
<br />
Do i need to reboot the laptop for the new settings to take effect?</p>
<p>

            <p>If for example the Wi-Fi network is on 192.168.1.X then you would need to set the LAN port on 192.168.2.1 and the printer on 192.168.2.2 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. The gateway is how traffic is supposed to leave the network which would never happen
 so shouldn't matter (there is no way out of the network anyway). In otherwords the Printer/LAN ports must be on a different subnet as the Wi-Fi but both should be on the same subnet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then from the PC open a command prompt and<strong>&nbsp; ping 192.168.2.2</strong>, this should generate 4 replies. Then if the printer is already set up go to its settings and add a Tcp/Ip port for the printer address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My are addresses are just examples as I don't know what you have.</p>

            <p>Thanks again.<br />
<br />
I did all of the above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened command prompt and pinged the printer and got 4 responses almost instantly&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added the TCP/IP port for the printer address the same as the IP i pinged in command prompt</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still wont let me print. When I send something to the printer it comes back with error in the printer queue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is set up as a RAW port. Should I change it to LRP? &nbsp;Or is raw correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to add new printer in the device manager but it doesnt find it???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where to go from here?</p>
