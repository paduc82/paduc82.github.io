<h2>            Outlook 2010 and Google Mail</h2>
                    <p>I use both Microsoft Outlook 2010 and Google Mail. I have a business email address that utilizes Google Mail but is not a gmail.com address. I can access this email using the Mail application on my iPhone, but I cannot seem to get it set up in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another email that is a gmail.com address that works fine with my Outlook 2010. The only difference I can see is that my personal email has a gmail.com address and my business email has a different domain. What do I need to do in order to set this
 up? </p>

<h2>            File is corrupt and cannot be opened in Excel 2016</h2>
                    I recently updated Office 365 with regards to Excel and Word. I keep getting a 'file corrupted cannot open' error message. What is the solution?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors.<br />
<br />
2. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
6. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
7. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
8. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
9. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
10. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
11. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
12. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
13. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
14. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

            <p>Is this happening to all files, or just one or two?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the problem appears to be happening with both Word and Excel, my guess is that it is installation related, rather than an issue of file corruption of specific files (please confirm by answering question above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going on assumption that is is an installation problem, a After doing update and repair as Vijay suggests,:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would skip down to step 14, do an uninstall from control panel, then re-install.</li><li>If that doesn't help, use the "fix it" tool mentioned in the link in step 14.&nbsp;
</li><li>Then, I would skip down to step 9.</li><li>Return to step 3 if 9 doesn't fix problem. </li></ul>

    <title>Word Mac 2016 pagination changes after copy and paste - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drdocument  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Mac 2016 pagination changes after copy and paste</h2>
                    <p>I am seeing a very weird behavior of pagination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Client requires volumes of exactly 200 pages, 25 double-spaced lines per page.</p>
<p>When volume I am creating gets to 200 pages I do a bit more, save, then Save As to create the next volume.</p>
<p>(For clarity I will call these Volumes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>Once I have finalized Vol. 1, the last remaining text on page 200, I then go to Vol. 2 and delete the duplicate text so that the text in Vol. 2 is a continuation of that in Vol. 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have as many lines on page 200 as possible without splitting a paragraph between volumes. Widow and orphan lines are allowed because of the 25 lines per page requirement. Paragraph formatting does NOT "keep lines together."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, having created Vol. 2 with Save As, I then reopen Vol. 1 and go to page 200 in Print Layout view.</p>
<p>I see that the last line of the last complete paragraph on page 200 -- (example) "last line of paragraph" is on line 21.</p>
<p>So I delete all the following text (starting with the new paragraph on line 22).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, the last line of the last paragraph now appears on line 6 of page 200.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other changes have been made in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, here?</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>Window/Orphan and "Keep Lines Together" are mutually exclusive: decide which one you want to use and turn the other off. &nbsp;Keep Lines will throw the entire paragraph to the next page if any part of it won't fit on the previous page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me as though you might have deleted a section break, and therefore altered your pagination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Phillip suggests, turn on you "Show non-printing characters" so you can see what you are doing. &nbsp;But be aware that will the non-printing characters shown, the pagination of the entire document becomes inaccurate (because display room is taken by the non-printing
 characters). &nbsp;For exact pagination, you need to hide those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            Yes, John is correct but you only want to turn hidden characters on only long enough to find any stray characters that should not be there. I had not thought of Widow/Orphan items. I guess that is why John is an MVP. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>😉&nbsp;</span>

<p>I think I found it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the first delete (to remove pages above 200) there was an additional paragraph mark, specially formatted (indicated by a dot), not deleted by Cmd-Shift-End, although its text WAS deleted. (Don't know why it works that way.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After going to the end of the desired ending paragraph and pressing Delete so that remaining blank-but-formatted paragraph was deleted, that is when the pagination changed.</p>

            Most likely it "works that way" because you've cleared the check in <strong>
Word&gt; Preferences&gt; Edit</strong> to <em>Include paragraph mark when selecting paragraphs</em>. Deceptively, the ¶
<em>does</em> get selected but does <em>not</em> get deleted or removed.<br />

            <p>The 'challenge' is presented because Word has no structural component called a 'page", as is the case with most word processing programs. Documents are a flow of text from start to finish with the text contained in
<em>Paragraphs</em> which comprise <em>Sections</em>. Pagination is determined for print purposes only &amp; is dependent on a significant number of variables as well as their interaction with each other.</p>

RAP 9.2(f)</a>. And in this arena we are still dealing with some participants using hard copy while others refer to digital versions. This is why final docs are PDF, because users cite to specific words by page and line number, and these can change in a Word
 doc depending on available fonts and printer drivers on different computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This requirement of each volume (except last) being <em>exactly</em> 200 pages is a new interpretation of the rule. Previously the limit was an upper limit only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure when I do this again in the current project this week I will be able to identify what I missed.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to send a second email to the same recipient when you sent the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to send a second email to the same recipient when you sent the last email in the coversation</h2>
                    <p>I couldn't think of a clearer/more concise way to phrase this question for the thread title. I hope it makes some sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've sent an email to someone and then want to send another as part of the same conversation or "trail" (e.g. if you have more information to add, or want to send a reminder), what is the simplest way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I just press reply, remove my own email address from the recipient field, and paste in the intended recipient's address. Is there a button similar to "reply" that will do this automatically? Otherwise, it would be nice if Outlook were intelligent
 enough to assume you don't want to "reply" to yourself, but to the original recipient.</p>

<p><span>It seems that you want to reply to the same recipient and keep the original conversation.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, you can try the followings:</span></p>

<li><span>In Outlook client, goes into “Sent Items” folder and find the last sent email.

<h2>            are the features of amber and black updates included in windows phone 8.1 by default&#63;</h2>
                    I have not updated my L520 windows phone 8 ever since i bought it.For my device many missing features like Bluetooth 4.0 and radio and tab to wake,and few changes in camera apps are available only with the Amber and black updates.But i haven't updated
 them.now i am thinking of upgrading directly to wp8.1,My question is will i get all the features of amber and black update with wp8.1?(or i have to update first amber then black then cyan?).Since i havent updated my phone before i have no idea.what should
 i do to get all features of amber and black updates with wp8.1 update?.suppose if had updated my phone with amber and black updates already and now if i upgrade to 8.1, will that remove all the previous update's features?i might be very naive to ask these
 but really confused about the updates.I really need all the amber and black update's &nbsp;features with my wp8.1 including latest denim update.so if any one could explain me all these,it &nbsp;will be of great help.thank you.

            Sorry, I misunderstood your post, because you h haven't got amber or black you will need to update them first then update to 8.1 when you check for updates and it finds 8.1 then it will update everything first. To reinforce, there isn't any way to skip
 these updates if you want to get 8.1.

<h2>            Get display name of installed Office product</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to programmatically determine what Office product a user has installed.&nbsp; For instance, "Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus" or "Microsoft Office Professional 2019".&nbsp; What is the best way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the registry, I see the following registry key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Licensing\LastKnownC2RProductReleaseId</p>
<p>
</p><p>which tells me, for instance, that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Excel" = "O365ProPlusRetail"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a reliable place to determine what CTR Office is actually installed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also aware of the registry key:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration, "ProductReleaseIds"</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the value of that can be a list of products (e.g., "ProductReleaseIds"="O365ProPlusRetail,VisioProXVolume").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a more straightforward way to get this information that I totally missed?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to get a report of Office products of all the users in your organization?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check this tool: <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/68b80aba-130d-4ad4-aa45-832b1ee49602#content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If you want to check the Office product name on one computer, you can check programs in Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your registry, the user should use Office 365 ProPlus and Visio of Volume license.</p>

<h2>            Online Hotmail Inbox &#34;Cleared&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Went to my hotmail account online this morning and found that both my Focused and Other inboxes were "Cleared" and none of my emails in both boxes were there...&nbsp; It appears that any emails that I saved to other folders are still there...&nbsp; What could have
 possibly happened?</p>
<p>On my phone, I've used the K9Mail app for years now and never had a problem.&nbsp; I checked my hotmail with my phone (K9Mail) after finding my inboxes empty with my computer and it was the same with my K9Mail.&nbsp; I also noted in my K9Mail that syncing was disabled
 (not sure how or why that would have happened either)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I did (on Wednesday) get a new phone and transferred everything from my old phone to my new one, including the K9Mail app, but everything was working just fine all day yesterday, until this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, no specific types of emails that I lost, just everything that was in my inboxes (both focused and other), but all my subfolders that I created to archive emails are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can currently send and receive emails using my K9Mail app on my phone and emails are coming in and populating my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything that I know of to find my missing emails, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Bob</p>

</p><p>1. Yes, we are trying to use this as a photo profile for our HR staff. for office 365. I believe Office 365 is almost the same as Outlook.com right?&nbsp; But, I was trying to upload it on Outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Below (Top Pic) is the image our HR would like to use for their profile picture. I've used .gif ; .jpg and .png to no avail. (Below Pic) All come out larger than is shown below and only part of the lower bottom of 'Your HR' and a dark line below that.&nbsp;
 Your help will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the update, JL. Profile photo’s usual scale is 4x4 which would appear as square. The photo that you’re trying to set isn’t appearing as it’s supposed to since the photo is set into a rectangular scale. To resolve the issue, we suggest editing
 or changing the photo’s orientation into 4x4 using a third-party program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll be waiting for any updates on this issue.</p>

                    When anybody using Yahoo mail tries to email my outlook account, they receive a Mailer Daemon message.&nbsp; I'm not getting any of their messages.&nbsp; I've added them to my safe list.&nbsp; Here is an example when I tried sending to myself from my yahoo account.&nbsp;
 I can't receive on any pc or smartphone.<br />

            I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I worry that other accounts besides Yahoo might also being blocked by hotmail.&nbsp; Several friends of mine received an email with a link for theater tickets around 6:20 pm.&nbsp; I didn't receive it.&nbsp; I am getting very few emails
 this afternoon and evening which is unusual.&nbsp; I wish Outlook.com had live support so someone could send the emails that were rejected.&nbsp; How do we know what we are not getting?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I emailed a friend tonight&nbsp; (she is on my safe and contact list).&nbsp; When she tried to respond, she got a Mailer Daemon message that read, " No MX or A records for hotmail.com"&nbsp; She had to let me know by text message that her emails could not get through.<br />

<p>You can just set the Enabled property to No and leave Locked also No - but that will "grey out" the control visually. You might want that as a visual indicator that this control is "look but don't touch".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Select the control's Allow Edits property to No; or to keep the user from even setting focus to the control, set the Locked property to Yes, and Enabled to No.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends to some extent on what kind of meddling you're trying to prevent. These will protect the data from an ordinary user messing with it, but not from someone with a modicum of Access knowledge who is trying to deliberately break the rules.</p>

    <title>On Outlook Calendar creating a recurring event once a month on the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> llamaguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            On Outlook Calendar creating a recurring event once a month on the same day&#47;week for several months</h2>
                    Example of a very common scheduling situation is to create a meeting every month on the second Tuesday at Noon for 2 hours. This was very easy on the old Live interface and I can still do it on an old laptop that still uses Live and it will show up on
 my Outlook calendar. But I cannot figure out how to create directly in Outlook such a "every month same day/week" recurring event. If I create an event and choose a recurring "once a month" the event shows up every month ON THAT DATE. I don't think I have
 ever scheduled meetings based on the idea of meeting once a month, on the 6th for example, regardless of what day of the week the 6th happens to fall.

            I am using Outlook as a Microsoft email client. Before I went to Windows 8 and Outlook I was using the Windows Live interface for my @msn.com email and calendar. Live and Outlook still talk to each other. I can access my email and calendar using Live on
 an old Windows Vista laptop and both interfaces synch with each other.

<h2>            why does the washingtonpost.com website not load on IE9&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I try to load the washingtonpost.com website on IE-9 (running on Windows-7 professional), the page loads for a brief few seconds and then the below script is displayed. This started happening about a month back. Prior to that I was able to go to the
 website without any problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the javascript that gets displayed:</p>
<p>var PortalCommons = { servicesUrl : '/_mpsctx/services', _isChrome : null, isChrome : function() { if (typeof(_isChrome) == 'undefined') { _isChrome = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') &gt; -1; } return _isChrome; }, createXmlHttp : function()

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which IE browser are you using?&nbsp; 32-bit or 64-bit</p>
<p>Try using 64-bit if using the default 32-bit </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; Type Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Select 64-bit</p>
<p>or, vice-versa</p>

            <p>I'm having the same problem with IE9 on both of my computers. The correct page shows for 2 seconds and then the javascript page wipes it out. One computer is 64-bit CPU and the other is 32-bit CPU, so I don't think that matters.
</p>
<p>The only way I've found to prevent the Javascript from appearing is to enable ActiveX Filtering&nbsp;in the Tools/Safety menu. But I don't like to do that because it messes up other websites and I keep having to click Allow ActiveX.</p>

            <p>Wasim,</p>
<p>I have the same problem. </p>
<p>1/ It is peculiar to WashingtonPost.com. It is the only site of the dozens I visit daily&nbsp;that has this problem. Hence any changes are moot. I wrote to them about it several weeks ago and it was fixed after a few days but is now recurring,</p>
<p>2/ Using terminal services to log in to my local 2k3 server and IE8, I have no problems with their web site. This localizes the problem to the site and IE9.</p>
<p>3/ I think make, model is irrelevant.</p>

            I had the same problem and it was resolved by turning on :Script debugging (Internet Explorer)" and "Display a notification about every script error". I have no idea why this would correct this issue, but it did for me.

<p>FWIW, The Washington Post's revenues are down about 85% right now, so karma's a mother.</p>

            Connect your device to your PC. Open Activesync on your computer and click Tools - Options. Uncheck contacts and wait for Activesync to save your new settings. When done, check Contacts again. Let me know if this helps.

<p>However, whether I choose curve, freeform or even scribble, it automatically produces a STRAIGHT LINE! Also, it won't let me curve the line!</p>
<p>Please, what should I do?</p>

<p>There are 2 tools which can be used for that purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To use the <strong>Curve</strong> tool, click at the stating point, move the crosshair pointer to another location &amp; click again, then move the crosshair pointer again. The line will curve as you do. To continue the line click at each point where you want
 to change direction. When you want to end the line double-click. Once the line is created right-click it &amp; select
<strong>Edit Points</strong> in order to alter the curves.</li><li>To use the <strong>Arc</strong> tool, click &amp; drag to create the initial arc, then use the yellow diamonds to modify the arc. The
<strong>Edit Points</strong> feature also can be used on arcs.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If these methods aren't working for you please describe in detail how it is behaving differently for you. Additionally, go to Word&gt; About Microsoft Word in the main menu to determine the present Version of your Office installation... Include that info in
 your reply.</p>

Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be possible to create a VBA to add or delete columns specific to columns header.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for e.g. I have a set of 30 - 35 column headers. They appear in the same order mostly, but some columns could be missing in few files. Would it be possible to create a VBA to check the column headers and then accordingly add a column if required with the
 appropriate heading or delete any extra column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for all the help.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an auto generated data every month which has some fixed columns. To be able to work on this data, I need to insert some columns in between certain columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first row of this data has column headers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For e.g. the raw data that&nbsp;I have has the following headers Line, Order #, Order Date, Item, Unit, Price.</p>
<p>To be able to work on this data I need to insert three columns between the column with header Line and Order #. Also if the raw data gives me any other data with headers other than the ones listed above, the VBA should be able to delete those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be possible to create a VBA to add these columns and delete any unnecessary columns that might be in the raw data sheet.</p>
