<h2>            Inking greyed out in one Excel Spreadsheet and not another</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an excel spreadsheet in which we sign=in / out for security.&nbsp; This spreadsheet works on and off and the last time I used it I could sign with my pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all settings and also tried on a new spreadsheet and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have saved the current document as another document with no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document is not shared, nor is the sheet shared / protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just swapped to my new surface and I can ink in other applications just not this particular spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Hi Tammy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, adding digital signatures is also a method to protect the file. You may try to add the digital signature for the new file you used to test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still works fine, considering you mentioned the issue only occurs with particular file. The issue may be related to some settings in the specific worksheet, I'd like to suggest you copy the context and paste to a new workbook. (without any formatting)&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work after you add the digital signature, please provide the following information for us to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>1.Your OS version and Office version. (Open Excel&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information)</p>
<p>2.Detailed repro steps. (e.g. how you create the file, signature Setup)</p>
<p>3.Confirm whether other users can ink. You may also share the repro file with us via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zixuan</p>

<p>Hi Zixuan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try cutting and pasting however that's quite a lot of work as the excel spreadsheet is quite large.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear I am not "inserting" a digital signature a such.&nbsp; We just ask our receiving team member to sign to acknowledge they have received the item for tracking. &nbsp; Screen capture inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We only have authorized management team members that have access to this file its in a secure location on our file server so we are not as worried about protection of the digital signature as such.&nbsp; Its better than us having this a paper based signature
 across all of our sites with no visability... to be clear in the past our business has been "very" paper based and we are working in baby steps to get away from this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps - open spreadsheet, navigate to signature field and then ask team member to sign in the space provided.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Enterprise, Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus Version 1708 (Build 8431.2079)</p>
<p>I know one of the other team members could Ink in the last few weeks I will just need to confirm tomorrow that they can still do this.</p>

<p>Hi Tammy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you confirmed the status with your colleagues? If they still can do it, are there any differences between the two of you?</p>
<p>If they also can’t use ink, could you provide a sample workbook via&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">Private Message</a> for us to further investigate? To protect your information, please remove your PII,&nbsp;and delete other
 worksheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to share the status with us.</p>

            You've probably solved it by now but for others an easy fix for a grey Excel worksheet is Control+F10 it's happened to me a couple times and it's worked. I ran repair after because I didn't know what caused the grey problem.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Yoga</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I found an article that came out today saying that the icon has changed with the new OneDrive Sync Client.
</span></span><span><a href="http://www.sharepoint13.org/?p=605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.sharepoint13.org/?p=605</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It used to have
</span></span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd4e610c-65c8-4a39-b555-80b496b295db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd4e610c-65c8-4a39-b555-80b496b295db" /></a><span><span>and
 now has </span></span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a517802c-fcce-4678-8397-1b5da2e82dca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a517802c-fcce-4678-8397-1b5da2e82dca" /></a><span><span>&nbsp;(looks
 like office buildings).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>So it seems that I have synced to the new team site automatically.&nbsp; Not sure why older files were added in. I can only assume that one of my colleagues who has had issues occasionally
 syncing has started syncing again after the upgrade and then the older files were added back in??</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new OneDrive sync client will keep files in sync if the network is connected. In this case, files from the SharePoint site you selected to sync will be synced to the local synced SharePoint folder.
 Please check if these older files are added to the SharePoint site by others. Besides, if you have any sync issues, this article about
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-OneDrive-sync-problems-83ab0d8a-8400-45b0-8dcf-dc8aa8a6bcf8#subscriber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Yoga</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult to know whether older files were added by others as the sync issues were intermittent.</p>
<p>Feedback:&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were all unaware that OneDrive SharePoint was being updated and have had to spend extra time on every computer to get them working again.&nbsp; We all lost the links and had to resync the libraries.&nbsp; All others have 1 cloud showing (OneDrive - our business
 name), I have 2 clouds showing (OneDrive - our business name) and (OneDrive for Business - No libraries are currently connected).</p>
<p>When updates are done, they should be seamless so that no extra work needs to be done.&nbsp; We are a small company that does not have an IT department and expect that any updates done by Microsoft would not require expert assistance to allow programs to continue
 to operate correctly.&nbsp; The explanations that were sent were not at a level that a non-IT person would necessarily understand.</p>
<p>All computers seem to be working at the moment.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Natalie</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint smartart 2010 to 2003</h2>
                    Hi, from reading the questions in the forums I understand I cannot convert an organisation chart created in smartart in&nbsp;PPT 2010 back to 2003, at least not in an editable form.&nbsp; My research says I need an add-in to get the "old" org chart back, which is
 not automatically installed with 2010.&nbsp;I have been trying to follow the instructions which says I must go to Ctrl Panel, Programs and Features and then click on the plus sign next to MS Office - there is no plus sign.&nbsp; When I right click or double click the
 MS Office 2010 icon it ONLY offers me the option to uninstall.&nbsp; Very frustrating!!&nbsp; Please can someone help here - many thanks.

<p><span>Most of the add-ins are not compatible with Click-To-Run edition hence if Click-To-Run edition is installed convert it to MSI edition.</span></p>

    <title>Export from OneNote keeping embedded files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export from OneNote keeping embedded files.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm currently working with templates and bits to put together a generic report that will be zapped off straight via "email page as PDF". I like the security that comes from the PDF option but the problem is the PDF shows a nice icon where embedded files
 are but it doesn't contain the file for access at a later date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is there a way to export as PDF straight through email from OneNote (2010) with the ability to access embedded files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Edge casting to device no longer finds DLNA devices</h2>
                    <p>In the Anniversary update it was possible to cast Edge contents to a DLNA device (TV) using the "Cast media to device" option.<br />
With the Creators update (15063) this option has had some rework and DLNA devices are no longer found.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this problem too?</p>

<h2>            CANNOT PRINT ENVELOPE FROM WORD 2007</h2>
                    I have been able to print everything else including labels but not envelopes. The printer is a HP 7550 Photosmart. The printer appears to communicate with the PC but then spits out the blank envelope and no attempt to print. I've changed fonts and toyed
 with ddifferent settings in the Options.

    <title>Access 2010 User Defined function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcdude_778  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2010 User Defined function</h2>
                    <p>I created a user defined function in a module in my Access 2010 database.</p>
<p>The date field name is Dte</p>
<p>I want the function to take a date,and then return the goal number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the function is being stored in my database, because when I click on the magic wand in the criteria, then functions, then the database name, I get the</p>
<p>function name in "Expression Categories".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name of the user defined function is called, "RetrvGoal"</p>
<p>When I start typing RetrvGoal</p>
<p>it gets highlighted in blue underneath with the parenthesis for userdate like this:</p>
<p>RetrvGoal(userdate)</p>
<p>How do I get the user defined function to work with the date field?</p>
<p>I tried doing this:</p>
<p>RetrvGoal("Dte")</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then it says, "undefined function "RetrvGoal" in expression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do differently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>The first thing to check is... where do you have the code for RetrvGoal? If it's in a Module which is ALSO named RetrvGoal you'll get this error: modules and functions share the same "namespace", so if you have the same name used for both Access can't find
 the function. Try naming the module basMyFunctions or something else distinctive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second issue is where you're calling it. If you want to see the returned value in your query, don't put it in Criteria; instead put</p>
<p>
</p><p>GoalNum: RetrvGoal([Dte])</p>
<p>
</p><p>in a vacant Field cell in the query grid. Note that it's brackets not quotes - "Dte" would be passing the function a three-character text string, not a date!</p>

<h2>            Windows Ten Questions</h2>
                    <p>I have a few questions, so I'll list them all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- On my desktop computer, it's running Windows 7 home service pack 1 (I think). I cannot see the GWX application in the task bar. I've successfully removed the update KB3035583, and it's reinstalled. The application is still located in C:\Windows\System
 32\GWX\ after the update has re-downloaded, although when I manually run it (even as an administrator) nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not located in task manager, and it doesn't won't run. The same happens on a Windows 7 home laptop in the house, although a Windows 8 laptop works perfectly. My specs meet Windows ten, and in fact go over the minimum specs, so I don't know what's causing
 this.&nbsp;I've scanned my system and nothing has been found. Does anyone have any ideas what I can do to force it to run, or what in general may be going wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Next, I don't want to lose my Professional version of Windows 8.1. When I upgrade, what will happen to my license key and Pro version? Will I be able to use my license on another machine, or do I need to purchase a new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Some of the games I play, for example, Empires Dawn of the Modern World, require to be ran in compatibility for Windows XP service pack 2. I know that Microsoft have ended support for Windows XP, but will the compatibility option still be there to run
 programs for it? This will be a key factor in me upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What will come pre-installed? Will I be able to actually remove things form the machine? For example, you can't properly remove Internet Explorer in Windows 8, can this be done with everything pre-installed on Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What compatibility issues are there with applications in Windows ten compared with Windows 8?</p>

you'll be able to use compatibility mode. not sure the games will run though. I have one that won't even though it installed. to check if you can pre-order, try checking for updates. if you use 8.1 pro to upgrade, you'll get win 10 pro as an upgrade, then you
 can d/l the iso with a win 10 key. the old win 8.1 key becomes invalid. remember win 8.1 receives MS support until 2023, win 7 until 2020, win 10 may be a paid for fee service to get updates&nbsp;after 2 years. you'll get free updates until the fee for service
 starts. also, win 10 may not be really stable until a couple months have passed, read some performance reviews for a while before deciding to upgrade. win 10 will NOT transfer to another machine. it won't even allow you to change a bad motherboard, and will
 require a new key to re-install should you have&nbsp;new hardware. the key is for the machine, not you.&nbsp;

</p><p>- What will come pre-installed? Will I be able to actually remove things form the machine? For example, you can't properly remove Internet Explorer in Windows 8, can this be done with everything pre-installed on Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What compatibility issues are there with applications in Windows ten compared with Windows 8?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A) Make sure you are in fact on Windows 7 SP1. You should be. But double check. Honestly it's not that important if you don't have the&nbsp;reservation thingy or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) If you want Windows 10 for free on your 8.1 machine you lose that license. You're trading that in for a Windows 10 license. That's the whole point of insisting you have a&nbsp; valid Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C) Not sure about your games. I'm assuming you didn't bother trying to tech preview otherwise you'd have your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D) I'm sure lots of thing will be pre-installed. Yes you can remove IE but not Edge. Same goes for&nbsp; the other stuff some you can some you can't. I'm not sure why that matters. Just don't use those things. It's not like take up a lot of space.</p>

<p>Wait - so I can still get the free upgrade if I don't reserve it? What I was going to do was trial it on the Windows 7 computer, and then if it's good enough for me, and matches everything I want, I'd upgrade on my proper machine. I've checked, and it is
 Windows 7 home service pack 1, too.</p>

<h2>            PIN issue</h2>
                    <p>I have encountered a problem with WM10 on my 650 and the automatic updates and restarts. In the morning now and then, I have to re-enter my SIM PIN. That means that I have been unreachable for some ours. That is really bad as I see it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a workaround? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it's old school, but I don't want to turn of my PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I bought the phone, I was able to choose when to restart, but I can't find that setting after the latest update. I have turned off all automatic updates on apps, but it still restarts sometimes in the night.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to prevent a Word 2010 picture or drawing from printing temporarily&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Many publishing programs allow the user to toggle the properties of individual objects in the document.&nbsp; We are looking for a way to temporarily toggle the SHOW/HIDE or PRINT/DON'T PRINT attributes of individual photos or drawings in a Word 2010 document.&nbsp;
 Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one example for this feature would be when creating a form letter&nbsp;or&nbsp;template that included a letterhead graphic.&nbsp; When printing to paper stock with a preprinted logo or letterhead, the user could simply turn OFF the printing attribute&nbsp;for the graphic.&nbsp;
 On the other hand, when printing to blank paper stock, the user could simply&nbsp;turn ON the print attribute so that&nbsp;the logo or letterhead graphic&nbsp;would print on the blank stock.</p>
<p>

    <title>Cancelled Sync Deleted OneNote Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebastianpantin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cancelled Sync Deleted OneNote Folder</h2>
                    <p>The problem: a failed syncing process deleted a OneNote folder completely, the only trace of it is the file I have pinned in under the "Open NoteBook" place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before clarifying the issue I'd like to state that I have already checked Open Backups, OneDrive, and both types of NoteBooks, the desktop app and the regular app, and even the Recycle Bin. I am almost certain the file has just been completely erased, but
 would like to be assured of this, just to know nothing can be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, onto the clarification. I have all of my OneNote folders saved locally, so that there is no automatic syncing, or any syncing that can take place, as far as I am aware, since I don't believe it syncing can occur when&nbsp; files aren't connected to the Drive.
 When I created a new folder, for some odd reason, it attempted to sync, but could not do it, as the little circle and 'x' symbol was next to the folder. I initially ignored it, but eventually I went to press the folders 'Notebook sync status' to 'Sync Now',
 and since nothing was happening (remember, I don't believe files can sync when saved locally) I pressed 'Cancel Sync', which closed the 'Shared Synchronization Window' and deleted the folder which was failing to sync. Again, the only evidence left that this
 folder ever existed was in the recently opened file sections of OneNote, of which I have uploaded a screenshot, but when I press open, it obviously cites the error that the file no longer exists in the location I have attempted to open it from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, the folder itself was not of great importance, and I'm citing this question mainly to know if anything&nbsp;<em>can</em> be recovered, or if it is truly lost.
</p>

<p>Hi Sebastian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, it appears to be that the Folder/NoteBook that you've created on OneNote is beyond recovery. For additional information, OneNote only uses

 created will automatically stored on OneDrive.</p>

<p>What you call a OneNote folder is by definition called a OneNote <strong>notebook</strong>.</p>

</p><p><strong>All</strong> OneNote notebooks get synced, even the locally stored notebooks. Sync means that changes are synced from the local OneNote cache to the notebook's master, where ever it is stored.</p>

</p><p>I assume you created the new notebook without paying attention where it should be created. The default place for new notebooks created in OneNote 2016 is OneDrive. If you create it without a working sync (your case) you create a volatile one.</p>
<p>If for any reason this notebook gets closed (seems your case) it's lost.</p>

<h2>            One Note 2010 file cannot be read in OneNote 2007</h2>
                    I changed the properties in OneNote 2010 at school so that the default format is One Note 2007. Then I brought the file home and tried to open it with One Note 2007 and it wouldn't open.: same error message as before.

            Setting the default format is not sufficient. Existing notebooks must be converted explicitely:<br />

            OK. I will try that when I get to school and let you know.
<div><br />
<div>Can you help with a few other OneNote 2010 questions?</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>1. I keep my notebooks in Dropbox wo I can open them at home (with 2007) or at school (now with 2010). At school, when I click to open one of my old 2007 notebooks
 in Dropbox, OneNote 2010 opens and says there aren't any notebooks. They still open fine at home from OneNote 2007.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
2. I use OneNote with a smart board and my students and I need the pens on the sidebar (most of us can't reach up to the top of the smart board, at least not easily). Is there a way to put the pens toolbar back on the left side where ti was in 2007? That old
 left toolbar with pens and erasers and colors was SO useful and we used it almost every day in every class.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. Often during class, I clicked on file-export as pdf and so had class notes ready to upload to the website. Is there a 2-click way to get a page onto my desktop in OneNote 2010? I liked being able to do that so quickly at the end of class.&nbsp;</span></div>

            #1:<br />
Do you see your notebooks within the Dropbox folder ? Double click one of the sections (.one file) of a notebook in explorer. Should open the whole notebook in ON 2010.<br />

            #1: I see the notebooks in DB. I haven't tried clicking on a section, just on the notebook. I will try clicking on a section.
<div><br />
<div>#2: Putting the pen tools on the QAT below the ribbon is still way up at the top of the toolbar, very high, I guess you're telling me the QAT is my only option and that's not an option that can be moved along the left side of ON, just above or below the
 ribbon.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>#3: So export as pdf may be one of the commands I can put on the QAT? If so, that's great.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate your replies, but it's looking like ON 2007 is still better for me that 2010. I'll see if my tech guy can reinstall it.</div>
