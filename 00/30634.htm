<h2>            Windows 10 reboot loop after attempted update</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago my laptop, which has been running windows 10 since it came out but originally came with windows 8, downloaded an update. I turned it off and it began installing the update. After restarting a few times and getting to 30%, it started restarting
 and wouldn't get past the 30% screen, and after a few seconds on that screen it restarts, doing this for hours with no progress. The situation at this point is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I tried was startup repair. It couldn't be completed. Windows restore doesn't work either as it says there are no restore points, though I vaguely remember having one some time ago. Tried to refresh the PC, it can't be completed either. Tried
 booting from a windows 10 USB I created using a tool made for it (From microsoft), and though I can boot, I can't use any of the repair options on there because they can't be completed. I have also tried the command prompt with the bootrec commands (rebuildbcd,
 scanos and a few others from another topic from here about restart loops), however I believe those might not be working since scanos and rebuildbcd tell me the number of windows installations is 0. I have also tried to fix that by following instructions from
 another post on here, yet the result is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the point where I'm at, I can't get to windows, can't get into safe mode (it reboots when I try), can't use the repair tools I've tried. Can you give me any more suggestions? THe laptop is an HP ProBook 4540s, it was working perfectly up until this
 last update and I do need the files that are in it, so I am hoping to get back into it instead of wiping the whole thing.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Powering the computer on and off didn't work, it's always the same, boots up to the update then resets on its own. I can access the Refresh this PC and Reset this PC options through the HP menu right after I start the computer, however
 the Refresh option, which allows me to keep my files, doesn't work. As for the Reset this PC option accessed this way, it doesn't allow me to keep my files.</p>

            Hi Joseph_440, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Please take a look at this article and let me know if it helps.

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App

<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . . .

<h2>            Microsoft Work Account was overwritten when signing in to old hotmail account online</h2>
                    The company I work for provided a laptop for me and when I set it up I used the Email address that is connected to my Microsoft Work Account and work email address. I signed into my old hotmail account online one day and ever since the laptop owner and
 administrator changed from my work account to my hotmail account, which was completely unintentional and does not comply with my company's standards. I tried to remove that hotmail account from that laptop since I can't have anything private associated on
 there but it will not let me. What do I have to do to change the Administrator and owner back to my company account and block the hotmail account forever, Thanks

<h2>            MSDN Premium License</h2>
                    <div>My company has an MSDN Premium License and I had a few questions regarding it. &nbsp;I understand that it's licensed to only 1 person and that is why I need to ask these before proceeding.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We currently have 2 developers on our team. &nbsp;I use out MSDN license and the other developer has a VS 2010 Professional license from separate purchase (not MSDN license). &nbsp;We have Visual Source Safe and have been experiencing some issues with it and would
 like to install Team Foundation Server. &nbsp;But before we do this, I'd like to know:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.) Will our other developer be able to connect to TFS even though they do not have an MSDN License?</div>
<div>2.) Can I use a Windows Server 2008 R2 license from our MSDN to install TFS on?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All of our development remains in-house and we do not sell or give away any of our applications to our customers. &nbsp;If anyone can help me with this, it would be greatly appreciated.</div>

    <title>Network adapter turns off when laptop is unplugged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> voldiemorty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network adapter turns off when laptop is unplugged</h2>
                    <p>So I wanted my laptop to connect to my 5GHz network because I heard that it doesn't interfere with bluetooth connections, but it couldn't detect my 5GHz network even though my phone could. I did some searching and I saw that someone's managed to detect it
 once he uninstalled and reinstalled his network adapter, so that's what I did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled my network adapter in device manager and reinstalled it by clicking "scan for hardware changes" (I'm not sure if this is how you're supposed to reinstall it. Maybe this is where the problem lies?) My network adapter is Realtek RTL8822BE 802.11ac
 PCIe Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway since then my network adapter would turn off only when my laptop is unplugged, and my latency in games has been noticeably higher (before anyone mentions this the "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" option is already unchecked).
 I've already tried doing a network reset twice but to no avail. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!</p>

            Hi, thanks for all the suggestions. I did a DISM health restore and the Windows Update troubleshooting also came up with a result, which just got me to restart my laptop. I also used the networking commands found in suggestion D such as netsh winsock reset
 and the others. However, my situation still doesn't seem to be improving. Unfortunately, I'm also unable to roll back the driver.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does the issue persist with printing? </p>
<p>2. Are you presented with an error message when you try to scan? </p>
<p>3. Are you using a software to perform a scan? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue could happen if the Windows Image Acquistion service is not enabled. There can also be an issue if the scanner software has become corrupted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kodak ESP C310</strong> seems compatible with Windows 8.1</p>

            I have a Kodak ESP Office 2170 that worked flawlessly with Windows 7, scanning and printing. After installing windows 8.1 it will print, and it will initiate scanning, but then process the scan indefinitely presenting a dialogue box that tells me to wait
 while it finishes the scan. &nbsp;The current record is 12 hours. &nbsp;I then shut it all down with task manager. &nbsp;I have check version currency and uninstalled and re-installed the software several times. &nbsp;Any ideas?

And you downloaded and installed the latest software/drivers from Kodak for the device from Kodak (those who manufactured and support the device)?<br />

            <p><span>I too am having the exact problem described. I have the Kodak ESP C310 printer installed on windows 8.1 Upon installing the latest drivers which was Version&nbsp; 7.8&nbsp; Upon install it asks you to scan for the printer at the end of the software installation.
 It gets 3/4 the way through the scan and then stays there forever. I had to then close the installation by clicking end task in task manager. Id noticed despite ending it this manner it seemed to have actually have installed itself.<br />
<br />
So through search I opened the Kodak programme I tried to scan again both by USB cable and through WIFI and it just wont pick up the printer.<br />
<br />
However I then noticed on the webpage of the latest driver update it says NOTE: </span>

<strong>Operating System, 64-bit</strong>, is not supported. </p>
<p><span><br />
My laptop is 64 bit. I had checked on Microsoft that Windows 8.1 supported my printer before Id bought it so its very frustrating. I guess you guys check 64 bit part too.</span></p>
<p>______</p>
<p><span>It is very confusing because within the link below it says 64 bit it is supported and it mentions the scan issue mentioned by me and this poster that is fixed.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry to hear this, Mike. The message "not supported on 64-bit" usually indicates that there is no 64-bit driver, only 32-bit. While Scan apps can be either 32-bit or 64-bit on 64-bit Windows&nbsp;the Scan drivers need to be 64-bit, there is no other way....

            ok, now I really feel stupid. It seems the computer is fine. In the game of hearts, if some one gets the queen of spades and all the hearts, it's called shooting the moon and everyone (but that persone) gets 26 points.

    <title>White static fuzzy lines in background&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codyisadork  say:</h3>
<h2>            White static fuzzy lines in background&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have my XBox 360 Slim hooked up to my 73 Inch 3D HDTV via the Component Cables, and when I turn it on, there's white, fuzzy static in the background. I've tried adjusting my display settings to no avail. No matter what resolution I choose, the white fuzzy
 interference is still there. The TV is a Mitsubishi 73 Inch 120Hz DLP 1080p 3D TV in case you need that info. The TV is brand new, and only my XBox 360 has this issue.

<p>Hey there Cody! For testing purposes, could you try hooking your console up to a different TV with the same cables, and the same TV with different cables? Also try out different types of cables, like the regular AV or HDMI. Let me know the results of these
 tests as this can help narrow down the cause of your troubles. Thanks! </p>

<p>Just hurry and send it in for repairs if you still have your warranty. or else it's gonna cost you $100. I have the slim also. and I'm not getting any help from microsoft unless I pay them. &nbsp;instead of white static I got red squiggles(E82 error, alot like
 #74), just before receiving an error code(surprisingly no red squiggles durring that screen). Apparently this so called "accessory defect" affects the console alone, and they say it will have to be sent it to be repaired. But' I'm gonna wait until I get more
 info on the subject before letting them benefit from me in any way at all.</p>

</p><p>good morning&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p><span>It is often the case that these computers run slow or sometimes they don't connect with required programs very quickly programs that control inventory like SAP, payroll, email, training applications, multiple printers for labeling,
 along with connecting with family and such like that.</span></p>
<p><span>There are times that we release the shift prior to us and the operator forgot to log off the network/computer and the only way we can logon the in as hard shutdown by depressing in the on/off button until the computer shuts
 down then we restart the computer and the software will allow us to enter our credentials to use the computer.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>Make sure you save everything from your account on the old computer before following the below</p>

</p><p>if he is not an administrator you should make him on (assumes you are an admin) by going into the user control panel (win key +"X"&gt;control panel&gt;user accounts control panel)</p>

            Hello, I see that you want to save Microsotfts default wallpaper. You may do so by going into Windows Explorer, and going into the following directory. 
<br />C:\Windows\Web
<br />There should be the photos that you want! Just copy the photos over to where ever you wish to move to!

            Hi Ernie
<br />
<br />Those are Windows Spotlight images - they are provided by the Microsoft servers!
<br />
<br />Please post a photo of those images and I will try to locate those for you
<br />
<br />Your best option is to search the web for Windows Spotlight images and a quick description of the image to find that file
<br />
<br />If you have trouble finding those, there is a good collection of those images on this page:

            Windows 10 which includes DirectX 12 includes the necessary run times for older versions of DirectX. So, you should be able to install older games using compatibility mode.

            It probably has nothing to do with your problem but the Windows 7 64 bit driver for the PIXMA MP530 at the Canon website has a file name of&nbsp; mp530win64111ej.exe
<br />
That is from (warning if using Internet Explorer 9 you will have to use Compatibility View for the site to work correctly):&nbsp;

            <p>I did check the Task Manages (30 years experience in IT) and it was Windows Update that occupied the memory - especially when Antimalware.exe was running the PC slowed almost to a standstill. This while I was working remotely on&nbsp;a rather serious business
 issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the option you gave for turning automatic updates off does not exist in my version of Windows 10. I can select 'Automatic Updates' or 'Notify When to Restart'. The last is the currently selected option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can it be that the Windows Update is confused by the Time settings?</p>
<p>Timezone GMT+1 (Amsterdam) with country set to 'United Kingdom'. This last to avoid the 'user-friendly' functionality that will automatically give Dutch language in a number of places...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some logic to how it selects the time for downloading and installing the updates. That the keyboard and mouse are in constant use should be enough, but that does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 - Desktop Custom Folder Icons Automatically Turn Back To - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mxbn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - Desktop Custom Folder Icons Automatically Turn Back To Default Icon If Folder Is Not Empty</h2>
                    <p>After some poking around the 'Net I managed to change the Folder default icon to the one I prefer, but only for folders that are subdivisions of a volume.</p>
<p>For instance, when I click Drive C:, I see all folders have the icon I want; same with their subfolders.</p>
<p>As for the folders directly on the desktop, they have the new icon as long as they are empty. When I start populating them, they revert to the default icon. Same thing happens if I drag a folder from C: to the desktop. When I look at the Properties/Customize
 tab of a desktop folder (empty or populated) it always shows the icon it is supposed to have - my customized icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read and carefully implemented the instructions in this MS Support article&nbsp; http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2396571/en-us&nbsp;&nbsp; "Icons Change Incorrectly In Windows", to no avail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any knowledgeable advice will be highly appreciated</p>

            <p>Hi MxBn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue. Please answer these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Are the desktop icons on the computer set to view as thumbnails or large icons?</p>
<p>2) Which theme are you using on the computer? Is it a theme which you have downloaded from a third party website?</p>
<p>3) If this is the first time that you are facing this issue, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>4) Does this issue happens with all the available folder icons that you have set for the folders?</p>
<p>5) Does this happens with all the user accounts on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Rebuild the Icon Cache Database</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find that one or more of your icons are not displaying correctly, or that your Icon Cache is corrupted, you might want to rebuild the Icon Cache. The Icon Cache or “<strong><em>IconCache.db</em></strong>” is a special database file that Windows utilizes
 to keep copies of each icon handy. When Windows needs to draw an icon, it uses the copy from the cache instead of retrieving the icon image from the original application file. This helps in making Windows draw the icons faster. The Icon Cache file is located
 at: “<strong><em>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\IconCache.db</em></strong>”, where C is the drive where the Operating System is installed. To purge and rebuild the icon cache, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Click on “<strong><em>Start</em></strong>” button and type “<strong><em>cmd</em></strong>” in the search box.</p>
<p>b) Right click on “<strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong>” icon from the search results and then select “<strong><em>Run as administrator</em></strong>”</p>
<p>c) Copy the following commands and then right click in the Command Prompt window and select the option “Paste” from that menu to paste all the commands there, and then press “Enter”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong><em>taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>CD /d %userprofile%\AppData\Local</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>attrib –h IconCache.db</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>DEL IconCache.db /a</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><em>shutdown /r /f /t 00</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) Your computer will restart now automatically.</p>
<p>e) After the restart the Icon Cache will be rebuild automatically and then check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then I would suggest you to try the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: Changes to the size, view, icon or position of a folder are lost</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the article given below and run the troubleshooter given in it and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813711/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Changes to the size, view, icon or position of a folder are lost</a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 3: Create a new User Account and check if the issue persists there</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an additional user account on the computer, then check if the issue persists in that user account. If you only have one user account, then create another one and check if the issue persists with the new user account. To create a new user account
 on the computer, please refer to the article given below and follow the steps in it.</p>

            Just to add to the conversation:
<div><span>Product keys are never sold separately by Microsoft. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad,
 or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work
 for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen. The best way to get everything you expect up front is to buy&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Hardware.aspx#PCPurchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">genuine

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
We have various bugchecks from the attached DMP files, and from looking at it, it appears we're dealing with an antivirus conflict here... see:<br />
<br />
<u><b>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (1a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 1A, {<u><i><b>41201</b></i></u>, fffff68000019cf8, c835304500d525ab, fffffa8008efa290}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bugcheck is <i><b>41201</b></i> which indicates that an unknown memory management error occurred. This implies more likely software than actual physical RAM errors, however it is still very possible.<br />
<br />
Also, if we look at the process that was at the time of the crash: PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp;
<i><b>mbamservice.ex<br />
<br />
</b></i>Usually processes at the time of crashes don't mean anything, however, when it's an antivirus program providing real-time protection, it's a bit of a flag raiser.<i><b><br />
<br />
Now, if we move to the next DMP:<br />
<br />
</b></i><u><b>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (7a)</b></u><i><b><br />
<br />
</b></i>This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.
<i><b><br />
<br />
</b></i>ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS) 0 - STATUS_WAIT_0<i><b> -&nbsp; </b></i>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; <i>
<b>McSvHost.exe</b><b><br />
</b></i><i><b><br />
^^ </b></i>McSvHost.exe<i><b> </b></i>is in regards to McAfee.<i><b><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
</b></i>Remove McAfee ASAP - <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331</a><br />
<br />
You cannot have two real-time protection software running / installed at the same time, and I certainly don't recommend keeping McAfee over MBAM.<br />

<p>The MBAM was installed as suggested from a similar post on this site to find possible solutions to the Kernal error.&nbsp; But as you have suggested, I shall be removing McAfee.&nbsp; Will this resolve both problems (Kernel and Management Memory Error)?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is typically the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be helpful to pull down the latest driver for this device from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you buy this machine new or used?&nbsp; If it is new, then the machine should still be under warranty and you could contact them for assistance on the machines exact capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
