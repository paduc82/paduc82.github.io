                    <p>HI All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased Office 2013 in April - Business &amp; Home User and want to now add a new&nbsp;member of staff so she can use on another laptop as seperate user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I purchase a user licence (if so, how and where from?) or must i pay another £220 and download a new product key and software. Originally DL from Microsoft. Any ideas or guidance would be appreciated. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Olof and Nathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent now my morning to test this little bit more and came up with a solution/workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Olof mentioned default language of Sharepoint site cannot be changed, unless you practically rebuild your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I created a another test user in our local AD and&nbsp;<strong>added </strong>an attribute "preferredLanguage" for user with value "en-US".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9016d27-0f4b-4feb-a5d8-163d841f94f5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9016d27-0f4b-4feb-a5d8-163d841f94f5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When user is replicated to Azure/O365, this will add "English (United States)" as user default display language (you can find the setting in Delve -&gt; Update Profile -&gt; How can I change language and regional settings? -&gt; Click here -&gt; three ellipses -&gt; Language
 and Region):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7928d5d9-72b3-42d6-9e26-85c7ac43044d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7928d5d9-72b3-42d6-9e26-85c7ac43044d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>After this when you enable Known Folder Move to OneDrive, folders stay in English language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested this also with old user (already existing in our AD with OneDrive enabled w/o KFM). Added attribute and waited for sync to Azure. Default language was changed in O365 and Known Folder Move was enabled and working with English language. Only thing
 which is not tested is that&nbsp;<strong>IF </strong>user already have KFM enabled <strong>
and</strong> has other than English language folder names <strong>and</strong> you add the attribute, will it change folder names to English language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point we do not have the need for it, since we are in the beginning of the OneDrive / KFM path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>brgds</p>
<p>Kari</p>

<p>That worked perfectly. Thank you for your response.</p>

<h2>            Need Advice how to Stop Spam Emails from LinkedIn</h2>
                    I've been receiving email invitations to my outlook/Hotmail address&nbsp;from LinkedIn, showing the invitation is from a specific business and employee's name.&nbsp; I know who the business is. I phoned and told the employee about the emails.&nbsp; She claimed that she
 does not know about LinkedIn or the spam emails showing her name. I tried the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email, but it took me to a page stating I must log in to LinkedIn to verify that I am the owner of the email address. I believe I have never
 used this email address on LinkedIn. Maybe this is a way that LinkedIn harvests email addresses for sending more spam.&nbsp; LinkedIn got this businesswoman's name somehow.&nbsp; They most likely got my email address from her or someone else in her business, because
 I emailed that business a few months ago to inquire about their services (but I did not make use of their services).&nbsp; Either someone hacks into this company's emails and sells their customer email datab

    <title>4k UHD content in Microsoft Movies &#38; TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falstaff1596  say:</h3>
<h2>            4k UHD content in Microsoft Movies &#38; TV</h2>
                    Will there be 4k content published in Microsoft Movies &amp; TV? With the launch of the Xbox One S (and with the ready availability of monitors at 4k or near 4k resolution), it would be great if Microsoft's own media store supported this resolution. As of
 now, it seems my options to get 4k content are largely limited to Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube.

            Microsoft doesn't control that. &nbsp;People had to buy DVDs to replace VHS, they bought Blu Ray to replace DVDs and people will have to buy 4K to replace Blu Ray. &nbsp;Companies spend resources to remaster the movies so it wouldn't make financial sense as a business

            First the owners of the material would have to recreate the content in 4K. I doubt that most would bother even if they have higher resolution originals.

<p>Having an option to upgrade doesn't mean giving it away for free.</p>
<p>ie, revoke the Blu-ray license and get the 4K Blu-ray content for an additional fee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this would allow people to upgrade their library without constantly repurchasing the same thing over and over (who wants several different lower resolution films in their digital collection? it makes no sense). with physical media you could at least flog
 the older copies, but on digital an upgrade path should be offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>people are more likely to spend a fiver on an upgrade than 15 on a duplicated version of something they already have. this would push for hardware upgrades and probably push for content sales. I will certainly not repurchase content I already have. I would
 upgrade it if the price was fair.</p>

<p>What he is asking for isn't totally unrealistic.&nbsp; I don't remember which company&nbsp;(one was Warner Bros)&nbsp;it was but one of the studios allowed you to send in old copies of your DVDs to be replaced for Blu-Rays for a small fee.&nbsp; It was the best of both worlds
 for the studios that participated because they knew they could squeeze a little extra out of almost everyone.&nbsp; Only a true "movie buff" or "audiophile" would buy a movie on Blu-ray when they had the DVD.&nbsp; So don't just dismiss what he said.&nbsp; It has been done
 before and will probably happen again.</p>

            they can't necessarily but they could find a way, &nbsp;walmart allowed people to trade in their dvds and for an upgrade fee upgrade to HDX (1080p) via the Vudu app. &nbsp; So there is a way just some hoops they'd have to jump through with studios. &nbsp;

    <title>Print Preview in Word &#38; Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calla.carla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Preview in Word &#38; Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>In previous versions of Word &amp; Excel, when you hit print preview, you saw a full page of your document with the ability to see successive pages.&nbsp; You could read the document and see how everything lined up and make changes to the page set up.</p>
<p>In 2016, you see a tiny unreadable version that is completely useless.</p>
<p>Am I missing some other way of accessing what I knew of as Print Preview in those earlier versions?</p>
<p>Help, I really need that function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below, I had to pick one product, so I chose Excel, but word has thew same problem.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 64 bit.</p>

            Have you tried the Zoom slider in the lower right corner of the print preview? Together with a maximized window, it gives an almost full-screen preview of your printed document.

            Thanks, I did try that.&nbsp; It is better than nothing, but&nbsp; it doesn't give you a clear view or the ability to adjust the page settings.&nbsp; I'm trying to produce professional looking invoices, statements, and letters that must be customized each time I use
 my templates. 2003 and 3007 were more useful than 2016 so far.

            Yes, this is not the default functionality. If you want this functionality, do following -
<br />
<br />You will need to add the Print Preview in all MS Office apps individually. The below step uses Excel as a name only.
<br />
<br />1. Open Excel 
<br />
<br />2. File &gt; Options &gt; Quick Access Toolbar &gt; Choose All Commands in Choose commands from &gt; Click on any entry in the lower box &gt; Press P to reach to entries starting with P &gt; Scroll down and select &gt; Select Print Preview Full Screen &gt; Add
<br />
<br />Now, this will be available in QAT i.e. in top bar of your Excel.
<br />
<br />You can press this button any time to get the required Print Preview which you need.

<p>I'm not sure what to suggest ...&nbsp;what has been done&nbsp;is what I would do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears as if some setting got wacked.&nbsp; I might consider doing a HArd Reset, installing Live Search first and checking to make sure all is fine.&nbsp; Then add back what you need...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at it this way, a Hard Reset is a perfect time to do some "Winter Cleaning"&nbsp; so all the junk you don't use is gone....</p>

            Why can't I print anything like emails or internet pages anymore? This all started after my last windows update this week. When I click print I get a Script Error message that states an error has occurred in the script on this page with the following info:
 Line: 1527, Char: 1, Error: Invalid argument, Code: 0, URL: res://ieframe.dll/preview.js.

            I am able to print other items from my computer as long it is not from the internet or my email. I use AOL and this has not been a problem until about 5 days ago when I received the latest windows update. I have tried updating updating my printer drivers
 but that did not solve the problem.

            This should not (and almost&nbsp;undoubtedly&nbsp;<i>cannot</i>) be the culprit. &nbsp;The printer is abstracted from the software being used to print, as Windows uses the XPS system to create the print roster from the program. &nbsp;There should not (and pretty much cannot)
 ever be a circumstance where you can print from one program but not another: the printer driver doesn't know or care which program did the printing.
<div><br />
<div>I'd be very intrigued to know if the user can print from another program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, the error that they mentioned, a javascript error, suggests that the issue is not the program (Internet Explorer), but a failure on the webpage, perhaps on the website's javascript link for "print this page". &nbsp;I bet if the user tapped Alt to show
 the menu bar, then chose File &gt; Print, it would work just fine.</div>

AOL software (including AOL Browser &amp; AOL Mail) and even Windows Live Mail uses the Internet Explorer print engine (as does Windows Mail in Vista &amp; Outlook Express in WinXP). Unfortunately, the vast&nbsp;majority of printer software has not yet been updated to work

    <title>Zune Software Customization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iarwired  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune Software Customization</h2>
                    I've been using the Zune Software for quite a while now, and I wonder about some things that are not deal-breaking, but makes sense to be included.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Custom colors for some parts of the interface (i.e. equalizer at the bottom etc.)</div>
<div>2. Custom images can be used as background for the different pages (i.e. Quickplay, Collection etc.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Perhaps these questions have been asked by some people, but I want to know personally some answers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi IARWired,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the question you have about customising Zune Software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure you have found this setting but there is an option to change the background in the software if you click on the settings option in the top right hand corner.&nbsp; In the Software menu, select display, there you can alter the background of the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding further customisation you can make your suggestions at the following link.&nbsp; Although this is a suggestion box for the Windows Phone, the phone does use Zune software to sync music and videos.</p>

<p>By default, gridlines don't print, nor do the column and row headers.</p>
<p>Select one or more sheets.</p>
<p>Activate the Page Layout tab of the ribbon.</p>
<p>Click the Print Titles button or click the little arrow in the lower right corner of the Page Setup section, then activate the Sheet tab.</p>
<p>Under Print, you'll find check boxes that let you specify whether gridlines and/or row and column headings will be printed.</p>
<p>Note: this is a sheet-level setting, it can be different for different sheets in a workbook.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to help you with your issue in sending emails. Let's find out what are the possible options that we can do to resolve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the bounce message you received, it turns out the email address that you are sending emails to is no longer existing or there's a problem with the email account.&nbsp;Check the email address to make sure that you got the e-mail address correct. If it
 still bounces, try contacting the recipient some other way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            OneNote doesn&#39;t always respond when in canvas mode</h2>
                    I use OneNote with my Surface Book quite a bit, more recently so while in canvas mode (screen flipped backward on base). There has been an issue where I'll be writing next to a PowerPoint slide that was printed to OneNote (anywhere between 10-20 slides
 on one page). I'll scroll down my OneNote notebook with my finger, and continue writing. Every so often when I go to scroll down further, the OneNote notebook will not respond to my finger scroll, and will refuse to respond until I tap the screen with my Surface
 Pen. Obviously I cannot use the keyboard or mouse to see if those will work since, in canvas mode, those are de-activated. Anyone know how to fix this issue?

            This is a service bug that is current affecting Sway users at this time. The only solution right now is to wait for a fix and keep trying periodically. 
<br />
<br />Honestly sorry for the inconvenience you are experiencing at this time.

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did Win7&nbsp;come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7, or did you upgrade from Vista to Win7?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />

<p>2. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?</p>

<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)?</p>

<p>And judging by the Comments &amp; Comment Statistics from users <em>like you</em>&nbsp;here

http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/vindale.com/event-35142#events</a>, I'd say that IE8's SmartScreen filtering &amp; AVG's&nbsp;Safe Search &amp; Identity Protection components&nbsp;are doing their job and properly protecting your computer! [1]</p>

    <title>Bring the Skype &#34;Classic&#34; Features to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ishaan awasthi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring the Skype &#34;Classic&#34; Features to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Looks like the "classic" Skype users <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-skype-for-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
will be forced soon to switch completely to the Win 10 version</a>. Not sure that it is decent replacement – I've been using Skype for more than 10 years and feeling lack of important features in this new version I’m used to use. Seems MS is trying to conquer
 the teens with this «restyling» – bad attempt because they have lots of more popular alternatives; but the «old» users’ loyalty is being lost rapidly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless there’s still a chance to keep the loyal users by bringing the most important and useful „classic’s“ Skype functions to the Win 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>No access to the old history!</strong> It’s possible to open the chat’s history from the beginning in the “classic” Skype while the “new” one allows scrolling up to the last several months’ messaging. And the navigation via the history is much more
 convenient – the same should be available in the “new” Skype.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d61866cb-26e4-48b0-a274-a18d579f123c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d61866cb-26e4-48b0-a274-a18d579f123c?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>No ability to export the chats history.</strong> Starting from the Skype v.12 for the Windows 10 the chats history is stored in the “skype.db” file whereas the other versions keep it in the “main.db”. As a result, now it’s impossible no import the
 history just by replacing of the “main.db” file. And it would be very cool to be able to import the full chats history to all other devices where Skype is running e.g. via Dropbox, OneDrive, Skype for web etc.</li><li><strong>No contacts lists.</strong> I have hundreds of contacts and all of them are distributed by various lists together with the group chats related to the contacts in the list. It would be a disaster to get them as a single list.</li><li><strong>No in-chat search</strong> <em>(like in the “classic” Skype)</em>. Irreplaceable feature when you know what and where to search. The “general” search returns too much rubbish so very difficult to find what you need.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20f6f347-d962-42d2-9b12-7bb329ce5173?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20f6f347-d962-42d2-9b12-7bb329ce5173?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>The renamed contacts are not searchable.</strong> I often rename the contacts and the “general” search doesn’t return them after that when typing either initial or changed contact’s name. Looks like a bug.</li><li><strong>Bring back the contact’s time.</strong> Was very useful feature when the contact’s time was displaying at the chat’s toolbar. As many of my “contacts” live and work in different time zones it was easy to find the best time to call or message them.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So Skype has several months to improve the situation. Otherwise it will share the destiny of the MSN messenger...</p>

            These are wonderful and very useful features that make the whole Skype experience better.&nbsp; I would also like to add a feature that used to exist and one that I have been asking for in this forum for well over a year (only to be told that it has been sent
 on to the developers) is the ability to sort your contacts to see you has their status set to 'Available or Active' rather than defaulting to the Most recent.<br />

<p>I agree 100%. Also adding that features such as individual chat windows instead of all in the same one or the ability to customize your font was a nice additional feature.&nbsp;<br />
With all other options, I remained loyal to skype because it is familiar and have been using it for 10 years. But if it decides to change I might change too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some other features that I feel should be added...</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Disabling the call box that appears at top right.</strong> Even if you close it if you tab into skype and then tab out it reopens.</li><li><strong>Sharing system sound without sharing your screen.</strong></li><li><strong>Moving position of chat box while in call.</strong> In classic skype you have your contacts on the left and chat box on the right however you can only have 1 opened and both are on the left in windows 10 skype.</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>What options do you see when you right click on that number from the recent list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see an add number option, try to right click and select view profile. From there you will have an option to save the number from the profile window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not seeing an option to save the number&nbsp;in the profile window, try to just click the number from the left column or recent tab, then from the chat screen, there should be a save number option under the number from the upper left part of the chat
 screen.</p>

<p>Yes, agree 100%. These features are important for some of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the lists too, I had students in different lists, from different courses and different years, it was very useful. But, I need to add one more...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can no longer copy the skype name of my contacts. I used to open the profile and be able to highlight name, right click with the mouse on the name and copy, now this is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to do these to send the skype names of students to tutors and it will be very time consuming to be checking and typing every single one onto an email.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please look into this as well.</p>
<p>

<p>Reverted to Skype 7.</p>
<p>Not using Skype 8 as much as possible, as it is really not nice/comfortable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't split windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chats always scroll down if I'm replying while "behind" in conversation (replying as I go through what the other person said since last time I replied).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other user's replies show as Black background, which makes it REALLY hard to read (I change only switch to Dark mode, so their replies appear White and mine appear Dark, but it is still not comfortable to read).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts list have even less flexibility than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And a number of other minor things that I hated as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I usually try to accept updates and rarely downgrade stuff (if I ever did..), but this time… I have no other choice.</p>
<p>I'll be rejecting the upgrade until you guys get enough complaints and fix….<br />

            Thanks, but I did both of those things. &nbsp;I submitted my question on the Family Safety forum and I set my default search provide to Bing. &nbsp;I finally decided to just uninstall Family Safety and purchase software that I can rely on.

            Let me rephrase my reply: &nbsp;I submitted my question on a Family Safety forum BECAUSE I was having issues with Family Safety which I had already downloaded on all of my home computers.

<p><br />
Then BING would be used in Search from the Address bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you also have Search Suggestions enabled for the BING provider you might be seeing its effects on a different host name than the main one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you would need to disable Search Suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;
 E.g. via Options, Programs, Manage Add-ons, Search Providers.</p>

    <title>How to make individual cells automatically add up numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make individual cells automatically add up numbers</h2>
                    <p>This is not asking about the SUM function. &nbsp;I am not trying to add up a number of different cells to get a grand total. &nbsp;Here is what I am trying to do. &nbsp;If you have a cell with a number in it and you need to add another number to it, you go to the formula
 bar, put an '=' in the front of the original number then put a '+' after the original number &amp; then your new number so your formula would look like this: &nbsp;=1+1 &nbsp;and you would get '2.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, so good. &nbsp;What I used to be able to do back in Office 2003 (though I can't remember how I did that anymore) was highlight an entire row and somehow tell the computer that I didn't need to add in the '=' every time I added numbers to the various cells
 in that row. &nbsp;I could just enter in '+(whatever number)' and the computer would automatically know to add that number to whatever number was already there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be done in Excel 2010?</p>

<p>
</p><p>No Excel can't do that. You have choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Manually add the vale.</p>
<p>2. use a formula in another cell =A2+25</p>
