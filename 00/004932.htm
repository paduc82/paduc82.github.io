            <p>One possibility is that&nbsp; <em>chase.com</em>&nbsp; may not be sufficiently precise as a method for trying to get signed on.&nbsp; E.g. they probably redirect to somewhere more specific but the redirection could fail or it could complicate the sign-in.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I tried using&nbsp; chase.com&nbsp; and got redirected here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.chase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.chase.com/</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Sign-in button there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes here</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://chaseonline.chase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://chaseonline.chase.com/</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Its certificate was issued to&nbsp; <em>apply.chase.com</em>&nbsp; That may or may not cause a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Developer Tools, Console tab (F12, Ctrl-2) shows there is some sloppy coding being done there and other questionable practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you are getting that far, try turning on the Developer Tools, Console tab yourself and see what happens next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

    <title>Invalid tracking and nothing in purchase history&#47; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> logic01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invalid tracking and nothing in purchase history&#47;</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded Office 2010 Home &amp; Student to re-install after hard drive replacement. &nbsp;During the process I order a backup DVD. &nbsp;All seemed to be good, I received receipt via email, card charged correct amount and I received email notification of
 shipment the next day. &nbsp;So far no problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the tracking number furnished in the shipping notification is not valid. &nbsp;It is 30 digits long. &nbsp;USPS does not recognize it as a valid number. &nbsp;The number is also too long to be a UPS number. &nbsp;What is more distressing is that upon checking the order
 status I find no history of the order being placed. &nbsp;I placed a call to Microsoft Support and talked by telephone to a woman with what sounded like an Indian accent that I had trouble understanding who eventually told me that the order is good and I should
 receive the disc in 5-7 business days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave her the tracking number and she verified that it was invalid. &nbsp;She actually told me I gave her a number that was too long. &nbsp;Of course, I told her that it was the number that Microsoft had sent to me, but I'm not sure if she actually understood my
 concern about receiving an invalid tracking number for my order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my question: &nbsp;Has anyone else had a similar issue when purchasing something from Microsoft or should I be concerned about some sort of fraudulent activity? &nbsp; The heading on both the receipt and shipping notification showed them as being from Microsoft
 (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). Should I be worried?</p>

                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got an email from an unknown address that included an image attachment.&nbsp; For some reason Outlook displays the preview for this image.&nbsp; This concerns me as there is always the possibility that a malicious actor can somehow exploit the image format
 to execute some code on my machine.</p>

<h2>            Pictorial Directory Project</h2>
                    I am trying to develop a pictorial directory for the community in which I live. &nbsp;How do I set-up a template for a picture and text for each person? &nbsp;I had a template but was corrupted. &nbsp;The bigger problem is that the directory is edited each year and many
 people have left and many more have to be added. &nbsp;This creates a situation where each picture and associated text has to be moved to another location to keep everything alphabetical. &nbsp;Is them some way the information can be placed in a table or something where
 deletions will automatically cause the data below to move to up to the correct location? &nbsp;Help!

            <p>Hi Kam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I wouldn't shy away from using Word for a community directory and the reason I say that is in my experience community directories are usually more than just names, address and pictures. They often have a cover page, acknowledgement page, a TOC
 (table of contents), and maybe even business card advertising in the back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the body of the directory I suggest a 3-column table with each row of the table being a family in the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first column would contain the last name of the family and the column is "hidden" so that it will not be printed but can be used for sorting. The second column contains the name, address, and phone number of the family. And the final (third) column contains
 the picture the person or family provides you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make each row of this multi-row table consistent, you set the height of the row to be "Exactly X measurement high." When you insert the picture the family supplies, this will then automatically resize it to fit and you will have consistently sized rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people leave, you simply delete their row. New community member rows can be easily added at the end of the table and then the entire table selected and resorted based on the non-printing column one value (last name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
        </p>

<p>1) Is this best done all in Word where the directory fields are added in a table, or does this involve Excel in creating the fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 )I 'm stymied as to how to handle photos as a field similar to the data fields. &nbsp;</p>

            Just tried a simple fix recommend by Microsoft and in my case it worked. Basically, one reason for the stop code is out of date software causing conflicts. So, I updated everything and have not seen that blue-screen since.

<p>Hi Alasdair,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please firstly check if you can activate Office 2016 for Mac with your work/school account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you cannot activate the Office applications or the download page doesn’t display more than 24 hours since you assigned license to your work/school account, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Access<a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this URL</a> to capture a screenshot of the left Software Panel.<br />
2. Access <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this URL</a> to capture a screenshot of your subscription.<br />
3. <span>Navigate to the Office 365 admin center and
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
re-assign the license to your account</a>. Check if the download page display and the application can be activated</span>.（Normally it is not suggested to re-assign licenses, especially we should not re-assign Exchange Online licenses. It may cause some unexpected
 issue.(<em>Modified at April 27th)</em>）&nbsp;<br />
4. Click the app launcher button on the top left, capture a screenshot of the tiles.<br />
5. Some tenant information. For privacy protection, I have sent you a private message to collect the tenant information. You can find the message via the URL
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.&nbsp;<br />

<p>you don't understand how things work. apps in the stores aren't made by google or apple or Microsoft. they're made by other companies - the stores are just marketplaces. if a company like snapchat refuses to make their app for windows, Microsoft can't go
 and make a fake snapchat app - they would be in legal troubles. additionally, if Microsoft started making apps for other companies, why would anyone else make their own app? "just get Microsoft to do it for free", that's what they'd think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"make a tool that we can install other apps" - that's not realistic, not legal, not going to happen.</p>
<p>if you want to run android apps, get an android phone.</p>

            I have been using a Windows Phone for a few years now and love it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, like a lot of other people, I'm seeing more and more apps that I've depended on disappearing for the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; What Microsoft could do would be to help subsidize the major or key
 mobile software developers to provide support for the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; That may seem like a big expense but face it, the more apps the more market share they'll start to capture.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I fear is that MS will do what it has done with so many other good products it's
 created over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is discontinue them instead of learning how to market and sell them.

            I had an Android phone initially and switched over to a Windows phone because the apps I was using were available and I hate supporting Google.&nbsp; The biggest let down was&nbsp;when Bank of America stopped supporting the Windows phone and I had to start making
 trips to an ATM to make deposits.&nbsp; Then, Craigslist dropped support and a number of other apps&nbsp;I was using discontinued support.&nbsp; I've used MS video editing products in the past only to have them discontinued, software development tools same thing, Streets
 and Trips... defunct.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, remember Zune?&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a bad history of supporting their products and their market share of phones show it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook will not open emails from scanner</h2>
                    <p>I am IT and work in an office with a network printer. One of my isers uses the 365 online portal to send and recive emails. Outlook on 2 seperate browsers will not open the emails from the network scanners. I've looked in their blocked addresses and nothing
 there. It has no problems with scanned document emails from other network printers from our sister office. Other users in the office don't have this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the email its blank and then after a minute just shows the subject. &nbsp;This only started this morning and the user said it was fine yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a way it was resolved. I installed Office 2016 onto the computer and they were able to open those emails. I am unsure if the online portal is still malfunctioning.&nbsp;</p>

Greetings Graceb!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access Forums!
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would ensure that you have ActiveSync (AS) setup to sync your contacts.&nbsp; Click on the AS program on your PC desktop (you should be able to see the icon for it down on your taskbar near the clock)&nbsp;and click on options button.&nbsp; Then,
 on the Sync Options tab, you'll see all the different items available for syncronizing.&nbsp; Please ensure that there is a check-mark next to Contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there wasn't one there to begin with, then this was your problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there was one there already, please uncheck it and then Sync your BJII.&nbsp; After successfully sync'ing, go back to the same setting and re-enable Contacs, and Sync again.&nbsp; Let us know if this resolves your problem...</p>

            From Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Configuration check that Preferred access point is correct (for your operator). Also try if activating Default in all apps -setting makes any difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
If doesn't work with operator access point try the following (still in Configuration -menu) select Personal settings &gt; Add (or Options &gt; Add new if there are settings already). Create a new Access point and Web configuration with default settings (default names
 created are My access point and My web. Then select My access point as Preferred access point, Personal config as Default config settings and also activate Default in all apps -setting. Then try e.g. using Communities again.

    <title>Freezing up of Word 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim_oliver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing up of Word 365</h2>
                    I bought into Office 365. the Word portion of it freezes for up to 30 seconds everytime I do a task, such as saving, comparing documents and so on. From reading these comments, this has been going since 2014? That is a long time for an issue not to be
 resolved! To be fair, I am running an HP Pavillion with Win 10 but it's non-native Win 10. I upgraded during the big giveaway. I wonder if that is a cause of the issue? I've repaired and reinstalled but the problem seems to be getting worse.

            1. Open Word &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Keep going down till you reach Display section &gt; Check Disable hardware graphics acceleration
<br />
<br />2. Below are possible troubleshooting steps from Micosoft
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-get-a-stopped-working-error-when-I-start-Office-2016-or-2013-applications-on-my-PC-52bd7985-4e99-4a35-84c8-2d9b8301a2fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-get-...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, this is caused due to Word not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.
<br />
<br />5. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />6.  Run Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool 2.2 to list down problem issues

            No, it is not Win 10 specific. Apparently it is now a "feature" &lt;sarcasm&gt; of Word/Office (happens in other Office apps).  My (unsupported) suspicion is that it has to do with the "click to run" technology. Office 2010, when CTR first invaded is when I started to notice it.

    <title>unable to login to rms server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w.raak  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to login to rms server</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are using MAC OS X 10.6.8, with Office for MAC 2011 connected to MS Exchange 2010 SP1 rollup v5. Both MAC OS X and Office for MAC are up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have 10+ users on MacBookPro, when they receive restricted RMS messages they get a message:</p>
<p>Your credentials must be verified before you can access this message. If I click Verify Credentials, get a box:</p>
<p>Enter your user name and password for the following server: rms.corp.phantom.com, where: company name = domain name = phantom</p>
<p>phantom\username </p>
<p>or corp.phantom.com\username </p>
<p>or rms.corp.phantom.com\username and password none seem to work. The prompt just shows right backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i try to go to Options (under new message) Permissions drop down&nbsp;and Manage Credentials and try; i am asked for fully qualified network username:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** i&nbsp;get: Office for MAC cannot connect to the rights management services server</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** i get: the same prompt as if i was clicking on Verify Credentials which goes into a loop if i do domain\username</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** cannot connect</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** cannot connect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously this works without issue on WINDOWS 7 computers running outlook 2010, and under manage credentials the account is listed as:
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like this is somehow certificate related. For example when we configured communicator/lync we downloaded a set of certificates: CA certificate; user certificate.</p>
<p>if anyone could point me in the right direction would be much appreciated. currently the users can go to OWA to get these emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            How to remove header and footer from blank end-of-chapter page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a blank page at the end of a chapter, which should have no header (book title) or footer (page number).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I achieve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove either, the headers and footers get removed from the entire chapter.</p>

            Headers/Footers are Section properties... In order to vary H/F the document must be divided into Sections using
<strong>Section Breaks</strong>. You can then specify the properties for H/F in each individual Section. See Word 2016 Help on the topic:

            <p>The book uses section breaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is fine if the last page of the chapter is on the recto page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if the last page is on the verso, I have issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I put in a section break at the end of the recto, then one on the verso.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this leaves the footer on the verso being somehow attached to the following page. So whatever I do to the first page of the new chapter, also affects the preceding verso, which should be completely blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>

<h2>            Problem exporting contacts from outlook to csv file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I try to export contacts from outlook to a csv file, the data in the name field appears in the spreadsheet with a % symbol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g. &nbsp; Smith, %John %</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other fields are okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it something to do with the way the contacts have been entered into Outlook? &nbsp;(Manually, one by one, over the years).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit of a tech numbskull and I apologise if this is a question with an obvious answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Going to take a guess and say you dragged over the field called &lt;Name&gt; instead of the individual fields that comprise the name field (click the + sign beside the field to see the component parts).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The &lt;Name&gt; field (FullName on the contact detail screen) is a "derived" field from the component parts and formatted according to the default setting for the FullName field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seldom if ever should a &lt;Root&gt; field (one with a + sign beside it) be selected for export.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you didn't select it this go round - just means that you didn't explicitly select which fields you wanted to export by clicking on the &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; button when it was presented which in turn means that Outlook just used the settings from the
 last export done - however long ago that may have been.</p>

    <title>switchboard to form in datasheet view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russell packett  say:</h3>
<h2>            switchboard to form in datasheet view</h2>
                    All,<br />
<br />
I am wondering if it is possible to use a switchboard and have it open a form in datasheet view (which is how I have designed the form)<br />
<br />
It appears if I open the form the traditional way...... using the navigation pane it opens... in datasheet view.<br />
<br />
However, if I try to open the same form using a switchboard it open in a traditional form view.<br />
<br />
I can manually switch it to datasheet view but it sure would be helpful if it opened the way I had intended it to.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

            <p>If you are using the "built in" switchboard, you would need to create a VBA procedure or a macro to open the form in datasheet view and then call the procedure from the button on the switchboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VBA would basically be</p>
<p>Public Function fOpenMyForm()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "NameOfForm", acFormDS</p>
<p>End Function</p>

    <title>Why does clicking BLOCK SENDER in Outlook 2016 move the email back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does clicking BLOCK SENDER in Outlook 2016 move the email back into the JUNK EMAILS folder and why not into DELETED&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'd actually prefer that it just not even download&nbsp;anymore emails at all from that Sender and just leave it alone so I can Delete it myself.<br />
After all, I've had to get tricky and create my own little "Junk Emails so links work" folder that I move stuff manually into from the normal Junk Email folder so that I can click REPLY ALL and find out &amp; Copy which&nbsp;of my email addresses this particular email
 was sent to and then I can close that and click UNSUBSCRIBE (which now works since the email is no longer in the Junk Email folder) and I then can Paste that email address into their box and unsubscribe from it.<br />
What if I didn't know to go thru all of that hassle? The normal person would just maybe see an email in their Junk Email folder and they'd right-click and Junk &gt; Block Sender but they wouldn't know which of their email addresses to put in the box on the website
 that then usually pops up with an empty field box wanting to know what email address you want to unsubscribe.
</p>
<p>Sure, a few places use a system that automatically knows what address to Unsubscribe and they then thank you for your time &amp; patience and they might even ask you why you're wanting to Unsubscribe. (dumb).</p>
<p>I've always thought that I should do both a Block and an Unsubscribe, but I just found out that doing a Block doesn't keep their future emails from being downloaded from the outlook.com LIVE server where my Outlook 2016 and my Windows phone gets all of their
 new emails from. <strong>The LIVE server for outlook.com just keeps a list of Blocked Email Addresses and that assures that they're moved automatically into the Junk Email folder which my Outlook 2016 and my phone both&nbsp;then update with every Send/Receive,</strong>
 so those trash emails from that Sender will still keep show up in my Junk Emails folder in my Outlook 2016 until the actual Unsubscription goes thru on the sender's system.</p>
<p>So much stuff wastes your&nbsp;time these days, even with all the technology we have.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Jeff</strong>,</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Here are my answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If you’ve signed into your Outlook account on the Outlook 2016 desktop app by entering the
<strong>email </strong>and the <strong>password</strong>, it should be configured as Microsoft Exchange automatically. This means, all the changes that you’ve made through the app, will be synced accordingly as you’ve signed into the same account via the
<strong>Outlook.com</strong> website.<br />
</li><li>If you’ve blocked a sender or marked an email as junk, the changes should be applied across the Outlook versions where your account is signed into from. These include the
<strong>Outlook.com</strong>, <strong>Outlook 2016 desktop app</strong> and <strong>
Outlook</strong> in your <strong>Windows phone</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any clarifications on this.</p>
        </p>

<div>Yes, that's true. The long list of Blocked Senders can't affect either the Outlook app and Outlook.com performance. Functionality when it comes to sending and receiving emails either these two platforms will work as it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
