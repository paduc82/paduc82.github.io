<h2>            AMD HD Radeon 8400 and Windows 10 no longer compatible in 2016</h2>
                    <p>I saw the discussion in 2015 on AMD HD Radeon 8400 and Windows 10.&nbsp; I personally have had Windows 10 installed since the summer 2016 and NO problems until OCTOBER, when GENERIC pnp MONITOR DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE occurred.&nbsp; My HP Pavilion Touchscreen
 14-f040ca froze and after reboots, it freezes soon after desktop icons appear.&nbsp; This first occurred about an hour after a Windows 10 update on October 30, 2016.&nbsp; HP service technician reset my computer to just before the 'event', thinking it was simply a corrupted
 driver, and all was fine for several hours until WINDOWS 10 ran another update, restarted my computer and I'm back to where I was before.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be the only one with this problem???&nbsp; What's the solution? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft and/or Radeon aware of, trying to do something about this problem???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Day 12 of this nightmare.</p>

</p><p>Hello Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We've reviewed the previous post that you've made. We can sense that the issue has to be forwarded to Microsoft. Surely it has been known to them already, and we're going to do this again as a follow up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know which version of<strong> Windows 10</strong> do you use (Home or Pro)? If you're using Pro edition, we suggest you to do the
<strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> &gt; Select the radio button for
<strong>Defer upgrades.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to check this Wiki Article: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10/how-to-block-automatic-updates-in-windows-10/659d2e50-978e-4ab5-9f27-23342be283c2">
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to: block automatic updates in Windows 10.</span></em></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, if the System restore is unsuccessful, we will suggest you to download the latest version of the GPU Driver, and uninstall the current one. Your current GPU Driver may show that it is up-to-date, but in this situation, we will need a clean-reinstall
 of the driver. This is also suitable at best since you just reset your rig.</p>

<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AMD Support.</span></em></a> Consider the bit (x64 and x32) version of your Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll update here once we got a notification from the higher tier.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Home version of Windows 10, 64 bit.&nbsp; HP tech is calling (again) within the half hour.&nbsp; Will let you know what happens.&nbsp; I also contacted AMD Support yesterday, posted on Forum BUT spoke directly with tech support. In safe mode, I I saw a message
 (didn't before the reset) that AMD Radeon driver wasn't up-to-date, so maybe this is problem (HP hasn't yet seen that message that popped up when I was doing something in safe mode.)&nbsp; AMD also advised to use THEIR clean uninstall utility, update of their driver
 (gave me specifics of where to download), but he, like me, is not sure if a new Windows 10 update will mean I'm back to the same problem again. He said I may have to go back to Windows 8, 8.1 (he saw as HP and I did that online HP ONLY offers driver downloads
 for Windows 8 for this laptop)...and if I'm back to Windows 8, 8.1 then I wonder if THOSE updates will cause same problem.&nbsp; As I said, will get back to you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS.</p>

            <p>What I should have added.&nbsp; HP DID uninstall AMD driver on Tuesday, and replaced with Crimson Fix.&nbsp; This didn't work.&nbsp; AMD said they should update from Catalyst 15.7.1 suite (it's from 2015?)&nbsp;&nbsp; They also said don't just uninstall from my laptop menu on driver,
 download their clean install software and uninstall using it, then download, install driver.&nbsp; Hoping HP will try that today.</p>

            <p>I am encountering the same problem. I can't use software that accesses pictures or graphics. The technical support that I've been using has suggested moving back to Windows 8. It's been really frustrated - started about 10 days ago, when the most recent

<p>
</p><p>Surely that Microsoft and AMD are now working together regarding this matter. It is also best to get in-touch with&nbsp;<a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AMD Support</span></em></a> regarding this concern since they're the once to set your expectation if their latest
<em>chip-set</em><em> can already adapt with<strong> Window 10</strong></em>, and for Microsoft it is
<em>vice versa.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please perform and check if the workarounds, above this thread, to
<strong>clean-uninstall</strong> the previous chip-set driver, <strong>download, and install the updated driver</strong> from the
<em>manufacturer's website</em>. After the uninstall, it is also good to run your
<em>trusted system cleaning software</em> just to be sure that there are no remnants of the previous driver software.&nbsp;

            After my original post, I paid HP to remote connect and 'repair' my HP Pavilion laptop with AMD Radeon 8400 graphics.&nbsp; I advised what AMD had recommended with respect to cleanuninstall, and then download of Crystal Suite 15.7.1 driver, but they elected
 to do factory reset to Windows 8, then update to 8.1 (175 Windows 8 updates; 55 for Windows 8.1).&nbsp; I then copied my files back to laptop, reinstalled programs and apps.&nbsp; IF I had known HP was simply going to do factory reset, I would have saved the $, done
 myself.&nbsp; The good news is that it worked...everything is fine (day 6 since the reset).<br />

<h2>            Mouse and Keyboard Control Center will not open</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just bought a Microsoft keyboard/mouse desk set 5050. &nbsp;It loaded the drivers and works. &nbsp;I then installed the Mouse and Keyboard Control Center and it loaded ok, but will not open. &nbsp;I am running Win 10 on my desktop pc with an Intel i7 cpu. &nbsp;I tried
 the uninstall/reinstall/hardware troubleshooter stuff to no avail. &nbsp;The blue circle spins for a few seconds, then stops. &nbsp;I tried opening the program from all possibilities - it won't open. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Friotolio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might have installed an earlier version of the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center that isn't optimized for Windows 10. We suggest uninstalling it again and downloading the latest version
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/downloads/mouse-keyboard-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still unable to launch it, try creating another account and install the app from there. If you're able to launch it, then this indicates an issue with a main account. We can logically assume this to be the cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, we suggest you run <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">SFC and DISM</a></strong>.
 These are built-in tools that are meant to restore any corrupted or missing files that are necessary for Windows 10 to run properly.

<br />
I ran method 1 - then tried re-running the audio troubleshooter, no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 doesn't apply, because device manager isn't detecting either my speakers (Cyber Acoustics CA-3602a)</p>

    <title>WIndows 10 is not recognizing my external dvd drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 9jayh1  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 is not recognizing my external dvd drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I am trying to use a Samsung DVD Writer model SE-218. It worked flawlessly with my 8.1 but since I installed 10 it doesn't.</p>
<p>I installed "DriveTheLife" to check for outdated drivers but it didn't find anything that made a difference.</p>
<p>I also went to "Start", "This PC", then right clicked on the "DVD RW Drive E" to troubleshoot it but it kept telling me to plug it into a 2.0 port and click next. The problem was that I had already done that.</p>
<p>I then&nbsp;plugged it into a 3.0 port and ran the troubleshooter again (just to be sure I was right)&nbsp;but I got the same message.</p>
<p>When the DVD Burner has a disc in it, the units image&nbsp;disappears from the "Devices and Drives" section of the "This PC" window. If I eject the disk it re-appears.</p>
<p>Any solutions would be fabulous, Thx!</p>

<p>Hey there <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/13ab0218-0d1e-4b25-8187-6a32d2df62ee" title="Micha≈õStania">
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to&nbsp;hear that you're having problems with Dishonored 2.</p>
<p>I would say that if you haven't, to try the steps outlined in our<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox One Game Freeze Solution</a>&nbsp;for resolution on this kind of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't resolve it, another good idea would be a good idea to try a soft reset.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>

                    <div><span><span>Ciao. </span><span>Sono italiano perdonare il mio inglese da scuola</span></span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><span>Da ieri ho un problema con Windows Hello, tutto ha funzionato perfettamente e non ho apportato alcuna modifica al sistema, un normale riavvio nella schermata di login Windows Hello non ha aperto la schermata di riconoscimento
 facciale, regolarmente configurata, ma mi ha rimandato direttamente a le opzioni di accesso con la motivazione: c'√® un problema, costringendomi a inserire il PIN per avviare il computer.</span></span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><span>Leggendo tra le guide ho fatto quanto segue:</span></span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><span>1) aggiornamento del computer tramite l'aggiornamento (necessario ma non ha risolto il problema).</span></span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><span>2) Ho cercato "device management" e il "device biometric" che ho disinstallato, sperando nell'installazione automatica al riavvio ma nulla di fatto la voce non √® ricomparsa.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>&nbsp;Nella schermata di configurazione delle opzioni di accesso di Windows Hello ho un avviso rosso che dice: Windows Hello impedisce la visualizzazione di alcune opzioni e il mio dispositivo Windows Hello non √® disponibile, ma
 ho acquistato il PC e ha funzionato benissimo!</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Premetto che ho una versione di Windows Surface Laptop 10.0.17763 17763 con Windows 10 Pro, e che ho solo il riconoscimento facciale come accesso biometrico.</span></span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><span>Qualche buona anima per aiutarmi a risolvere il problema, per favore</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Grazie mille</span></span></div>

            Hi Kcooter !!<br />
<br />
Thank you for writing for Windows Vista Forum. I hope this will be a good tutorial for you.<br />
<p>A number of people have asked me how to enable the old Run dialog that existed on every other version of Windows until Vista. One of the nice features of the old Run dialog was that it saved the history of what you had typed in.</p>
<p>We should note first that you can always get to the run dialog by just hitting Win + R on the keyboard, which is the simplest way to do so, and would probably be worth getting used to.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can re-enable the run dialog by right-clicking on the Start Button, selecting Properties, and then clicking Customize on the ensuing dialog window. You‚Äôll be taken to the Customize Start Menu screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2007%2f02%2fWindowsLiveWriter%2fEnableRunCommandonWindowsVistaStartMenu_CE33%2fimage%7b0%7d.png" /></p>
<p>Check the ‚ÄúRun command‚Äù checkbox in the list, and&nbsp;you should now be in business:.</p>

Hope this will help mate.<br />

<p>creation date on security client 8-27-13 (had installed in past but had massive virus issue and reformatted to remove.&nbsp; so it is now reinstalled.)</p>

<p>anti-malware client 4.3.216.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>not sure if norton or mcafee was ever installed but I am thinking the hd wipe woulda taken care of that because it brought it back to factory setting and neither were there afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>neither came pre-installed from what I can tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security Update for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 on Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 SP2 x86 (KB2604094)</p>

<p>You have version 10,0,22,87 installed&nbsp; (adobe version.)&nbsp; so no, older version installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no alternate browser programs installed currently though am planning on installing chrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>under installed updates I see internet explorer 9 installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>internet explorer seems to be running efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>since restoring comp to factory I have not done a repair install or a clean install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have malware bytes installed and run regularly.&nbsp; was planning to get ccleaner for my registry and probably combo fix as well to give me a more complete protection.&nbsp; had both in the past but the particular virus I got was beyond nasty and also unfortunately
 beyond my ability to remove without the "restore to factory" option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hopefully this helps you to give me a more accurate idea as to my current issue with security essentials.&nbsp; I would appreciate any help you may be willing to provide and will do nothing with the setup of the pc until I get a response from you or anyone else
 that may know the issue.&nbsp; will wait 2 weeks for reply before I begin updating the java and adobe and whatnot to try to correct problem myself.</p>

    <title>Cannot upgrade from staged version to unstaged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hilary moore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot upgrade from staged version to unstaged</h2>
                    I have Vista Home Premium on my Sony laptop. Support will soon cease. I purchased Office 365 in order to install Office on this and other computers. I have to upgrade to Windows 7 or 8, (Office 365 not being compatible with vista,) but have to use 7 due
 to work software. On attempting the upgrade, I get the error message that the staged version cannot be upgraded to an unstaged version and the upgrade fails.
<p>All help gratefully received.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update Install on M.2 SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b&#225;lintcsert&#225;n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Install on M.2 SSD</h2>
                    <p>I've tried to install this update but with no luck.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think that it's the M.2 SSD that won't let windows update install itself. I tried so many times I lost count...<br />
<br />
Here is my config (at least what is important for this problem):<br />
C Drive: Samsung MZHPV128HDGM-00000 (<span>SM951 M.2 SSD</span>)<br />
MotherBoard: Gigabyte GA-Z97X-SLI</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB (4*4GB) of HyperX CL9 (but I doubt that this could be the problem)<br />
</p>
<p>I had the M.2 SSD in an expansion card and I managed to put it in the other GPU-Slot - which I didn't use - but for the time being I tried to place the M.2 SSD in the M.2 SSd slot on the MB.<br />
<br />
Till now nothing I've tried worked... so I would appreciate a little help here what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am constantly getting: 0xC1900101 - 0x20017 error code (yes I googled it how to fix it but still nothing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there is everything You need. If I missed something then please remind me! :)<br />
<br />
Thank You in advance!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the exact error message that you receive on the computer?<br />
3. When exactly do you receive this error message?<br />
4. Are you able to boot into Windows?<br />
<br />
If windows explorer stop working then you may try the steps from the knowledge base article provided and check if it helps:<br />
Error: Windows Explorer has stopped working<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2694911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2694911</a><br />
<strong>Disclaimer:<br />
clean boot </strong><br />
Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above Knowledge Base article.<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner <br />
</strong>If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted.<br />
<br />
<strong>In-Place Upgrade:<br />
</strong>An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system. Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be
 lost through this process.</div>

<h2>            Unlock Bar on Surface Book Splash screen</h2>
                    <p>Surface book appears to be working fine. &nbsp;But when I turn it on, there is a red bar with an unlocked image at the top of the black screen. &nbsp;(This is not a RED boot screen which is what I kept finding when trying to search). &nbsp;It didn't used to be there. &nbsp;What
 does it mean? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently reformatted the computer but it was doing it before the reformat it. &nbsp;I have detached from the base keyboard and rebooted and it also shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to actually sell it but worried this is a concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Its an interesting point. I wanted to know if others felt that way. In my opinion what kills games is the mod damage hacks and sometimes the lopsided matches and sniping can sometimes to a degree ruin a game what do you think?</p>

<p>so since when does hitting an enemy from behind take two whole clips with the aug assault rifle from close range to drop them? same game same people it took 2 headshots with a m24 rifle from closer range to drop em thats not skill and thats not body armor
 (I could see the blood exit the head) and &nbsp;and they run around with 0% health? and as far as sniping how if this is an actual military tatic widely used can you say serves no purpose i can do some damage with the sniper rifle believe that.</p>

<p>lag okay maybe your right but i was playing with a friend and he said it was the same thing for him that these two guys were just taking way too much damage to drop em and I never experienced this in over 600 hrs of play this was the first time. Okay i get
 it you don't like sniping however one or two targets? I almost have 100 combat excellence pins and damn near 200 ace pin awards 95% of them earned with recon, I got three sniper rifles and the motar attack platinum- out and what about motion mine assists and
 spotting? &nbsp;so that math argument, I can't agree with.</p>

<p>This game has bad hitreg problems. You shoot and their character models and it even reacts but no hitmarker and no damage dealt. There are no hacks on dedicated servers on the console. Sniping wil not help your team if you are far enough away to need anything
 greater than a 4x scope.</p>

            Hi BarbaraAllen2,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this up. To be able to understand the issue better, let us know more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
‚Ä¢ Were there any changes made prior to this matter?<br />
‚Ä¢ Have you tried checking in the 'Action Center' if the "Tablet mode" is enabled?<br />
‚Ä¢ You mentioned about keyboard and mouse not recognized. Can you clarify if you're using a Type Cover and a Bluetooth/USB-type mouse? Did you check in the Device Manager if the necessary drivers are visible?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, let's try a force shutdown/restart of your Surface. Performing a Forced Shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets the hardware and clears all the cache and memory for your hardware. To
 do this, here's how:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*The Surface may boot to UEFI. This is normal. Exit the UEFI without any changes made.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.<br />
<br />
If the first solution did not work, you can download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>.
 It is a self-healing tool which looks for potential issues and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. The tool takes about 10-15 mins. to run. Once you run the toolkit, kindly follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

    <title>Can I save non-synced folders in OneDrive &#40;Folders from a 2nd Hard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roninrr2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I save non-synced folders in OneDrive &#40;Folders from a 2nd Hard Drive&#41; - i.e. Use OneDrive just for storage.</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 hard drives - a smaller C: SSD (200 GB) and a larger D: HD (2 TB) in my laptop.&nbsp; I keep everything that I use, need and is active on the C: drive and it is synced to/with OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am using the 2 TB HD mainly for storing my life-time pictures (around 200 GB by themselves) - but they don't need to be synced because I rarely make any changes to that folder(s) -- and of course, they will not fit on the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there a way to sync the folders on the D: drive with my other folders on my OneDrive - I haven't seen that this is a MS OneDrive supported feature (although I may have missed it) -- and I really don't need to do this - i.e. #2 will work just fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Is there a way to just use the OneDrive as a Back-up storage device without engaging the OneDrive syncing business - i.e. just copy/upload the large Pictures folders to OneDrive and just leave them there for back-up purposes - and just re-load&nbsp; (or add
 new folders) to these saved pictures on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an Office 365 subscriber, so I have the 1T of storage for each of my 365 licenses, BUT I don't want to jack around with a bunch of additional MS accounts - I just want to keep it simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the best way to accomplish this.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ron
<br />
<br />On OneDrive is already a folder Structure - Documents, Pictures . . .etc.
<br />
<br />The files you just want to store on OneDrive should be in a different newly created folder structure. If you want to sync files, put them in the existing Documents, Pictures . . .etc.

            Hi Lisa,
<br />
<br />Can you check something first:
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Logs
<br />What size is the CBS folder contained in the logs folder?
<br />
<br />To turn off Automatic Updates:
<br />1.
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options
<br />Choose to sign in with a Local Account rather than a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />2.
<br />In the Settings App
<br />Go to Network and Internet
<br />Set your WiFi connection as Metered
<br />
<br />3.
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit ENTER 
<br />Scroll down the list of services to find Windows Update 
<br />Double click the service 
<br />If it has started, click 'Stop' 
<br />Then you must set its startup type to 'Disabled' - 'Manual' will not do! 
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

<p>Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp;<span>The CBS folder is 23.5 MB.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm assuming that the automatic updates are from other apps rather than Windows updates. Is that correct? I believe it is other apps that are filling up my C drive.</span></p>

            Hi Lisa, Windows Updates do take a lot of hard drive space . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Automatic Updates include:
<br />Monthly updates can range from 300MB to over 1GB.
<br />Bi-yearly major update can be anywhere from 3GB - 8GB
<br />There is also Security  updates, Windows App updates and driver Updates
<br />
<br />This is the new model Microsoft has decided that Windows now follows. They now refer to Windows 10 as a Service rather than an Operating System . . .

            See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:

<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Make sure the following update is not installed and is blocked:
<br />
<br />KB4023057
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />See if KB4023057 is installed or not. 
<br />
<br />If it is, right click it then uninstall it.
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There should be an Auto Reset Button on your Monitor to reset it to defaults.</p>
<p>If the above does not fix it or apply in your circumstances&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp; go to your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; look for a Drivers and Software download section &gt; key in your&nbsp;Computer model munber &gt; look for the correct Vista&nbsp;Operating System &gt; find Drivers
 (Graphics, Video, Chipset, depending on wording there)&nbsp;for it &gt; download and install them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have done that you can then change Screen Resolution to suit your options:</p>

<p>The vgw/s-video ports on your laptop are&nbsp;outputs, so it won't help if you want record something on the laptop, it would work to send the laptop's image to the TV.</p>
<p>To record on your computer, you need a TV tuner card, probably a USB one, which would connect to your antenna, cable, sat. box, etc. You would also need some type of software application for tuning in the TV stations (usually supplied with the tuner card).</p>
<p>However, you should check the spec of your system first to see if even can support proper recording and playback for whatever type of TV signal you have.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro cannot add a specific domain user</h2>
                    New Dell XPS8900 with Windows 10 Pro, updated, added to domain, able to add asw administrators domain users no problem. One user when ever added creates a temporary profile. This person is operating on another machine full access not problems, cannot create
 a permanent profile on the machine. Nothing appears wrong on his AD profile (not roaming) there is no sid for the profile when logged off and then logged in as admin. Tried all the fixes with event viewer, Sid erase, hand create as local. I have to believe
 something with this profile is screwy, anyone have an idea or similiar problem? (and yes I have done hundred of these without issue, this one is a bit of a problem!)

            <p>Sorry but just to double check based on your description you've already done the typical profile rebuild steps?
</p>
<p>-Go to HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList. Find which SID has the ProfileImagePath of C:\Users\&lt;theirusername&gt;, backup the reg key if desired and rename .old or delete it</p>
<p>-Go to C:\Users and rename their user profile to .old</p>
<p>-Have them try to log in again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again it sounds like you did this already but since that is the first step just wanted to double check. The other thing I've had happen before that caused this is due to Windows getting an Access Denied when trying to copy the Default profile. Usually with
 that it will cause new profile issues across the board, but if you haven't tried this yet what you can do is:</p>
<p>-Go to C:\Users and right click the Default profile-&gt;Properties</p>
<p>-Go to the Security Tab and click on the Advanced button</p>
<p>-Click on "Change Permissions"</p>
<p>-Typically I'll have 4 different permission ACEs on the list in this screen: SYSTEM, Administrators, Users, Everyone. For each of those security principals select it and tick the "Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this
 object" and click apply.</p>
<p>-Try to log in again</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing I've seen with temp profiles is again an access denied issue, and was caused by the presence of some folders under C:\Users\Default\Application Data\&lt;Random Folders&gt;. In that instance the random folders were causing the access issue, so after
 deleting the random folders under application data (but NOT the application data folder itself) I was able to get the user in. This may have been specific to my old company but I have seen that once as the cause so at least wanted to throw that out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also one helpful blog I've found on profile issues is https://helgeklein.com/blog/2011/05/helges-profile-toolkit/ , and specifically https://helgeklein.com/blog/2011/11/temporary-user-profiles/ https://helgeklein.com/blog/2013/09/error-message-explained-user-profile-service-failed-logon/</p>
