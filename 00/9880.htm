<h2>            Rules&#58; Have replies sent to</h2>
                    
<p>Ok I know in every e-mail there is a "Have replies sent to" option, where if the receiver hit reply, they would reply to a different e-mail address.</p>
<p>So I was wondering, is there a way to configure that as a rule?</p>
<p>Basically what I am looking to do... If i e-mail Amy and Sue, the Have replies sent to option would automatically be configured to this e-mail address. And if i send an e-mail to Ben, he would reply to a different address.</p>

    <title>One Specific Word Document Is Lagging - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            One Specific Word Document Is Lagging</h2>
                    <p>I have tried searching for answers online to no avail. Only one of my word documents is slow and lagging for no particular reason. This document is only 44.3 KB. It is only one page long. I have a couple of tables, logos, headers, footers, and check marks.
 That's about it. This document lives on OneDrive and it was also slow on my colleague's computer. None of my other documents are slow. This document wasn't always slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already gone into Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Display and checked the box next to 'disable hardware graphics acceleration'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.</p>

<p>Since it's only that one document, and the problem travels with the document, it's probable that there's some corruption in the file. To try to avoid it, go to the end of the document and press Enter; then select everything except that new paragraph mark,
 copy to the clipboard, and paste into a new blank document. Separately copy the headers and footers (which may contain the logos) and paste those into the new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the new document doesn't have the lag, then delete the old document and resave the new document with the old one's name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the lag is still there, there could be corruption in one or more of the tables. There's some advice on that in the article&nbsp;<a href="https://wordmvp.com/FAQs/AppErrors/CorruptDoc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://wordmvp.com/FAQs/AppErrors/CorruptDoc.htm</a>&nbsp;after

<div>I have tried to set up account for forum and website for my custom email in outlook. However, I did not receive their activation email.</div>

</div>
<div>I have tested using my normal hotmail account to register in these forum or website, I am able to receive the activation email instantly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>May I know if there is something that is blocking the activation email from sending to my custom email and how to unblock it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

<p>
</p><p>Since your screen shot shows that the template does not contain any fancy graphics, it would be a lot easier for you to use the built-in label definition in Word.</p>

<h2>            Back button &#43; hamburger &#61; Star Menu. Buttons at top cause navigation issues.</h2>
                    <p>Look, it's hard enough as it is to have ALL the options at the top of the screen (fire that PM who did that)... but to hit the hamburger button and go back to the start screen on top of that? Navigation nightmare.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All buttons that are frequently used should be at the bottom, and the back button should move to the previous option inside the program. If I wanted to leave the program, there is this other button with a windows symbol I can click. Otherwise the back button
 is redundant and frankly not useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Windows Phone Developers and PMs inside Microsoft should be required to use the phone with a single hand. Make them hold a coffee in one hand, and navigate the phone with another. If they cannot use their feature while doing this, then redesign it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, this isn't just a Windows Phone issue, this is a tablet issue. Stop letting Windows Desktop dictate mobile device usage.</p>

<h2>            Outlook app for Android</h2>
                    
<p>i have a question concerning the outlook app for android. &nbsp;</p>
<p>if i compose a new message in the app and search for a user that i want to send to, the app does a directory lookup and searches contacts on the phone, if i select a user that exists in the directory for our organization the to field populates with their
 last name and first name and lastname, firstname. &nbsp;the first two are invalid as they are not email addresses, they are just 'parsed' information from the directory search. &nbsp;the last entry (lastname, firstname) is correct. &nbsp;if you try to send an email the app
 will tell you "invalid address"&nbsp;</p>
<p>where is this information coming from? &nbsp;has anyone else seen this? in order to send the new email one must select the last name and delete it, and select the first name and delete it, and leave the lastname, firstname. &nbsp;</p>

<p>hi jedediah,</p>
<p>thanks for your detailed information.<br />
to protect your privacy, i have modified your post.</p>
<p>since the issue is related to the outlook app and our forum focuses on office 365 for business online services, to better help you, we have a dedicated channel where you can use the in-app support to report any issues regarding this app. you may also request
 bug fixes and submit feature requests via in-app support.<br />
*note when using the in app support:<br />
1. it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you will see a response from the technician.<br />
3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b03e4868-ac6c-4e4c-ba44-8ddae7017cf7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db03e4868-ac6c-4e4c-ba44-8ddae7017cf7" /></a></p>
<p>by the way, here’re some our tips that may be helpful to find out the root cause of the issue.<br />
1. check whether the issue occur to the latest version of the app.<br />
2. if available, set up your account in another android device for a test. doing this can help narrow down whether the issue is related to your android device.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
poppy</p>

    <title>Exchange 2013 hideDLMembership not work for &#34;Outlook for MAC&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry_ye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exchange 2013 hideDLMembership not work for &#34;Outlook for MAC&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate anyone who can share any explanations and resolutions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1). I created one Distribution Group which called "<strong>TestDG</strong>":</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d518a09b-c516-470c-a427-f4ce2fea887f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2). Modify the attribute "<strong>hideDLMembership</strong>" of it in <strong>
ADUC </strong>(Advanced View):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01a3e74d-99dd-437e-9229-1c7b1f69d53d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9c85fbf-788d-45e8-8a63-b5425776159e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3). After then, try to send E-mail to this Distribution Group, from <strong>OWA
</strong>and <strong>Windows Outlook (Outlook 2013)</strong>, users can't view the members of this Distribution Group:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f5a1f13-9412-4516-989d-f10af25ef45d" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/332fd6e4-bbf6-45d0-b0c2-a604fbd5b025" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>4). However all users using <strong>MAC </strong>devices, we confirmed that they can still
<strong>see the members of the Distribution Group</strong>. Following is the version of
<strong>Outlook for MAC</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc126de1-97bd-4d08-ab1b-c159fb9c1e9d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need your confirmation that it is normal? Or one bug? Is there any resolutions or workarounds that
<strong>MAC users(Outlook for MAC) </strong>can't see members of any Distribution Groups?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>
<p />

<p>All of a sudden I couldn't print my lottery ticket and wondered why. I found the answer here. Had to use method 3 by typing in the line at the command prompt as instructed.</p>
<p>Restarted the computer and it worked immediately. Very grateful and will pass it on to my son who has the same problem.</p>

<p>The sound is working fine on my rig. I noticed you are using the MS generic driver so it could be that generic driver is just not compatible with your specific configuration (even though MS thinks it should be). I had a problem with my wifi and the installed
 driver (from Win 10 update) was the cause. You might want to try and download a more stable driver from the manufacturer's website. I used a Win 7 driver to fix my wifi issue. Good luck to you.</p>

    <title>Visio file to PDF - transparency rendering with a hash pattern - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianluster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio file to PDF - transparency rendering with a hash pattern</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am using Visio 2007 and I am trying to convert a wire frame to PDF. I do not have the "Publish" feature under "File so my options are to use the "Print" function and select "Print to PDF" or the "Convert to PDF" feature under Adobe PDF.<br />
<br />
My issue comes when the pdf renders. I have a layer on the page that is grey and has a transparency set so that the content under is viewable, however when it renders the transparency becomes a hash mark type pattern. I have tried to adjust the opacity, the
 layer, restart the whole design, and I get the same effect. I have sent it to a co-worker who can render it and it the transparency works correctly.<br />
<br />
Do you know if this is an issue with 2007? If there is a work around? <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!<br />
<br />
Christian<br />

            <p>Because it requires also passive listening, which is supported on devices running the Qualcomm 8XX chipset and 640xl has 4xx. Hence it won't support passive listening, i.e. no "Hey Cortana" ever will be available.</p>

<h2>            Problems with O365 desktop versions going back to an old design with no features</h2>
                    <p>Hi! 😄</p>
<p>I'm having some troubles with the Office 365 programs in Windows 10 (Word, Excel and PowerPoint). Sometimes they load up as should with the latest features, as shown in the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e8afcb-1708-4d31-bf65-3f6f6ec003c9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e8afcb-1708-4d31-bf65-3f6f6ec003c9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I close them and open them back again they go back to an older version (or at least the design seems to, since the program is up to date). Sometimes this doesn't follow that pattern and simply open as an old version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a190d3e0-bc60-4c02-b8af-41bebdf16978?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a190d3e0-bc60-4c02-b8af-41bebdf16978?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that this means I cannot use many options (such as autosave) until I reboot the computer and start everything again, which seems to fix the problem for some time until I close the programs again.</p>
<p>The truth is that this is a bit annoying 😪 I'd appreciate if you think of something to fix this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks 🤩</p>

<h2>            Access 2010 &#40;32&#41; Runtine error when used on XP SP3 &#34;The database cannot opened because the VBA Project contained in it cannot be read...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Win7 running Office Professional Access 2010 (32). Up to date with Service packs etc.</p>
<p>I have tried recommendation of Nathan Ost of un-installing/re-installing Office 2010 on my Win7 computer to reset any registry values.</p>
<p>This has not worked.</p>
<p>I have also ensured the 32/64 issue is sorted which it seems to be given I CAN open a fresh/simple accde on XP SP3 using Access Runtime 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issue:</p>
<p>Developed MDB in Access 2003 [split DB, VBA &amp; Forms].</p>
<p>Migrated to Office 2010 for Packaging wizard&nbsp;purposes &amp; Runtime.</p>
<p>Have migrated Access 2003&nbsp;MDB via&nbsp;"save as" Access 2007/10 as well as started a blank Access 2007/10 DB and imported all. Both work &amp; compile fine.</p>
<p>Have ensured that VBA Libraries/References ONLY point to x86 [non-64]. [I dropped a WSHOM.OSX that was 64 reference].</p>
<p>Debug Compile ok.</p>
<p>Create accde file ok.</p>
<p>Use Packaging Wizard ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It Installs with Runtime on Win XP SP3 [have tried on 2 computers] which installs ok.</p>
<p>Upon opening file via shortcut; following error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The database cannot be opened because the VBA project contained in it cannot be read. The database can be opened only if the VBA project is first deleted. Deleting the VBA project removes all code from modules, forms adn reports. You should back up your
 database before attempting to open the database and delete the VPA project. To create a backup copy, click Cancel and then make a backup copy of your database. To open the database and delete the VBA project without creating a backcup..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further testing I've done:</p>
<p>- blank&nbsp;Access 2010 accde with 1 basic form, VBA&nbsp;&amp; module packaged and installed on XP computer. Opens &amp; runs ok.</p>
<p>- delete ALL modules/forms from my database file&nbsp;- STILL doesn't open rather same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No idea what is happening as this error seems to be related to something in the specific "database" [independent of the 2003-2010 conversion or the 2010 import]. I've checked everything I can think of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Debug compiles fine &amp; references are specifically NOT pointing to 64s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Confused...very frustrated &amp; needing to know a way forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help is appreciated...</p>
<p>Dan</p>

            <p>RTM stands for release to manufacturing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So basically, it is the base build of a product when it is released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have machines with different VBE7.dll files, then you will want to make sure you update the machines so they have the same versions of this file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So my recommendation would be to install SP1 for Office 2010 and after you install this, you will then want to install the update in KB 2553385 since this is the update that will get your VBE7.dll file to the 7.0.16.25 build.</p>

<h2>            Making a Web-based interface for a Workbook in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to find a way to make a web-based interface for people to use a Workbook. They do not need to upload information in the sheet, but they must be able to use certain macros that I have created and have full use of buttons (spin dial etc..). We
 also want there to only be restricted access to the site based on a log-in of some type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a tough time finding more information on excel online or sharpeoint servers and was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To clarify the issue, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></span></p>
<span><span>1. What do you mean about “</span></span><span>full use of buttons (spin dial etc..)”?
 Could you give us some examples and some screenshots?</span><span><span><br />
2. It seems that you want internal users to access one workbook online to make changes in SharePoint Online. If yes, since macros won’t work in Excel Online, your requirements can be partly achieved. I suggest you use the Excel Web Access Web Part in a site
 page and then only share the site with the internal users.</span></span>

            <p>Thanks for your Response Cliff,</p>
<p>For example, here is a portion of the interface. I would like a user to be able to change their primary assumptions (for example change from Medicare (top left scroll down bar)) to a different set of data which would subsequently change some of the graphs.
 They would also need to be able to use the save/ retrieve buttons up top (which are macros) to save this model and retrieve it later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user must also be able click on the graphs and download them so they can upload them to power point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your second link, the Excel Web Access Part/Sharepoint Server, it does not state whether there would be usability with macros. If Sharepoint acts like a regular VPN where people sign on and access the excel file from a server, then shouldn't macros
 work just fine?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’d like to explain that macro doesn’t work in Excel Online, so it also doesn’t work in the Excel Web Access Web Part in SharePoint Online.
</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference: </span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Work-with-macros-in-Excel-Online-98784ad0-898c-43aa-a1da-4f0fb5014343?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Work with macros
 in Excel Online</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, you want to achieve two things. </span></p>
<span><span>1. You customizes an Excel workbook and want some internal users to use it in Excel Online. Except the macros, you also want them to use the customized buttons online. As Excel Online is different from the Excel client and some features in the Excel
 file aren’t supported, we should collect a sample Excel file for us to check if the customized button features are supported in Excel Online. I have sent you a private message for you to upload the sample file. You can upload it via

2. You want to restrict people to use the Excel file online. As SharePoint Online has permission levels for users’ permission requirements, the requirement may be achieved in your environment. To do that, you just need to share the whole site where the
</span></span><span>Excel Web Access Web Part is with some users who can use the Excel file online.

            "Excel online" isn't really excel online - it's a viewer with some limited functionality. It sounds like you're trying to use excel as a web authoring tool which will never work. If you have a access to a SP developer you can probably build some sort of
 dashboard using SP functionality that may approximate what you need.

<p><span><span>After uploading the example file to a SharePoint site, the features of the interface in AM New aren’t supported in Excel Online. This means that you can’t use the

<p>Is it happenning in all cases..(i.e. when you receive call from anyone in your contact list..) or only the one with 3 no. entries ?</p>
<p>Because what jimmyireland states may not be true..</p>
<p>Reasons... On my Nokia 5800XM (S60) even if there are multiple no. entries under one person.. the Name and the no. from which call is made are displayed.. whereas on Nokia X3 (S40) even for single no. entries only the Name is displayed... only when the call
 is from someone not in the contacts list.. the no. gets displayed..</p>

<p>Agree with you.. but if you are interested in knowing the no. from which that person has called..( after the call I mean..) you may check in the LOG&nbsp; and the no. should also get displayed there..</p>

<br />
The use of seeing the number along with person's name is that I will get a fair idea of where he/she is calling from and will talk to him/her accordingly<br />
<br />
I guess all other companies phones display number along with contact name except nokia which claims itself to be the most user friendly s/w!!!!!!

<p>Ok..Lol.. I got your point... A person has 2 nos stored against his / her name.. say 1 Home No. and 2 Mobile No. Now you will talk differently if you know whether its from the Home No. or Mobile No.. ( you can talk more freely if you know that the call is
 from Mobile No...).. Right ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case...Store the nos. properly selecting the detail.. when the call is from Home No. you will see an Icon of Home before the caller's&nbsp;name.. and an Icon of a Mobile if the call is from Mobile No...&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cell reference of a data point selected in a chart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cell reference of a data point selected in a chart</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to select one data point in a chart and see the cell references of the cells the data corresponds to? I can see the cell references of an entire series but what I need is that upon selecting a particular data point I can read off that
 it corresponds to the x,y values in cells X,Y with references B109, D109 (for example). I know I can read off the values but it's a nuisance to have to check the Xvalue, then go to the table, then locate the cell, then read off the reference, only then being
 able to put that reference in a formula.</div>
<div>I am dealing with long tables and big charts, and lots of them too, so this would greatly alleviate my job!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>ellie</div>

            <p>It is quite simple, and something that MS has actually prepared for. Just buy a 365 Home license and activate it on your current account using the provided product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The official policy is that a 365 personal 1 year will extend a new 365 Home subscription by 9 months.&nbsp; Some people have reported that they actually got a 1:1 time extension on the new 365 subscription.

<p>Then the next thing to check is <strong>Tools&gt; AutoCorrect - AutoFormat as You Type

<p><span>It does look like the program is behaving incorrectly here, though. It seems to be inserting an en dash regardless of whether you wrap a single or a double hyphen within spaces. If you have the same result after verifying the AutoCorrect Preference
 please note that here, but also submit a complaint at </span><a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304942-word-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word for Mac</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested in Word 2016 as well which demonstrates the same behavior. That suggests to me that it either is an unresolved issue carried forward to the new release or is somehow influenced by OS X. In either case it's hard to believe that there have been
 no reports of the issue before now.</p>

<h2>            Emails in Outlook are Listed in list but blank when I go to view actual email</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden when I click on any email in my Outlook (MSN) email account, the email itself is blank. However, if I click FORWARD, the email appears in the pending forward email. I've rebooted several times, emptied everything from my MSN Outlook account,
 deleted all cookies and still can't see them. Also, I CAN see them on another laptop that runs Windows 8 but the other laptop &amp; desk computer where I can't see the emails have Windows 10.

<p>Does anyone know why this is happening &amp; how to fix please? Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you are using the Outlook app, the issue may&nbsp;<span>occur because of an incompatibility between the Avgoutlook.Addin add-in and Outlook. For steps on how to resolve this issue, kindly go to this
