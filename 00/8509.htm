<h2>            How do I find and play my local music files in Groove for iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    I have Groove on my iPhone. &nbsp;I also have thousands on songs already on my phone, but cannot find any way to find or play those songs in the Groove for iPhone app. &nbsp;When I use the search function, it pulls in plenty of music selections available for download
 (if I were to pay for a Groove Music Pass), but no option to play local files. &nbsp;How do I do this?

            <p>I don't think it is possible to play music you've copied from a computer to a phone via the Groove app for iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have an iPhone so I haven't used the iPhone Groove app, but I've spent a few hours exploring the Android Groove app and I think the apps are similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I've learned: </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Groove app is primarily useful for streaming music to a phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a Groove Music Pass, you can stream music from Microsoft's online music collection.&nbsp; You can also download some music from Microsoft's online music collection to play offline on the phone.&nbsp;</li><li>If you do NOT subscribe to a Groove Music Pass, you can upload your music collection to the Music folder of your OneDrive account and then use the app to stream music to your phone from your OneDrive account. You can also download music from your OneDrive
 account to play offline on the phone.</li><li>Any music that you copy from a computer to a phone via USB cord will not be recognized in the Groove app, so the only way to transfer music to a phone so the Groove app will recognize it and play it offline is by downloading the music either from Microsoft's
 online music collection (only if you subscribe to a Groove Music Pass) or from your OneDrive account.</li></ul>
<p>If you don't want to upload your personal music collection to OneDrive and then download it to your phone, you can copy your music to the phone via USB connection, but you need to use a different music app to listen to your music on the phone. (This is what
 I am doing on my Android phone)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response. I apologize for my delayed response. It's a long story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Android is 6.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Baseband version??? MOLY.WR8.W1449.MD.WG.MP.V57.P13,2017/03/20...</p>

<p>
</p><p>In addition to NO INCOMING CALL RINGING, Google maps defaults me in Boston, Massachussetts, hometown of my favorite singer, who was in Manhattan on 9/11, and subsequently contracted lung cancer and died.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, yeah, I worked at the DOJ, in the Foreign Language Program, in 2010. Mom was on her death bed when they brought me in. I did work that had been done. Supervisor harrassed me. When I taught rurally in Carrizo Springs, Texas, I was working in my classroom
 on Christmas Eve, when I heard the school district Chief of Police, and about seven supposed Border Patrol Officers, in tow checking each, classroom, then surprising me in my own, asking me, "Where does that door go? What's behind that door?" Yeah, they were
 planning a shooting "drill," that ended up not happening...Do you think this could be related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah, in 2016, the same week I had a student, presumably coached, act up in class, my landlord said I had to move.&nbsp; When I asked why, she replied, "I have to do what my people say." And that week, the Texas National Guard started changing the time on
 my phone up to 7 times a day, until February 14th.</p>

 gets to steal it's neighbor's land Syria, Iraq, and Iran, while our weapons manufacturers literally make a "killing." While the Bible thumpers go on about how the modern day Israelis are "The Chosen Ones," so we have to help them steal from their neighbors
 (I am willing to bet that the bible was plagiarized by men millinnea ago, by "the chosen ones," for the "chosen ones" ??? And continue to proclaim, that they are "pro-life" as they support war/slaughter-for-profit, overseas, that puts us in the cross-hairs
 of Russia, China, and North Korea. Money may stimulate the same areas of the brain as cocaine, but I have to wonder if some of the bad decisions, are not related to cocaine, or drug us, by our Dear Leaders? Do our top military and intelligence leaders get
 regular and spontaneous drug screenings?</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your first post, yes it is possible to use Skype on your android device. An SD doesn't have anything to do with calling issue on Skype. In this case, kindly try to use a different connection (Wi-Fi, Cellular Data).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have same nickname by the way, probably a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that works. </p>

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an engineer on the Sway team, working on analytics. We've had a service issue recently that caused a delay in analytics to update. All analytics and view data should be updated now. There was no data loss, so if you check now all the numbers should
 be correct. It sounds like Sway failed to get your view data and showed 0 instead, now that the issue is resolved this should not happen.</p>
<p>Please feel free to check and let me know if there are still any issues with the view data for your Sways.</p>
<div>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 920 internet sharing problem - Computer can&#39;t find the phone</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hey :)</span></p>
<p><span>I have a Nokia Lumia 920. My internet sharing used to work fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday when I had to use the internet sharing on my computer i could not find the wifi signal on the computer. Ive tried to search for any software update for the phone, but can’t find any - so I guess it’s up to date. I've tried to reboot the phone,
 and the computer with no luck.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any ideas how i get it to work again?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>btw, some days ago my phone froze and I had to froze it to shut down - can that be the source of the problem?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-Thanks</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/96230149-342D-43DD-87EE-EF119E55252F">MathiasFrost</a>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting and welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!&nbsp;:Cool:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>All Nokia Lumia phones have the feature to share phone's internet connection over WiFi (tethering) with up to five other devices or computers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To use your phone as a modem:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Internet sharing</strong>&nbsp;and set&nbsp;<strong>Sharing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>On</strong>.</span>
</li><li><span>Your&nbsp;<strong>Broadcast name</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>password</strong>&nbsp;are automatically provided.</span>
</li><li><span><strong>Guests connected</strong>&nbsp;shows how many guests are currently connected to your phone. Up to five guests can be connected at the same time.</span>
</li><li><span>In&nbsp;<strong>Setup</strong>&nbsp;you can change your internet sharing password.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: The connection automatically turns off if it is not used for a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you face such issues, try the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Switch Off&nbsp;<strong>Battery saver</strong>&nbsp;mode or connect a charger.</span>
</li><li><span>The cellular network may not be in range or has a weak signal to provide a successful connection. Check the&nbsp;<strong>signal bar</strong>&nbsp;at the top of the screen to ensure you are in good network coverage.</span>
</li><li><span>Make sure that the&nbsp;<strong>security type</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;password</strong>&nbsp;settings match on the phone and connecting device.</span>
</li><li><span>Make sure your connecting device (e.g. laptop or tablet) allows&nbsp;<strong>WPA2</strong>&nbsp;(AES)&nbsp;<strong>security connection</strong>. If possible, try to create a connection with some other device.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have searched everywhere for a list of voice commands.&nbsp; I know the obvious one ["Call" (name)], but what other things can I do from voice command?&nbsp; Can I query signal strenght or battery level?&nbsp; I've tried and it hasn't worked so far.&nbsp;

    <title>insufficient memory excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mirtheponsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            insufficient memory excel</h2>
                    Dear people,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, I performed many calculations in excel (Office 2011, Mac OS X Lion versie 10.7.5) using macros. As a result I am not able to open excel any more and I recieve the notification that I have 'insufficiënt memory'. I can't close the program as well.
 I reinstalled Office and removed all excell files in which I used the macros, not resolving the problem. Internet provides a solution in which they advise to enlarge the memory using the information tab of excel. This solution doesn't work as I don't have
 the possibility to create more memory in this information tab. Does anybody know an answer to this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            To begin with, you must have found some very old information :-) Memory management is handled by OS X. The OS allocates as much as needed relative to how much RAM is available at the time. In earlier versions of Mac OS a user could specify min/max for
 individual programs but OS X did away with that.<br />
<br />
Secondly, what may have been done in any Excel files should have no bearing on launching the program, itself. The content of a file is a non-issue until such time as there is an attempt to
<i>open</i> that file. How are you attempting to launch the program?<br />
<br />
Please provide a more clear &amp; complete description of the situation. Be sure to include:<br />
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by "performed many calculations... using macros"?</li><li>Are the macros saved in a Personal Macro workbook or in the individual Excel files?</li><li>What is your present update level of Office 2011?</li><li>Does the message appear when you launch the program or when you attempt to open specific files?</li><li>What are the specs of your Mac?</li></ul>
As a shot in the dark I'm guessing that your OS X System Preferences are set to open all files on launch, which could easily cause such an error. Have you checked that?<br />
<br />
Also, make sure that in <b>Excel&gt; Preferences - General</b> you do not have a folder specified in the
<i>At startup, open all files in:</i> field.<br />
<br />
You should be able to launch the program by holding the Shift key while using the Dock icon or the program icon -- i.e.,
<i>not</i> by double-clicking a workbook file.<br />

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with contacts syncing between my android phone and outlook contacts. I opened a support ticket that they were not able to resolve the issue. Every morning I have 2-3 contacts just missing from my phone. I had to manually delete all contacts
 in outlook.com and re-import them. The problem went away for a couple of days, then came back again. Also, outlook contacts is not syncing with "People" app in any way shape or form.
</p>
<p>Any Help?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since this is a sync issue, there might be a possibility that this is due to the account configured on your Outlook application. In this case, I would suggest that you uninstall the application and reinstall it back again. Once reinstalled, kindly try to
 re configure your email account. This would get the application a fresh new start and hopefully resolve the sync issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Importing emails to new outlook email account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently registered with outlook with the intention of using this service for my new personal email account. I would really appreciate some guidance as to how I can import emails from my old btinternet email account so they will all show in my new
 outlook account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the option sync email, in the settings tab and although it imported around&nbsp;75% of my emails from my btinternet account there is around 25% missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any restrictions (other than storage size, which isn't an issue) which may be preventing all my emails being imported to outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, is there another way I can&nbsp;action this in Outlook&nbsp;to complete the task?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<br />A pleasure to help you.

<br />Can you tell me if you have the desktop Outlook application? It would be very good to import emails and contacts, then you would sync with your Online mail.
<br />
<br />Let me know.

            Perfect that would not be the problem.
<br />Since which web browser are you working.
<br />Try to do it from Internet Explorer or validate from another computer.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I created a new @outlook.com address and then added my old btinternet address to this via the sync email option in the settings tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the correct route to take? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice when doing this it performed a one off import (which is all I really want, but 100% complete) and it does not sync real time as and when new emails come in to my btinternet address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now managed to import all my emails from my old email account into my new outlook.com account, thank you for your help thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other matter concerns me a little:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the import/sync continually and&nbsp;updated real time? i.e. once my old email account closes down will I lose all the imported emails I have made to my new outlook.com account? I note the imported emails have my old email address attached to them in an orange
 subject box which was leading to me think there may be a link in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above question makes sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>How to make a web page in Word2010 that adjusts automatically to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard peters_1947  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make a web page in Word2010  that adjusts automatically to different screen sizes.</h2>
                    I have created a web page in Word2010 to make an entry page at this site:<br />
melbournedominatrix.net<br />
<br />
On my large screen it is perfect, but I know the page does not adjust automatically to different screen sizes.&nbsp; I have seen several so-called solutions to this by the use of additional HTML code.&nbsp; But I cannot get them to work - probably because I am HTML illiterate.<br />
<br />
I cannot find anything in Word that allows me to fix this issue directly - is there a fix that I am unable to see?<br />
If not, is there any kind-hearted&nbsp; HTML literate person out there who would be willing to copy the code from the above site and add the necessary code for me?<br />
<br />
Perhaps I need not say it - but this is driving me NUTS - and any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />
<br />

            This should probably be in the Word forum rather than the customization forum. Perhaps a moderator will move it there.<br />
<br />
Word is not the program of choice for creating html. It probably would not be in the top twenty choices. The html it creates is usually very clumsy and complicated.<br />
<br />
To check your web page, try adjusting your screen to a very low resolution and see what you get. View the page in your browser, not in Word. Then check other browsers.<br />

            Exactly, how did you create the page in Word. Did you hand code it, or just place everything in a word document file.<br />
<br />
I often save simple pages I've copied from the web as HTML. They adjust. I us SAVE AS "Web page Filtered, HTML"<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you are placing elements using tables. That probably would not adjust.<br />
<br />
You might want to switch to a dedicated web tool. There are many free tools you can use that switch between HTML views and WYSIWYG view.<br />

I developed an everyday word file and saved as Web Page filtered.&nbsp; I have used text boxes to position the text.&nbsp; Thanks for responding<br />

            All,<br />
<br />
I found a solution while raising this issue to Microsoft Support. I tried it and it worked perfectly.
<br />
<br />
After installing the MS Office and the Language Pack what happens is that the language pack installation replaces the default templates. The solution is to repair the Full Installation of the office itself in order to re-replace the default templates and install
 the correct ones. <br />
<br />
After doing this all my issues regarding this has been solved. <br />
<br />
I really advise that anyone who is facing such issues to try this solution and it will be solved.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks everybody for your help in this manner. <br />

<p>1.&nbsp; Delete Twitter from Email + Accounts list</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Reboot phone</p>

    <title>Issues with Outlook 2013&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skier641  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Outlook 2013&#58;</h2>
                    <p>Using Office 2013 with Windows 7 64-bit in a home environment i.e. no Exchange server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I have contacts (People) set to display (First, Last).&nbsp; Despite this some contacts are listed&nbsp;(Last, First)&nbsp;name despite the fact that the option is set to display (First, Last)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Weather in Calendar view.&nbsp; This constantly defaults back to New York rather than the UK location where I live.&nbsp; It also reverts to displaying temperature in Fahrenheit when Celsius has been set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When moving e-mails from folders in an IMAP account to a folder in a POP account I frequently get a message that states,' Item cannot be moved because it has changed.'&nbsp; It hasn't though I may have replied to it.&nbsp; Selecting 'Mark as Unread' then moving
 always succeeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I experienced the much reported issue of problems syncing with an IMAP account.&nbsp; Deleting and recreating the account seems to have fixed this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The overall appearance of Office 2013, whilst (sort of) consistent with Windows 8 sucks; it simply isn't as clear as Office 2010 and elements aren't clearly demarcated.&nbsp; I should add that I'm not a fan of the Window 8 'Metro' interface (I know it's no
 longer called that) for a productive desktop machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll persevere for a little longer but I have to say that I'm close to reverting back to Office 2010.</p>

    <title>Error messages when trying to update an Excel 2007 add-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rueful rabbit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error messages when trying to update an Excel 2007 add-in</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel 2007&nbsp; file in Windows 7 with macros which I previously saved and distributed to another user in the group as an add-in and which ran successfully there.&nbsp; Today I saved an updated version of the add-in file.&nbsp; The other user had de-selected
 the add-in, so she re-selected it in the add-ins list to get the new version.&nbsp; When she executed the menu command that would run the add-in macro, she got the following error message:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Cannot run the macro '&lt;var&gt;macroname&lt;/var&gt;'. The macro may not be available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>She also tried to incorporate the new file by browsing for it&nbsp; instead of re-selecting it from the add-ins list.&nbsp; Same result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my own machine I also got an error message, but a different one.&nbsp; When I navigated to the add-in file from the add-in manager and selected it, I first got a message asking if I wanted to copy the file to my local add-ins folder, then a message saying
 that a copy already existed there; do I want to replace it?&nbsp; When I clicked Yes, I got the following message: "Microsoft Access cannot access the file 'c:\users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Addins\&lt;add in file name&gt;'.&nbsp; There are several possible reasons:&nbsp;
 the file or path does not exist; the file is being used by another program; the workbook you are trying to save has the same name as a currently open workbook."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Additional info: I am still successfully able to run the old add-in file.&nbsp; But it wasn't just a corruption in the new add-in -- I re-saved the new add-in file, but I still continued to get "Cannot run the macro '&lt;var&gt;macroname&lt;/var&gt;'. The macro may not be
 available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled" when trying to run it, although I have not been getting the other error message now.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S. Please don't say that this is a development issue.&nbsp; I thought that's what I'd be told if I posted here, but when I posted to the development forum I was redirected here and my question there was moved to off-topic (although in the interest of full disclosure,
 I didn't have the "additional info" yet when I made that post.)<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Two things to check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) It may be that you add-in was disabled.&nbsp; Check under:</p>
<p>Office button &gt; Excel Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; (at the bottom) Manage: Disabled Items &gt; Go</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) When you say "<em>executed the menu command that would run the add-in macro</em>", what do you mean?&nbsp; I suspect whatever button you have that was pointing at the macro needs to be re-pointed at the new file.&nbsp; Please explain what you mean by "menu command".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

            <p>1. When I went to Manage: Disabled Items -- in the same file and under the same configuration that produced the error message -- it said "there are no disabled items".&nbsp; So to all appearances that can't be it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Following chapter 21 of "Excel 2007 Power Programming with VBA", I used a method in the ThisWorkbook object which 1) adds a command to the pop-up menu that appears when the user right-clicks on a cell in order to invoke the macro after 2) invoking Reset
 on the menu to get rid of&nbsp;the command added from the previous install.&nbsp;Does that answer your question?</p>

            I am still not sure yet about the "cannot access the file" message (which I presume said "Microsoft
<b>Excel </b>cannot access the file" rather than "Microsoft Access cannot access the file").&nbsp; But the explanation for the "Cannot run the macro" message turned out to be pretty simple:&nbsp; because the main procedure name wasn't accurate any more, I had move and
 renamed it.&nbsp; I was too used to thinking that if you have a call to a nonexistent procedure you get a compile-time error.&nbsp; But -- if the call is in a menu command that you add at runtime, then you get a runtime error.&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; Same thing if I had entered a typo
 in the procedure name in my code, except that I would have seen the message the first time it was used as an add-in.<br />

<h2>            Not Able to Post Comments on MSN.com News Stories</h2>
                    <p>Since the change of MSN.com to its new format, I have been unable to post comments or reply to comments on MSN.com news stories where others are able to comment.&nbsp; I have tried posting with my facebook account sign-in; and I have tried posting using my MSN
 account sign-in.&nbsp; Neither seems to work.&nbsp; If I make a comment or reply to a comment and then post it, the comment will appear on the screen as if it is posted on the forum.&nbsp; And, even if I leave the site and return to it later, the comment that I made seems
 to appear.&nbsp; HOWEVER, if I access the same MSN.com news item using a different browser (e.g., Google Chrome), my comment does not appear.&nbsp; So, it really is not posted.&nbsp; Normally I use Internet Explorer as my browser.&nbsp; However, I have tried posting comments
 using IE, Chrome, Firefox, and the MSN (the butterfly) browser -- none of these work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding to my confusion, I tried posting a comment to an MSN.com news article using my grandson's computer.&nbsp; There I used Google Chrome and signed in with a G-mail address and password.&nbsp; When I went back to my own computer to check whether I could see that
 posted comment, I could see it when I use IE as the browser; but I could not see it when I use Chrome or Firefox as the browser -- so, I really do not know whether it is posted or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one have any insights as to what is going on here and suggestions on how to get so that I can post on MSN.com news items with some reliability?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do realize that this question has been asked before and I reviewed many of the responses -- but nothing seemed to be applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI.&nbsp; I am using a Dell Latitude E5530, with Windows 7 Professional, Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<h2>            Excel files open&#47; close in a semi-minimized window</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Office 2010 Professional Pro on Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Office 2016 Excel files won't open maximized, they're minimized to a window of say 3x3 cm, you have to maximize yourself. This does not happen always, but most of the times, at random so to speak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, all Excel files do open maximized&nbsp;<span>IF&nbsp;</span>I delete the personal macro workbook (personal.xlsb) from Users/User name/App Data/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel/XLStart/. As soon as I then create a new macro and store it in a personal
 macro workbook that then sits in the location specified above, all files either through a shortcut or directly don't open maximized anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be the cause? Is there a solution for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
Danker

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't help fix the problem. I had the same problem in previous Office versions, and both then and now with Office 2016 I have already several times done an online repair of the installation. It didn't solve the semi-minimized window problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I will try repairing once more, and see what happens.</p>

            <p>Hi, ShinearSawyer. For apps larger than 50 MB, Wi-Fi connection is required to download them. This is the reason why you are getting that error. Please look for "Why don't I see an app that I downloaded from the Store?" from the below link for your reference:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I actually recently found out how to download things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just went into my app stop then pressed the settings then it came up with a few options I clicked "Only download while on WIFI" Now I can download anything (: Pretty easy</p>

<h2>            Problem Connecting Samsung i300 to Vista &#40;also problem with WMDC&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I got a Samsung i300 a couple of days ago, and i've tried syncing it with WMDC; but the program doesn't even appear on the screen. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a pitty, because on the manufacturer's CD there's only a copy of activesync. And, there's a bunch of programs that you can only install via activesync. I imagine there's a problem with the driver (which was automatically isntalled by vista)
 because in device manager the device is simply "windows mobile usb sync" or something similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to us WMDC to sync, but nothing happens, even after several clicks and waiting. Any solutions?
