<h2>            How can i sort out an error code  0x80048861&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I have this at the end of a message on my phone "If you call support, you can tell them you received this error code: 0x80048861?"</p>
<p>Ironically, I can't call support because technical support doesn't exist on a phoneline because nobody can be bothered talking to you. As usual you get directed to online. Stupid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of that. Here's the scenario:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I signed up for the brand new outlook.com email address which then replaced (and deleted) my hotmail.com email address</p>
<p>However, all my settings on my Nokia Lumia 710 were set up with my original hotmail.com Windows Live Account. So I can't delete my original Windows Live account off my phone (no delete option just synchronise) and my facebook and twiiter account, which are
 signed up via my original email address, will not delete.</p>
<p>In all three situations it says underneath them <strong>Attention required</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on Windows Live I am told my <strong>Windows Live password is incorrect</strong>. It's not incorrect because my account no longer exists.</p>
<p>When I click on Facebook I get the following message:</p>
<p><strong>Can't delete Facebook</strong></p>
<p><strong>We're having trouble deleting Facebook.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Check to make sure you have a connection, then try again. If you do, the problem may be with Windows Live.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you call support, you can tell them you received this error code: 0x80048861</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on Twitter I get the following message:</p>
<p><strong>Can't delete Twitter</strong></p>
<p><strong>We're having trouble deleting Twitter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Check to make sure you have a connection, then try again. If you do, the problem may be with Windows Live.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you call support, you can tell them you received this error code: 80048861</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how about an actual member of the Microsoft Technical Support Team (who actually knows what is happening and how to rectify the problem) answer this question. Or better yet, send me a message or whatever with a contact number so I actually speak to a
 human being instead of a customer representative who has a written statement they have to follow because they don't have a clue what's going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>I wait IMpatiently for a decent response by someone who has a clue and doesn't need one buying for them.</p>

In order to change the primary Live ID on your device you must hard reset and setup the new account after the reset.
</p>
<p>Like you, I got&nbsp;the new outlook.com but decided to sign up as a new user then linked the account to my others.&nbsp; I was unsure just what was going to work and I did not want to "mess up" my ability to use the apps I have purchased or my xbox account since
 I use the same ID.</p>
<p>On a PC, can you sign out of the outlook.com then sign in as a different user with the original account?&nbsp;</p>

Shouldn't it be made easier to disassociate accounts and associate new accounts on the Windows Phone platform in case of scenarios like this that may occur, without having to use a
<strong>hard reset?</strong></p>
<p>In relation to your question, I am still able to view my hotmail.co.uk account perfectly fine for emails (and I&nbsp;would presume other things as well) with no problems at all.</p>
<p>When, and if, I sign out of outlook.com email account, I am able to sign in with hotmail.co.uk with no problem at all.</p>
<p>My outlook.com and hotmail.co.uk accounts are linked as they were when they were hotmail.com and hotmail.co.uk accounts by the way.</p>
<p>My emails work perfectly fine on my phone for both outlook.com and hotmail.co.uk - not that you probably needed that information granted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my other point in the original post, can you or someone else give a reason as to why there seems to be no
<strong>Technical</strong> <strong>Support</strong> <strong>Telephone</strong> <strong>
Helpline</strong>? Every major company that deals with items that require technical support have one.</p>
<p>Why not Microsoft?</p>

            <p>Sorry, been away for a week or so.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've backed up my phones pictures and videos to my computer using the ridiculously stupid Zune software so am kind of ready to reset my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just need some clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Will all my contacts be saved properly via my email addresses and thus reload on to my phone when I link my email addresses?</p>
<p>2. Will I still have access to my original Xbox LIVE gamertag as I still have a bit of credit with it and trophy information etc? (I do not, and never would have, an Xbox by the way so cannot alter anything via a console).</p>
<p>3. Any software and games&nbsp;I have downloaded, more importantly the paid for ones, will i be able to redownload them without any problems or will they require payments again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think I can think of anything else at the moment.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Jay</p>

            <p>As Jack points out, you will be able to retrieve that information after the hard reset. (Except, of course, for any contacts data you've added or changed on the device since syncing stopped with the email address change.)&nbsp;What you cannot backup or restore
 are any text messages, or third-party app data, unless the app developers offer an in-app option to export/upload that data to a server&nbsp;somewhere.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, the both the need to hard-reset&nbsp;just to&nbsp;change a Live ID, and the fact that there's still no decent full backup solution for this nearly two-year old platform is mind-bogglingly, industrial-strength&nbsp;stupid.</p>

<h2>            msn coming up in french</h2>
                    <p>I recently returned from a few weeks holiday in France. Now when I sign out of my hotmail account the msn page is all in french language. I can change the language back to english by clicking on the gearwheel icon and selecting uk english but next time I

<h2>            Can&#39;t set up OneNote on Mac and online gives error</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the OneNote app from the App Store onto my MacBook Pro (OS high Sierra, v. 10.13.4) and I haven't been able to use it, it keeps saying problem setting up and asks me to close the app and it will try to fix. This doesn't fix anything. I try to
 use OneNote Online and get this error&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Reference number: 67cdd779-0fd4-4c94-84f9-3685883e5cda</span></p>
<p>I have not been able to use OneNote so I have no notebooks created yet. &nbsp;When I try to create one
 it lets me pick a color and name but just spins like it's hung up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create my Microsoft login I used a yahoo personal email since this is for personal use. Can anyone help? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried a safe boot. I have removed Login items. I have attempted an uninstall and reinstall. These have not worked. &nbsp;I also downloaded the app on my iMac desktop and it is the same situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Nera451S</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When you are creating the notebook via OneNote for Mac, you are actually creating it online; as you are also having issues creating it online, we suggest trying a different account (you can create a new account to test out if you don’t have one) and see if
 it helps.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions, we welcome you come back and share the information with us.
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jonk</p>

            My problem seems to be that I recently changed some security information on my Microsoft account that won't take effect until October 12. That's the first message I get. When I click to continue, I get a message that the authorization period (of the current
 session?) has expired and to try again. I try again and get both messages again. I also get the message about a problem with OneNote and to close and open it again to fix it. Do I really have to wait until October to work on this?

            Sometimes the delay before it responds to a Flag for Follow Up command can be over 30 secs!&nbsp; We get the same problem when managing&nbsp; reminder flags for Outlook emails or calendar entries.&nbsp; The common factor would seem to be Office Reminders.<br />

<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To switch off N8 in such circumstances, hold down power button for <strong>8</strong> seconds until
<strong>three</strong> vibrations felt; you can then start device normally again.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a shared link expires, you can't access the shared files via the shared link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your second question to tell if a file is shared, you can check the shared status under Sharing column.</p>
<p>It should display <strong>Shared</strong> if you shared the file, <strong>Only you
</strong>if you didn't share it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c609ac1-d412-481f-8bb5-9024c590b6f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c609ac1-d412-481f-8bb5-9024c590b6f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the history of shared files with expired links, I'd like to tell you that this is not feasible in OneDrive for Business.</p>
<p>You can select one shared file in OneDrive for Business and click&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be7c3541-a916-48bd-8ad2-43ed6da10b2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be7c3541-a916-48bd-8ad2-43ed6da10b2b" /></a>
 button on the upper-right corner to check the shared history, but we can't tell the way how you shared the file.</p>

<p>Do you actually have Microsoft Office? Or are you trying to install the plugin into WPS Office?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't clear why the error message is referring to the startup folder for Kingsoft's WPS Office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Microsoft Office, the startup folder for Word should be</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\STARTUP</p>
<p>instead of the one shown in the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the download page at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/citation-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/citation-plugin</a>, the only supported word processors are Microsoft
 Word and LibreOffice. I wouldn't expect it to work with WPS Office.</p>

 all of a sudden but is there a way to rectify this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>macro for automatic grouping in Excel using indented columns for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdsigrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            macro for automatic grouping in Excel using indented columns for heararchy</h2>
                    <p>When you extract data from QuickBooks to Excel (list of accounts with balances), the resulting spreadsheet physically puts the Account Number in a different column for each level in the accounting structure.</p>
<p>I would like to find a Macro that looks at each column where the Account Number starts (from left to right) and create the appropriate grouping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account Name</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Starts in Column 1</p>
<p>&nbsp; Fixed Assets &nbsp; Starts in Column 2</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leases &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Starts in Column 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume a test for blanks in each column would identify the level and each change in the level would create the end of the group.</p>

<h2>            Magnifying software</h2>
                    
<p>I use my e66 since years now. To change to a new model would cause big trouble for me 'cause there is no magnifying software in included. This e66 contained "Mobile Magnifier light" a great tool that allows me to use all functions even my eyes are very bad.
 I can't install this software on another model. Does anybody know why Nokia included this application only at this e66 model? Or if any other model contains good magnifying application to make even menus readable.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            LinkedIn contacts associated with secondary Live account doesn&#39;t sync to phone</h2>
                    <p>I have a Hotmail account and a separate Live account&nbsp;that I keep separate for personal and business ie, contacts, calendars, etc. I have my Zune Pass associated with my personal Hotmail account and therefore is my primary account on my phone. This works
 fine. I have added my secondary business Live account to my phone. I get all my Live contacts, calendar, to-do's, etc. However, I do not get any LinkedIn contacts that are associated with this Live account. When I try to add the LinkedIn account on my Samsung
 Focus running the latest Mango on AT&amp;T, it opens a web page that says I already allowed Microsoft access to my LinkedIn account. I see my LinkedIn contacts when I log into my Live account but I don't see them on my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sounds like a bug in the OS. Has anyone else hit this? Does anyone know a workaround or if a fix is coming?</p>

 characteristics or IP/domain reputation. Another possible reason is that your IP address appears to be an open proxy/relay. If your server has its mail relays open, your server might be used to send spam emails. Thus, the reason for blocking anything coming
 from it.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2003 only opens Word 2003 editor with word running</h2>
                    <p>This currently only applies to a single user currently but I'm keen to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user has Office 2003 Professional Suite installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue started when the users was frustrated that they couldn't use the auto correct feature when sending emails. On further investigate I found that the use Word 2003 editor option was unchecked in options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enable the option and try to create a new message I am given the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Word cannot be used as the email editor because Word is unavailable, not installed or not the same version as Outlook. The Outlook email editor will be used instead"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So after some troubleshooting and finding a couple of articles on line I get to this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have the option checked to use word as the editor, both outlook and word open at the same time, I can click new message and word opens as the editor as expected and auto correct works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close word leaving outlook open it continues to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close outlook, open outlook without word and try to create a new message I get the above error again. I'm then given the built in editor where auto correct doesn't work. Every time after getting this error if I do not re-check the use word as the editor
 option it will continue to use the built in one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Articles:</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906307</p>
<p>http://www.msoutlook.info/question/68</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a repair on Office, uninstalled and re-installed just Word and various combinations of the above include system reboots incase there is a specific process that fixes this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now stuck. If anyone has a resolution they know works for this I'd greatly appreciate it if you would share this knowledge.</p>

<p>Same suite yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're familiar with the installation process; when I removed word I checked the option to customize and changed it from installed to not available instead of just un-ticking the check box next to word</p>

<h3> juliaintoronto  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I import favorites to Win10 IE11&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new computer which came with Windows 10 Microsoft edge. I use Norton security, so had to change browser to be IE 11 for compatibility due to extension issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I saved my favorites onto a zip drive, and tried to import it into the new computer (using import drop-down selection from Favorites). The import field does not recognize the folder name on my ZIP drive.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">

                    I was running windows 7.1. &nbsp;I got the email confirmation that windows 10 was reserved for me. My computer met all requirements. &nbsp;On 8/1 the desktop icon said I could schedule the update. &nbsp;So I clicked on it and my computer acted as if it were updating.
 &nbsp;Took several hours. &nbsp;Finally it appeared to be done but it is stuck on the screen that says welcome back. &nbsp;I click on the NEXT button. &nbsp;Nothing happens. &nbsp;No error messages. &nbsp;I need my computer. &nbsp;How do I get back to a working pc? ? ? ? ? ?&nbsp;

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I understand that you have an issue on&nbsp;Windows 10 build which gets stuck in the&nbsp;welcome screen. We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to know the details below to assist you further.<br />
1. What is the Windows 10 build installed on the computer?<br />
2. Do you get any error message or code?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try performing the steps below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I request you to boot the computer in Safe Mode via Windows 10 installation media and check if you face the issue. To do so refer the below Microsoft help article.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also I suggest you to perform Automatic Repair using Windows 10. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. Automatic
 repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting. Refer to the steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Insert the installation USB media and boot Windows from it.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option ‘Troubleshoot’ and select ‘advanced options’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You may choose ‘Automatic Repair’ from ‘Advanced boot’ option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Follow the instructions.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope it resolves your issue. Keep us posted on the issue to assist you better.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask if this is happening with all the contacts you have called or with only this specific contact? You might want to try out turning off your subtitles and start to dial the extension again. To do this:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select your <strong>profile picture</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Calling</strong> &gt; <strong>Call Subtitles</strong>, then turn off the option to<strong> Show subtitles for all voice and video calls</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you don't have the option turned on to Show subtitles for all voice and video calls but have turned subtitles on for an individual call, starting a new call with your contact will resolve this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

<p>Another things; you can actaully program the WORD file to run a macro or a VBA and ask for approval then it is forward to a list of users</p>
<p>Each one can do his job according to the role. A Word form might also do the job</p>
<p>Regards</p>

    <title>A reiteration of the &#34;retirement&#34; party. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A reiteration of the &#34;retirement&#34; party.</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>YESTERDAY my Skype for LiNUX quit. &nbsp;It wasn't supposed to, according to Skype, until 05JUL17. &nbsp;More than a month early, it STOPS with NO warning. &nbsp;Because 32-bit versions are being "retired". &nbsp;Okay, I have to go out and buy a new machine, (or at least a
 motherboard), for THREE computers with 64-bit processors. &nbsp;NOW! &nbsp;TODAY! &nbsp;Because there was NO warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS morning I get the "We Have Noticed" e-mail. &nbsp;Well, the wife has a 64-bit W7 machine. &nbsp;So, if I read this correctly, she should be fine. &nbsp;My Android phone doesn't seem to be in any affected list, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY question to MS/Skype is: &nbsp;WHAT in the ACTUAL HELL is the LOGIC behind these moves? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the wife's L/T and the Android phone, You just knocked out THREE machines. &nbsp;A MONTH EARLY. &nbsp;With NO WARNING.</p>
<p>I have used Skype pretty much from roll-out. &nbsp;I have used the PAID version of Skype, with a Skype number, for &gt;5 years. &nbsp;I DEFENDED Skype in the LiNUX fora here, as well as various other places on the web. &nbsp;From my perspective as a former MCSE, I DEFENDED
 the MS takeover as a good idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, there goes THAT idea. &nbsp;What IS the logic of RETIRING all of these versions, (especially given the way it's being done), ESPECIALLY for Lx, (after all, it was at v4 for YEARS after it was at V2 for YEARS), when it was just sitting there not bothering
 anybody? &nbsp;It hadn't had any updates in a LONG time, why not just LEAVE IT ALONE? &nbsp;As to Windows versions, well, 8.anything was garbage like Millennium was. &nbsp;Interval releases out of Redmond usually are. &nbsp;But everyone knows all of those stories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, I really don't expect much of an answer out of MS/Skype. &nbsp;Really. &nbsp;They've never even had "real" support, after all. &nbsp;BUT! &nbsp;I needed to say this as a representative, (in my own mind), of the "old school" Windows and LiNUX communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have whatever kind of day you see fit.</p>

            YES, admins. &nbsp;I DO know I also posted this in the Windows Desktop area. &nbsp;I FEEL that it's IMPORTANT ENOUGH for BOTH communities to be aware of this mischief.

    <title>Outlook 2010 won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden my Outlook 2010 won't open. I've looked and permissions are still good on my .pst file, it's still in the same location but I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot start Outlook, cannot open outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. File access is denied. You do not have permission to access teh file c:/users/ etc.. points to .pst file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the admnistrator of my computer no one else is, I'm logged in as me and the .pst file says I'm the one that has full access to it. Not sure why this happened all of a sudden?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great because I can't even open outlook at all.</p>
