<h2>            No audio when external monitor is hooked up_Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Just got a new laptop with Windows 8.1 and when I hooked it up to my external monitor via HDMI it kept prompting me to choose an audio program or something to do with the audio and I kept on hitting cancel because it seemed unimportant because the monitor
 doesn't have any speakers. After the prompt kept on coming up I decided to just choose one of the options to shut it up. The problem is that now if anything is plugged into that HDMI port I don't get any audio on my laptop. Unplug the HDMI, and audio works
 fine. So how do I fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Codec44,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two things you need to have before upgrading your Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro. One, your Windows 10 Home should be on the most recent build and version (<em>Version1709; Build 16299.214</em>),&nbsp; and two, a valid product key for your Windows
 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have both, then you can follow these steps to proceed with the upgrade:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Change product key</strong>, then input the 25-character Windows 10 Pro product key.</li><li>Hit<strong> Next</strong> to start the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To check the current build and version of your Windows 10 Home, just type in<strong> winver</strong> in the
<em>Cortana search</em>, and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. You should have a pop up window showing those information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update this thread with the result so I'll be able to further assist you, if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access MDAC databases unreadable from MANY applications </h2>
                    
<p>Hello, everybody</p>
<p>I'm a flight simulation enthusiast, and I'm&nbsp;having problems on THREE different applications, which SEEM to share some common database access systems:</p>
<p>- MS Access (which I installed, loaded, and never could get to open a DB).</p>
<p>- Navigraph nDAC 3 (which reads out high-resolution flight maps downloaded from the net, and gives an "could not open database" error.</p>
<p>- Feelthere ERJv2 (a simulated plane which loads flight data&nbsp;onto the sim-FMC (FlightManagementComputer)&nbsp;[specific named locations, identified with latitude-longitude, taken from another .DB]). The ERJ.LOG file created automatically every time the plane
 is loaded on MS Flight Simulator 2004 gives this in the mid-section:</p>
<p><strong>Plane initialised<br />
Connect<br />
driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};dbq=F:\Flight Simulator 9\FeelThere\Nd\nd.mdb<br />
Trying Connect<br />
Connect ok<br />
Connect error<br />

hr = 0X80040E14<br />
before loading plans</strong></p>
<p>I have searched forums for both the ERJ maker and the nDAC3, and the only adivice was, BEFORE formatting the whole thing, that something was amiss with my MDAC files ("..&nbsp;your mdac file is faulty. mdac is a standard OS module. your OS install is faulty.
 unless you correct the mdac file references, or install the data file reader, you will never get any FMC data to show...")</p>
<p>It's great advice: the point is: HOW DO I CORRECT the MDAC file?? I tried to re-install MDAC.INF, did it a number of times actually. Still nothing.</p>
<p>Can anybody please help me, before I give up and re-install WinXp (or format everyting, or change PC...)??</p>
<p>Thanks, Mirko.</p>

            Hi David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you everything that's working for others with the known issues with Bluetooth and headsets:
<br />
<br />First HEADSET:
<br />
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page.  While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.  
<br />
<br />BLUETOOTH Troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-make-bluetooth-mouse-automatically-reconnect-to-my-microsoft-surface-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-ma...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Just a few questions first to get a clear picture of the issue:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><i><font><font color="#000000"><font>Did this issue start recently? Do you remember making any recent changes prior to this issue?</font></font></font></i></p>

<p><i><font><font color="#000000"><font>What happens when you try to access the built-in webcam? Do you get an error?</font></font></font></i></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If the webcam doesn’t work with the Windows generic driver, then you can visit the manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest driver.

            The crash was caused by memory corruption-probably by an unnamed driver.
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier:

<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

            <p>Hello&nbsp;- </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have also received this error message after deploying patches to PCs.&nbsp; We have had several reports of the issue and have narrowed down the problem patch.&nbsp; The issue seems to be caused by 2956283 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2956283/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2956283/en-us)</a>.&nbsp;
 We have uninstalled the patch and IE11 begins working again without issues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, we are only seeing this on Windows 7/IE11 machines and Windows 8.1 does not seem to be having the issue.&nbsp; The behavior that we are seeing is that IE will not even open when we receive this error message, nor can you access Internet Properties through
 control panel or by attempting to launch inetcpl.cpl from run.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Will MS be able to fix this patch or determine what is the cause?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

<h3> es33  say:</h3>
<h2>            VSS keeps switching itself back to &#34;manual&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I switch VSS to "Automatic (Delayed Start)", after a short while it switches itself back to "Manual". &nbsp;Is there an explanation for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backstory: I'm having an issue with Carbonite backup where it keeps locking my pst file so I can't open Outlook. &nbsp;So I'm trying to determine if VSS or Carbonite is faulty. &nbsp;So far the VSS testing is producing the above odd behavior.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for our detailed update on the query. I truly appreciate your efforts&nbsp;towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to test the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS) by creating a restore point and restoring it back to the same point. This will ensure if the VSS is functioning fine. To do so, try the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Create a restore point</p>
<p>Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Reboot your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Restore your system to the&nbsp;restore point created in Step 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer:
</strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed after that restore point are removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps and check if you get any error message during execution. Post back with your results for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 10&#34; microSD cards issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major issues spread among Lenovo tablet users. It seems that it is spread on multiple tablet types.</p>
<p>After, upgrading to Windows 10, the tablet is not reading the microSD cards anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am tired on waiting for Lenovo to solve it, I need to know what do you need from my side in order to try to solve this.</p>
<p>I have a 16GB and a 64GB cards and I can do whatever tests you need and provide any logs needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zoli</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply!</p>
<p>I have seen this answer everywhere I have searched for people with SD problems like mine and it's clear to me that you have it written somewhere and send it as a first action plan but I think we have passed this already and we can go on and dig at a deeper
 level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the proposed steps solved the issue and if you take a look at the forum, it doesn't work for most of the people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, from all the digging I have done and talking to the people who have the same issue, it's clear that this seems to be a software issue because every card that doesn't work in our tablets since the update to Windows 10 work perfectly in other tablets/PCs/phones/etc...
 I am even able to read them with my tablet via a card reader and an OTG cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See here my thread on working/non-working cards:</p>
<p>https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Android-Yoga-Series-Tablets/A-list-of-working-non-working-microSD-cards/m-p/2166052/thread-id/9308</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, you cannot send us to the manufacturer site to &nbsp;download a driver for an SD card. That is not provided as Windows should read them native. How would SD cards be such a successful product if you would have to download drivers first and then use them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This being said, we are beyond a problem where removing the device and putting it back solves the issue and this is a cry for help to Microsoft to try and treat this with the correct priority and seriousness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will come back later with some other findings on this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Zoli</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I was saying earlier, I am coming back with more details and some pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have two microSD cards:</p>
<p>Sandisk Ultra 16GB HC I</p>
<p>KingMax Pro 64GB XC</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 16GB card:</p>
<p>Used to work good on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>When I insert it, it will be discovered, the confirmation sound can be heard.</p>
<p>Device manager shows it as working.</p>
<p>If I try to access it, I get a window asking me to insert the D drive.</p>
<p>Event log fills with disk events.</p>
<p>Sometimes if I reboot the tablet, the SD will work for a few minutes then eject itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f987f37-e099-4d70-b47c-3b7dec54a766" /></p>
<p>Drive D is available but if I click on it I get the below window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27f59e01-934a-476f-9004-56226856fd1b" /></p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1739f114-358b-4fc2-9511-391f3fa34a62" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">All storage devices are marked as good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 64GB card:</p>
<p>Didn't get to try it on Windows 8.1 but it works good on any other PC with any Windows version and I can read it with the tablet via OTG cable and USB reader.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is seen by the tablet just like the 16GB card and also cannot be accessed but after one reboot it is seen as trouble device error code 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/adb1551f-8065-4bf6-b95d-c2db44ef2a8b" /></p>
<p>In the picture above you can see that only the internal memory of 32GB is seen and one SD Storage Class Controller is marked as troubled device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac70eb0b-0807-46ed-a213-978a56173546" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another thing that I have found strange is that Windows 10 is working on drivers since 2006 as seen below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1560a8e0-00bb-45f4-af85-abc71188535e" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>I will try to find a solution to upload the event logs next.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the first step didn't work and I don't want to set the tablet to factory defaults as I don't find this as a solution and I am sick of having to reinstall everything. I did not buy a Windows tablet to have to reset it every time I have an issue. Imagine
 spending a lot of money on a brand new car and having a problem with it and instead of getting a fix for your issue, they would ask you to get out and back in the car because it will work again, every time you hit the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I have offered logs, a full description and screen captures but I still get "standard" solutions that I would be able to find by a simple google search.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I am still waiting to find out why my Windows 10 uses drivers from 2006, what is the explanation behind the errors I see in the error log, etc....</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Visibility of own camera picture &#40;miniature&#41;</h2>
                    Hallo. <span>During a call Skype-Skype </span>I can't see a miniature of my camera picture. This is really inconvenient e.g. if I want to show something to other person. I use Skype&nbsp;8.42.0.60 (Win10_64) and I've tried practically all options to switch
 it on. It has appeared just after an upgrade to the latest version. Could you advice how should I switch this option on? Thank you in advance. Best regards.

 - Thank you Roberta. By the way - this option doesn't look too intuitive… I just didn't use it before.

<p><span>Hi tutembug,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Default settings for Windows Firewall will not harm anything, but if you’ve allowed some programs for exceptions, then
 you have to re-add them to the exception list. Please make a note of programs and ports you’ve allowed exceptions for in Windows Firewall, which you can re-add it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the links below for more information,</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Firewall-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Firewall-frequently-asked-questions</a>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And restoring connection settings to default state will restore Windows Firewall settings as before, which means if you’ve
 made any changes in Windows Firewall Connection settings earlier to connect to a network or internet would be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know what is the exact message you’re getting and why has this occurred on your computer to help you further.</span></p>

    <title>After update, console freezes when trying to sign into Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cladpaladin  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update, console freezes when trying to sign into Live</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so I'm having an interesting problem. I hadn't played my 360 in several weeks and when I came back I had about two updates to download.<br />
Sure, no problem.<br />
Well after they were done my screen promptly froze and every time I try to sign into Xbox Live after that my console freezes shortly thereafter. When I am offline my system works just fine. It's only when I try to get online so I can get to the marketplace.
 I've never had a problem with Live or console freezing before these updates.<br />
<br />
Steps I've taken:<br />
1. Cleared Memory Cache<br />
2. Deleted downloaded video files<br />
3. Checked to see if the system still ran properly without the HDD.<br />
<br />
I don't really play online nor do I have a desire to, I simply want to get back on the internet so I can give Microsoft more of my money in DLC and I just think it's funny how hard their console is making it.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

 by the thieves guild and can be found throughout the five major Holds: Whiterun, Riften, Windhelm, Markath an Solitude. They are used to provide a variety of information to potential thieves, such as which houses contain the best loot, potential dangers, where
 fences are located and even where to find escape routes in jail cells.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Below I've listed the different marks that can be found, but if you want an in-game reference simply search the Thieves Guild premises for a book entitled Shadowmarks, written by a certain Mr. Delvin Mallory.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"THE GUILD"</span><br />
This sign indicates that there's a member of the Guild nearby for certain, and it also provides a safe place to stop and just chill out. Break open a beer or two, watch some TV and generally try to work the irrational fear of flying lizards out of your system.
 If you're a member of the Thieves' Guild then you'll have seen this symbol many times when entering and exiting via the graveyard.</p>
<p>--------------------------------</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fxrhye.png" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"SAFE"</span><br />
This symbol indicates a safe way around a dangerous obstacle such as a corridor full of traps. Be sure to head in the direction it's pointing so that you don't get turned into a shish-kebab. If this symbol is on a house it means it has been cleared out, so
 don't waste your time.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fjndcN.png" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"DANGER"</span><br />
The exact opposite of the above, this sign indicates that you're taking your life into your own hands past this point. Consider investing in some shiny new gear and coming back later, preferably with a small army. If you're still determined to go on, at least
 write out your Will before you do so. I can have your stuff, right?</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOsooq.png" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"ESCAPE ROUTE"</span><br />
As the name implies, this handy little marking is found inside jail cells. Look nearby for an escape route and then enjoy your new-found freedom. Not to be confused with the above "danger" sign.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fO22hV.png" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"PROTECTED"</span><br />
Anyone within this house is under the protection of the Thieves Guild, and therefore should not be robbed or assaulted. I'm unsure if there actually is any penalty for ignoring this symbol and robbing/assaulting the houses occupants. Presumably the penalty
 would being stripped naked and forced to spend an evening locked inside the Night Mother's coffin.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fJqH2a.png" /></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"FENCE"</span><br />
Every thieves favorite symbol: this little baby means there's someone nearby who'll buy your totally legally acquired goods for a fair price. Or it could mean that there's a fence you're going to have to climb over, so ensure that you're feeling healthy and
 not wearing anything heavy, after all we don't want to straining yourself, now do we?</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fCk0Ry.png" /><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"THIEVES' CACHE"</span><br />
You'll find these emblazoned on the top of chests or barrels. Open it up to find a gift of some sort. And for god's sake don't panic: dragons don't fit inside barrels so you're not going to be ambushed. Mind you, Cicero might fit inside a barrel, so maybe you
 should be careful when opening them.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fOJc0c.png" /><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"LOOT"</span><br />
One of the most beautiful symbols ever created, this pretty little thing indicates that there's something worth stealing here. On another note I did try drawing this symbol on a little box I own to see if some loot would magically appear inside. None did, and
 I felt sad.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fxVDq1.png" /><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">"EMPTY"</span><br />
This little sod is the worst of the worst, indicating that there's nothing of note inside. Presumably that's why it's emblazoned on the side of my head.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
So there we have it: a short guide to the wonderful world of Shadowmarks.. Hopefully this little post will help out some people out there or at least provide a little bit of extra information on the world of Skyrim and one of the oldest proffesions in the worlds.</p>

            Hi DB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough to stabilize it then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
