<h2>            Word 2003 problem opening docx files</h2>
                    <p>I know that 2003 is no longer supported, but I thought the community may be able to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two computers, both running Windows 7 Professional and Office 2003 with SP3 and the format converter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one computer, everything works fine--I'm able to open the new formats ("x") by double-clicking on the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other computer, I can do the same for xlsx and pptx files, but not for docx.&nbsp; I can open docx by opening from within Word, but not by double-clicking on the file name.&nbsp; I get an error message that says:&nbsp; "This action is only valid for products that
 are currently installed".&nbsp; I checked the list of file types in the control panel and they are correct.&nbsp; I then un-installed and re-installed Office 2003, SP3 and the file converter add-on.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I'm stumped at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what the problem might be on the second computer?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            Can you open Word first and then use File &gt; Open to get to the file? If this works then the problem is likely to be with your file association for docx files.

            As I said in my original post, I can open from within Word (i.e. File/Open).&nbsp; I also said that I had checked my file associations, and they are the same as my other computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Got to be something more subtle.

            <p>I had this problem too when Office 2010 was installed, then downgraded to 2003.&nbsp; We have the older versions and only want to use those for test computers as they do not require the latest versions of Office.&nbsp; Here's what I did and so far it seems to be working.&nbsp;
 Fix the file association classes by modifying the registry.&nbsp; You may need to modify the following (the first section removes any culprit items, this may need to be run under each user logged on a computer that has used Office before):</p>

<h2>            &#64;msn.com email address disappeared</h2>
                    I have had an @msn.com email address for 20 years. &nbsp;I recently added it to a new gmail account as an alias. &nbsp;I didn't like having the accounts merged so I decided to seperate them again. &nbsp;When I removed the @msn account, it seems to have deleted the entire
 account. &nbsp;When I try to log into account from Outlook, it says that the email does not exist. &nbsp;Emails being sent to the @msn address are being sent back to sender as undeliverable. &nbsp;

            <p>Same problem here. My son added an alias account for his xbox and now our 10+ year old email account is gone and I am getting nowhere with tech support. I have given this email address to THOUSANDS of people, friends, family and companies over the
 last decade. There is no way I could ever contact all of them to give them a new email address for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it worse we are in the middle of an adoption and all the courts, lawyers, case workers, social workers, investigators, etc have this email address for us and they are all being returned as undeliverable!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a COMPLETE freaking nightmare!</p>

            <p>Hi sportscars1968,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note that the thread is a YEAR old, so it's best that the next time you are having an issue, you can just create a new thread next time. But let me try helping&nbsp;you out here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that after your son added a new alias, he removed the old one on the account. Technically, the Microsoft Account still exists but is under a different address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since your old alias ends in @msn.com, this is not a 'regular' address that can be added back as an alias again, as it's for MSN customers who are paying for the service.&nbsp;You may want to contact MSN Support if it's possible to retrieve the old address
 back, or you can submit a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/get-support?selectedproduct=Windows%20Live%20ID&amp;selectedissue=I%20am%20having%20trouble%20signing%20in&amp;Mkt=en-US&amp;productKey=wolmain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support request here</a> and see if they can re-add&nbsp;in the old alias to your Microsoft Account.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            word 2010 documents are being saved all over the place--I need to find out where they belong as if the computer was new</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 ultimate and use word and office 2010. (im sorry that microsoft gave the same name to multiple and different things such as email and documents)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening statement: My computer literacy is medium so most of the basics i know so that as I get a reply or 2 I can fly with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening a document and then when clicking "save"--over the past few years those documents are saved onto the hardrive into dozens of locations and no matter how hard I try I cannot get them straightened back out. I realize that it usually returns to
 the location last saved to but no matter what i do the locations are impossible to figure out even after moving all documents to what i thought was the correct folder and making sure over a period of days and weeks to get it saving correctly by navigating
 painstakingly to the correct location and hitting "save". &nbsp;Yet STILL they are all over the place. The best way is to give some examples --I see no other way to clarify the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple weeks ago I decided to tackle the problem and sought out all documents and MOVED them to the correct folder and deleted and cleaned up other folders in which documents were all over the place. (a good example of a mistake was saving a document into
 a created folder so that it would be there when i searched instead of clicking on "open"--and up comes a list of 13,289 documents going back decades. That was likely the root of the problem. But I cleaned that up and let them all go into the one giant "documents
 resorvoir" and if there was an important critical one i would save it into a backup folder off the system such as my backup drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation at this moment--&gt;I open or start a new document and there are dozens of places it goes when i hit save--or if i go "attach file" when sending an email. I moved all documents to C/users/jeff/my documents and after doing that i deleted the various
 empty folders where they had been. &nbsp;But i cannot figure out--and i simply do not understand all the locations to choose from or how to stop them and why a document has dozens of options where it might be that the computer chooses. &nbsp; &nbsp;users/jeff/my documents--so
 why if i open or create a document do i look up at the top of the screen and it shows a path name a mile long that is someplace else like "libraries"?? &nbsp; what is the difference between users jeff my document and "libraries" which also has documents under it.
 &nbsp; the users i believe is locked or something and shows a little lock--what then is the purpose of "libraries"?? &nbsp;why is "libraries" not under c-users-jeff-my documents? &nbsp; why if i save a document painstakingly saving it to users my documents then i open an
 email to attach it--ITS MISSING?? &nbsp;why when i click on something else it then shows a window that shows about 5 or 6 recent documents BUT THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS ARE MISSING???</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am profficient enough that if someone can reply to WHERE ARE DOCUMENTS SUPPOSED TO BE?"--i can do the rest but why no matter how many times that i do it are my documents all over the place and if i email and try to attach or open word and click up at the
 upper left OPEN--up comes a list of documents and yet again up at the top of the screen i have to navigate all over the computer to keep trying to get back to c drive--users--jeff--my documents.? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to attach a picture that shows an example of opening word but then there are dozens of places in which a document is lost and no way to know WHERE CAN I MAKE THEM BE AS IF THE COMPUTER WAS NEW. &nbsp;another note is that it does not list them correctly--i
 know about list "by date or modified etc" however i constantly spot them where they are not listed right. i can create a document this minute and save it and it will become lost and i have to track it down by going to multiple locations and then i will find
 it and it will be in a random list--not alphabetic--not by date--not by anything. it will also not be listed in "today" yesterday--a long time ago. &nbsp; those sometimes get lucky but rarely. My documents are totally out of control and i can fix them if i get
 a reply &nbsp; thanks...<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8b0e1a4-b7f9-483d-b60f-221de5dbbf52" /></p>

<p>You can, in that view create sub-folders eg for a particular subject </p>
<p>
</p><p>The libraries are simply pointers to the Users location, they are not in multiple locations</p>
<p>You should get used to opening the Libraries and using that to manage, and not explorer&gt;Users\jeff</p>
<p>
</p><p>C/users/jeff/my documents is the same as Libraries&gt;Documents, it is a single location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office default locations for 'Save As' is the Libraries&gt;Documents, although the user can re-set the Office component save location</p>
<p>When you create a new doc always use 'Save As' to give it a name, &amp; save to your desired location in the Libraries&gt;Documents</p>
<p>

<p>If in MS Outlook in a new mail msg you click Attach File the resulting window will be Libraries&gt;Documents</p>

            <p>I think the root of your problem is that you're working with Windows' libraries, possibly the most confusing thing Microsoft has ever invented. The best solution is to close the Libraries icon and never touch it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A "library" is not a real folder, it's a sort of shortcut to a collection of folders that do exist in other places on your drive. That's why you think you're seeing dozens of places -- you can see the real folders as well as the shortcuts to them in various
 libraries. For some reason, the My Documents icon under Libraries &gt; Documents drags in thousands of files that aren't really in the My Documents folder at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to bother to learn about libraries, here are a few links:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/libraries</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>The "proper" place for Word documents is the "My Documents" folder that you're already using, or subfolders that you create within it. One thing to check out is in Word, click File &gt; Options &gt; Save and make sure the path to "My Documents" is shown in the
 "Default file location" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that will help is to use Windows Explorer to open the folder C:\Users\Jeff, grab the My Documents folder's icon on the right side, and drag-and-drop it to the Favorites icon on the left side. It will stay there, and also appear in the Office
 dialogs for Open and Save As. Clicking the My Documents icon under Favorites will go directly to that real folder, avoiding the Libraries nonsense.</p>

    <title>What is the purpose of the Contacts... button in the Properties dialog - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger sherman  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the purpose of the Contacts... button in the Properties dialog box&#63;</h2>
                    In Outlook 2010, when viewing an open message (received, sent or to be sent), the message tab has a command group called Tags.&nbsp; Clicking on the arrow (dialog box launcher) in the bottom-right corner evokes a Properties dialog box.&nbsp; My question is: What
 is the purpose of the Contacts... button in the Properties dialog box?<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time searching for an answer to this question on the Internet, but had no luck.&nbsp; I found one mention of the button<br />

<h2>            Bach &#40;music&#41; font and MS Word 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm writing up my PhD thesis (in music), and I've imported the <a href="http://www.mu.qub.ac.uk/tomita/bachfont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Bach music fonts</a> into MS Word for Mac 2011. I've only just started using them. When I select the Bach font in Word, I can't seem to create ASCII codes to make the correct note symbols. I can insert basic symbols that don't require inputting them as ASCII
 code by inputting a symbol in Arial and then changing it to Bach font (for example, the @ symbol in Arial font becomes a flat sign in Bach font), but when it comes to quarter notes and half notes etc (which require ASCII code) I can't make them work at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help me, that would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew Harrison</p>

</p><p>Thanks for all of your help, I do appreciate you taking the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After quite a lot of fiddling around, I've cut to the chase and purchased PopChar, which allows me to insert any musical symbol easily into Word. So this has solved my problem, and it seems it was worth the money!</p>

</p><p>If you have a video Downloader and you wanted to know how to use it, it is best contacting the developer of that video Downloader app for assistance. But if you don't have an app yet and you wanted to know how to download video on your phone, please provide

    <title>Emails from subfolders not showing up in unread email search folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philhoule  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails from subfolders not showing up in unread email search folder</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Outlook 2013 on Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have a number of sub folders one level below the main Inbox folder. &nbsp;The issue is that it appears that the content of certain of these folders is not appearing in the Unread email search folder. &nbsp;I've compared
 the properties for subfolders that where unread emails are showing up correctly to those that are not and do not see any difference. &nbsp;All email is popped into Outlook from 3 web based emails. &nbsp;Sending a test email from Outlook to each of the 3 accounts results
 in the test email appearing correctly in the unread mail folder. &nbsp;Emails are being sent to certain subfolders using rules and it's certain subfolders that appear to be consistently missing from the unread mail folder, however, it's NOT consistent that all
 emails to a subfolder don't show up. &nbsp;For example, I have a subfolder and this folder gets consistent "reporting" emails at the end of each day and these are NOT showing up in the unread mail, however, alert emails from the same source and being moved to the
 subfolder by the same "rule" do appear in the unread email folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Nayana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions;</p>
<p>All 3 email accounts are POP3.</p>
<p>All the subfolders are under the inbox folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think I may have solved it, however. &nbsp;When looking at the rules I saw an icon to the far right in the rules list that was present on only a few of the rules. &nbsp; When I investigated this I learned that it meant that the rule included an instruction to "stop
 processing rules" after this rule. &nbsp;Somehow this was being selected by default during the rules setup. &nbsp;After unchecking this the reported number of "unread" emails in the global search folder now matches the total number of unread emails listed in the individual
 subfolders.</p>

<h2>            WHS Launchpad Runs But No Menu as of build 10122</h2>
                    <p>I now have build 10130 and have the same issue. The launchpad comes up fine and appears to log in to the server. The green screen has no menu choices on it so I can't tell for sure. This worked fine until 10122.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have WHS working?</p>

            <p>Launchpad is a client side app that communivates with WHS. Since it is client side, I figured this is ere I should post it since it ran fine until 10122.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turns out, I reinstalled the app and all is well.</p>

    <title>I can create an index for multiple documents, but the page numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhuffman21  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can create an index for multiple documents, but the page numbers don&#39;t specify which document to use. Can page numbers specify the correct document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a set of user manuals (many hundreds of pages each) that I would like to provide a single index for. I can easily create an index using RD, but the index just shows a list of page numbers and not the particular document the page number comes from.
 I'd like to be able to specify which document to look in. I'm thinking there must be a way to add an acronym for the document name (or something similar) to the individual documents' page numbers so when the index is generated, the page numbers would include
 the acronym. Something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An index entry.........UG-1, CG-124</p>
<p>Another index entry........CG-5, MLG-238</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where UG is the acronym for a document named User Guide, CG is Configuration Guide, etc. and the page number in that&nbsp;document.&nbsp;I could then easily provide a definition for each acronym at the top of the index so a user could find their index entry and see
 the various manuals with their specific page numbers. Right now, the index looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An index entry.........1, 124</p>
<p>Another index entry........5, 238</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which isn't at all helpful for a user of the document set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after four years I have no idea which article was originally at that link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you just want to compile an index for several separate documents, you can use RD fields.</p>

<p>Is there a document that will guide me (step-by-step) through this process. I have a document with an Index. Just before the Index I have used the Insert &gt; Quick Parts &gt; Field &gt; RD &gt; File Name</p>
<p>When I then Update Index I get the following message:</p>

            You'll need full paths to reference the external documents, and you also need to use double backslashes when specifying the paths. See

<p>OK, I've read all of this material. This is what I have tried:</p>
<p>I created a document entitled "Master Index"</p>
<p>I opened this document in Outline View, selected "Show Document" and then used the Insert button to add several of the documents for which I want to have a common index.</p>
<p>Each of these documents has words or phrases I have marked as Index entries (using the Mark Entry button on the Index box of the References Tab.</p>
<p>When I insert an Index, using the Insert Index button, the Index that is created now attaches page numbers to some of the Entries that are incorrect. It seems that the later an Entry is in a document the more likely it is to have an incorrect page number.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions?</p>

<p>If you can see the index marking (XE fields), you must turn off the display of hidden text before you update the Index field. The problem is that when the XE field codes are displayed, they take up extra space and change the locations of page breaks. The
 farther into the file you go, the more the pagination is thrown out of whack. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The XE fields are marked as Hidden, and you have to hide them, either by clicking the ¶ button on the Home tab or by opening the Options dialog to the Display page and unchecking the "Hidden text" box.</p>

            To add to what Jay has said, I believe there used to be a bug with the RD field that caused numbering issues. However, I think that bug should be fixed by now.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Unfortunately, this is impossible because outlook.com has far too many critical errors and stability issues in the core functionality. This has been the situation for years (at least since 2013), and there are currently no indications that it

<p>
</p><p><span>I guess our needs are very similar to most other families with jobs, children and a digital life. I am therefore sure you will smile and recognize the scenario and more specific needs listed below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Youth:</strong></span><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Facebook is the platform where the youth have most of their communication, contacts and arrange meetings/parties. Their other needs are very basic; they just need to receive and reply to occasional emails and to maintain their personal
 calendar. Platforms: Outlook 2013 University, web, iOS and Android.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Parents:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Outlook 2013/2010 is the platform where the parents manage emails, contacts and calendar appointments, both business and personal. We coordinate business trips, family events etc. as meetings in the personal calendars. We have all personal
 information on a separate domain. Other platforms: iOS and web.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Privacy: </strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>We (reluctantly) accept in service web ads based on the specific mails we are reading, but we will not accept that all our mail, contacts and calendars are being scanned to build a marketing profile.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Validated:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I am not interested in repeating the failure I did when choosing outlook.com based on advertised features, minimal test and&nbsp;confidence in Microsoft. I am looking for recommendations referring to real life experiences from a similar family/company
 setup that has been used daily in minimum a month.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Any inspiration, guidance or help is highly appreciated!</span></span></p>

            <p>
</p><p><span><span>As a starting point, I will now be the first to describe the setup that we currently use in my family.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Our current family calendar setup is a mix of outlook.com and Exchange Online.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The youth use outlook.com; the parents use Exchange Online. <span>
&nbsp;</span>The total price is $8 per month.</span></span></p>

<li>The above is enough to provide a consolidated calendar with both own and other family member’s appointments on web (outlook.com), Outlook 2013 University, iOS and Android.</li><li>The youth can respond to meeting invitations from the parents.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li><span>The subscribed calendars from both outlook.com and office365.com refresh every 2-3 hours.
<br />
(This can also be seen as a major benefit compared to the 2-3 days in outlook.com)</span></li><li><span>Exchange Online has more features than outlook.com, so setup takes more skills and effort.
</span></li><li><span>Exchange online has a few limitations compared to outlook.com (e.g. only one outgoing email address per user)</span></li><li><span>The price of Exchange Online is $4 per month per user. This is $96 a year just for the parents in our little family.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Exchange Online on own domain</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If both the youth and the parents use the same personal domain (myfamilyname.com) then Exchange needs to be setup to relay emails from the parents to the (forwarding) mail service of the youth. The trick is to</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>setup the personal domain for <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj945194(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>create an <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms.exch.eac.connectorselection(v=exchg.150).aspx#InboundOutbound1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>The above setup also allows additional mailboxes hosted directly at the mail servers of the personal domain.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>iOS bonus information</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I like the iOS App: “</span><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-by-readdle-sync/id608834326?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Calendars by Readdle</span></a><span>”. It reads the content already synchronized to
 the native iOS calendar and then allows me to have a very nice week/month overview - very much look like the outlook calendars.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Other considerations</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I have considered moving the entire family to Exchange Online, but that would really be killing mosquitos with cannons. Exchange Online is designed and priced for business users with high requirements like the financially backed uptime of minimum
 99.9%. We can easily live with less and therefore find it superfluous to add another $192 on top of the $79 for a 4 year
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/university" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 University
</a>subscription. Especially because we do not like to financially reward Microsoft for the exceptionally low quality of the already included complementary service (outlook.com).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>My future setup</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Surely, the current setups is no a long-term solution; we just use it to keep the family coordinated while I search for better alternatives. I am painfully aware that the personal use of the Microsoft Office suite is the root cause driving us
 into the outlook.com troubles, so Microsoft Office is also included in my search for alternatives. This situation then opens up the search to include other operating systems. I guess you by now&nbsp;understand why I paid a bit to gain sufficient time to investigate
 and test my next move.</span></span></p>

<li>If fixing the Outlook.com core platform would take a long time, then why can Microsoft not quickly release a

Office 365 Business Essentials</a></strong> service, which would provide access to
<strong>5 Microsoft Exchange Online accounts</strong> (mail, contacts, calendar), and using the Outlook.com domain name (or a new name created for this family service)?</li><li>Such extension need not be free, I believe many would gladly pay an fairly priced fee for a reliable and ad-free service, providing mail, contacts and calendar service for the entire family.</li><li>It would be a great alternative to Google's or Apple's platform.</li></ul>

            <p><span><span>A large organization like Microsoft will also take a long time to define and release a new product like the one you propose. I doubt it can be done in 6 months, perhaps 1 year with high management commitment.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Therefore, the only quick fix possible would be to somehow refund the costs associated with using the existing Exchange Online until the issue is fixed. This would demonstrate a high commitment to customer satisfaction and create internal pressure
 to quickly fix the issue. I have never seen anything like that from Microsoft, and will be surprised if it happens. Microsoft simply does not yet feel the same fierce competition as seen for cars, hotels, airlines, etc.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I currently pay, but I doubt many would be ready to pay for a basic family calendar; similar services are well functioning and completely free if you shop elsewhere (e.g. Apple). The only drawback is that their services do not integrate so well

</p><p><strong>What puzzles me about this situation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That the IT press has not reported on the fundamental issues with Outlook.com's contacts and calendar cloud services.</li><li>That Microsoft has let a truly fundamental problem with a core cloud service linger and go unresolved for such a very long time now already.</li><li>That Microsoft is unaware of, or willing to take, the risk that many frustrated home users will abandon its platform and move to Google or Apple.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alternative solutions?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Continue to use Outlook 2013, and replace Outlook.com by Google's cloud platform</strong>. In that case we need a "middleware" to sync Google Contacts and Google Calendar. There is a free open source tool available,
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/googlesyncmod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Go Contact Sync Mod</strong></a>, but I have experienced issues with it. Some people may also not like the fact that Google will build a "marketing profile" based on your personal
 with non-Apple devices is not as smooth as one would want. To be confirmed...</li><li><strong>Continue to use Outlook 2013, and pay for Microsoft Office 365 Business Essentials</strong> for use as a mail, contacts and calendar repository. This seems to be a robust solution, but it costs $4 per month, per user. It's too expensive for family
 use.</li><li><strong>Abandon Outlook 2013 and start using the Google or Apple cloud platform with a web browser client</strong>. However, using a web browser as a front-end may have some disadvantages (for example, offline use is not as smooth).</li><li><strong>Abandon Outlook 2013 and start using an alternative desktop client software</strong>. On Windows pc's, there are not many alternatives available to replace Outlook 2013 for both mail, contacts and calendar functions. I have started testing
<a href="http://www.emclient.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>eM Client</strong></a>, which appears promising at first sight. (Note that its free version is limited to 2 mail accounts per user, e.g. your personal and your business account). Unlike Outlook 2013,
 eM Client has built-in synchronization support for Google's platform (and others, including Outlook.com, iCloud, Exchange), so a combination of eM Client and Gmail.com could be a alternative to the combination of Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com. See also this

 comes with additional learning and a lower quality product (“icing the half-baked cake”). Microsoft has realized this and are now concentrating all their best resources on business features in Win10/Outlook2016, and we see the consequences in personal services
 like outlook.com.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Microsoft being completely complacent and therefore not realizing the situation<br />
</span></strong><span>This is the impression we get when seeing all the auto responses from Microsoft and MVP’s in this forum. Nobody thinks, that perhaps this is a programming error in our software, everybody starts out be assuming that issues are due to hardware,
 setup or user errors. This is the scenario supported by prominent people like John P. Kotter:

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>IT Press</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>We both know that it takes quite some time to collect and verify the information to build a forum supported list of critical issues. The IT press does not have the resources to do this. It is much easier to make a quick shallow review of the
 new Windows 10 preview, and it probably also generates more hits and clicks on the ads.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In addition, the issues are not really news considering the above well-known scenarios. Then it is just small ripples on the surface… (no pun intended ;-)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anyway, now I feel we are getting a bit too much off-topic (finding the best calendar service), so let us leave room for other forum members to add real life experiences with other outlook.com alternatives.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Alternatives</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for your list of alternatives, please let me know what you choose if you replace outlook.com.</span></span></p>

<li>I purchased a 2-user 1-year license for <strong>Microsoft Exchange Online Plan 1</strong> (3.1 euro per user per month). This seems to be a robust solution (in my currently limited experience, and from what I heard from you and others). When this first
 year expires, I will evaluate the situation again.</li><li>Also, we continue to use <strong>Outlook 2013</strong> (on Windows) and&nbsp;<strong>Google's Gmail, Calendar and Contacts</strong> apps (on Android) as clients, because we have grown so accustomed to them over the years, and because they have a feature set

            My biggest problem with outlook or hotmail.com for that matter is how slow it is. Of course I have used it for years as my primary email. I hope that they can speed it up soon. Oh well.&nbsp;

    <title>How to populate new column with year from a date column&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chelonidae  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to populate new column with year from a date column&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Brief summary:</p>
<p>My inherited database has many samples, now collected for the same locations for multiple years. In order to conduct specific queries that segregate data by Year, I need to create a new column for year. I have thousands of records. How can I add this column
 to the necessary tables and extract the year from another column in these tables that provides a date? I don't want to do this as a query; I want to create the column in these tables so that I can designate it as another component of the primary key.
</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for your help. FYI, I'm a bit of a novice with Access (no SQL experience, but will try).</p>

            <p>Again, Wrong approach. If you already have a date field that identifies when the samples were done, you don't need another field in your table. If you only want to identify the samples by Year, then you do it in a query adding a column:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yr: Year(datefield)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as I said in your other question, you need to split out the Samples results into a separate table.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 - Suddenly not working with Network Solutions POP server to receive email</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10</p>
<p>Office Professional 2016 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook had been working until suddenly last Wednesday morning. &nbsp;It never finished the Send/Receive cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that it is hung up on the receive from a Network Solutions POP email account. &nbsp;It does not give an error message. &nbsp;It just grinds on and on and never finishes and never downloads messages (which I can see on the server via webmail).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired the Office app... both quick and full.</p>
<p>I have run scanpst.exe on all files.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Office 2016 and reinstalled.</p>
<p>I have checked spelling and passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages, it just grinds on forever when it tries to send/receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached is where it gets stuck when setting up the Outlook email in the fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just does not seem to make a good receive connection with the POP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. I'm at wits' end!</p>

    <title>where is the &#34;clear recent files&#34; function&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rrh in ct  say:</h3>
<h2>            where is the &#34;clear recent files&#34; function&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">
In Word 365 for Mac (with OS 10.14.3).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
As of about two days ago, when I am in a Word document and click on File and then Open Recent, the list of recent documents pops up as usual. What does not show up at the bottom of the list is the option to “Clear Recent” — which I have used many times in the
 past. I was told by Microsoft tech support that the only option now is to clear every single file manually by clicking on "More" at the bottom of the list and then right-clicking and deleting each recently opened file one at a time.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
Really? What could be the possible explanation for removing the "Clear Recent" option? If I've opened a two dozen or more files in the course of a day (not unusual, given my work), why can't I clear them all at the same time?
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
<strong>Is there a workaround?</strong> Is there someplace where I can specify the number of recent files to show? Most important: Why was this function deleted and how can we get it back?! &nbsp;When I am finished working with a bunch of files I should be able
 to clear them and start the list anew.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
I am attaching a screen shot to show what I mean. Again: until a day or two ago, there was a "Clear Recent" in the same area as "More." Now, there is no more "Clear Recent." And yes, I quit Word, shut down and restarted my computer, etc. etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Recent Files list uses a list from OneDrive, if you are signed into your Microsoft account and store files on OneDrive. To eliminate those, sign out of your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .plist shows files that you have edited locally on your computer. Here's how to find and delete it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Word.</li><li>Hold down the<strong> Option </strong>key while clicking on the <strong>Go</strong> menu and choosing
<strong>Library</strong>. Your hidden user Library folder opens.</li><li>Open <strong>Library/Containers/com.Microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences</strong>.</li><li>Drag <strong>com.microsoft.Word.securebookmarks.plist</strong> to your desktop (or the trash).</li><li>Reopen Word. The Recent Files list should be empty (actually, it just says <em>
More...</em>)</li></ol>
<p>If you do this frequently, you probably want to create an alias on your desktop to the Preferences folder. That .plist doesn't hold any other significant information, so Word is otherwise unaffected.</p>

<h2>            Contacts Deleted On An Update Attempt - HTC HD2 -- HELP&#33;</h2>
                    So I was updating my HTC HD2 because of the freesing problem that it had. While I was doing the update, the website told me to sync my contents into MyPhone, so I did at first and after i finished my phones update, i had synced it by mistake to MyPhone
 without knowing that once you sync again, the previous info gets erased especially since after the new update, the phone is completely cleared. I just want to know if there is a way where I can get that previous sync where i had all my contacts and documents,
 just more concerned about my contacts than anything else. PLEASE HELP!

<p>If you had deleted the info from your device THEN sync'd with MyPhone, ALL of the deleted data would have been moved to the MyPhone Archive.&nbsp; If that was the case, then go to the Archive section on the MyPhone site, select Contacts and see if they are there.&nbsp;
 They will be if you deleted from the device then sync'd with MyPhone.</p>
<p>If they are not there then you are out of luck&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows Live Mail&#34;........is no longer alive&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I'm ready to pull out my last few hairs! I've only started using a PC in 2009, but wouldn't say I'm a novice even tough I'm 65 years old. I have a Hotmail-Microsoft account and when necessary to use the Windows 2012 Live mail, I am constantly told my account
 has been "locked" due to excessive password failed sign ins. I have been unable for MONTHS to access my Live Mail account to send certain emails requested on that account. Since my recent move, I now have a new phone number and cannot complete the "change
 password" procedure as it wants to text or call my old phone number and cannot figure out how to change that. So I'm in a pickle trying to "reinstate" my Windows Live mail. Any tips? Should I clear out this account and start all over, or will I lose all my
 connections with others?

            <p>Hi Skipper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you unable to login to Windows Live Mail only, or is your password not working online as well? (https://account.live.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to login on both Windows Live Mail and on the online web, it's likely that your password is no longer recognized by the system. You will need to reset your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since you already mentioned that you do not have the old phone number associated with your account, you cannot get a security code anymore. You will have to reset your password using another method, which is filling out an
<a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery Form</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the form above fails to verify your ownership, your best option would be to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">submit a Support case
</a>about your account. You will need to use another Microsoft Account for this procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, if your password works online but not on your Windows Live Mail, it's likely that the configuration of your software is the cause. You can contact
<a href="http://answerdesk.microsoftstore.com/msusa/en-us/answerdesk/answertech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Answerdesk</a> for a consultation about the settings, and they may be able to help you out with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know what happened, thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my side, we should unselect the check box for “Transition navigation keys” for just moving one cell with Tab key. If the issue persists after unselecting this option, I’d like to confirm the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does Tab key work well before? When does the issue occur, after Windows or Office updates?</li><li>Does Tab key work properly in other Office applications? </li><li>Open Excel&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of all information under Product Information. Meanwhile, what is the version of your operating system?</li><li>With Transition navigation keys unselected, when you click Tab key, what is the behavior (what do you mean by “tab key was not functioning as well“)?
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
