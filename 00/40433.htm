            <p>I would start by trying the built-in diagnostic to see if it can correct the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click your Start button at the bottom-left of the screen (or press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+<strong>S</strong>) and choose Control Panel</li><li>Type "trouble" in the search box and go to the Troubleshooting section</li><li>At the bottom, click "fix problems with Windows Update"</li></ol>
<p>After the update runs, check for desktop updates first:</p>

<h2>            XBox won&#8217;t connect to ANY WiFi Connections</h2>
                    <p>my Xbox One has been connected for months to my AT&amp;T router via WiFi with no issues whatsoever. None.</p>

<p>Yesterday it disconnected itself and now it wonâ€™t connect again. I tried the 2.4Ghz and the 5.0Ghz options and nothing.</p>

<p>Then I disconnected my iPhone from the WiFi and turned on the personal hotspot to test out the connection and nothing. That wonâ€™t work again.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an Xbox issue it seems like, not a router because it wonâ€™t connect to the router or the personal hotspot.</p>

<p>It says itâ€™s connecting and then checks the connection and it fails.</p>

            <p>When the Xbox doesn't see of connect to any wireless network, the Xbox usually just needs to be power cycled.</p><p><br /></p><p>If the Xbox is not seeing the network, power cycle the Xbox by unplugging the Xbox from the wall outlet and let it sit for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Power cycle your network by unplugging the power to the modem &amp; router for about 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Plug the Xbox back into a wall outlet and not a power strip.</p>
<p>Turn the Xbox on and see if you're able to see your network.</p><p>If you still can't connect to your router try this.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;- If that fails then, go to Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network Settings &gt; Forget Wireless Network</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Go to Settings &gt; Network Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Alternate MAC Address &gt; Clear &gt; let the Xbox Restart</p>

    <title>Unable to start Restore from System image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suusja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to start Restore from System image</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise 64 bit.</p>
<p>I want to try to create 'system image' and then Restore it. In case it'll work for me I'll use for all my 20 PC's.</p>
<p>My PC has one drive C:</p>
<p>I partitioned it and now I have C: and D: with a plenty of free space on each.</p>
<p>What I did:</p>
<p>1. Created 'system image' and stored it on D: Eventually I'll use external drive for backups ( currently I don't have it and just want to test that I could backup/restore)</p>
<p>2. Created 'Repair disc', then from it I created a bootable USB drive because some of my PC does not have CD ROM</p>
<p>3. Boot machine from USB drive and select 'Restore from system image'. It recognized that image is located on D: but immediately aborted Restore with this message:</p>
<p>"The selected system image cannot be restored in this recovery environment."</p>
<p>Browsing various forums it looks that this message comes due to 32 bit Repair disc and 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>Hence my 2 questions:</p>
<p>1. Could my issue be related to the fact I am trying to restore not from external drive but from another partition?</p>
<p>2. In case I do have an issue with 32 bit vs. 64 bit ... and which point it could happened? I used Win 7 Enterprise to create that disc but I'm not sure if it default to 32 bit or 64 bit or it even gave me the option to choose from ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Movie maker can&#39;t open AVI file&#33;</h2>
                    I have taken a video in .MOV format and have converted it to AVI, PAL but when I try to import it into Movie Maker it won't open it, stating that the codec required is not installed. I thought AVI files were Microsoft specific and shouldn't need any other
 codecs, or am I completely wrong. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I have Windows XP and run; couldn't tell which Movie Maker version I have but it dates from 2006. Many thanks.

=======================================<br />
In Windows XP...your version of Movie Maker would be<br />
&nbsp;2.1 this can be verified by going to...Help / About.<br />
<br />
There are many types of .AVI files and many if not most <br />
are problematic in Movie Maker. Converting the original<br />
.MOV file to the .WMV format before importing into Movie <br />
Maker should be the fix.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail...the following freeware&nbsp; <br />
is just one example:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 )<br />
(***Carefully read *all* the install screens...there <br />
may be some items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />

<h2>            I know my cd-key but forgot a account-ID and password</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've got a problem with a game I purchased (and played) over Steam. Half a year ago I purchased Super Street Fighter IV : Arcade Edition over steam. I created a windows live account and linked the key to that account. Now, I haven't been playing the game
 for a longer period of time. In a meantime, I got a new pc. Today I downloaded via Steam SSFIV:AE and when I started the game the Windows live login came butI forgot the account name and the login information I used the first time to connect to my account.</p>
<p>If anyone can help me. I do own a cd key which I can present in case of verification. Is there a way to find out which account was linked to my cd-key so I could actually recall my username and retrieve a password.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there's no way to identify a profile using a CD key. You should be able to recover your profile with your email address using one the following links
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr</a> or forgotten password
<a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/.../reset</a></p>
<p>If you are not sure of the address you used you will have to look through your emails from around the time you purchased Street Fighter IV and see if you can find the registration emails, when you set up your account you should have received a few confirmation
 emails from Microsoft which may even have your gamertag ID on them. Once you've found these you can use the above links. This page may also help

<h2>            My SSD is full and I don&#39;t know why</h2>
                    I've gone over all my SSD files and my games/essential programs like Skype, Discord, so on - are not on there(all on HDD). I originally had my games on SSD but when they were becoming too large(namely WoW) I started moving them over to my HDD, and I had
 well over 50GB+ free and it was in the green. Now it only has 5GB and there's no essential programs on it...everything is installed on HDD.

<h3> ixascaelum  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD&#58; DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;SynTP.sys&#41; during GAMING</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have experienced countless BSODs involving the Synaptics Touchpad.</p>
<p>The BSOD only occurs in-game and usually after long hours of gaming (however, there was one occasion where it occurred after 10 minutes of gaming)</p>
<p>I am using a Aftershock S-15 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Specs:</p>
<p>Intel i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.60Ghz</p>
<p>RAM: 8GB</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 64-bit</p>
<p>Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970M</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have brought it for servicing multiple times but they are unable to detect/solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the actions taken (on different occasions):</p>
<p>Reinstallation of NVIDIA Graphic Card Drivers</p>
<p>Reinstallation of Synaptics TouchPad drivers</p>
<p>Running CCleaner</p>
<p>Reformatting entire hard drive</p>
<p>Replacement of hard drive (latest action taken)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the games that the BSOD have occurred in:</p>
<p>Dying Light</p>
<p>Saints Row 2</p>
<p>Saints Row 3</p>
<p>Saints Row 4</p>
<p>Garena League of Legends</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</p>
<p>PayDay 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only occurs during movement and not when idle (in game).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also observed that after uninstalling the Synaptics Touchpad drivers, the same BSOD occurred but involving a different file (<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">HKKbdFltr.sys).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Please advice on what I should do next. I suspect that the next course of action the technicians would do is to replace the actual touchpad itself but I have a feeling that it will not help.</span></p>
<p>Here is the link to my dump file:</p>
<p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4A944F23C2DAE7BE!130&amp;authkey=!AF_WQHG5cd4NqJo&amp;ithint=file%2czip</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have more dump files but there's only 1 since I've recently gotten a new hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">This is also my first time posting on this forum so I'm sorry if I didn't format my question correctly.</span></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ixas</p>

            <p>Hi ZigZag3143.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coincidentally my technician emailed me today regarding this issue.</p>
<p>He has consulted the factory and provided me with new drivers to install.</p>
<p>The driver version that he provided is<strong>&nbsp;18.2.1</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully, this will solve the persisting BSODs. I'll let you know if anything crops up.</p>
<p>

 few of the other games and didn't get any failures so I'm going to contact Ubisoft as well. I can't do all the actions you did as far as reformatting because of the other work I do, which of course, I back up on the storage and external drives as well. I'm
 using a Digital Storm (DS), Harker with a GeForce GTX 1080. But DS and this custom built config got off to a very rough start. So, until I read your posting, I assumed it was another DS problem. Thanks so much for your time in posting this.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Vista - all programs &#34;have stopped working&#34; and nothing will open. Mcafee is also not working, and help and support center&#47;internet will not even open</h2>
                    On my windows vista, whenever I turn on my computer and log in, none of my programs work. An error message pops up saying that the program has stopped working and windows will try to find a solution to the problem.&nbsp; The problem is that the help and support
 center doesn't open either. None of my internet programs open either, and the same error message pops up for everything. We have tried turning off the DEP, and that did not help. My computer is connected to the internet (2wire) but is not able to run due to
 the problems with my computer. I have scanned my computer with windows defender, and it found no problems. Please help

    <title>Unable to boot to the computer after Windows updates. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to boot to the computer after Windows updates.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows XP Media will not load after multiple windows updates and restarts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what else to try. I have a Dell Dimension 8400 running&nbsp;XP sp3 Media, Norton Internet Security 2012 and Norton Utilities 15. I had&nbsp;not gotten around to installing Norton Ghost. I am not sure if I am running IE7 or IE8.</p>
<p>Here is where the problem comes in. I have not used the desktop since March, so when I logged on there were multiple windows updates&nbsp;to install and restart. On the 4th restart, it would not restart. There are no&nbsp;error messages, it makes it though the Dell
 POST,&nbsp;then gives the three Safe Mode options, Last Known and Start Normally. None of them work: all Safe modes go to a screen full of drrives ending with: multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)Partition(2)\Windows\System32\Driverrs\agpCPQ.sys (I am not sure if this happened
 originally or if they just locked up). The Last Known... goes to black screen (no blinking cursur) and Start Normally locks up the option screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the Windows disk that came with it and ran Recover and chkdsk /r multiple times, also booted to the Diagnostics partition that Dell has on the hard drive and on a Resourse cd. I even&nbsp;changed the Setup to run a slow boot in F2 instead of the default
 for fast boot.&nbsp;I also ran the Norton Internet Security resource disk that updated online to the most recent to check for viruses. I am not getting any errors to know where to go from here. I have alot of data files that I do not want to lose, so I would hate
 to reinstall Windows and do a million updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do next. Is there any way to revert back to the system before the windows updates on 9/25/12 or to repair whatever they may have clashed with? I am lost, frustrated, and so tired of not getting anywhere with this. I&nbsp;was updating it
 because I needed some of the files and because&nbsp;I need a backup for when my&nbsp;Dell Inspiron 9400 laptop goes down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>If you have the installation CD/DVD for Windows XP, I would suggest navigate to â€œ<b>You<span> need to perform a repair installation of Windows
 XP</span></b>â€ section from the following link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to fix a computer that won't start</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but you may need to run
 Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version.</span></p>
<p><span>If your installation DVD disk is prior to Sp1, and you have SP1 installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall SP1 to complete the in-place upgrade
 and then reinstall the necessary windows updates. This applies if you have SP2 also.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps and provide us with more information if you need further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Hi M. Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for responding and sorry for the delay. I&nbsp;thought that I would&nbsp;get a notification when someone had replied. I was still searching endlessly for answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I had already tried, before posting my problem, unsuccessfully to repair Windows XP with the OEM CD from Dell, I ran across other sites regarding my problem accessing
 Windows. From what I can see, I donâ€™t think that I&nbsp;was â€œrepairingâ€ correctly. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it true that when you access the Windows cd and have the option to â€œRâ€, repair a Windows XP installation using the Recovery Console, that you press enter to setup Windows
 XP now rather than using the Recovery Console? Then accept the License Agreement and another repair option will hopefully (since it is an OEM cd) be available? Then, say no to register and just keep updating and hope it doesn't happen again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the link above does not tell you to ignore the Recovery Console. I had thought that it was the only way to repair without reinstalling and losing everything.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will give it a try and respond back tomorrow.
Also, if I need my activation code or license number for Windows, do you know how I could find it, since&nbsp;I bought it preinstalled&nbsp;from Dell in 2005?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Cheryl</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for clearing that up. It would be better if that step was included in the "Repair" instructions. I found that detail on other sites but not on any Microsoft support areas. Anyway...</p>
<p>The repair did eventually bring up Windows after several error messages&nbsp;along the way.&nbsp;I had to find&nbsp;"iastor.sys"&nbsp;file, it was in C:\Windows\Dell subdirectory instead of on the install disk.&nbsp;A "svchost.exe Application Error" at "0x7c9111cd" referenced&nbsp;memory
 at "0x00690076".&nbsp;Also, a few ngen.exe - Entry Point not found&nbsp;(I think this is a Norton issue).
</p>
<p>The ERROR&nbsp;that concerns me the most is the ".NETFramework Initialization Errors C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\ v4.0.30319\mscorwks.dll could not be loaded". I have not restarted it yet since I don't know if it will boot up again. I was able to back
 up my files to a flash drive. Yeah!</p>
<p>Now I am searching for answers as to why Windows won't update. I receive an error 0x8024400A when I try the express critical updates, since it did not start the updates when Windows came up. Start-Run-"winver" says I am running Windows XP Media Center Version
 5.1 Service Pack 2 (build 2600.xpsp_sp2_rtm.040803-2158). </p>
<p>How do I update Media Center to Service Pack 3? And how do I fix ".NETFramework Initialization Errors"? I will keep looking, but please reply if you have the answer before I find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Again,</p>
<p>Cheryl</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for all the great links. Unfortunately, my desktop wants me to pull all my hair out. I am in this endless loop with everything I try.</p>
<p>It seems that I am running IE ver 6 sp2 and .NET Framework 1.1. The IE 6 needs a fix according to the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888092</a>&nbsp; due to a glitch that&nbsp;causes&nbsp;the shutdown error from&nbsp;a mshtml.dll error.
</p>
<p>I can't run any Microsoft updates&nbsp;or fixes without .NET Framework 2.0 or later, but I can't update it because of the IE 6 problem. I get the&nbsp;80240036 and&nbsp;8024400A for Microsoft&nbsp;or just&nbsp;IE updates. I get the IE encountered... shutdown when I try the skydrive
 link.</p>
<p>Also, the 25007 error while initializing fusion. Setup could not load fusion&nbsp;with LoadLibraryShim()-80131700 on the auto install for .NET Framework 2.0 that comes with Ghost 15 that I finally installed too late, but prompts to install on startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did look that last one up too, I do have .NET Frame 4 Client Profile in add/remove programs. Will it help anything if I remove it? How can I fix, update&nbsp;or upgrade IE without getting errors when I try? I am stuck. I can't get anything to update except
 I didn't get an error on the windows installer update. But, then again, I don't know if it is working either.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cheryl</p>

            <p>I do not really recommend a repair install, if you can get into windows, back up your data and do a complete reinstall.</p>
<p>If you performed the dot net fix, which you may have to download to a flash drive from a working pc and carry it to yours, you would not be at dot net 4.0.</p>
<p>I believe what happened is that you were at sp3 and now the repair brought you back to IE 6 and sp2.

            <p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>
<p>Thank you for all your help. As soon as I was able to get into Windows, the first thing I did was&nbsp;copy all my documents, files, taxes&nbsp;and pictures.&nbsp;I am fine with a complete reinstall. I think that is everything? I&nbsp;will probably only have problems and glitches
 at all the wrong times if we try to fix it all.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but I am confused. This is probably a stupid question... What is a dot net fix? Is that the .NET Framework?</p>
<p>Also, when I do a complete reinstall, do I have to&nbsp;download&nbsp;IE6 with the link you supplied and then run updates, then uninstall or can I jump to IE7 or IE8 at any other point? I don't want to assume that the IE6 problem has to be fixed before I can update
 to a newer version. Though it seems that way with the error codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are right when you say that "I believe what happened is that you were at sp3 and now the repair brought you back to IE 6 and sp2. " (sorry I don't have the quote feature down yet)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;I only typed your skydrive link (and the other links)&nbsp;on the desktop, I was unable to access it due to IE6 errors. Now that I finally clicked on it with&nbsp;my laptop, duh,&nbsp;I see what is there. I never tried to download anything from it to&nbsp;my flash drive.
 When it comes to downloading, it is always hard to tell whether the option to download to a flash drive, cd, etc. is available. &nbsp;Is that an option for anyone who does not want to do a complete reinstall?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to miss any steps and I also want to be sure that this is the only option if anyone else is at this point.
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cheryl</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to say that your screenshot is amazing. Is it for real?&nbsp; Is it downloadable as a screensaver or wallpaper?</p>

            <p>The downloads of .net (dot net) were if you tried to fix your pc.</p>
<p>if you are going to do a complete reinstall follow the instructions here:</p>
<p><span><a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&amp;t=44636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&amp;t=44636</a></span></p>
<p><span>to download to a flash drive, if it is on your desktop you would right click and choose Send To, which lists your drives, if you have a flash drive connected it will show up on the list.</span></p>
<p><span>if it is in your folders, you can use the common tasks in the left hand pane, highlight selection and choose copy selected items, a box will open up and you can choose where to copy to, then press
 copy.</span></p>
<p><span>As for the cloud screenshot, if you download it to your pictures and then right click on an open area on your desktop and choose properties, in the display box choose screensaver, then browse to
 your pictures and choose the picture that you want.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: any pictures in My pictures is added to the list of screensavers, so if you do not want to have everything in your pictures folder listed, then create a new folder labeled, for example, Pics
 and put all your pictures in there.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I asked about downloads, I did not ask it quite right. Sorry.</p>
<p>When you are downloading any programs or updates, sometimes you are given the option to "RUN" and/or "SAVE",&nbsp;you don't always know that you will be given an option to&nbsp;"SAVE" to&nbsp;another path: flash drive, CD or even to your desktop in a format that can be
 transported and copied to another computer to "RUN" it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is where&nbsp;I hesitate to download programs or updates that might hurt&nbsp;my working computer, when it was meant to be copied to the problem computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want me to try anything else for the benefit of anyone who can't copy their files, just let me know. Otherwise, I will work on the fresh install over the weekend and hopefully be able to close this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have SP2 on both&nbsp;Windows XP Media Center&nbsp;2005 &amp; Internet Explorer 6,&nbsp;do you think&nbsp;the&nbsp;install&nbsp;will fix the errors enough so that&nbsp;I&nbsp;can use the links that you supplied earlier to update them since&nbsp;they are no longer supported?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help. If I am off track please let me know. Have a great weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheryl</p>

            <p>Howdy - Windows Audio quality guy here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm... Dell's support site doesn't list an Inspiron 12 3452. <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Products/laptop/inspiron_laptop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Products/laptop/inspiron_laptop</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest I see is an Inspiron 15 3542, with a Realtek ALC3223 HD Audio driver.
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/inspiron-15-3542-laptop/drivers/advanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/inspiron-15-3542-laptop/drivers/advanced</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember correctly, the Realtek audio drivers are also on Windows Update. Can you try these audio troubleshooting tips?
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/mediaq/archive/2015/07/30/windows_2d00_10_2d00_audio_2d00_troubleshooting_2d00_tips.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If that still doesn't work, can you do Start | DxDiag | Save All Information and send me the resulting DxDiag.txt file?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;bricked&#34; my Dell laptop</h2>
                    <p>Attempted to upgrade to windows 10 on July 29th and the system appeared to be in a loop restarting. The system went to a black screen and does not show the Dell splash logo and does not show the Bios or boot menu anymore. It powers up but does nothing, black
 screen, no OS no boot options nothing. I have my windows 8 recovery disks but can't use them because I can't get to the boot options!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was seeking advice on the Dell forums and there are a large number of people in the same boat. Their tech advice is useless, they keep saying dead motherboard or need a new hard drive, use the F2 or F12, etc. It's like they are not reading/understanding
 what we are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone experiencing issues like this? I would like to hear if anyone has found a way to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 10 upgrade has done more damage than a virus!! I hope Microsoft will actually step up and find a solution because Dell has not been much help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>From what I have been reading it sounds like a lot of people are experiencing issues similar to mine. It appears that the upgrade actually makes changes to the BIOS, can anyone confirm this? As the only time I am able to get partially up is when I remove
 the CMOS battery (and that's a pain on the laptop). </p>

<p>
</p><p>Like many others, I can not get to the BIOS or BOOT menus. I have a black screen! I was able to get into windows 10 last night and tried to roll back to Windows 8.1 in the settings menu. It started the process and hung again on reboot, black screen, no BIOS
 or BOOT options, just the power light and the fan running. I CAN NOT USE THE INSTALLATION MEDIA because I can not get to the OS or BOOT options!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to answer my question,Does Windows 10 modify the BIOS during installation?</p>

<p>During online Star Trek gaming and while using NFL rewind computer shuts down after approximately 10 to 15 minutes and no longer! Currently experiencing shut down during these two activities only! Regular online surfing such as Facebook etc does not result
 in computer shut down! I did boot into safe mode with networking and accessed NFL rewind watching a whole game minus audio drivers which were disengaged!</p>

    <title>Is It Possible To Upgrade From Windows 7 Enterprise To Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is It Possible To Upgrade From Windows 7 Enterprise To Windows 10 Home&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">So I recently got a new HP laptop. It's an <strong>
EliteBook 8470p </strong>laptop, and I really like it, it's a pretty decent laptop! I got it from a company, and they forgot to reset it, so the operating system that is installed on the laptop is still
<strong>Windows 7 Enterprise</strong>. This is the version that companies have on their computers, so that they can be optimized for work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">So obviously I wanted to fix this, and I've been thinking about ways to make the laptop my own. And I thought that I could buy a
<strong>Windows 10 Home installation disc</strong>, and upgrade straight from <strong>
Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Home</strong>. But I'm not sure if this is possible though. That's why I'm asking this question:
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is it possible to upgrade from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Home?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Oh and by the way, if it's necessary, I'll put in the
<strong>tech specs </strong>of the laptop here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor: <strong>Intel Core i5-3320M CPU 2.60 GHz</strong></li><li>Installed Memory (RAM): <strong>4 GB (3.87 GB Usable)</strong></li><li>System Type: <strong>64-bit Operating System</strong></li></ul>

                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
In the Uninstall Manager, there is a program called "opensource" (not capitalized). The Publisher is "Your Company Name" and the size is 48MB. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">It
 is hard to figure out what this is because "opensource" could refer to so many things.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Does anyone know what this program is? &nbsp; Would it be risky to delete it?</p>

<strong>Please note that I am not asking for a definition of "open source." </strong>
&nbsp;I am saying this because so many people (or computers?) seem to skim posts and respond without understanding the question.</p>

<p>I have 16 gigs of photos and viedeos on my Macbook.&nbsp; I hate it.&nbsp; I cannot figure it out and do not have time to sit through hours of tutorials so I'm switching back.&nbsp;&nbsp;I copied some of my photos/videos onto an SD card and imported onto the new PC.&nbsp; The photos
 worked fine.&nbsp; Some videos will play but some will not.&nbsp; I have tried both Media Player and Quicktime.&nbsp; Neither works.&nbsp; Quicktime will pull up the video but when you hit play it glitches or something and will not play.&nbsp; Windows Media Player won't pull the image
 up or anything......gives me an error about having the wrong codecs.&nbsp; The files that work&nbsp;end in .mov I think.&nbsp; THe one's that do not work end in .mpg.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 with Media Player 12 and the most recent Quicktime.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Katie0622,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There could be two reasons you are not able to play some of the files that you transferred from your MAC book.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The files could be corrupted.<br />
b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You might not have the required codecs to play the files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you are able to play these files on a different computer. Copying the files on a Secure Data card and transferring them is a good idea of
 transferring the files. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, you might not have the required codecs to play these files with Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that should give you information on what a codec is:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/faq/codec.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/faq/codec.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>It would help us figure this out better if you could tell us the exact error message you get when you play these files with Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Though the format of the files that you are trying to play says MPEG, it could be an unknown format for Media Player. You should try to check the
 format of the files that you are trying to play and convert these files to the format that is recognized be Media Player. There are several Third Party converting software that are available to convert these files to the format readable by Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft
 cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></span></p>

            Hi Commodore65<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Are the accounts listed in c:\users accounts you do not need?&nbsp; If so, here is one way you should be able to delete them.<br />
<br />
Click on <strong>Start</strong><br />
Right click on <strong>Computer<br />
</strong>Click on <strong>Properties</strong><br />
Click on <strong>Advanced system settings<br />
</strong>Click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> Tab<br />
Under User Profiles, Click on&nbsp;<strong>Settings<br />
</strong>Click the User Profile you no longer need then click on Delete<br />
<br />
As to why they are not showing up in the User Account list, I am not sure.&nbsp; I've been researching that and have not yet found an answer.<br />
<br />
Please Post back and let us know if this helped to resolve the issue - thank you

    <title>Mice not working on windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flamewolf393  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mice not working on windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have a wireless mouse that I was using on a Vista laptop with no issues at all. I am now using a brand new Windows 7 64x laptop and the mouse is not working right. It will work fine most of the time, but every once in a while it will stop working and
 I have to re-seat the USB plug. Every time I sleep the&nbsp;laptop, the mouse no longer works when I bring it back up, and again I have to re-seat the plug. I have tried other corded USB mice, and windows will just sit there spinning on "installing device drivers".
 What is going on? I have looked up the mouse in question and it says it is fully compatible with windows 7 with no user action required.<br />

<h2>            Mouse cursor constantly loading &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">I have an <em><strong>HP</strong></em> laptop with a wireless mouse connected to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I don't remember doing anything in particular but since 3 days ago my mouse cursor is constantly loading even when I'm not running any program. It looks like the picture below.</p>

            Hi Vicky, this may be just an error/bug in Windows, however that is generally an indicator that your system is busy in the background . . .
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />If necessary, click on the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Leave that window open to monitor your system
<br />
<br />When that busy indicator is on your pointer, is your Hard drive, CPU or RAM overly busy (high percentage) at that time?
<br />
<br />If so, click on the appropriate column header, so the arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes at that time?       
        </p>

<p>The indicator that my cursor is busy never goes away. Not even for a second. It seems like it's always loading.</p>
<p>Anyway... I don't think in general that my CPU or RAM is overly busy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPU is around 3% most of the time and RAM is around 49% most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top 5 processes in the&nbsp;<strong>CPU</strong> collumn are:</p>
<p>&gt;Google Chrome</p>
<p>&gt;Task Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;System</p>
<p>&gt;McAfee management service host</p>
<p>&gt;Explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top 5 processes in the <strong>RAM</strong> collumn are:</p>
<p>&gt;Google Chrome</p>
<p>&gt;Radeon settings: Host application</p>
<p>&gt;Search</p>
<p>&gt;Task manager</p>
<p>&gt;Explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the <strong>Hard Drive</strong> is currently at 0%.</p>

            Hi Vicky, 
<br />
<br />Thank you for that . . .
<br />
<br />Your system is fine, there is nothing running in the background using your resources, this cursor must be a bug, it will probably go away with the next Windows update . ..

<p>Hey Stormwatch! Have you also tried your Kingdoms of Amular disc in an alternate Xbox 360 console? Are you able to install the game to your hard drive by hovering over the play game option on the Dashboard and then tap Install? This might make your game
 run and get passed the supposed "Unrecognized Disc" error. With either disc? </p>

<p>Miss Kleo,</p>
<p>I mentioned in my OP that both discs work fine on another console in my house. &nbsp;When I get the Unrecognized Disc error, I'm unable to install to the HDD since the xbox doesn't give me that option. &nbsp;My only options are "open tray" and "status code". &nbsp;I did
 work around this particular problem by using an alternate xbox, putting the game on a USB and then copying to my HDD from USB. &nbsp;However, I still can't play launching from the game library because it tells me to put the original disc in the tray...even when
 the game is in the tray. &nbsp;The error code I keep getting is 03-57-00.</p>

                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 Pro on a Lenovo X1 Carbon and it now won't recognize my additional monitors connected through my docking station.&nbsp; This all worked yesterday before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go into the settings for Intel HD Graphic Control Panel and select Multiple Monitors,&nbsp;it only allows the single display setting.&nbsp; I find no other options to extend my desktop.</p>
<p>
