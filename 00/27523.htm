<h2>            PROBLEMS WITH INVISIBLE FORMATTING IN OFFICE 365 WORD</h2>
                    Hullo friends. I'm hoping that someone can solve a problem for me to do with spacing - not between lines, or between characters. It is between words. In Word on Office 365 on my Mac, when formatting is shown, a space is indicated by a raised dot in the
 text. Problem is that between some random words there is that dot and also a space, which is an invisible character which seems like some invisible formatting character. When I move the cursor by the arrow, it moves across two separate characters between the
 words - one being the dot and the other being that invisible character. Sometimes that character is before the space/dot, and after on other occasions. &nbsp;I've tried to use Find/Copy/Replace, but will not work. Can someone please tell me how to eradicate all
 of those invisible characters? It's really messing up the formatting of this very large file, a book. I need a solution quickly, but no-one on line can help me. It even creates an indent of one space when text is justified at t

            <p>MS has to "pre-approve" your school before you can simply use your school email account.&nbsp; Since that is not working there are alternatives you can use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This page: https://products.office.com/en-ca/student&nbsp; is for "Office 365 Education", which is a free offer, if your school qualifies.&nbsp; Check it out. Ask you IT department to look into it too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>change the country in the bottom left corner of the page</p>
<p>enter your email account to see if you qualify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is the Office 365 University "MS Store" page: https://products.office.com/en-ca/university&nbsp; But it is pretty useless for this problem.&nbsp; There used to be a FAQ that was helpful, but it no longer is ...

<h2>            MS Project 2016 - Show fields from tasks and resources in a single view</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to have a customized view of project showing information from field to pertain to both the tasks and the resources at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We build our project for management purposes in Project 2016 and for accounting purposes the information need to be transferred to SAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We normally work within the task usage view that shows a task and then indented the ressources attached to this task and does that for each tasks.</p>
<p>In addition to the task and ressources I would need to have the following information shown:</p>
<p>Start date, Finish date, Work, Cost, Code (which is a field under the resource detail card), the type of the resource and the group of the resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to have an hybrid view show this information all at once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Mathieu_Cardinal,</p>
<p>The Start, Finish, Work and Cost fields are already available in the Task Usage view, you just have to add them as columns in the view. The resource code, type and group can also be added but it requires either some manual copying or a little VBA to translate.
 In order to understand why I suggest you read the following Wiki article:</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31991.ms-project-data-types-task-resource-assignment.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following that, this Wiki article will show you how to do the translation using VBA.</p>

<p>Yes this really is a different topic and should be a separate post. If I were a moderator, I could move it, but I'm not so I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's correct, using the import wizard, there is no way to import data into separate cost rate tables. You could either do it manually or use VBA. If this is a one time import and you don't have tons of resource data, the manual approach should work fine.
 If you need to do the import on a regular basis of it you have tons and tons of data then I'd use VBA. If you want help with that I can write a macro to import all your Excel data, just let me know by contacting me direct at my address below and we'll work
 one-on-one. I will ask some questions.</p>

            <p>
<span>Hi </span>Devin,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>The black screen issue could be due to display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following question so that we can help you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which Build is currently installed?</span></li><li><span>Was it working fine earlier?</span></li></ol>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up t</span><span>o check if you still get the black screen.</span><span>
</span><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then get updated drivers software for that particular device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> <strong>
with Networking</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode with Networking and <span>
update the drivers:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article to boot to Safe Mode with networking:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To <span>check for updated drivers follow the steps below:<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + C.</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Change PC settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Update and recovery</strong>&nbsp;and then tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Windows Update</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>View details</strong>, and tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Check for updates</strong>. (If you don't see&nbsp;<strong>View details</strong>, there aren't any optional updates available.)</span></li><li><span>Under&nbsp;<strong>Optional</strong>, click the update that you want to install, then click&nbsp;<strong>Install</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 3: Roll back driver</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suggest you to restore the driver for a device to a previous version. Refer to the steps below:<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + X key</strong> and click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand ‘<strong>Display Adapters</strong>’. </span></li><li><span>Right-click on the Display Adapter listed and click on properties.</span></li><li><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Driver</strong>&nbsp;tab, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Roll Back Driver.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If there's no previous version of the driver installed for the selected device, the Roll Back Driver
 button will be unavailable even if you are logged on as an administrator.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>If no updated drivers are available through Windows Update, check the website of the manufacturer of your video card to see if they have updated drivers available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

<h2>            Access Populate a query field with a conditional time value</h2>
                    <p>After going back and forth on how to word this question I decided to just babble out what I have so far and refine it as I go in hope that someone out there can help me out!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>**Updates on 2/7/17: (1) Changed the word appointment to hearing to better reflect the situation that is being displayed.&nbsp; (2) added a link to an example file (3) Tried to reword parts of the question to provide better clarity.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would place myself in the novice area when it comes to SQL, VBA, and most other things, but I am able to both learn and apply most things I read. I just haven't found something that applies seems to apply to the situation I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working inside Access 2016 with data that was primarily DB2 based, however now resides in a number of export files that have been pulled over the past few months regarding an hearing table that is maintained in my office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data set I am working with has:</p>
<ul>
<li>180 days of data</li><li>hearings related to 9 different locations</li><li>each location with rooms ranging from 1 - 8</li><li>Each day is broken up into 4 (on Thursday 5, so for ease it can be 5 every day) 90 minute time periods to break up scheduling.</li><li>The hearings have two check-in times, as each hearing consists of two parties who can appear.</li><li>A check-out time if both parties showed up &amp; a decision was made</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There are two login times to reflect two different parties arriving for an hearing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to come up with approximate duration values for how long each hearing took. This initially seemed to be more an issue of identifying which records had the appropriate time values, however that part was overcome rather quickly once the criteria
 were clearly defined. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The hurdle I face is as follows: the check-in times don't indicate the start time of the hearing. That is to say, it's not always a first in, first out system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better describe the logins, I uploaded an example of a single day/time period worth of data:

</p><p>I can upload to OneDrive later (if that's easier for anyone out there), however I'm currently limited by where I can upload files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the data set shows all of the Control #'s that could possibly appear in the given Time Slot. If a Decision wasn't logged, then I clearly couldn't calculate a duration; thus why they were sorted to the top. In some cases a decision was rendered
 when only one of the two parties showed up. I've omitted the decision column as it the actual decision doesn't weigh into this portion of the conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The timeline for how this mess gets entered goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the beginning of the day, all of the possible Control #, ID Number are listed for each Location, Room and Time Slot.</li><li>The value for LOGIN1 has a default value of the Date and a time value of 11:59:59 PM (this is the system default value)</li><li>The values for LOGIN2 and DECISION LOGIN are blank (as the back end tables don't require these field to have a value)</li><li>The Logical Start Time field is one of my own creation, and would only come into play for my own analysis.
</li><li>When either the first person or the second person shows up, the values for LOGIN1 or LOGIN2 are changed to reflect the times that the person checked in.
</li><li>LOGIN1 and LOGIN2 aren't dependent, as the person attached to LOGIN2 could be appearing in the room for a different CONTROL # before (or after)&nbsp;the one that is being calculated. The&nbsp;ID Number is reflecting the LOGIN1 value, and as such is used for purposes
 of grouping Control #'s&nbsp;with the same&nbsp;ID when it comes to the start and end times. &nbsp;</li><li>Once a decision is rendered, it is entered into the system. That is time stamped at the time the decision is made, and recorded in DECISION LOGIN.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The more I've looked at this data it's better to perhaps view LOGIN1 and LOGIN2 almost as Check-In times, as the hearing doesn't begin until the one before it concludes. There isn't really a logic behind which hearing gets heard first, second or third that
 can be standardized beforehand. A hearing won't start until there is at least one login, and generally the logic for when they proceed without one login or another would probably just muddle up the logic I'm seeking to create. I believe this only because I'm
 working off the data after it's been entered into the system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumptions went something along the lines of this: </p>
<ul>
<li>The only start time I can derive is that Hearing 2 can't start until Hearing 1 concludes. As such my theory was to take the Decision Login time value as the start time for the next hearing (with the exception of the first hearing, which would use the later
 of the times between LOGIN1 and LOGIN2)&nbsp;While this wouldn't be exact, it would be closer than any of the other numbers that I can come up with (such as the duration from a LOGIN time to DECISION LOGIN).
</li><li>An earlier Login time for either column doesn't ensure that they will be heard before a later login.
</li><li>ID #'s with multiple CTL #'s should be grouped, such that the a single ID# gets the latest possible Decision time for all of the of the grouped CTL #'s.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Is this something that can be done inside a query as I pull the data? VBA? Should I pull it into Excel and use a DAX function? (off topic I know, but still an option...)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried converting the time fields into numeric fields for evaluation, that didn't seem to work. I tried an overly complicated Switch statement that also didn't work. I've never had much luck getting the Case statement to work with DateTime values.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I really am stuck here and am trying to find a solution. Any suggestions out there?
</p>
<p>I can try to refine what I've asked more if it will help anyone!</p>

<p>Hey Karl - it occurred to me that I should follow up on this, and I'll post a different workbook (or screenshots maybe?) later that captures the values both from their original state before anything happens to the state I am working with them in (after the
 close of business). </p>
<p>
</p><p>The data actually represents hearings. I get overly concerned over what terms I can use when asking questions out here. I think however in this case it will help understand the data however. I think it looks like a mishmash because I didn't explain it very
 well...</p>
<p>
Would posting a workbook that guided you through all of this be easier, or should I just post some screenshots on here?

            <p>All of the data I'm looking to work with comes from one table, which I grabbed some information on. Even the old data that I've been archiving (the table that follows purges itself of the current day after 24 hours) maintains the format that follows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be a little skewed, since the connection to DB2 is done through Access, which, I'm told returns some interesting column information for this system. I omitted two pieces that I was told couldn't be posted, and some additional indexes that Access
 defined but play a role more in some batch processes overnight than the actual table structure currently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for any formatting issues that follow...I'm not great at posting stuff up here.

<h2>            Angry Birds full and seasons for the N9</h2>
                    
<p>The in game links to full and seasons only takes me to OVI with no AB.</p>
<p>I have sent an email to both Rovio and Nokia, the&nbsp;answer&nbsp;from Nokia&nbsp;was a link to OVI with AB for the N900, N8, E7 and so on but no N9.</p>
<p>Rovio no response at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So...any rumours on when or IF we ever will get this game on the N9?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps</p>
<p>Can anyone with a twitter account tweet and ask <span>@AngryBirds or @rovio about this?</span></p>

    <title>Internal links turn external when pasted to new workbook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internal links turn external when pasted to new workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook called Original with sheets One and Two.</p>
<p>Sheet Two has VLOOKUPs to columns in sheet One. </p>
<p>The VLOOKUP formula does not specify an explicit workbook; it is just local.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create a new empty workbook, called NewBook, and rename two of its sheets to One and Two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paste some rows from Original sheet One to NewBook sheet One and then some from Original sheet Two to NewBook sheet Two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brilliant, that all still works and I email the result to my client, who opens it and is asked to log into some alien server (my C: drive) in order to access Original, because NewBook unaccountably links to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't start suggesting workaround just yet, I know about saving the linked data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did not know was that, in pasting the VLOOPUKs from Original to NewBook, they would change from internal formulas to external links. [Hyperlinks do the same]. They now name [Original]!One as the target for VLOOKUP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is As-If I used Paste Link. But I did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be new behaviour in Excel 2013* and it is a nuisance. Is there some way to switch this off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry, I know that in Edit Links I can change the target. But I found that, if I do not do so immediately after pasting, the link turns into a zombie and become un-killable; another feature I do not much appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I really want to be able to switch off this unexpected and undesirable behaviour.
</p>
<p>Please could you tell me where in the backstage I might be able to do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ever so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I think it is Excel 2013, but the Help/About that used to tell me what I was running seems to have gone away. As a bonus question, can anyone tell me where version information is now hidden?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

</p><p>When you copy paste vlookup formulae in new workbook it looses the reference. </p>

<p>Thanks for your response. In the above, you can see that the VLOOKUP pasted into NewBook is not pointing to NewBook, but to Original. And, because I also pasted some of the source data, there is nothing to alert me to the fact that&nbsp;this link has been created
 - it all works and gives the expected result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A colleague will notice because they&nbsp;won't access to Original, which lives on my C:.</p>
<p>I will notice when I&nbsp;rename or move Original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that this might be desirable behaviour - when you are constructing a wildly complicated set of interrelated workbooks. But I can't believe that this is default behaviour and I really want to switch it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A colleague tells me that this behaviour is not new in Excel 2013. Perhaps I have just never noticed before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

<p>You need to use a bookmarklet trick. Bookmarklet is a piece of JavaScript stored into bookmark which can perform some simple actions like search text form a web page or act as forward button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this might be a working solution, or one of them:</p>

<h2>            Shortcuts problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I face problems with the shortcuts of the display, ie blank shortcut boxes on main screen&nbsp;and when I press the green button I don't get any response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the latest software version, I tried several reboots with or without the memory card, but still nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I am not sure which green button you are referring to in relation to shortcuts on the home screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you added shortcuts to the widget?&nbsp; Out of the box it has some by default, I believe - or at least mine did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the home screen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Options, Edit Content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the Shortcut Widget</p>
<p>Select Settings on the pop-up menu</p>
<p>Select the shorcuts you want</p>
<p>Exit from the Settings screen</p>
<p>Done on the Home screen</p>

<p>the shortcut are already added to the main screen, but they don't work. They are invisible and when trying to select them nothing happens.</p>

<h2>            Network Upload to 365 Online Archive</h2>
                    <p><span>I need to migrate emails over to user's 365 Online Archive and I'm using the network upload tool to upload the PST files. My question is on how to fill out the mapping file- the IsArchive flag is set to true but I'm
 unsure if that means the Archive folder within their main mailbox or the Online Archive which is where I need to move the emails to.&nbsp; Also, if the IsArchive flag means the online archive after all, I still don't know what I should set the target root folder
 to- "/Online Archive"?&nbsp; These are PSTs with several sub-folders such as Inbox, Sent, etc, and those folder often have sub-folders themselves.&nbsp; So the root would have to be something like "Online Archive" but I'm not quite sure.&nbsp; Please let me know, and thanks
 in advance for your assistance.</span></p>

Hi Scott,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. Based on your description, you use the network upload tool to import PST files to user’s Office 365 Online Archive. In this case, if you set TRUE value in the IsArchive parameter, it will import the PST file to the user’s archive mailbox
 instead of the archive folder within his primary mailbox.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, you can leave blank in the TargetRootFolder parameter. If so, the PST will be imported to a new folder named Imported located at the root level of the archive mailbox. Or, you can specify “/<em>&lt;foldername&gt;</em>”, then the PST file will be imported
 to a folder named <em>&lt;foldername&gt;</em>. All the folders with subfolders saved in the PST file will be located under this
<em>&lt;fordername&gt;</em> folder. Otherwise, you can try to consider running a few test about this parameter so you can determine the best folder location to import PST files to.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can get more information about these 2 parameter of CSV file by referring to the step 4 of this article:

<p>Well, the 1st step is to give some info as to where you currently are on the Insider food chain.&nbsp; If you are on the latest build 17017, then you have to go in 1 direction.&nbsp; If you are prior to 17017, then it can be very simple due to the recent release of
 the Fall Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp; tell us some info and we can go from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can tell where you are in several ways, but Settings/Update will give you this info.&nbsp; If you search for "winver" this should also tell you.</p>

    <title>O365 Global Admin and Yammer Admin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            O365 Global Admin and Yammer Admin</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm facing a problem where I have global admin in O365, my O365 domain is validated and I still do not have Yammer admin. I need Yammer admin to configure Yammer inside of Dynamics CRM.</p>
<p>None of the global admins for my company have admin in Yammer either. The admin page shows a blank list. How can I add people to the Yammer admin list?</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that your email address is auto filled in&nbsp;Outlook.com sign in page, I would like to inform you that it depends on the browser you use and it is the feature of the browser, so as you have mentioned that you are using Google chrome I
 suggest you to check the settings with the google support.</p>

    <title>Help with emails received in Plain text Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertmallett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with emails received in Plain text Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone help with this problem. I just bought a new desktop PC and am running Windows 8.1with Outlook 2013. My old machine is still here and is Windows 7 with Outlook 2010, the old machine is turned off but can be fired up if I want.</p>
<p>On both PCs Outlook is set up to connect to an Exchange server (2010) using proxy, and there is an additional&nbsp;POP account, the email from the PPO account are delivered into the Inbox of the Exchange account.</p>
<p>All working fine. One small problem:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I send an email from the Exchange account to the POP account in HTML format it arrives in plain text.
</p>
<p>Emails from the POP account to the Exchange account sent in HTML arrive in HTML and emails send from the Exchange account to the Exchange account in HTML arrive in HTML.</p>
<p>If I send an email from the Exchange account to another user (a friend) in HTML format&nbsp;it arrives in HTML.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I turn off the new machine and go to the old machine and repeat sending from the Exchange account to the POP account in HTML format then it arrives in HTML format. If I leave it in the Inbox, turn off the old PC and go back to the new PC the email in
 the Inbox is still in HTML.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So ONLY on the new machine, as the email arrives it is reduced to plain text but only from the Exchange account to the POP account. All other emails sent to either account are in HTML or at least in the format they were sent in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So there is something about Outlook 2013 POP account&nbsp;which is not happy to receive emails from the Exchange account in HTML.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any clues anyone?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Nayana,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. If I send an HTML email from OWA to the POP account then it arrives in HTML as it should.</p>
<p>2.The email address is saved in Contacts (People actually as it's Outlook 2013).</p>
<p>3. Because it's Outlook 2013 I'm not sure that option hasn't been removed. I can't seem to access it anyway. If I hover the mouse over the email address in People there is no drop down for View more options.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I sent and email from the Exchange account to POP account and checked it in POP webmail and it is in plain text.</p>
<p>So it seems Outlook is converting emails to this address to plain text when sending, but not converting emails sent to other recipients to plain text - I have sent one to a colleague who has a POP account on the same server as my POP account from the Exchange
 account and it arrives in HTML</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance</p>

<p>Has this been fixed? Outlook 2013 with an exchange server account sends emails in plain text to certain recipients. Mostly POP3 accounts I think. And yet, if I go to the on-line outlook it works. When you compose a message to send the option displays showing
 HTML. Why is it available (fixed) online but not for the outlook 2013 loaded on my Surface Pro 3 (Office Professional 2013)??</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm facing the same problem. Battery is draining too fast and whenever i power off my phone, the Battery Saver App reset the "time since last charge" counter back to zero minutes.</p>
<p><br />
I've all ready made a soft reset and didn't work. Do you think if i' try to do a factory reset, this will fix this problem?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for you help!<br />

<p>The hard reset&nbsp; didn't work. I returned the phone at the retail store and they give me a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After setting up the phone, update all apps and install the update that fixes?!?!&nbsp;the touch problem, the new phone show the same problem. After power off, the battery app resets and&nbsp;starts to drain real fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not normal at all. I gess this is a software bug</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own a Lumia 630 and never seen notting like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Should&nbsp;I use&nbsp;Lumia&nbsp;Recovery Tool to roll back the instalation prior to December Update or return the phone again to the Store and ask for a refund and give up from this Lumia model?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again I thank you for you help and suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com creating multiple folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I access outlook.com with my live email, I see multiple folders created automatically. They have similar names as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chat 22222222</p>
<p>chat 2222222222</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mail archive&nbsp;0_0</p>
<p>Mail archive&nbsp;0_0_0</p>
<p>
</p><p>they are more than ten in each tree of folders. Every two minutes I receive on all my devices emails about conflicting folders in my mailbox.</p>
<p>I tried to rename some and to delete them all but they keep getting generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to check on the ms database if my account/profile &nbsp;is ok?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Have you tried running an anti virus scan? Outlook.com is accessed using a browser. It might be infected by a virus. You might need to delete your profile and create a new one.
