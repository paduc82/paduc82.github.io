<h2>            Can&#39;t see external HDD in  file explorer. Has drive letter but not online</h2>
                    <p>I have IDE HDD connected with a USB converter on Win 10 64 bit PC. Can see the HDD in device mgr portable devices and disk dives as a HDD USB device. In disk mgr it does not show in upper table but is shown in the lower section as Disk 2 Removable (N:) No
 Media. It does not show file explorer.</p>
<p>How do I initialize this drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booted into Safe Mode and now can see the USB Drive (N). When try to format or expand the drive get error "no disk". It looks like an optical drive to File Explorer.</p>

<p>Do you see it in THIS PC where your drives are accessed from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the IDE to USB is the issue. Somehow, MAYBE, Windows can not configure it properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might need to go into your BIOS settings too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the Hard drive is not capable with a USB adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never used this adapter as I would never use an IDE in USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What PC is it?</p>
<p>What HDD model# is it?</p>
<p>Which adapter name and model # did you buy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you open Computer Management and take a snap shot on lower section and post it here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only have 1 HD (disk 0)&nbsp;and adding this 2nd HD, then it should be (disk 1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And very ODD a 2nd or 3rd drive with be labeled (N) Unless you have like a 7 in 1 card reader. But that letter is still too high.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example of Mine with 4 HDD, 3 USB HDD, 5 in 1 Card Reader and DVD drive and Mine just reached "N" on the 12th device.</p>

<h2>            Cannot remove OneDrive shortcut from the Windows Explorer Navigation Pane</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Windows Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to get rid of the Microsoft OneDrive shortcut from my Windows Explorer Navigation Pane. It's currently under my Desktop shortcut in the tree.</p>
<p>First, I tried uninstalling it, and that only made the icon change.</p>
<p>Second, I read on many forums and articles that one can go into the Registry Editor and change a DWORD called "System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree" value from 1, to 0. I was able to go into this registry entry even after uninstalling the application through the
 "Programs and Features" window from the Control Panel. This had no change, after restarting Windows Explorer and after a PC restart.</p>
<p>Third, I went back into the Registry Editor and changed the DWORD called "SortOrderIndex" to 0, from 42, and found that only moved the folder above the others in the list.</p>
<p>After those three attempts, I tried looking for more forums and articles, and at last, I couldn't find a solution that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post a photo for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me Microsoft Community, you're my only hope.</p>

<p>Hey Patricia Yu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the Registry again and I double checked that those Keys were set to 0. After a restart, the OneDrive folder was still visible in the Navigation Bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my frustration I did a full search and I found a Key under "Name Space" under "Desktop". I made a back up of my registry, and when I knew it was saved, I just went and deleted the whole Key. Below is a snapshot of the Key I deleted.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43fe0d38-29f3-44bf-9ac4-249a32afcf81?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43fe0d38-29f3-44bf-9ac4-249a32afcf81?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>After that, the folder was gone!</p>
<p>Below is a photo of the fixed Navigation Pane.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bba23dad-357d-4202-a0ad-1913cdb6ec4b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bba23dad-357d-4202-a0ad-1913cdb6ec4b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have a hunch that the Keys that I had read on forums, and that you had suggested, are to remove the OneDrive folder from the main structure, Ex: Quick Access and Desktop (red arrow). However, my OneDrive folder was nested in the Desktop for some reason
 (blue arrow), and that was the different Key I found with the "Find" function in the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL DR: Its a different Key, below, and I just straight up deleted it.</p>
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\</li><li>Deleted the&nbsp;{018D5C66-4533-4307-9B53-224DE2ED1FE6} folder</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your input and I hope this post can help others with similar problems!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>How do I revert the Bluetooth pairing question so I don&#39;t have to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewissall  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I revert the Bluetooth pairing question so I don&#39;t have to type in a PIN</h2>
                    <p>I have a Bluetooth keyboard that requires re-pairing so I can use it between a computer and a tablet. If there is a pairing delay or some problem, it says 'Oops that didn't work' and requires me to use another keyboard to type in a PIN. Every time since
 then, I need to type in a PIN that I can then type in on the Bluetooth keyboard. Re-pairing itself is a pain since I need to remove the device, then turn on Bluetooth, then wait, then pair etc, in order to avoid pairing errors and so that the keyboard can
 be found. Typing in a PIN so that I can type it in with the Bluetooth keyboard is just stupid though. I would rather type in a PIN written on the screen as is the default.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I eventually learned about the OnScreen keyboard. That's what I often use, but it can be a pain to use every time. If it were the only keyboard I used, that would be one thing, but launching it to type in a PIN just to get rid of it again is somewhat
 redundant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide some more information, the PIN I was asking about was the Bluetooth PIN, the one that appears below the device during Pairing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cdab074-095a-4114-aa17-18ac4267d051?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cdab074-095a-4114-aa17-18ac4267d051?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click the device, it shows up there, or if something goes wrong, it will ask you to type it in every time after that. That's what I am avoiding, and it's stressful trying to type it in correctly so I don't have to provide my own.</p>

            Looking at all those unknown devices - I might look in control panel's&nbsp; Devices &amp; Printers and remove them - then probably visit Device Manager and expand Bluetooth and then on the menu bar&nbsp; View/Hidden. &nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe delete unknown devices there.<br />

            There seems to be a lot of this same error around.<br />
I find it pretty bad that Microsoft can't even suggest anything on here.<br />
<br />
I purchased this upgrade, it went sideways for me (the same way it has for others) and every road pointed to posting in this forum for help. It's been better than a week now and no word at all from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Is there a phone # for Microsoft help?<br />
If it was Apple at least you could call someone directly.

            I gave up. Sold the discs + license key to my brother, he transferred files to a usb and it worked on his laptop. Meanwhile, i got a new computer and installed Windows 7 on it. That's altogether $218 gone

<h2>            Microphone--- too LOW</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly Skype Help Support is the worst support I ever found online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have issue with Microphone while using Skype. People can barely hear me. I tried to change Microphone settings, everything is ok in settings. Microphone Sensitivity is at Maximum. But still people barely hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my microphone change it, bought new, still did not work. I also use Viber&nbsp; and everything is fine. When I talk on Viber people hear me excellent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess there is issue directly in Skype. I reinstalled skype still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is very important for me to fix this problem as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S. I am so disappointed that Microsoft has such a bad technical support.&nbsp; This issue is not for some random online user.&nbsp;</p>

Hello&nbsp;</span><span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=thepokerchef&amp;referrer=http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistamedia/thread/37d4a2a1-b0e6-498b-939e-e9684701e78b&amp;rh=Bb%2b6wIVR941E0uhnATQLf34MMw0lZS4IevFudnHyqW0%3d&amp;sp=forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>thepokerche</span><span>f</span></span></a></span></span><span><span>,<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your question!<strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><br />
</span><span>You can follow these steps and check if they do the job<br />
</span><br />
</span></strong><span>I)<strong>
</strong></span><strong><span>Have a look at this article and check if helps:</span></strong><span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934015</a><br />
</span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>II)
</span><strong><span>Start the computer in safe mode<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When you start the computer in safe made, you can determine whether the cause of the startup-related performance
 issue is related to a background service or to a driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start in safe mode, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click</span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span></strong><span>,
 click the arrow next to the</span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Lock</span></strong>&nbsp;<span>button, and then click</span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Keep tapping the
<strong>F8</strong> key as your computer restarts.</span><span>&nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
</span></span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>You
 have to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you must try to restart your computer. To do this, wait until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shut down and restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the</span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Advanced
 Boot Options</span></strong>&nbsp;<span>screen, use the arrow keys to select the</span>&nbsp;<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong>&nbsp;<span>option,
 and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to your computer by using a user account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>III)
</span><strong><span>Perform clean-boot troubleshooting</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
If you verify that the issue does not occur in safe mode, start Windows Vista in a clean-boot environment to determine the programs or the services that are causing the issue. This process will systematically eliminate any of the third-party services or applications
 that are running on Windows Vista that could potentially be the cause of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about how to perform clean-boot troubleshooting in Windows Vista, click the following
 article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista - </span>

</span><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem continues after you perform clean-boot troubleshooting, go to the next troubleshooting step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>IV)
</span><strong><span>You can also try using the System File Checker to locate corrupt or missing Vista files.<br />
</span></strong><span>Here's an article on that:<br />
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></span></a></strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Please let us know if it helps.<strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong>Thanks and Regards,&nbsp;<span><br />

            Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I read the article you recommended and it did not answer this question: &nbsp;if programs can be trusted after the expiration date of their code signing certificates, then why bother with an expiration date at all? &nbsp;What exactly does
 expiration mean in this context? &nbsp;Does the private key become publicly known? &nbsp;If so, can't a malicious programmer tamper with the program to make it a malware vector? &nbsp;Please elaborate on your implied contention that programs with expired code signing certificates
 can thereafter be trusted not to have been tampered with.

<p>OK, but I asked if your new&nbsp;thread concerned the same&nbsp;<em>computer</em> (i.e., not the same
<em>problem</em>) as in&nbsp;your&nbsp;previous thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for trusting an "expired certificate," see my colleague Steve's reply above (as well as his replies to your&nbsp;previous thread) and/or the ANSWER post in your earlier thread which, in part,&nbsp;includes the following:<br />
<br />
&lt;QP&gt;<br />
An <strong><em>SSL Certificate</em></strong> is intended to secure the transport of information via encryption and as such
<em><strong>must always be valid when used</strong></em>, so&nbsp;it should not be expired.&nbsp;This requires that a certificate used for SSL purposes must always be renewed before it expires, since otherwise it would not be valid at the time the client attempts to
 use it to create a secured connection to the server where it resides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong><em>Code-Signing Certificate</em></strong> on the other hand <em><strong>must have been valid for signing when the code was signed</strong></em>, but may be expired after the code is released.&nbsp;This isn't a problem, because the&nbsp;Digital Signature&nbsp;itself

            Thank you for your reply, Mr. Dyer. &nbsp;I understand that the code signing certificate certifies that a program came from the named source if the certificate was valid (not expired) at the time it was issued. &nbsp;But what happens after the certificate expires?
 &nbsp; Is it not true that a program with an expired code signing certificate can be modified by a malicious programmer AFTER the expiration date of the certificate? &nbsp;I have read that there is an active black market for the private encryption keys associated with
 expired code-signing certificates for just this reason.
<div><br />
<div>Now, some have said that I should trust the downloaded program since I obtained it from a Microsoft website. &nbsp;But what if my browser was hijacked and redirected me to a malicious website spoofing Microsoft.com? &nbsp;I use the code-signing certificate as a
 double-check on that possibility.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please download the program yourself and examine the code signing certificate. &nbsp;Please verify that it is indeed expired. &nbsp;Now, forget about my computer and my other threads and just answer me this one question: &nbsp;Do you consider it a good practice for Microsoft
 to offer executable programs which have expired code-signing certificates for the public to download? &nbsp;If not, then please add your voice to mine in calling on Microsoft to update the code-signing certificates on ALL of the programs they offer to the public
 for downloading. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Batman Arkham Origins und Cold Cold Heart Probleme</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo wir haben uns das Spiel Batman Arkham Origin gekauft und gestern online den Zusatz Cold cold Heart gekauft und auch runtergeladen! Soweit sogut, nun hat mein sohn aber das Problem wenn er das Cold cold Heart spielen möchte das er nach kurzer Zeit folgende
 Fehlermeldung angezeigt bekommt :</p>
<p><br />
Probleme mit Inhalten zum Herunterladen, Beschädigte Inhalte zum runterladen gefunden. Falls sich diese Inhalte nicht mehr verwenden lassen, bitte neu herunterladen oder über die Xbox Steuerung löschen. Batman Arkham Orogins kehrt nun zur Xbox Steuerung zurück.</p>
<p>Was machen wir denn nun? Kann ja nicht sein das man etwas Kauft im Download Bereich und es dann doch nicht funktioniert!</p>

            <p>Hy Zoe,</p>
<p>sowas ist ärgerlich und ein Lösungsvorschlag wird ja auch gemacht:</p>
<p>Den DLC bzw. auch das komplette Spiel einmal von der Festplatte löschen und nochmal neu installieren.</p>
<p>Ich würde aber zwischen löschen und neu installieren auch 3x den Cache löschen und die Konsole neu starten.</p>

<p>@zoe Barnett</p>
<p>das Lustige an der Datenwelt ist, das da garnichts perfekt ist !</p>
<p>beim Kopieren oder Downloaden gibt es immer kleinere Fehler, die von den entsprechenden Abspielgeraten bzw. deren Software kompensiert werden müssen. Du hast z.B. keine Musik CD die perfekt ist oder ein PC Spiel etc.</p>
<p>Deshalb kann man solche Software auch nur endlich kopieren, da bei einem Kopiervorgang die vorherigen Fehler kopiert werden plus die neuen Fehler&nbsp;des Kopiervorgangs - kopiert man jetzt diese Kopie kommen immer mehr Fehler bis man irgendwann nur noch Datenmüll
 hat*.</p>
<p>Das gleiche passiert halt auch beim Downloaden und dann kann es passieren das deine ONE das nicht kompensieren kann, also muss&nbsp;du es nochmal runterziehen !</p>
<p>PS.: *... das selbe gilt übrigens auch beim Menschen. Klont man einen Menschen und klont dann den Klon etc. dann bekommt nach ca 200 Klonvorgängen nur noch Leberwurst raus&nbsp;! ;)</p>

<p>ManWaDaMaHaDa , ganz so stimmt das aber nicht.</p>
<p>So wie du das erklärst, würde es Bedeuten das beim Kopieren einer Datei immer mehr Daten fehlerhaft sind.</p>
<p>Würde heissen, nach dem Einmaligen Kopieren einer Ausführbaren Datei, würde diese schon nichtmehr Funktionieren.</p>
<p>Was aber nicht Stimmt.</p>
<p>Im Normalfall kann ein Gerät bei Lesefehlern die Defekten Stellen durch eine Prüfung ersetzen und die Datei Reparieren.</p>

<p>was ich meinte war, das beim einmaligen Kopieren als Download (als zusätzliche Fehlerquelle) solche gravierenden Mängel auftreten können, daß das Abspielgerät es nicht mehr kompensieren kann. Ist mir auch schon passiert. Gelöscht, neu geladen, dann gings.

<h2>            Geometry Wars Retro Evolved no longer launching on x1. </h2>
                    
<p>I have been able to play geowars on x1 until recently. Now when I attempt to launch it, I get an error asking me if I own the game or have a disk to insert. I'm wondering if somehow I'm having a license issue or if support for the game has been pulled for
 some reason?</p>

                    I installed windows 7 and I can't use my HP Laserjet P1006. How can I get the drivers? The printer worked with vista (my previous windows version) but not with 7. I called HP and they haven't released them yet. Thanks.

<p>Install the vista drivers and remember the location of the drivers ( i.e. C:\program files\hp).&nbsp; Don't worry if it fails to install. Go to device manager (i.e. right click my computer and select Manage). Look for the printer under unrecognized hardware in
 the hardware tree (your printer should be turned on for it to show up), right click on it and&nbsp;select update or install&nbsp;the driver.&nbsp; Browse for the driver in the location that it was installed by the HP software and install it.&nbsp; It should work now if not try
 rebutting or to power cycle the printer.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 security won't let the driver to install otherwise.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 PIN request for a bluetooth pairing and no PIN is known</h2>
                    I have a palm tungsten E2 which I had to a hard reset. Now Windows 10 is asking for PIN to pair. There is no PIN but will not connect without it. Is there a way to bypass or block this request. I have read all the similar requests posted with answers and
 none of them work-Fred

<p>This is nonsense. Many Bluetooth Devices DO NOT have a pin and do not require a pin and will connect to any other device / OS except windows 10 without issue. Windows 10 is the only OS that prevents any connection to devices that do not have a PIN. Its utter
 incompetence by microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            After Windows 10 update from Win 7 USB keyboard is not functional.</h2>
                    I updated a DIY built desktop (i7 64 bit, 20G RAM) from Win 7 to 10. The update completed, I was able to signon to Windows, but once in I could not use the keyboard to type in the new Edge browser or on the Search Bar. Chrome &amp;. Firefox would hang when
 attempting to type. However, when I opened a new texfile via notepad, I could type just fine within notepad. Seems that the keyboard input is being ignored when interacting with the Windows GUI and other apps like Edge. The keyboard does respond to hitting
 CNTRL_ALT_DEL to be able to get to task manager. The Windows key does seem to respond at times. This is using a standard generic USB Keyboard. Fortunately the mouse (also a generic USB mouse) works. I've tried 2 different keyboards that I know work, and have
 the same problem. &nbsp;I had to revert back to Windows 7. Keyboard works fine in Win 7. Searching the various sites, seems that alot of people have problems with keyboard and mouse working after upgrading to Win 10. Very bad ex

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to go to the device manager and right click on the device
 so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer
 to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

    <title>Setting default line spacing in Wordpad - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setting default line spacing in Wordpad</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have noticed an extremely annoying trait in the Windows 7 version of Word Pad. The<strong> Default line spacing
</strong>is set to 1.15 and "add 10pt after paragraphs".</p>
<p>I would like to change the <strong>Default </strong>line spacing to 1.0 and "No 10 pt space after paragraphs".&nbsp; is this possible with a registry hack?</p>
<p>I realize this is silly, but it really is annoying.</p>
<p>Any Input is very much appreciated,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

            I found a really simple trick to bypass this really annoying trait.<br />
I create a simple Wordpad document with the desired settings I want (including fixing the spacing).<br />
I then delete every character, save one ( If you delete the last one Wordpad will default back to
<br />
Cambria - 11pt).<br />
<br />
Now save this document as 'Document.rtf' or whatever name you want and to any directory you want.<br />
Create a shortcut on your desktop to this file.&nbsp; Then rename the shortcut Wordpad.<br />
Now whenever you open Wordpad thru this link you will have it open and ready to go with all your settings!<br />
There will be of course one character there, but I start all my Wordpad encounters with copying &amp; pasting<br />
so I never notice it.<br />
<br />
I realize this fix might not be what everyone wants, but for anyone who just opens Wordpad from their<br />
desktop like me and many others it is a extremely simple fix to a most annoying problem.<br />

                    All my browsers spam the refresh button all of a sudden on my PC and it is hard to even search something for school because it seems to happen so often now. I had this problem since I got my PC, so it is not a virus. Anybody know what this is? Also, when
 I go to the task manager while this happens, all the values refresh EXTRA fast.

            I looked at the eMachines website and downloaded the user manual (not impressed with the amount of information available from either source).&nbsp; The only thing I found was that it is possible for the E640 to have one of three or four different touchpad manufacturers.&nbsp;
 You might try going to Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound and in the Devices and Printers section look for the touchpad -- they may be on a tab of the Mouse settings.&nbsp; Once you find the touchpad settings, look for something that sounds like it may be intended
 to disable the pad when typing.<br />

<h2>            Accidentally deleting text</h2>
                    When writing large blocks of text I find myself accidentally deleting whole paras.&nbsp; It happens so fast I am not even sure what I pressed but I assume I accidentally pressed the control button while intentionally pressing the backspace button, intending
 to delete just a couple of characters but finding I have deleted whole blocks of text.&nbsp; When I try to reproduce this error, however, I find that control plus backspace just deletes a line not whole paras so I am not sure if this is what I am doing wrong.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?

Here's How:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/control-panel-windows-8.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Windows 8 Control Panel</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Tip:</b> You can check your Windows 8 system type much faster from the <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsp/g/power-user-menu-win-x.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Power User Menu</a> but that's only accessible if you have a <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/componentprofiles/p/p_kb.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
keyboard</a> or <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/componentprofiles/p/p_mouse.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mouse</a>. With that menu open, click on <b>System</b> and then skip to Step 4.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Touch or click on <b>System and Security</b> within <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsc/p/control-panel.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Control Panel</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> You won't see a <i>System and Security</i> link in Control Panel if your view is set to either
<i>Large icons</i> or <i>Small icons</i>. If so, find <b>System</b> and touch or click on it, then skip to Step 4.<br />
<br />
</li><li>With the <i>System and Security</i> window now open, click or touch <b>System</b>.<br />
<br />
</li><li>With the <i>System</i> <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsc/g/control-panel-applet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
applet</a> now open, titled <i>View basic information about your computer</i>, find the
<i>System</i> area, located under the large Windows 8 logo.<br />
<br />
The <i>System type</i> will say either <b>64-bit Operating System</b> or <b>32-bit Operating System</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> The second bit of information, either <i>x64-based processor</i> or <i>
x86-based processor</i>, indicates the hardware architecture. It is possible to install a 32-bit edition of Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro on either an x86 or x64 based system, but a 64-bit edition can only be installed on x64 hardware.</li></ol>
Tips:
<ol>
<li><i>System</i>, the Control Panel applet that contains the Windows 8 system type, can also be opened by executing the
<b>control /name Microsoft.System</b> <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsc/g/commands.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
command</a> from Run or <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsc/p/command-prompt.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Command Prompt</a>.</li></ol>

<h2>            How do I watch ultraviolet movies on my xbox 360 in the UK&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trawling the Internet to find a solution to this and come up with nothing (unless you live in the US) . I have a number of Blu Ray which came with an ultraviolet copy. I have been able to download the films to my computer but can't find a way
 to get them to play on my xbox. I have been unable to find an ultraviolet provider app on the xbox, and my Internet connection is far too slow to stream through Internet Explorer (if that is even possible). Is there a way of playing my downloads either directly
 from the xbox or streamed over my home network?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have also been trawling the internet and have found no answer to this question yet. I suspect it is due to the fact the xbox live servers are all in the US and therefore streamed content (region restricted) could be streamed to the wrong regions. Although
 if this is the case and flixster can handle multi regions I would've though Microsoft could handle it too</p>

<p>How do you claim your UV movies in the U.K? Do you also have the main uvvu.com site? (two V's)<br />
<br />
Do you also have other sites that let you link your uvvu accounts?<br />
<br />
In the U.S we have the flixster and vudu app. Flixster is crap now because of some HDCP that doesn't allow HD via component for me.<br />
Vudu works perfectly.<br />
<br />
Do you happen to also have the Vudu app in the U.K? If you do, this would be your best choice. Vudu is normally one of those apps where you rent movies or buy them digitally...but they also let you sync your UVVU account so every movie code you redeem, you
 could also watch it on your consoles.</p>

<h2>            Backup Error Code&#58; 0x8007001B</h2>
                    <p>This error occurs when I try to make a backup using Backup and Restore. The process goes to 100% but then errors out with the above error code. It is related to creating a system image, as I do not get the error when I do not include system image in the
 backup process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run ccleaner, but this has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the backup after a clean boot as recommended in the other discussions on this subject, but even with ALL non-microsoft services disabled, I still got the same error.</p>

            I found an answer, in case it helps anyone else. I found a discussion on the internet about HP Servers having this same issue when trying to back up, and it was caused by the drive space being fully assigned. To fix the problem I reduced the size of my
 240GB SSD by 1 GB. I have been able to run a backup to completion since I did that.

                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday, After completion when I logged in, I have no network connections listed, and no wireless networks/adapter showing in network settings. Device manager shows the Broadcom 802.11n adapter installed and working, but I cannot

            <p>I had this issue after upgrading to win10pro from win8.1pro on a Lenovo yoga 2 13" the issue seems to be wide spread and has been mentioned on a few threads (see related threads). I have now successfully managed to get my wifi card working and hopefully
 one of the solutions below will help:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>solution 1(easiest): </strong>
switch off your device</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the easiest and simplest option and does not need rolling back to win8.1 after painstaking hours I realised this was all I needed to do. NOTE* this is
<strong>not a restart! </strong>what you need to do is properly shut down the machine either through start&gt;power&gt;shutdown or power button on your device. leave the device
<strong>off </strong>for at least 1 minute. At restart one of three&nbsp;outcomes will be the case... 1.&nbsp;wifi works and you're immediately able to&nbsp;use the network (congradulations) 2. wifi works however you cannot join your home network and 3. wifi is still not
 present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if outcome 2. is the&nbsp;case, your wifi card (in my case the realtek RTL8723BE) <em>
should </em>now appear in the device manager and all you need to do is update your driver to the latest windows10 drivers from Lenovo (if not the latest 8.1 driver) and restart. (hopefully you now have wifi).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>solution 2: </strong>roll back to windows 8.1 and remove interfering software</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>the most apparent culprit is Cisco VPN software/drivers these seem not to be compatible with windows 10 and after upgrade are affecting network connectivity. solutions on how to remove these are in the following thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/windows-did-not-detect-any-networking-hardware/13a38d40-8b03-4bd0-8ea9-f31a4571ed3c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/windows-did-not-detect-any-networking-hardware/13a38d40-8b03-4bd0-8ea9-f31a4571ed3c</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>on my system I had cisco peap, fast and eap modules that I uninstalled just incase
</p>
<p>
</p><p>reinstall win10 and after the install make sure that at some point BEFORE accessing the internet you switch off the device for at least 1 min. a simple restart during which power is still going the cpu will not surfice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>good luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>to open device manager right click the start button and select device manager. your wifi hardware should be under network adaptors</p>

            <p>I was able to determine that the cause was the Cisco VPN client that was installed.&nbsp; Windows 10 would not allow me to remove the application, so I ended up rolling back to 8.1, uninstalling the VPN client Running the last Windows update&amp; reinstalling Windows
 10. This time the upgrade went flawlessly, and all but applications &amp; drivers worked properly.</p>
<p>If you have the Norton security suite installed, you must download the Windows 10 update from Norton (or your ISP)</p>

            <p>My issue is I’m able to see neighbors’ networks, but not mine in the available networks list. The workaround I found out is by changing wireless channel of my network in the router. &nbsp;Use another device (ipad) and login to your router configuration page,
 if set to auto scan uncheck and check. Make sure you save every time. &nbsp;You may also use mobile app like ‘wifi Analyzer’ to identify which channel your system recognizes and set the wireless router to that channel .</p>
