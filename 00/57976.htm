            Sounds like MS has "improved" the feature you need OUT.  Notmuch I can do about that.

    <title>Family Pack did not convert, it expired, no extra three months&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyralun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Pack did not convert, it expired, no extra three months&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was sent an e-mail by Microsoft saying that my xbox Family Pack (which was slated to expire Sept. 8th) would be converted to four individual accounts on Aug. 26th and that we would be given three extra months of Xbox Live. &nbsp;It also said my MS Points would
 convert as part of this process.</p>
<p>August came and went, the conversion did not happen. &nbsp;I was told over the phone via xbox support that I could not add any time onto my subscription because the family pack deal was no longer offered, I had to wait until I was converted to an individual account.</p>
<p>So I waited. And waited. &nbsp;And lo and behold, my account was not converted, none of us were given our extra three months and I expired back to Xbox Live Free.</p>
<p>I have resubscribed, but I would like the three months I was promised. &nbsp;In the e-mail it clearly stated this would happen in August to MY specific family pack. &nbsp;I'm looking for three months of Xbox Live as promised to be added to my account.</p>

<p>Hey Tyralun,</p>
<p>Something obviously was misinformed or there has to be some kind of confusion going on. The family pack conversions took place at the end of august and I have been told here at work that some are getting pushed back to September. They wanted to be done by
 the end of august with the conversions but havn't quite got to all of them. If your family pack ended, its because it was set to end before the conversion took place. You will have to contact xbox billing support 1(866)611-6188 so you can match up dates with
 them because like I said there is some confusion somewhere. If you would like to see your renewal dates and bill on dates from when you actually paid for your family pack, log on to billing.microsoft.com with the primary accounts Microsoft account. The family
 pack was taken away back in may but people that had remaining time left were converted to individual accounts and the 3 months get placed onto everyones account at the same time this happens, so again if you feel like you were shorted xbox live time please
 contact xbox support as they will be able to go over your account bill dates and renewal dates and issue out any compensation for any system errors or glitches that come with these updates.
</p>
<p>Did this help?</p>

<p>Yeah, I knew my subscription ended September 8th, my problem was that I was told in August I would be converted to individual (as would the four accounts in my family pack) and we would get three extra months. &nbsp;I've talked to Xbox Support and their answer
 is basically "Our system didn't do your conversion in time, so, we can't help you." &nbsp;But, my problem is I was promised in August the conversions would happen "Next week" which was the week of August the 26th. &nbsp;So I'm looking for three months to be added to
 my account to match up with what I was promised.</p>

<p>I'm going through the same problem myself. I was told that they will not honor the three free months because they did not convert my membership back in August like I was initially informed they would do through two desperate &nbsp;emails. &nbsp;It's upsetting that
 they're conducting business in this manner. They even close the email with, "enjoy your three free months". What's the deal?</p>

<p>So are you basically saying that calling XBOX SUPPORT and getting the run around there is just a waste of time? Why does Microsoft make the customer jump through so many hoops to have their issues dealt with? One would think that a call to a company's SUPPORT
 team should solve ALL issues.</p>

<p>Support wasn't much help. &nbsp;Now, the people in billing seem to know how to fix things quickly. &nbsp;It was also explained to me that the reason I was not eligible for the three free months was because I had stopped my Family Pack membership from renewing automatically
 before the conversion took place. &nbsp;Since, that situation was not explained ANYWHERE, the guy in billing went ahead and gave me one code for three months free. &nbsp;Now I just have to decide which of my three kids gets the code.

<h2>            How do I Import a TXT file into my firewall rule list&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Okay so I exported a firewall rule list into a txt file. I then copied over some firewall rules. I then saved the txt file and I am wondering how I can re-import the txt file. Please note I do not mean Import Policy......

            Ummm thank you for responding but apparently you misunderstood what I meant... When I go into windows firewall there is an option to export rule list what I wanted to know is how to re-import that rule list in because there is no option.... So yea how
 do I do this??????<br />
<br />
Also since I couldn't find a solution I found something different that worked. I found a .bat file that you can place in the folder in which you want to block the program and it will block all exes in that folder and all sub-folders. You can even choose a custom
 firewall rule pre-fix... So for anyone else having this issue follow the instructions I provide below:<b><br />
</b><br />
<u><b>Instructions (Found online modified by me)</b></u><br />
<br />
Create a .bat file named "addfwrs.bat" without quotations using the text in italics then follow the further instructions :<br />
<br />
<i>@echo off<br />
REM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BATCH FILE CREATED BY CHARLES DE HAVILLAND 20/02/2012<br />

GOTO :Finish<br />
:norulename<br />
Echo Error! - You did not specify a Rulename type - Addfwrs "Rulename"<br />

<br />
<u><b>Further Instructions:</b></u><br />
<br />
Windows 7 firewall actually works very well, but it's not easy to configure with multiple programs (very time consuming).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I looked for ages trying to find a way of blocking multiple .exe files through Windows 7 in one go; it seemed the only possible method was to create my own batch file (windows script).&nbsp;
<br />
I have added it below for anyone to use / modify for their own purposes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Running the batch file below (addfwrs.bat), will create inbound AND outbound firewall rules that block all .exe files within your chosen folder and subfolders from accessing the internet.&nbsp;
<br />
Very useful.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To use:<br />
<br />
(1) Place addfwrs.bat in the folder in which you want to block the .exe programs (It will block all exe programs in any sub-folders so you can place it in a folder without any exes so it blocks<br />
exe programs in multiple sub-folders at once)<br />
<br />
(2) Now run CMD as administrator.<br />
<br />
(3) Copy the&nbsp; new directory (eg. c:\Programs Files (x86)\YourProg\) of where you put the addfwrs.bat file<br />
<br />
(4) Paste the directory into CMD with "cd" and a space before the directory (example: cd c:\Programs Files (x86)\YourProg\) and press enter.<br />
<br />
(5) Now run the batch file by typing: addfwrs.bat "rulename"&nbsp;&nbsp; example: addfwrs "BLOCK_PROGRAM_NAME_HERE"
<br />
(Make sure there are no spaces in the rulename of the firewall rule, so use underscores as spaces.<br />
<br />
N.B: It's important you add a firewall rulename, so that you can identify the rules when added to the firewall at a later date.<br />
<br />
(6) Follow the on screen information, it will advise you which rules it is creating.<br />
<br />
(7) Check Windows Firewall for the new rules listed and you can then remove the addfwrs.bat file from where you put it (It is no longer needed although you can keep it somewhere for later).<br />
<br />
All done.&nbsp; Hope you find it useful, I certainly have! <br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
N.B: View the new rules contained within your firewall (In/Out rules), change as and when you need to.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t join co-op due to different DLC</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so I am trying to play with my dad but it says we have different DLC.&nbsp; I am positive I downloaded the free weapons pack but not sure what I have downloaded or what he has downloaded.&nbsp; Is there someplace I can go to see what I downloaded?&nbsp; I was also wondering
 how he can download the free weapons pack since I can't seem to find it anymore.&nbsp; Also, would it be easier to delete the DLC that he and I both have and if so how do we do that?&nbsp; I checked my hard drive but I can't seem to find the the fable 3 DLC.&nbsp; Neither
 of us spent money on the DLC so if we did download anything it was freebies.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>You both have to have ALL the FREE DLC downloaded on both the consoles in order to play coop. It's okay if you both don't have the same DLC that you paid for, just the FREE stuffs that will either prevent or let you play coop together.</p>

<h2>            Sype Language</h2>
                    Although my Skype app displays in English when I receive messages from Skype they are in Portuguese, I lived in Portugal for a while. My address is set up as in the UK in Skype and in Microsoft, how can I change the language of messages.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Command Prompt Randomly Popping Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calmyourself  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Command Prompt Randomly Popping Up</h2>
                    Sometimes when I'm using my computer, my command prompt, or what I believe is the command prompt, the window with the black background and the white letters, pops up for a half a second, then disappears. I don't know whether it has something written on
 it or not because it comes up and goes away so fast. This also reoccurs when I turn on and sign into my computer, or restart it and sign in, and just randomly when I'm using it like now. It doesn't really bother me a lot, but I'm just wondering if I should
 be concerned about this happening and look into it more, or just not worry about it at all. I don't believe I have a virus or anything, nothing else unusual has been happening besides that, and I have antivirus software and run checks and everything so I don't
 think that's the problem. I just want to know if this is normal or not. I use windows 8.1 64 bit and I'm on a hp Pavilion g7.&nbsp;

<p>Hi all, please can somebody help my I've having a mare!</p>
<p>Not played anything on my XB1 for a good few months now, for obvious reasons, lack of games etc.. Bought the new COD friday and played about 6 hours all together over weekend.. Been fine all weekend, bit of lag here n there but I know its a common problem..
 Since the update today, since the console restarted I can't play a game longer than 5-10 minutes before getting kicked out. It says something like ''lost connection so server/host'' then exits me back to multiplayer menu with the message, ''You must have an
 active network connection to play Xbox Live or System Link matches''.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had this problem with Ghosts after a month or 2 of it coming out. EVERY other game is fine apart from this one. My download speed is averaging around 60-85MEG today and 6MEG upload.</p>

<p>What I have done so far..</p>
<ol>
<li>Spoke to Xbox support on chat. </li><li>Cleared persistant storage and mac address </li><li>Power cycled console.&nbsp; </li><li>Unplugged router/modem numerous times </li><li>Spoke to virgin to double check with my ports being forwarded right and they are set up for XB1 and Advanced Warfare requirements
</li><li>He also saved my I.P settings for XB1 to make sure if i do power cycle it won't forget.&nbsp;
</li></ol>

<p>Only thing I can suggest is contact Activision support, don't think it will help,oh and maybe setup port forwarding.</p>
<p>Hope you get it sorted.</p>

<h2>            Unable to delete Mozilla Firefox folder from C&#58;&#92;Program files</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 and have just uninstalled “Monzilla Firefox”.</p>
<p>I have been left with a residue folder named “Monzilla Firefox”, several subfolders and several files in C:\Program files (*86).</p>
<p>When I try to delete this folder (or any of the subfolders or files) I receive an error message stating “You’ll need to provide administrator permission to delete this folder”.</p>
<p>If I select “Continue” I receive an error message stating “You require permission from Administrators to make changes to this folder”.</p>
<p>If I select “Try Again” I receive the same error message.</p>
<p>As I am the only user of the computer and also the “Administrator” could someone please advise what I need to do in order to delete the unwanted folders and files?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and new hardware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmg ken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and new hardware</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so my question is a bit weird. I had bought this PC pre-built at a TigerDirect and it had Windows 8 installed, I have since then upgraded to Windows 10, I have also made the hardware upgrade for AMD CPUs from an fx-4000 series to an fx-8000 series with
 no issues. As of now I'm doing something bigger, I am making the jump from AMD CPU to Intel CPU and that means I'm replacing the Motherboard which is also forcing me to upgrade my RAM. What I need to know is if this will force my Windows 10 to be reformated
 or reinstalled? My current edition of Windows 10 is Home and under Activation it says "Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account." So will I need to reinstall windows 10 or make a boot disk backup after swapping out all the
 hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: it does say I'm an insider but I am currently not on an insider build, I went back to the normal builds after some issues with the insider builds a while back.</p>
<p>

            <p>Changing the motherboard will invalidate the license, requiring that you purchase an entirely new Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only reactivate if the original Windows 8 license is a full retail license, if not, then you need to purchase a new license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h2>            Limits to pinned programs in taskbar</h2>
                    Some of the programs I pin to a taskbar icon are not visible, unless I delete programs already pinned.&nbsp; There seems to be a limit to the number visible.&nbsp; Is that correct, and if so, is there a setting to increase the number?

<h2>            Update Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 &#40;KB3133431&#41; crashes Virtual Box</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Home 64 bits (build 10586) on a Lenovo G50-80 80E5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the last Microsoft update (&nbsp;Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 (KB3133431) ), I'm not able to run any virtual machine with Virtual Box&nbsp;Versión 5.0.10 r104061.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following error shows up every time I try to start a virtual machine:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>"VT-x is being used by another hypervisor (VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE).</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>VirtualBox can't operate in VMX root mode. Please close all other virtualization programs. (VERR_VMX_IN_VMX_ROOT_MODE).</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Result Code: E_FAIL (0x80004005)</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Component: ConsoleWrap</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Interface: IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed}"</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall that update and Virtual Box works properly again. So the problem was the update. I have followed the steps described here:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>&nbsp;
 to avoid that this update install again automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this kind of updates are important for security reasons, so I would like to be completely updated but I need to use Virtual Box. Could you help me with this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be very grateful if someone could help me with this issue. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: When I installed Virtual Box I did it as Administrator so now, every time I run Virtual Box I do it as Administrator, I don't know if this can be related to this issue...</p>
<p>

<h2>            Mecer laptop&#58; Wifi won&#39;t connect automatically</h2>
                    So I have a Mecer W25CEV laptop at work running Windows 7 Home Premium. When it's booted up, it used to connect automatically to wifi, but now it doesn't. Instead I have to troubleshoot the problem, which is always that the wireless capability has been
 turned off. I have tried checking the wireless network to see if it is set to connect automatically, and it is. The next thing I tried was to remove the wireless network and then add it back in. That didn't work either. I've looked at other forums but they
 all reference Dell and Lenovo laptops, which doesn't help in relation to this Mecer. If anyone would be able to help, that would be great.

<h2>            Windows 10 Bluetooth keyboard imput lag</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Microsoft Sculpt Mobile keyboard, but the problem is, every time I try to type on it, it lags like a lot. At the moment, Im typing this with te on screen keyboard from Windows 10.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is an actual solution for the problem, but I doubt it,my operating system is Windows 10 (Home Edition) with the Anniversary Update installed, and the keyboard instructions says it is compatible with Windows 8, might that be the problem?</p>
<p>Sometimes, the keyboard works fine, but then it starts to lag again and it is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry if I misspell some words or the text itself is not that good, but English is not my first language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            View Details</h2>
                    <p>I very much prefer File Explorer always to open with Details showing in the right hand field. However, no matter how many times I go to View&gt;Details the very next time I open Explorer it opens as "Large icons". How can I change the settings so that Details
 are always opened first?</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

    <title>Corrupt messages in Window Live Mail. Now fixed but WLM has a bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reed1e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt messages in Window Live Mail.  Now fixed but WLM has a bug</h2>
                    1. My emails in storage folders had the correct headers, dates, sender etc but the contents of all emails in some folders (involving several thousand emails) all had the same content, ie not the content relating to the headers.&nbsp; I sought advice from this
 website.&nbsp; I was advised to rebuild my message store which I did but this did not repair the problem.&nbsp; Having reported back I stopped getting any response from this forum.<br />
2. I took out a subscription to the Microsoft Answers Desk.&nbsp; They searched for viruses (none), checked that various potentially vulnerable applications had the latest updates (they did), took over desktop operation and looked in my folders but decided it was
 a corrupt folder and out of their scope.<br />
3. Assuming that was the end of it and the email was lost and my subscription to Windows Answer Desk to be wasted I mentioned it to my brother, a recently retired Senior Software Engineer for the Zurich Stock Exchange.&nbsp; He had a look a the folder, diagnosed
 the problem within an hour and wrote a script which fixed my email.<br />
4. The problem is a bug in WLM.<br />
5. Microsoft Answers Desk were unable to deal with this reported bug and said the only means of letting Microsoft know about a Microsoft bug is via this forum.<br />
6. I am uncomfortable publishing a bug on a website in case it's exploitable in the wrong hands.<br />
7. My brother is happy to explain the problem and solution (though having gone to the trouble of diagnosing it he's not inclined to go to some trouble to report a Microsoft problem).<br />
8. Please provide a means by which he can privately explain the issue.<br />

</p><p><span><span>Hi Rebecca,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Microsoft seems to have abandoned WLM support to the users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is a fault in the WLM coding which can't handle long names. If WLM is shut down before it's had chance to rebuild its database index (eg power failures or forced shut downs due to windows freezing etc) it creates recovery folders with very deep
 folder trees. These deeply nested folder structures are part of the naming used by the database indexing which it can't handle. This causes the problem ~ or at least it caused the problem I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way of fixing it is to shorten the folder names all the way down the trees (and there are lots of them). Just as one example the tree was: Storage Folders / Recovered items / 01-03-14 823/Storage Fol d5/Imported Folder / Storage Folders/Imported Folders/Local
 Folders/Imported Folders /filed/...then at this level I found some of my folders, which had their own trees that I'd created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother wrote a script to shorten the file names automatically, but he was able to test that with my specific configuration in a safe way.&nbsp; It would probably be too risky to try it with your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you just plough through these folder structures and abbreviate all the folder names until you get to ones you recognise. Mine now read SF instead of Storage Folders, IF for imported folders etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you make a back up copy of your Windows Live Mail folder first. In case you don't know you can find where the folder is:</p>
<p>* click the icon just above 'Email message' and below the very top bar (when you hover it says Windows Live Mail. Click here to save, print and see everything else you can do)</p>
<p>* select Options / Mail / Advanced / Maintenance / Store Folder. That will bring up a window showing the current location.&nbsp; I moved mine to the Root (ie C:\Windows Live Mail) to make it easier to get at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also a good idea to force the index to rebuild before and after your changes go Options / Mail / Advanced / Maintenance / Compact the database on shutdown every &lt;change this to 1&gt; runs.&nbsp; Shutdown WLM, it will rebuild the index. Then restart and change
 the number to say 10 until you're ready to have another go at name shortening, then repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Assuming your problem is the same as mine when you've done all this you will find your emails. You may need then to spend a bit of time sorting them out but at lease you'll have them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck</p>

    <title>Multiplayer Server Connection Issues on XB1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moribund osiris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiplayer Server Connection Issues on XB1</h2>
                    
<p>Since I downloaded Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on XB1 I have not been able to play the multiplayer version of the game. &nbsp;I get the same message something like "Square Enix servers are unavailable, please try again later." &nbsp;I got a similar message with
 Ground Zeroes last month every time I logged in to play the game (though I'm not interested in that games multiplayer). &nbsp;I tried Black Flag last night and had no problems connecting to a server and playing a multiplayer game on XB1. &nbsp;I can't believe the Square
 Enix servers have been down since Tomb Raider was offered free through Games with Gold. &nbsp;If I can connect to one game and play multiplayer it wouldn't seem like an issue involving restricted ports (which is the focus of many help guides here).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note, I have both an XB1 and a 360 connected for multiplayer. &nbsp;My XB1 is connected directly to a comcast modem (via wireless routing). while my 360 uses a standard router. &nbsp;(NOTE: &nbsp;I know how to check ports on my standard router but have no idea how
 to check them on the comcast modem). &nbsp;The comcast modem allows for faster wireless communications and nearly always provides me with an Open NAT, while my other router typically has a lower NAT setting. &nbsp;In terms of other multiplayer games IDARB has worked
 fine but I've never been able to play an online game for Worms Battlegrounds either (which I assumed was due to a very low population of potential players). &nbsp;The only other thing of note is that I've signed up for Uplay and Black Flag is a Ubisoft game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, so I have a Cisco DPC3939 gateway. &nbsp;I set up the 7 ports (for port forwarding) as described on another Xbox page. &nbsp; For clarity everything is set up as listed below.</p>
<p>•Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>•Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>•Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>•Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>•Port 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>•Port 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>•Port 4500 (UDP)</p>
<p>In addition, I've cycled the power off (and unplugged my XB1). &nbsp;I've set up a second user account on my XB1 and tried switching between the two. &nbsp;However, after doing all this, I still get the same message that the Square Enix servers are not available when
 I try to play multiplayer. &nbsp;I shutdown my XB1 and tried playing Tomb Raider multiplayer on the 360...I log right into the multiplayer game, no problem. &nbsp;I am very frustrated. &nbsp;Why can't I play multiplayer on Tomb Raider?</p>

<p>Hi Moribund,</p>
<p>Can you try to change you DNS on your router to something other than Comcast's? Like to 8.8.8.8. I used to have problems with multiplayer games with Comcast's DNS, until I changed it.</p>

<p>I don't see any DNS settings in my gateway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomb Raider multiplayer worked from 10/08/15 to 10/10/15, but has since given me the message that the Square Enix servers are unavailable. &nbsp;I made no changes to my gateway since my last post.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, hopefully the problem was resolved. If not, you can change the DNS on the Xbox One/Xbox 360 by going into the Network Settings, then Advanced Settings, then DNS settings, and choose Manual. Then you just type 8.8.8.8. Let us know
 if this doesn't work or if your problem was resolved. :]</p>

<p>Okay, so I hadn't been able to connect to multiplayer on Tomb Raider since October 10th. &nbsp;On Friday 10/23/15 I was playing the Walking Dead when suddenly it froze up and forced me to restart. &nbsp;I tried restarting it and it wouldn't accept my button press
 of "A." &nbsp;So I did a hard restart of the XB1 and tried out Tomb Raider before going back to the Walking Dead. &nbsp;Suddenly the multiplayer was working on Tomb Raider. &nbsp;I was able to play TR multiplayer for 2 days (again) on 10/23 and 10/24, then by 10/25 it wouldn't
 connect to the server. &nbsp;I did a hard restart and still nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I own two controllers, and I often switch them out (i.e. charge one while I use one). &nbsp;After the hard restart on 10/25, I realized I had switched controllers between 10/24 and 10/25. &nbsp;So I did a second hard restart and grabbed the controller I used on 10/23
 and 10/24. &nbsp;After that hard restart, I was able to play Tomb Raider multiplayer again. &nbsp;Coincidence? &nbsp;Why would a controller make a difference when they are both signed in to the same profile?</p>
<p>As for the DNS settings, I thought that had to be set-up on the router/gateway, not the Xbox. &nbsp;I haven't found DNS on my gateway and the only 4 digit code listed under a setting that appeared to be similar to DNS would not except 8.8.8.8. Can't remember
 that category off-hand. &nbsp;I'll take a look at the XB1 settings for DNS the next time I get a chance to.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Can you give me more details about your issue? 
<br />To check drive connected to your PC in general you can use Disk Manager:
<br />
<br />1. Digit "Disk Manager" in windows search bar
<br />2. Click on "Disk Manager" from the results
<br />3. Scroll down to see every disk connected to your system.       
        </p>

            Hi Bill,
<br />
<br />What type of external drive is producing this error, is that an external hard drive or flash drive
<br />
<br />Do you have a non-Windows 10 PC you can connect that drive to, to see if that drive is accessible?
<br />
<br />Open Disk Management (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of that window . . .       
        </p>

<p>The proper drive letter shows up in file explorer &amp; disk management. (Until a DVD disk with data is inserted, there is no drive on left side w/other drives in file explorer. Only as icon on right when computer selected.)</p>
<p>If a blank, unformatted or formatted disk is in the external drive it shows no media/data in the drive. (same in
<span>file explorer &amp; disk management.) </span>If you select format for a blank disk, it ejects. Only when a DVD with some data will it show as valid usable disk exists.</p>
<p>The external drive recognizes CDs normally, but not DVDs. Same results with VLC media player. The&nbsp;<span>file explorer &amp; disk management show the drive correctly whether the CD disk is formatted, blank, or full.
</span>With CD inserted, Nero can play music, indicates 'tracks', but w/no titles.<br />
