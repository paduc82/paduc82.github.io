    <title>Communications Suspension - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Communications Suspension</h2>
                    <p><span>I was playing an online multiplayer game with a friend yesterday, minding my own business, when out of nowhere, a group of three people decided to come attack me and my friend. They were repeatedly killing my friend and I while screaming racial and
 homophobic slurs. It eventually got to the point my friend and I had to mute and report the people and leave the game. I thought all was done. That we were gonna move on. That wasn't the case.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of them then decided to message my account with even more homophobic slurs. I responded to him calling him an "<strong>[Mod Removed- Profanity]'</strong>. But because I cussed in that one message, he thought it would be funny to report me and get
 me banned, which I was, and flung a couple more homophobic slurs. I blocked him immediately after the second insult, and reported him again. I was ready to move on. But not even a full minute later I was communications banned for fourteen whole days.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I filed for a case review on the Xbox Enforcement website. I told them in great detail what happened. They responded telling me that I was being disruptive for calling the racist homophobe an "<strong>[Mod Removed- Profanity]</strong>" even after going through
 the messages and seeing him verbally abusing me plain as day. They kept me banned. I then found out the next day that the guy wasn't punished at all. Imagine my face. This guy comes at me with a hurricane of the most racist and homophobic insults imaginable
 and I'M the only person banned because I said the "<strong>[Mod Removed- Profanity]'.
</strong>All while this guy sits there completely unaffected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wouldn't have really bothered me had it been a 24 hour ban, or even a 2 day ban. But I'm banned for two whole weeks for calling another person an idiot, which is pretty tame compared to what he called me. I guess it's fine to be extremely racist and homophobic
 to another person as long as you don't say any cuss words in your messages.</p>

<p>As long as you reported him the enforcement team will investigate and if he did violate the code of conduct he will be suspended too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your situation it would have been best to just report and block the person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point that you sent a cuss word at him you also violated the code of conduct and were subject to the enforcement action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point since you already did the case review and the enforcement team upheld the decision there is nothing that you can do but wait out the suspension.</p>

<p>Hey there Miny!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you ended up in this situation. </p>
<p>It's just because they usually go by who reports who first. Next time this happens, I would suggest to report and block the perpetrator asap.
</p>
<p>If you have already filed a case review at <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howTo#sub-topic0-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enforcement.xbox.com </a>, and the decision was upheld, then you'll have to wait it out.

<p>It doesn't matter how the situation starts, if you respond in a way that violates the code of conduct, you can be suspended. It's best to just report the other person and block communications with them instead of responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspension length can vary based on the severity of the situation but also any prior suspensions. So if you received a suspension for 2 weeks it's most likely because you have have received suspensions in the past, not just for what was said.&nbsp;</p>

            They can only do it to us apparently. If we respond in kind, WE'RE punished while they learn nothing and continue to repeat their actions. I just got the worst messages i've seen since being on xbox, and no response from xbox enforcement.

<p>Well yeah, I did that right away, but that's not really helpful. The update even had a screen that said "Your files are exactly where you left them" or some such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the update uninstalling my programs? What if it was Steam? I have slow internet, and it would take forever to re-download all my games. Fortunately CCleaner is relatively small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side-note: I also noticed one of the shortcuts on my start menu disappeared.</p>

<h2>            Skype IM conversations cannot be deleted</h2>
                    Some IM conversations are not deleted from Skype even when I delete them from my Conversations folder in Outlook. I right-click in Skype and select Delete Conversation, but they are still not deleted. This appears to be random messages. Eventually they
 do go away. I am wondering if this is an issue or whether I am doing something incorrectly. Thank you.

    <title>Reinstall of Windows 10, can&#39;t access old files. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xerophytic_live  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall of Windows 10, can&#39;t access old files.</h2>
                    I copied some important files to an external hard drive, then I did a fresh install of windows 10 on my computer. Now I can't figure out how to access my files on my external hard drive. When I try to copy them back into my main computer, it asks for admin
 permission, I hit continue, then get told I need permission from some long series of numbers to make changes to the file. I can't even open the files to view them either. I'm signed into my same Microsoft account, hoping that would help.

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>For us to better know your concern regarding the files that you've transferred to your external hard drive, we'd like to ask some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- How did you transfer the files to your hard drive?</p>
<p>- Can you open the files without transferring it to your computer?</p>
<p>- Have you tried opening or copying the files using a different computer and getting the same issue?</p>

<p><strong>- How did you transfer the files to your hard drive?</strong> Cut/Paste onto an external, then did a clean reinstall of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>- Can you open the files without transferring it to your computer?</strong> Nope. I basically don't have permission. I think these files were automatically encrypted on my previous installation of windows, and now I don't have the encryption
 key (assumption from googling). I didn't realize there was encryption keys. I figured I'd have access to them as long as I was logged into my same Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>- Have you tried opening or copying the files using a different computer and getting the same issue?</strong> Yea, same issue, won't even allow to be moved out of the external.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong> Are you sure that you are signed in to the computer as administrator?
</strong>Yep</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, but I remembered I had&nbsp; set up an automatic cloud based backup of my files. So I downloaded my files from there and deleted all my inaccessible files. So I don't know if your reply would have worked or not, I'll keep it saved in
 case this happens to me again though. Redundancy for the win.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now the problem : After reinstallation of OS I am able to see the D Drive with bitlocker enabled (A loc sign on that) and when I click on that drive (D: drive) it asks for password which I know but it shows that password I incorrect (I am sure it is correct
 as I noted it in a diary) and also tried the recovery key option by it says that key does not match, as I am copy pasting it so no possibility of typing error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I done this number of times restarted my PC many times but not able to open that drive.</p>
<p>Please help there is very important data stored in that drive that I need.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Ralink wi-fi driver doesn&#39;t work correctly in Europe</h2>
                    I have Windows 8.1 (just upgraded). My PC (an HPE HP 120IT) has a Ralink Wi Fi adaptor. I live in Europe (Italy), so I can use Wi Fi "g" channels 1-13 (in USA you can only use 1-11).&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I set my router to use channels 12 or 13, this PC only see the other wi-fi that are around here but not my wifi (other PCs I have see correctly the wifi). If I change my router back to channels 1-11 it works correctly.</div>
<div>This didn't happen before upgrading to Windows 8.1, but looking at the driver log it seems it updated the driver.</div>

<h2>            PDF won&#39;t print</h2>
                    I am unable to print any PDF. I have tried using Edge and Adobe Reader Touch. I have checked for system updates, unistalled and reinstalled the printers -both wired and wireless - checked to make sure the pop up blocker was on...nothing works. I can print
 from every single application/document except pdf. &nbsp;When I select Print it just says "connecting" to which ever printer I choose and spins forever.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Shannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What version of Reader (or Acrobat) are you trying to print from? What type of printer are you trying to print to? Is it on a network or local? Can you try to update your printer's driver by doing the following:</p>
<br />
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Go to Device Manager</li><li>Find your your printer under Devices and printers</li><li>Right click on in and go to Update Driver Software</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p />

            Try to download the pdf to your desktop and right click print. Will this work. I had similar issues before and this was a work around. Obviously not the solution you are looking for.

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.

<h2>            How Can I Run 2 Older Games On My Win7 64X</h2>
                    **** I want to ask for some help please in getting 3 of my favourite older games to run in windows 7 64x.  The games are: Kings Quest 7 and The Incredible Toon Machine  I used ot be able to run both of these on my old laptop but as it's now dead I want to try and put them on my desktop, I have tried DOSBOX and ScummVM but neither of them will run the games as they're either not supported or need windows to run....  I'm at my wits end, I'm not tech minded so anything I'd follow would have to be step by step and don't know what else to try anyway.  Thanks in advance.

            Both games were published in '94, so it's a bit surprising that DOS BOX did not work, but it's<br />
possible they were among the very first DX games.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.gog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Good old Games</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; sells a Kings Quest 7&amp;8 package that is Win7 compatible. If their version does
<br />
not run in DOS BOX then maybe the original had a 16bit installer. They may have created a
<br />
32bit installer to make it compatible with Win7 64bit. <br />
16bit installers are one of the more common issues with games this far back, and <br />
will run on 32bit Windows, but not on 64bit Windows. <br />
I have three pre 2000 games from GOG which run properly on Win7 64bit.<br />
<br />
If you have access to a machine with 32bit Windows you can&nbsp; try installing to that. If successful<br />
you can copy the game to the Win7 64bit machine and it will very likely run.<br />

            what boss said. you can also install it to virtual xp and copy the entire folder over to 7 or 8 as well. just don't 'install' the game to 7 or 8. also, d-fend is a great front end for dosbox. i use the both together and with that, virtual pc and some tweaks
 i can run just about anything on 7 or 8.
<div><br />
<div>on a side note: classic shell is an awesome program to use with 8. i love it.</div>

<h2>            My Panasonic KX-P1150 printer wont work on Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10, but when I tried to use my Panasonic KX-P1150 printer it was not on my list of available printers. I've been looking for drivers for this printer, but the best I could find is Windows 3.1 and I was unable to get it to
 download properly. Any suggestions as to how I can get this printer to work on Windows 10

<p>Windows 10 has driver (64bit too) as i did just found it and tested and it worked on my printer.</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>Shortly, you need know what port its plugged in. Then install it as a new printer (through windows settings at devices and
 printers).. at screen where you manually select printer manufacturer &amp; model click that button at below "Windows update".. it will bring after waiting couple minutes much greater selection of printers and its there! Amazing. It worked for me via printer port
 USB adapter. :)</span></p>

<p>What about the millions of players who pay for Xbox Live Gold and are seeing players access content for free that they are paying for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox’s setup is the most fair to both players and developers. All players contribute to the maintenance of the service. Developers who prefer full-featured games over free games with micro-transactions are not penalized.</p>

            I do not agree. Arguably, XBL servers are the most stable and secure (and that’s just across the board) which is attributable to the maintenance and upkeep that’s covered by membeship fees.

    <title>Windows 10 is critically halting and the screen smears white pixels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigd1972  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is critically halting and the screen smears white pixels and blue background at the time of the freeze up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Lately (past few weeks) my Windows 10 workstation is critically halting and the screen smears white pixels and blue background&nbsp;at the time of the freeze up. The only option is to hold in the power button for like 6 seconds or so and power of, then power
 back on. Once I have restarted the system and logged back in. I am noticing a 2+ Gig sized MEMORY.DMP file in the c:\windows folder time and&nbsp;dated at the time of the halt. However, I do not know how to review this information to help figure this out. Approximately,
 5 days ago from the time of this post I noticed a 22+ Gig sized file in the c:\ directory that appeared to be connected with Windows Hibernate feature. And at the time, it seems that the time and date of that file was always current to the last system freeze
 up (halt). I did some research to use the command prompt to turn off and delete the Hibernate file. However, what is strange is I never had or wanted that feature on. I have also gotten this result when logged in another profile that is on this workstation.
 I have removed a couple of recently installed programs, etc. I tired doing the Windows settings&gt;recovery&gt;reset option twice. But it states something went wrong and undo's the reset after it takes the time to go all 100% way through the reset tick up. Still
 get random freezes like the image below. If I leave the computer logged in or logged out over night, it will be froze by morning. No smeared blue screen because it is usually backend out I think once it has been sitting idol for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to? 
<br />Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703, 1709?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />How to update your drivers:

            See if there are minidumps in C:/Windows/Minidumps folder. If so, do share them
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

<p>I looked at my video card adapter and I believe I now have it installed to the most current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video card is a GeForce GTX 660, Driver version 390.77.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b01b83c-6233-4bec-811a-fbaa59b4ea29?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b01b83c-6233-4bec-811a-fbaa59b4ea29?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I point this out because there appears to be some slight improvement to the crash(es). My workstation did not crash over night like it has been doing since the video card update I did yesterday. However, while I was working this morning, I got a BSOD. So,
 the slight improvement that I mentioned is, now I can at least see the white writing information. It states ":( Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you." and shows a percent complete
 value ticking up, to eventually read "100% complete". And I let it sit for about 5 minutes with no automatic restart happening as it stated it would. There is also a QR code with addition information. "For more information about this issue and possible fixes,
 visit https://www.windows.com/stopcode"</p>
<p>"If you call a support person, give them this info:"</p>
<p>"Stop code: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION"</p>

            The Bugcheck 34 is fairly uncommon and nothing constructive in the crash dump.
<br />Microsoft recommends the following if there are repeated crashes.
<br /> Add new physical memory to the computer. This will increase the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are times when you connect a mouse to a USB port on your computer but the mouse is not detected or does not function correctly. We can try these steps to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Unplug the USB cables and then plug it back in and test the Device Drivers.</li><li>Try a different USB port. </li><li><span>Please make sure that the cables on your device aren't damaged in any way.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the device doesn't appear to work at all like no lights appear on the device when it’s plugged in, or the cursor doesn't move or doesn't appear on the screen then connect the device to another PC to see if the device works on that PC. If the device doesn't
 work on the other PC, you might need to replace it. </p>

<h2>            Transferring Ownership of dlc to a new owner.</h2>
                    
<p>A year ago i had an account with black ops 1 Dlc on it and there after the account was hacked. i still had the account and the dlc on the hard drive but one day i decided to delete the account because it was wasting space and i couldn't get in the account
 anyway. So i went and deleted my old account but i accidentally deleted the profile and it's items! (any sort of dlc, themes, gamer pictures, etc)I checked awhile later and i found out the dlc was still on the hard drive but no one owned it. i checked in game
 (Black ops 1)and the dlc wasn't active but for some reason it was in my hard drive. My question is: can i make my new xbox live account be the new owner of the dlc instead of having to buy it all over again? The &nbsp;DLC are First Strike, Escalation, Annihilation,
 and Rezurrection.</p>

<h2>            No Sound - No audio output device is installed Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>As per the title I have no sound and other threads and you tube clips fail to correct the issue.
</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite P750 with windows 7 and have tried the following to correct it-</p>
<ul>
<li>I have tried to update drivers- they were up to date.</li><li>I have uninstalled Realtek drivers from the Sound, video and game controllers section in the device manager.</li><li>allowed windows to automatically reinstall after a Restart, and I have manually installed prior to restart- and a few other combinations</li><li>I have checked Toshiba for system/motherboard updates- and is up to date</li></ul>
<p>The sound stopped working when a windows update just butted in and decided a restart was required while I was on you tube. On the restart something popped up with flash player, I missed what it said.</p>
<ul>
<li>I reviewed the windows updates and the log says the last update was 1 week ago.&nbsp;</li><li>I did a system restore to before the windows update, this might be significant as the first and only available system restore point before the windows update was when a realtek update was logged. i don't know what this was.</li><li>I have checked the adobe flash player for updates, it was up to date, and uninstalled/re-installed just to see.</li></ul>
<p>The text- "This device cannot start. (Code 10)" is the end of each &nbsp;path I take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this Windows related or Toshiba related, I guess windows as it happened when an update occurred. Any advice is appreciated. &nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Age of your machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Toshiba support web site and get the driver and install it, even if the one installed now is newer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Suggestion for future benefit:</strong></p>
<p>The default restore point space allotment in Windows 7 is 3% of drive capacity.&nbsp; In almost all cases, the computer is using but a very small proportion of the space available.&nbsp; That makes it very practical to raise that 3% to say 8 to 10%.&nbsp; This strategy
 will yield far more restore points that will give you much more flexibility in recovering a bad situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the allotment, type create in the text box above the start globe.&nbsp; Choose Create a restore point.&nbsp; Click configure.&nbsp; Move the slide to the right as much as you see fit.&nbsp; Setting it at 50 Gigabytes will have no affect if you have a 500 Gigabyte
 drive and are only using about 100 or so, which is highly typical.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I went through the steps on the link.</p>
<ul>
<li>Method 1 - Can't do it as there are no drivers install- or as it says.</li><li>Method 2 - previously tried over and over again - did not work.</li><li>Method 3 - tried to action this however nothing happened after hitting the run as admin on prompt box.</li></ul>
<p>And I guess foolishly, I went to Programs and feature and uninstalled the Realtek HD Audio thinking I could just reinstall. This didn't work as after I hit the run tab on the prompt box the install appears to start but nothing happens. I downloaded it from
 the Toshiba site. I also tried to run the application from the installed programs folder- and same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is definitely no sound driver- none show up in the Device Manager, and the Realtek HD Audio icon and text from the Control Panel have now disappeared completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have two issues - A computer that did say no sound driver installed when there was, and a computer that won't automatically update the driver or let me install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I will have to copy all my files off and run the Toshiba recovery discs I made the day I got the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have plugged in working earphones in as I suspected that may be the case after reading one of many web pages. They didn't produce any sound. I could try linking my Bluetooth speakers tonight, and will comment if it worked&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there is probably no point now as I un-installed Realtek HD Audio and haven't got it to re-install yet.</p>
<p>I guess if it is a hardware issue then it still won't work after a windows 7 &nbsp;reboot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 decimal key on numpad type dot instead of comma</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set decimal separator as "," although when pressing the&nbsp;decimal key on Numpad&nbsp;(Del / . ) I got a dot instead of a&nbsp;comma when using Windows applications (e.g. Windows Explorer), MSWord or Notepad. When using MSExcel or MSPowerpoint, I got "," as it
 should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;running Windows 7 and Office365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any support on this.</p>

            <p>That's how the customized format in Windows 7 normally works. When you are using the default applications, the system will detect the normal keypresses of the keyboard. However, when you are not using the default applications, the system can detect the customized
 format you have set.</p>

<p>Have used one, they are a solid build and great for FPS when you change the Thumbsticks for the more competitive ones...but I only game on xbox so, standard is good enough for me</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<strong>A)&nbsp;As a work around, you may try to do system restore.<br />
</strong>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Finish.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</p>
<p>Check the link “What is system Restore” <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/9f6d755a-74bb-4a7d-a625-d762dd8e79e51033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> rickervin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 25091. Setup failed to change the source</h2>
                    I am using MS Publisher 2007 (12.0.6501.5000)SP2 MSO (12.0.6425.1000) that came bundled with my HPMedia Center PC running Vista 64 Bit.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I go to use clip art in MS Publisher it asks for my Microsoft Visio Professional 2003 installation disk.&nbsp; I Browse to the CD drive where the disk and the file is but when I click OK the Error 25091. Setup failed to change the source is displayed in the
 new pop up window.&nbsp; I even tried coping the requested file to the local drive as well with the same results.&nbsp; The diectory it seams to be stuck looking at is the recovery partition which is unaccesablle except for rebuilding the system to the OEM new state.<br />
<br />

            <p>This is ridiculous. &nbsp;I also have had this problem with the "Endless Loop" looking for the installation disk. &nbsp;I have even re-created the installation disk and it does not recognize it.</p>
<p>I am about to do to a low level format of the hard drive to get this off the computer. &nbsp;It has been on the computer for over 4 months and it is just downright annoying. &nbsp;Microsoft claims "we do not support 2003" anymore, which is **** since it is causing
 this type of problem.</p>

<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's an old thread, but google didn't find any solution on the first few pages, so wanted to share what my solution was.</p>
<p>I had the same error yestarday while I wanted to add some features to my Office installation. Trying to resolve it I did an idiot thing, but finally it has led me to a solution. The idiot thing was uninstalling the whole Office package. I wanted to reinstall
 it later, but was getting the same error all the time.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to run the setup.exe file as administrator. And it helped :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the solution is : run the setup.exe as administrator, choose an option to modify the existing installation and add the requested feature.</p>
<p>Good luck :)</p>
        </p>
