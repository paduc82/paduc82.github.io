<p>My sent messages seem to be going into the OUtbox, and not being sent.&nbsp; How did they get there, and how do I get my messages sent directly?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

    <title>How and what to check when your emails are not being deleted or - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How and what to check when your emails are not being deleted or archived properly in Exchange Online</h2>
                    <p /><p><span>I thought about writing this article about how to troubleshoot MRM/Archive issues in Exchange Online, as we often see in support, situations like these.&nbsp;</span></p><p /><p><strong><span>IMPORTANT:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Before I go ahead and expand on this subject, please keep in mind that all the information found here, is based on my own troubleshooting experience and nothing else.</span></p><p /><p><strong>IMPORTANT 2:&nbsp;</strong>If you are troubleshooting archiving issues in a hybrid deployment, where the primary user mailbox is located on-premises and the archive is in Exchange Online, you can still apply the same troubleshooting steps from below,
 but just do this on the on-premises Exchange Management Shell, since it is the on-premises server applying the archive policies and hosting the primary user mailbox.</p><p /><p><strong>IMPORTANT 3:</strong></p><p /><ul><li><p>For all folders under the <strong>Top of Information Store</strong> with the exception of Deleted Items, Contacts, Calendar (recurring meetings only) and Tasks (recurring tasks only), so Inbox, Sent Items, Junk Email etc and any of their sub folders created by the user, you check the <strong>OldestItemReceivedDate</strong> and you compare it with the Retention Age defined on the policy that is not working.</p></li></ul><p /><ul><li><p>For everything that is <strong>under Recoverable Items</strong>, you look at the <strong>OldestItemLastModifiedDate</strong> instead and count against the RetainDeletedItemsFor property.</p></li></ul><p /><ul><li><p>For Deleted Items, this is a special folder for which you have to check this article:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-co
</span></strong><span>(</span>“<strong>never move to archive</strong>” or “<strong>never delete</strong>” actions are applied)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mailbox to be processed has a lot of items and has a big size or in the case of archiving, the Dumpster of the primary mailbox has a big size. Items in this case will be processed slower.</p><p>-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The policy applied on the mailbox contains only personal tags, which if they are not manually applied by the user, will result in a behavior where MRM doesn't seem to process the mailbox.</p><p /><p>Keep in mind that the Managed Folder Assistant has an SLA in Exchange Online of up to 7 days until it will process a given mailbox. This means that even if it usually processes mailboxes every day, it can sometimes take up to 7 days. If you would like to
 try and force the process, you can always run <strong>"Start-ManagedFolderAssistant &lt;mailbox ID&gt;"</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p /><p>Another important thing to note here, is that MRM will no process mailboxes that have less than 10MB in size.</p><p /><p><span>Going further with more details about the possible causes of MRM/Archive not processing a mailbox:</span></p><p /><p><strong><span>1.&nbsp;First, please make sure that the attribute RetentionHoldEnabled on the mailbox, is not set to True (typical for migrations done via PST Import Service).</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong><span>2.&nbsp;Another important thing, verify that the attribute ElcProcessingDisabled is set to False. This parameter tells us if MRM is going to process a mailbox or ignore it completely.</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong>3.&nbsp;If we have a Default Archive/Default Retention tag (applied on the entire mailbox), we need to make sure:</strong><br /></p><p /><ul><li><p><span>&nbsp;we have no personal archive/retention tag set to "nev
PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM</span></strong><span>, which contains all the retention policies applied on a mailbox; we need to make sure that in the list of retention policy tags found in this property, we have the Default Archive tag present (or any other policy tag that we just
 applied); if we cannot find it, delete the </span><strong><span>IPM.Configuration.MRM</span></strong><span>&nbsp;message that contains the
</span><strong><span>PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM</span></strong><span> property and run a </span><strong><span>Start-ManagedFolderAssistant</span></strong><span> for the affected mailbox, this will regenerate the IPM.Configuration.MRM&nbsp;message which should also update the
</span><strong><span>PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM</span></strong><span> with the new policy tag.</span></p></li><li><p><span>&nbsp;to locate the </span><strong><span>PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM</span></strong><span> and the</span><strong><span> IPM.Configuration.MRM&nbsp;</span></strong><span>message, please follow these steps:</span></p></li></ul><p><br /></p><p><span>- setup the affected mailbox in Outlook</span></p><p /><p><span>- download the correct version (must match the installed version of Office of 32 or 64 bit) of MFC MAPI from here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/releases</span></a></p><p /><p><span>- open MFC MAPI and go to Tools/Options and check these 2 flags:&nbsp;</span><strong><span>MAPI_NO_CACHE</span></strong><span> and
</span><strong><span>MDB_ONLINE</span></strong></p><p /><p><span>- click on Session/Logon and then select the Outlook profile that contains the affected mailbox and open it</span></p><p /><p><span>- double click on the affected mailbox in MFC MAPI and look after the </span><strong><span>
Top of Information Store</span></strong><span> after you expand the </span><strong><span>Root Container</span></strong></p><p><span>under the Top of Information Store, look after </span><strong><span>Inbox</span></strong><span> and right click on it, then select
</span><strong><span>Open Associated Contents Table</span></strong></p><p /><p><span>- expand the current window and look after the message class </span><strong><span>IPM.Configuration.MRM</span></strong><span> and highlight it</span></p><p /><p><span>- after highlighting the message, below you should see all of its properties, look after the one called
</span><strong><span>PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM</span></strong></p><p /><p><span>- double click the property and copy paste the XML inside it, in a notepad then save it as .xml</span></p><p /><p class="contentStandard">- open the xml with a browser to be able to read it easier, it will show you what are the actual retention policy tags that are applied on the mailbox</p><p /><p>This property contains all the retention policies that govern the mailbox.&nbsp;</p><p /><p>If we have personal archive/retention tags, please check if the personal tag is correctly applied on the folders by using MFC MAPI. Simply open the Outlook profile of the affected mailbox in MFC MAPI as described above and check the properties of the folder
 for archive tags or policy tags.</p><p /><p><span>For example, when dealing with a Default Archive Policy (that applies on the entire mailbox), you will not be able to see any archive policy properties on the mailbox with MFC MAPI, such as:
</span><strong><span>PR_ARCHIVE_TAG</span></strong><span>, </span><strong><span>PR_ARCHIVE_PERIOD</span></strong><span>,</span><strong><span> PR_ARCHIVE_DATE</span></strong><span>. There properties can be seen only when having a personal archive tag applied.</span></p><p /><p><strong><span>4.&nbsp;Collect the output of the following commands:</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong>Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity &lt;ExchangeGUID of primary mailbox&gt; -IncludeOldestAndNewestItems | select Name,Identity,FolderPath,Date,*estItem*,*estDel*,FolderSize,itemsin*,*Policy,FolderType,ContainerClass | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation -Path .\primaryfolderstats.csv&nbsp;</strong>- we are looking after which are the oldest items in any given folder (oldest last modified time when it comes to Recoverable Items folders), what policies are applied on the folders (could be disabled personal tags or active personal tags or even a retention compliance policy, that might override the policy we expected to have active)</p><p /><p
 and DeletedItemCount if we have an archive enabled in which we move Dumpster items from the primary mailbox)</span></p><p /><p><strong><span>Get-MailboxStatistics alias -Archive | fl ItemCount,DeletedItemCount,TotalItemSize,TotalDeletedItemSize</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- follow the item count and total item size to see if the archive mailbox size is modified (means that items are being
 moved in and the size/count should increase)</span></p><p /><p><strong><span>Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -ComponentName MRM</span></strong><span>&nbsp;- this should show us if errors have occurred when the Managed Folder Assistant processed the mailbox; beware of the date when the last error occurred to
 see if it is relevant for your issue; "</span><strong><span>resource unhealthy</span></strong><span>" errors are throttling messages, which means that MRM is processing the mailbox, but at a very slow rate because of the size and the number of items in the mailbox. Throttling cannot
 be avoided when dealing with big mailboxes.</span></p><p /><p><span>Once again it is very important to pay a great deal of attention when checking the MRM logs, to their creation/generation date so that you know they are relevant to your current issue.</span></p><p /><p><strong><span>IMPORTANT:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;If you are not seeing any logs (</span><em><span>error message on red font saying, “no logs were found”</span></em><span>), this means that MRM processed the mailbox without any kind of errors.&nbsp;You can confirm that the Managed Folder
 Assistant ran across the mailbox, by checking the attributes ElcLastRunTotalProcessingTime and ElcLastSuccessTimestamp (see below).</span></p><p /><p><span>The ExtendedProperties flag of the command Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs, will produce a big XML output, out of which we are interested to see only the Elc properties (Email Life Cycle), so we need to parse the XML with below set of 3 commands in Powershell:</span></p><p /><p><span>$logProps = Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -ExtendedProperties</span></p><p><span>$xmlprops = [xml]($logProps.MailboxLog)</span></p><p><span>$xmlprops.Properties.MailboxTable.Property | ? {$_.Name -like "ELC*"}</span></p><p /><p /><p><span>ElcLastRunTotalProcessingTime</span></p><p><span>ElcLastRunSubAssistantProcessingTime</span></p><p><span>ElcLastRunUpdatedFolderCount&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>ElcLastRunTaggedFolderCount&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n
 but at a slower rate than usual.</span></p><p /><p /><p><strong><span>5.&nbsp;To check the retention policies and tags, we can run below commands. Pay attention to those policy tags that are disabled or have the actions set to “never move to archive” or “never delete”.</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong><span>Get-RetentionPolicyTag -Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** | fl</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong><span>Get-RetentionPolicyTag -Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -IncludeSystemTags</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong><span>Get-Mailbox&nbsp;</span></strong><span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span><strong><span>&nbsp;| fl *Retention*&nbsp;</span></strong><span>- see what we have on&nbsp;</span><strong><span>RetentionHoldEnabled</span></strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>RetentionPolicy</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong><span>Get-RetentionPolicy | fl</span></strong></p><p /><p><strong><span>Get-RetentionPolicy | select -Expa
 they will have precedence before any other tags that may be applied.</span></p><p /><p><span>You can find more details about what is the meaning of the above command switches (such as IncludeSystemTags) or properties that can be seen when running those commands, here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd298009(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-retention/Get-RetentionPolicyTag?view=exchange-ps</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p /><p /><p /><p><span>Remember that we usually process the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Dumpster</span></strong><span>&nbsp;first and then the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Inbox</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or the folders under the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Top of Information Store</span></strong><span>, but on the same level with the Inbox. This can cause some confusion and make
 the user think that retention and archive policies are not working on his mailbox.</span></p><p /><p><span>The Dumpster of the primary mailbox, should not be at the maximum quota (30GB for regular mailbox or 100GB for a Litigation Hold enabled mailbox). In this situation, MRM will no longer move items in the archive.</span></p><p /><p><span>With the above in mind, one should consider enabling the archive mailbox for an account, right after it has been placed on Litigation Hold (especially if the user has a high amount of email traffic), to avoid having the Recoverable Items folder becoming
 full and the user being unable to further delete items from his primary mailbox. Additionally, they should enable Auto-expand archives depending on their Office 365 licenses (more details can be found here&nbsp;</span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-limits.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396#StorageLimits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Mailbox

                    The software Safehouse explorer is giving a general error on Windows 10 when I try to open files. &nbsp;About every 15 days after a computer restart it works and then stops working the next day. &nbsp;I do not have any additional virus protection besides whats on
 windows. It still works on windows 8.

            <p>Hi Joseph, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 Technical Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does the issue persist with a particular software? </p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message when Safehouse explorer does not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to run it in Windows 8 Compatibility mode as you said that it works in Windows 8 and check if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Type <strong>Run Programs </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Then click <strong>Next</strong> on the Program compatibility troubleshooter dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Now select the Program from the list. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us for any issues pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to help.</span></p>

<h2>            Grouping contacts Mac Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously had my contacts in Skype grouped in different tabs, such as: Family, work, foreign contacts, etc. In the version I'm previously running (Skype-version 8.29.0.50) I can't seem to find how to achieve this. The only this that I'm able to do
 is creating chat groups, which is not my intention. I what to add new groups Under All, Skype, active now...<br />
<br />
I'm not running Skype for business. Is this still possible, and if so how do I do this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel</p>

<p>
</p><p>Currently, there's no option to create a contact group. Adding to favorites is the only option available to use there. Don't worry, I'll take this as your feedback and forward this thread to our development team to help with improving Skype 8 in the upcoming
 updates.</p>

</p><p>In the meantime, if you prefer using the classic version, here's a downloader link:&nbsp;<em><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</span></a></em></p>

<p>Hi Vidhyalakshmi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p><br />
Can you try to add a partial of the sentence back to the document and see if it suddenly becomes unsearchable again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we suggest uploading a new document with the lines you provided and see if the same issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd like to narrow down if this is only happening to that specific document or if all documents that has those lines have this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist in the new document, we suggest uploading a new copy of that document and re-crawl your library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<p>Hi Vidhyalakshmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The language selected for the site has no relation to the search. Even if your site's language is only English, you should be able to search for any characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to confirm the issue you're having:</p>
<p><span>1. If the characters are not getting crawled, you should still be able to search the document that contains the characters above by using the document name.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. If the document can't be searched at all even using the document name if the characters are in the document, then it is a different problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm which scenario you’re having?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are encountering scenario number 1, I'd like to make sure that you have re-crawled the library and wait for at least 24 hours afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're encountering scenario number 2, then I'd like to narrow down the issue to whether or not it is happening to all documents that contain these characters, or only specific documents / specific libraries. You mentioned in your last reply that creating
 a new document are not working too - have you tried to re-crawl the library after you created the new document? It may take some time for the crawl, so please confirm whether you have waited 24 hours. I tested on my side and I can search for the document that
 contained those characters on a new document I created yesterday.</p>

<p>Hi Vidhyalakshmi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In SharePoint Online, content is automatically crawled based on a defined crawl schedule. The crawler picks up content that has changed since the last crawl and updates the index.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to manually request crawling and full re-indexing of a site, a document library, or a list, you can refer to the steps in the following article.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manually-request-crawling-and-re-indexing-of-a-site-a-library-or-a-list-9afa977d-39de-4321-b4ca-8c7c7e6d264e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manually request crawling and re-indexing of a site, a library or a list</a></p>

<p>Hi Vidhyalakshmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, language packs has nothing to do with SharePoint's Search method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your previous reply you mentioned that you checked for the document in crawled documents xml and provided us with this code:</p>
<p>var searchRestSource = _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + "/_api/search/query?querytext='Listid:("+varlistguid+")+Contenttype:(Policy Central CT) "+qry+"'&amp;selectproperties='Title,PCdtOWSTEXT,PCorgOWSTEXT,PCsubOWSTEXT,PCgeoOWSTEXT,PClangOWSTEXT,PCtagOWSMTXT,LastModifiedTime,PCLinkOWSMTXT,Path,View'&amp;rowlimit=500";</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know the detailed steps of this procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my side I used the SharePoint Search Center (https://tenant.sharepoint.com/search) to find the document. If you are using a different method, can you please try searching via the Search Center and see if the documents can be searched.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi N.C,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the issue, I’d like to confirm whether you are using SharePoint Server 2013 or SharePoint Online.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using SharePoint Server 2013 and the issue happens when opening the Excel files from a site in SharePoint Server 2013, I suggest you post a new thread on our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=sharepointgeneral%2Csharepointadmin&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet forum-SharePoint Server 2013</a> for expert help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using SharePoint Online, from your description, it seems that the accounts in your organization are configured with Azure AD Connect. If yes, please upload a full screenshot
 of the Account page in the Excel 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, confirm when the issue happens and whether the issue happens in a specific site or a specific file in SharePoint Online. Does the issue happen in all user accounts in your
 organization?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook preview for Android - Where are my contacts &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly please excuse me if I posted in the wrong category!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently Microsoft released a new outlook app for android thus replacing the old non-official one. (outlook.com developed by 7forums or something like that)<br />
<br />
I have downloaded this app and removed the old one but I'm facing a problem! &nbsp;In this new outlook app, my MICROSOFT CONTACTS (people) are not present! Indeed, when I check the "people" tab in the app I ONLY see the email addresses of people
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I rece</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ntly wrote mail to or received mail from</span>. &nbsp;I have absolutely no access to the "normal" Microsoft people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old app used to create a Microsoft account in the accounts section of the Android device (Settings &gt;&gt; Accounts). &nbsp;All the MS contacts and calendar were automatically synchronized to the device and the contacts were added to the "people" app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the app is still in preview but I wanted to know if anyone here knew if this was "normal" ? &nbsp;Because it is very very frustrating. &nbsp;I had to import all my contacts from outlook in a vcard / csv file to re-import them in the new outlook app to finally
 manage to have access to my full microsoft people list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this be corrected in the future or what ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Love from Belgium !</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>YES my contacts are still visible on the People Page!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I'm using the NEW outlook app ==&gt;&nbsp;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook&amp;hl=en&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had no problem with the old non-official app (outlook.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to uninstall it, then reinstall and reconfigure my account and nothing changes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 Android devices and the issue appears on both of them so I think that the problem is app-related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have this problem too.</p>
<p>With the older Outlook.com app for android (I know&nbsp;it was official)&nbsp;I could see my account people in Contacts on the phone, but after installing the new Microsoft Outlook app They aren't shown and there is no option about it in the app nor&nbsp;in Contacts, though
 I can see my Skype contacts.</p>
<p>I tried Clear data and&nbsp;reinstalling the app&nbsp;but no result.</p>
<p>I'm on Android 4.2 (CM10.1)</p>
<p>If this feature hasn't been implemented yet&nbsp;please mention it in the store.</p>

            Lol AT LAST someone else!<br />
<br />
I'm concerned with the lack of info MS provides about this issue. &nbsp;I understand that most Android users do not have theirs contacts synced with their MS account but with their Google account so the problem may have gone unnoticed for the majority up to now.
 &nbsp;But when all your contacts are linked to your MS account this is REALLY FRUSTRATING... users should not have to manually re-import all theirs contacts into their Android device... Furthermore, MS should at least warn users of this issue AND provide information
 about if this is normal or not and going to be fixed or not :)<br />

            <p>I used the in-app support option to ask about the ability to have outlook.com "people" being synced/available in the android stock contacts, SMS, phone dialler apps etc. Here's the reply I received....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to export all of my outlook.com "people" and import them into my Gmail account so that they are available on my android phone. A backwards step for me as I use outlook [.com] for everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know what the latest version of the previous "official" outlook app for android is and where I can get it? I want to go back to that version until this new preview app has at least the same basic functionality as the previous version.</p>

            <p>Here is another example of how the developers... or at least the project leaders are worlds apart with the needs of the users... "We just deleted the really useful feature and If you want it back you may cry over our support team and MAYBE IF WE ARE IN A
 GOOD MOOD we'll implement it... in a few years or so" hahahaha<br />
<br />
Btw thank you ClivekJames for getting an official answer from MS !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link to my MEGA with the OLD oultook.com *.apk ;) &nbsp;Just install it and you'll have access to the old app ;)</p>

            Thanks for the link Dahm Nicolas. I'm going back to the old version for the time being. I've got a second Android device which I'll leave with the new Outlook preview app on so that I can monitor updates to it over the next few weeks / months.

            <p>I've uninstalled the outlook preview version and then installed the previous outlook android app downloaded using Dahm's link. After launching the app and entering my email address and password, the app attempts to validate my account. Despite several attempts
 this fails with error message 100. I then tried to download the previous outlook android apk app from other sources and get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that perhaps it is not possible to revert back to the previous version due to perhaps something being set on the backend server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now given up and reinstalled the outlook preview app again. I'll keep running with all my outlook contacts now exported to Gmail and will wait for the outlook app to be upgraded to include the basic functionality to allow outlook.com people to be available
 in the stock android contacts, sms and phone dialler apps.</p>

            Well here it is a month later in April, 2015 and this feature is still missing.&nbsp; Seriously, who removes functionality from working apps?&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not, nor will I ever put my contacts in a google account -&nbsp; I like android, I hate google so that is not an
 option for me.&nbsp; I previously, with the old OUTLOOK.COM app could sync my contacts and calendar with my android.&nbsp; That was great.&nbsp; Now I have a new and improved Outlook Preview that can't even do that?&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; I cannot express to the developers how very stupid
 and frustrating this is for someone that uses MS services.&nbsp; FAIL<br />

<h2>            Google asking for Gmail sign-in in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have just returned from a few days away from the computer.&nbsp; When I opened Outlook (2016), and tried to access one of my Gmail accounts, a pop-up appeared asking me to sign in to my Gmail account.&nbsp; When I did this,I was asked to allow access (see below)
 - scary!</p>
<p>I did this and all appeared OK until I tried to send/receive folders, at which point it did it again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Office support spent an hour with me, looking for Google add-ins (none) etc, but couldn't resolve the issue - I was given the option of paying for Premium Support or asking Google Support for help.&nbsp; The only thing that was useful was that running Outlook
 in Safe Mode (type <strong>outlook /safe</strong>&nbsp; on the Run Command -Windows + R) stops the problem .... but who knows whether it will result in a loss of function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at Google's support website, this issue has already affected a lot of people (see thread here&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/thread/6139701?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/mail/thread/6139701?hl=en</a>), first reported 15th May 2019.&nbsp;
 It seems to be something to do with Google and MS Office working together, but no solutions are appearing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last week or so there have been a couple of Windows updates - could this be related?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix the problem, please?</p>
<p>

<p><strong>A solution has been posted on the Google Gmail forum:</strong></p>
<p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>I have managed to resolve the issue. It is ridiculous but worked for all my Gmail accounts. In your mail settings you need to

            I tried changing from gmail to googlemail in the imap and smtp as you suggested but it did not work for me.&nbsp; MS seems to have changed all the various places that you need to find to change settings like this.&nbsp; It used to be easy to just go to account settings
 and click on change, now you have separate menus, etc.&nbsp; I wonder if that change is what is causing the issue.&nbsp; It is annoying to keep having to type in my gmail password for every account, and then Google keeps sending me critical security alert emails as
 well.&nbsp; It started this past week on all three of my PCs.

<p>So far it seems that 2 solutions to this have worked... one is changing from imap.gmail.com to imap.googlemail.com (and doing the same with the smtp setting).&nbsp; The other one that I found elsewhere on line and worked for me is to disable the simplified account
 creation which was added and/or modified in one of the recent updates.&nbsp; There is a manual way to do it by adding a line to a registry key (which is fairly advanced for most PC users), but there is an easier way by downloading a registry entry file and then
 just clicking that and it adds the entry for you.&nbsp; Search online for something called DisableSimplifiedAccountCreation.reg.&nbsp; Try to make sure you find it from a trusted source.&nbsp; I'm sure that now this solution is out there some nefarious folks will try to
 create a fake one with a virus in it.&nbsp; I found mine here -<a href="https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/01/disable-simplified-account-creation-outlook-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/01/disable-simplified-account-creation-outlook-office-365/</a>.&nbsp;
 It walks you through both the manual process or has the .reg file available to just save and run.&nbsp; I recommend backing up your registry entries prior to doing this, for peace of mind in case you want to roll back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major screw up by the Microsoft Office development team, so I'm sure they will create a fix within a future update soon, but for now this worked and I no longer have to enter my gmail password ad infinitum when I'm using Outlook.&nbsp; For everyone's
 reference I am on Outlook Version 1905, build 11629.20196.</p>

            I have just got rid of the problem.
<div>i've got MS-Excel 64 bit.</div>
<div>I had turned ON the advanced option:</div>
<div>(File/Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; &nbsp;General -&gt;)</div>
<div><b>Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)</b></div>
<div>I did that to get rid of the&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><b>cannot use object linking and embedding</b></u></div>
<div>&nbsp;error when starting Excel.</div>
<div>I consequently found that the problem with this error was that something had changed the DCOM User to my account instead of the launching User</div>
<div>(Component services\Computers\Mycomputer\DComConfig\Microsoft Excel Application-&gt; Properties (right click) -&gt; Identity (tab) change
<b>this user</b> to the <b>launching user)</b></div>
<div>When I did that&nbsp;<u><b>cannot use object linking and embedding</b>&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;was gone, but&nbsp;</div>
<div>
There was a Problem sending the command to the program
<div>was shown up each time I tried to double click an Excel file.</div>
<div>Finally I turned</div>
<div>&nbsp;<b>Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)</b></div>
<div>back ON</div>
<div>and now everything seems to be fine!</div>
<div>Hope that helps</div>

    <title>Microsoft Math Add-in bug in Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armoredcpu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Math Add-in bug in Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>More of a bug report here if anything. No big deal for me, but perhaps others are more frustrated. If another person or two can duplicate this, feel free to chime in.</p>
<p>Windows 7 64-bit</p>
<p>Office 2007 Ultimate</p>
<p>Microsoft Mathematics Add-in (32-bit) 2.0.040811.01 (The latest as of this post)</p>
<p>Full updates, running a security suite, etc...</p>
<p>I'm getting a prompt when closing certain documents (non normal template based documents) to save changes to underlying templates. Uninstalling the add-in removes the problem. Re-installing the add-in reintroduces the problem.</p>
<p>I don't use macro-enabled documents.&nbsp;I have checked, and as expected, none of my templates or documents based on them have any macros listed as&nbsp;accessed through the developer tab. I've tested with a couple of custom templates, in a couple of locations, one
 of which being&nbsp;the built in user documents folder.</p>
<p>To create the problem, I can</p>
<ol>
<li>Run&nbsp;MS Word 2007 </li><li>Open a document (.docx) based on a non-normal (.dotx)&nbsp;template through the MRU list.</li><li>Close the document </li></ol>
<p>This problem does not occur when&nbsp;running MS Word 2007 and then opening and closing a normal template based document, or when re-opening and closing a non-normal template based document after choosing not to save changes without re-starting Word.</p>
<p>I can't get consistent testing results when opening a number of documents based on a mix of normal and non-normal templates before closing any of them.</p>

I've long since seen that Web page document and gotten no results from it other than to tip me off to add-ins. Keep in mind that my problems have nothing to do with the normal templates, and only appears to affect ones I have created. One of them was created
 on another computer and has been used for quite awhile without problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't just disable&nbsp;the Math add-in&nbsp;since a prompt tells me "This add-in is installed for all users on this computer, and can ony be connected or disconnected by an administrator". I am on an administrator user profile, the only profile used
 on this computer. I don't need help with that at this time since disable vs. uninstall is not a big deal for this.</p>
<p>I'd love to respond more quickly to you, but unfortunately I've never had the Microsoft Answers forum send me an alert to&nbsp;post responses as I've requested through the check boxes available at post time. I have my junk filter turned off at the ISP level and
 Outlook doesn't trash them without me having a chance to sift through them.</p>

    <title>Your preview build settings need attention - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dng tấn hiệp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your preview build settings need attention</h2>
                    In my Windows Update, I got a messaging saying "There's a problem with getting preview builds... Your preview build settings need attention. Go to Advanced options to fix this issue". And then I hit the Advanced options, under my Microsoft account it said
 "Your security settings need attention to get Insider Preview builds". When I hit the button Fix me under that message, I was told to restart my computer. But nothing changes after restarting. I still got the same message and restart so many times. Do any
 one have the solution to my problem?

Cancel preview builds on all computers for 2 days after two days go by restart preview builds and all should be fine, remember after turning machines off reboot and wait two days.

 and got a message insider preview builds will continue to download until you reboot.&nbsp; went to update and am downloading the lastest fast ring update as I type.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I solved the problem instantly by clearing the "FlightingOwnerGUID" value in the registry here;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability]<br />
"FlightingOwnerGUID"="CLEAR this value"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have go through&nbsp;the "Get Insider Preview Builds" process again, via "Updates and Security/Windows Update/Advanced Options/", and sign In with your Microsoft account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the problem&nbsp;is how the&nbsp;"FlightingOwnerGUID" is tied to the digital entitlement for the particular computer. I know that when I went through this procedure I ended up with a new "FlightingOwnerGUID" in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope it works for others.</p>

<h2>            How to remove Onenote link &#40;2016&#41; of a task &#40;created in outlook&#41; in outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When editing a task in outlook, I can click Onenote (add-on added in outlook toolbar) to link the task to the note. As my understand right now, when you click it (the onenote button), it will let you choose the location in my notebook. After I choose it,
 if I click the onenote button again, it will open the note for me (chosen before).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I remove or change the link? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click the button again, it will go to the note again. I try to remove the tag or stop the link according to https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-Outlook-tasks-in-OneNote-19725ff3-0234-495d-9838-fb1f511e924f. There is no help.

                    Obviously this is not a question about Getting Started, nor is it about Calling or Messaging. Does Skype really not want to answer any questions about PAYMENTS?&nbsp;

    <title>How to exclude sound files from Xbox Music collection&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to exclude sound files from Xbox Music collection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm relatively new to WP with my Lumia 635. On my old Android phone I was able to keep files from being added to my music library by placing a blank file named '.nomedia' in a folder I wanted to exclude. How can I accomplish this on Windows Phone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, the default behavior seems to have Xbox Music scan for every sound file on my SD card (no matter the folder it's in), picking up things like sound recordings and ringtones that I obviously don't want in my Music collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>

            <p>Xbox Music will include all sound files except those in the podcast and ringtone folder. All ringtones you want to use should be in the ringtone folder. If they are also in the music folder you will get them in your Xbox Music collection.&nbsp;
<p>There is nothing that will prevent music files from showing up in Xbox Music if they are not in the ringtone or podcast folders. If you don't want them, remove them from the music folder.</p>
<p>Check the phone music folder and the SD card music folder.</p>

            build 10240 is meant to be downloaded via Windows Update only. This&nbsp;is to test the system o make sure its' ready to deliver Windows 10 to everyone. If you would have read the blog post on the 15ht you would have known this. People that wish to be on the
 Insider program owe it to themselves to actually keep up on it. You'll have to wait until after the 29th. Even then before you can do a clean install you have to upgrade to Windows 10 from a legit Windows 7&nbsp;or Windows 8.1 machine.

            <p>No. This is the equivalent of downloading a Windows 8.1 image from Microsoft.&nbsp; You choose what you want, version, etc. to match your existing Product Key and then it will download what it needs to make that ISO (or install directly to that PC if you choose,
 but that is what Windows Update is trying and failing to do for some).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will still end up with a bootable ISO that you can put on a DVD or flash drive to install.&nbsp; You must upgrade an existing activated Windows 7 or 8 OS by running setup.exe from the mounted ISO, flash drive or DVD.&nbsp; Only those who do not own a license for
 Windows 7 or 8 would need to use a Product Key for Windows 10.&nbsp; Upgrades are based on the activated qualifying OS.</p>

            Thanks Don. Your reply is pretty much clear now. I started updating my windows using that tool now and later I will create an ISO from the ESD file for clean install if required in future.

            The tool will create an ISO for you if you wish, rather than creating one with the ESD file, but either way should work.&nbsp; Once you are permanently activated, you can clean install Windows 10 on that device at any time&nbsp;in future.

    <title>Highlighter in Word and Outlook deselcts and moves cursor, is there an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larry in sj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Highlighter in Word and Outlook deselcts and moves cursor, is there an option to disable that behavior</h2>
                    <p>I use Office 2013, mainly Outlook and Word.</p>
<p>When I either highlight (i.e. add background color) some selected text, or remove the highlight from selected text,</p>
<p>&nbsp; the selection is automatically deselected and the cursor (or insertion point) is set to be just after where my selection was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this behavior could be thought to save time when you are in highlighter pen mode, selecting swaths of existing text to highlight.&nbsp; Maybe they believe you can move the pointer a shorter distance to pick the end of the next selection, this way.</p>
<p>Or that you don't have to pick the start of the next selection, assuming that it follows immediately after the location you just finished highlighting or unhighlighting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any hidden option or workaround which will prevent the highlighting command from cancelling my text selection?</p>
<p>In my case, that would save me a little time and effort; when I'm applying more formatting changes on a section of text, beyond just the highlight color (or beyond just removing highlighting).&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Golf Tile &#38; GPS</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting increasingly frustrated using the golf app. The app is one of the reasons for purchasing the Band 2 to replace my Sky Caddie. &nbsp;However, it is continually loosing GPS and unusable. &nbsp;On some rounds it works ok, others I have to continually reboot
 the watch. &nbsp;I used it on Friday in glorious sunshine, and after a few minutes it picked up GPS on the first hole. &nbsp;By the time I got to the 3rd it had lost GPS. &nbsp;I rebooted and it picked up GPS again and lost it again after a few holes. &nbsp;This happened a number
 of times to the point where I gave up using it. &nbsp;My Sky Caddies worked perfectly all of the way round.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Golf App is not fit for purpose, and I am looking to return the watch and replace it with something which is more usable. &nbsp;It's a shame as I like the watch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had similar problems?</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a sheet that with the last data is Row 211, Column AH.</div>
<div>Excel insists on have hundreds and hundreds of blank columns and rows. It is sized row 246, column PK.</div>
<div>I have tried control+end to delete the rows and columns, save, and open. No luck. When I delete a row, it replaces it with the same number.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It makes it very difficult to scroll for information.</div>

            You can't keep them from showing up, but the scroll proportionality should reset (you may need to close and reopen the workbook).
<div><br />
<div>Formatting entire columns and rows can sometimes extend the scroll range.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't mind macros, you can always use VBA to set the scroll area. Unfortunately, it's not kept on saving, so you have to reinstate it when the workbook opens. Put this in your workbook's ThisWorkbook code module:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Private Sub Workbook_Open()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worksheets(1).ScrollArea = "A1:J100"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End Sub</div>
