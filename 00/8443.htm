<h2>            Google Search Results comes up Blank IE 11 Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so Microsoft is aware, IE 11 on Windows 8.1 on all my computers running 8.1 and my partners Windows 10 IE is experiencing an issue when running Google Searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can load the Home screen fine, but if I write "test" it will show the search bar and nothing more. To try to force the results, I can usually load YouTube then press back and be able to search... for awhile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though Google is your competitor, I would like to point out that IE may be the root cause as I am able to search fine on Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted a reply on a Google Search Support Forum on Google as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"My computers also have this issue on IE 11 Windows 8.1 and it is happening on my partners Windows 10 IE. Chrome seems to load it fine. I search "test" and the page moves to what the results page will look like, like the search bar going to top left. But
 nothing comes out. I press refresh repeatedly but nothing except it sometimes splices the home screen&nbsp;and search result screen. My Home Button is google so I click that and the homepage of Google loads fine. I can get it to work by going to something like
 YouTube using the App list on top right, and when I press back and try to search, it comes up, but only for awhile, then nothing.Bing loads and many other websites used work fine, just not search results of Google, so its come down to an issue with IE and
 Google or Google on IE, although others report that Chrome has issue, so.......WHAT THE!?!?!?!?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can work this out coz I hate Chrome and don't want to use it for browsing. But sorry to be a non-supporter MS, but I don't like Bing&nbsp;except when&nbsp;Cortana uses it, and uses it well.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing the Back Button after the search and doing the search again helps.</p>

    <title>Envelope address spacing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radiodave69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Envelope address spacing</h2>
                    In Word 2010 I have yet to figure out how to print envelopes without the outbound address being double spaced. No problem on the return address. But, it doesn't matter whether it's a captured address or typed in, both default to an extra space between
 each of the address lines. Any solution?

<p>The envelope address is placed with a style called, would you believe, Envelope Address. Change the format of this style to be based on no style, rather than Normal and set the space after paragraph setting to 0. - see also<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/changing_envelope_layout.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/changing_envelope_layout.htm</a>

    <title>Word 2011 will not print double sided on HP Envy 4520 wirelessly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolefranklin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2011 will not print double sided on HP Envy 4520 wirelessly</h2>
                    I have recently changed from a Cannon multifunction printer to an HP Envy 4520. The Cannon, which was only wireless, printed double-sided effortlessly. But I can only print double sided to my HP printer when it is connected with the USB printer cable.
 I spent two hours with an HP technician who could not fix it. Her take is it is a pprobem with Word 2011. Does anyone have a suggestion?

            <p>If you are able to print correctly from Word when hooked up with a cable, then Word is working correctly. The wireless part has absolutely nothing to do with Word, Word has no wireless features built in. Wireless communications are between the operating
 system and the printer driver: at this point Word is out of the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad truth is that since HP ran into financial problems a few years back, they have cut back on driver testing, especially with less-popular operating systems like OS X and Linux. Many users on Windows who use less-popular programs like Microsoft Publisher
 are also experiencing more difficulties with HP printers. They just don't have enough in their R&amp;D budget any more to test every program in every operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can do without wireless printing, just hook up the USB cable and be done. If wireless is a show-stopper, return the printer to the vendor for a refund with a note that the wireless function doesn't work with your installation. They can't say no.</p>

    <title>Cannot assign tasks to external exchange user, task received as - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot assign tasks to external exchange user, task received as attachment and message is cut in half.</h2>
                    
<p>hello, we are on office365 / latest version of outlook, and we are using tasks all the time between users of our organization without problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>however, when we send tasks to a subcontractor in an external organization (using exchange 2010), he receives the task as an attachment and the task in cut in half, like on the screenshot below, with no accept or decline buttons&nbsp;</p>

<p>how can we solve this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Adminadmin4393,</p>
<p>&nbsp;A couple of details needed for usto better understand the situation:</p>
<p>1. How do you send the task? Please send us the detailed steps.</p>
<p>2. What’s the normal email received with accept or decline buttons from the users in your organization? Please send us a screenshot about it.</p>
<p>3. By saying “latest version of outlook”, do you mean you use Outlook 2013 to send the tasks?</p>
<p>4. If you send the task to another external users, does the issue persist?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Hello! thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>1 - Tasks are sent using the task pane in outlook 2013, creating a new task, then clicking ''assign task'', we type in the address of the recipient, tell it to select the ''use outlook rich text format'', and click send.
</p>
<p>additionally, we created a remote domain for the external user domain where we specify ''always send using rich text format'', and we enabled TNEF for that remote domain using powershell.
</p>
<p>2 - yes, within our organization, the accept / decline buttons are always present and functional.
</p>
<p>3 - yes, outlook 2013, updated to the latest version weekly</p>
<p>4 - yes, it persists in any other organization using exchange that i tried, it only works well within our office 365 organization.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>hi adminadmin4393,</p>
<p>normally, when we assign tasks to exchange users that are outside our organization, we need to enable the tnef.</p>
<p>as you mentioned you have we enabled tnef for that remote domain using powershell, but the issue persists. i would like to confirm how you enable the tnef.</p>
<p>i have done a lot of tests from my side and i would like to share the results with you:</p>
<p>before enabling the tnef, the external user received the task as below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a887c725-2ee5-43f3-bb78-eba83f605948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da887c725-2ee5-43f3-bb78-eba83f605948" /></a></p>
<p>this is the task after enabling the tnef:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4e35142f-ae67-4fe9-99e9-c34d6e219bda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4e35142f-ae67-4fe9-99e9-c34d6e219bda" /></a></p>
<p>here are the steps to enable the tnef:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect to exchange online using remote powershell</a>.</p>
<p>2. new-remotedomain -name domain.com -domainname domain.com</p>
<p>3. set-remotedomain -identity microsoft.com -tnefenabled $true</p>
<p>*note: please replace domain.com with the external exchange domain name.</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>robert</p>

<p>Hi Adminadmin4393,</p>
<p>Since you have enabled the TNEF for the remote domain, the task request to the domain should be displayed properly.</p>
<p>I have tested with two of my Office 365 tenants, before enabling the TNEF, the task is received without the Accept and Decline button. After the TNEF is enabled, the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Given this situation, the issue might be related to the recipient side, the recipient might have configured some policy to block the TNEF emails. So can you please check it with the recipient about it?</p>
<p>To test it, I will send you one of my Office 365 test accounts, please set it as your remote domain and enable the TNEF for the domain, please refer to the steps in my last post. After the TNEF is enabled for some time (say half an hour), please assign a
 task to the test account.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>

<p>Hi Adminadmin4393,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>I have received your task with the wrong format. Generally, after the TNEF is enabled, we need to wait for some time to let it take effect.</p>
<p>Can you please send us a screenshot for running the below command in PowerShell?</p>
<p>Get-RemoteDomain | Where {$_.TNEFEnabled -eq $true}</p>
<p>If my test domain is included, please wait for some time and assign a task to the test account again.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

                    I'm unsure what I've done but my Shift+8 shortcut for asterisks into bullet points is no longer working in OneNote. I'm not having issues with Word or anything else, just OneNote. Does anybody know how I can fix this?&nbsp;

<h2>            How to filter and copy paste values through a macro&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I write this in a more effective way because this is done with the macro recorder. The steps of the macro should be this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Apply a filter to the Date field</div>
<div>2. Filter for dates before TODAY</div>
<div>3. Select filtered data three columns to the right</div>
<div>4. Copy and paste as values on the same place.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The code I have is this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;ActiveCell.Offset(3, -2).Range("A1").Select</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.AutoFilter</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveSheet.Range("$B$8:$F$20").AutoFilter Field:=1, Criteria1:= _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&lt;07/11/2013", Operator:=xlAnd</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveCell.Offset(2, 3).Range("A1:A2").Select</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Copy</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; :=False, Transpose:=False</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.CutCopyMode = False</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.AutoFilter</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveCell.Select</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you very much!!</div>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>The word documents are still showing nothing when opened. &nbsp;The pdf files open ok but not the word ones.</p>
<p>I have quotes saved which I need to access regularly and although it says the quote holds say 24.5kb in the panel on the left, when the file is opened there is nothing there to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its totally driving me nuts. I can type a new quote, save to my documents and the same thing happens immediately i try to view it. Its not there!!!!</p>

<p>Even the ones on my usb stick will open using this method so a big thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I can access the files even if I have to go a long way round to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you throw any light on why then they are not accessible going straight into them under My Documents? &nbsp;It now seems to be intermittent. &nbsp;Sometimes it works this way and I think all is well.</p>
<p>Next time I try I am back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Possibly you are running some maintenance utility that has deleted the registry settings for recent docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW Very unwise to open a doc on a usb stick, the data should be copyed to a documents location and opened there, edited/saved, and if neccessary copied back to the stick. Its easy to corrupt the data on a usb stick</p>

<h2>            Nokia X2-00 Text Messaging Problem...</h2>
                    
<p>I have bought a&nbsp;new Nokia X2-00. The issue is, that when I type a message of more than 6 SMS's length, that message changes to a Multimedia message, and will not be transferred/sent in spite of me having GPRS, WAP and MMS configured. What is the matter here.
 I don't want the message to change to an MMS in the first place, as is the case normally in every other phone I have used!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same issue with Picture Messages (Clipart and the built-in type, not photos). I can receive them as Test Messages, but when I try to forward them, it changes into MMS and therefore can't send them, and so is the case when I want to send a built-in cartoon/clipart
 to some one. This never happened with any other phone I was using, and they always went as Text Messages....!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, can Nokia or someone help me resolve this problem... It's so frustrating... Thanks.</p>

            I found when I checked the internet that this was a problem with many 365 users. I called Microsoft support and the tech seemed to be very aware of this issue. All I told him was the error as it was stated on my screen. He asked if I would allow him to
 access my computer to fix it. I allowed this and 2 hours and 15 minutes later he said it was fixed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I watched what he was doing on my screen. He deleted a 2010 version of Office suite from my computer and he changed my 32 bit version of 365 and replaced it with the 64 bit version. &nbsp;I have a 64 bit computer. I was keeping the old version while I was trying
 a trial version of 365.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The 365 did work after this but the problem I then had was it would not work with other important software I have that requires Outlook linking to function properly and this software ACT by Sage only works with 32 bit outlook.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After discussing this problem with both Microsoft and Sage. I had to get Microsoft to put the 32 bit version back on my computer then to get ACT back to linking as an add on to Outlook I had to get Sage to uninstall and reinstall ACT. &nbsp; This took quite
 a long time also with the tech taking control of my computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Admittedly this is not only expensive, time consuming and scary to let someone from the other side of the globe take control of your computer. The problem seems to be fixed at this moment. I hope it stays that way. I have already lost way too much time
 on trying to track down this problem and find a fix for it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was not charged by Microsoft for any of the tech support. I understood when I purchased it that tech support came with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

 require sitting on the phone for hours or turning over control of my computer to remote access?</p>

<h2>            Windows Mobile 6.5 - Threaded SMS - How to remove or change sort order.</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a new Omnia 2 running Windows Mobile 6.5 (Build 21856.5.0.65)</p>
<p>The threaded SMS is shocking. When going to view messages it scrolls from the oldest to the newest before you can read the message. Obviously this is really annoying.</p>
<p>I have tried to turn off the threaded SMS using the registry edit's as for Windows Mobile 6.1 however this does not work.</p>
<p>I can live with the threaded SMS as long as i can change the sort order of the messages or get it to go straight to the newest message and not the oldest message first.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            In WinMo6.1 on non-touch, the only true font setting was in the path I outlined above. &nbsp;That still exists in 6.5. Although, on the Jack, it's under a couple of "More" options in the settings menu. It's not grey-ed out on my Jack. Perhaps something you
 have installed has disabled this feature on your device.&nbsp;

<div>Now, in regards to editing a file in the windows folder to get this just in email - that's possible. But that's a much more advanced and custom solution and not something that the average user should attempt.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To edit, the physical style used for email you need to follow these steps:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Application unlock your device (see:&nbsp;http://www.mobilejaw.com/articles/2009/09/removing-application-lock-on-windows-mobile-standard-devices/ )
</li><li>Connect the device to your computer and browse to the \Windows folder and look for the following files&nbsp;- read_style.0409.css, read_sms.0409.css, and compose_style.0409.css
</li><li>Copy this files to your desktop and make a backup copy </li><li>Open them in Notepad </li><li>Change the font tags as you require </li><li>Save them, and copy back to the mobile device </li><li>You may have to reboot after copying them back to the device </li></ol>
<div>One thing to note, the "0409" part of the file is for the region. &nbsp;North America typically uses 0409. If you're not located in NA, then you might have to modify the files with 0c0a in the name.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, this is an advanced procedure. I don't recommend doing this unless you are sure you know what you are doing. &nbsp;With that said, I now have email with 18pt font!! Woohoo!! :-)</div>

<h2>            Turkish Support for Nokia Lumia 800 &#40;7.8 Tango Update&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Windows Phone 7.5 has been updated to 7.8 Tango. In Windows Phone 7.5 version of Nokia Lumia 800, there was no support for Turkish language. I'm thinking of buying a Lumia 800 but not sure whether Turkish is supported now.<br />
<br />
Has Turkish language support been added to Nokia Lumia 800?

            <p>Greetings Şâkir Aşçı:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting to the boards! I understand you wish to know the status of the Turkish language and its availability with Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you check the list of <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp7/basics/feature-and-service-availability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
languages supported for Windows Phone 7</a>, Turkish is available for the on-screen keyboard, but not display. You would be able to write in Turkish, but the menus and navigation on the phone would not be in Turkish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as what languages are actually installed on each phone, that is up to the manufacturer and the carrier. I would contact the phone carrier you use and ask them if their Nokia Lumia 800s come with Turkish support for on-screen keyboards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Iris.</p>

            Is the language change happening only in Office apps, or everywhere?<br />
<br />
If you don't have any use for French, you could delete it: File tab &gt; Options command &gt; Language option.

    <title>VBA in access decrypting a password for email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samharrap  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA in access decrypting a password for email</h2>
                    Hi guys I have used the following code in my system to encrypt a password<br />
<br />
Public Const Hider As Long = 191817<br />
<div>Public Function Encrypt(ABCin As String) As String<br />
Dim Encry As String<br />
Dim Keynum As Integer</div>
<div>For Keynum = 1 To Len(ABCin)<br />
Encry = Encry &amp; CStr(Asc(Mid(ABCin, Keynum, 1)) Xor Hider)<br />
Next Keynum<br />
Encrypt = Encry<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
</div>
<p>Everything Is working great however, I previously made a function to send emails to user who had forgotten their passwords<br />
Now when I send the passwords to users they are given an encrypted password which will not work to log in to the system<br />
Is there any way around what I'm trying to do perhaps decrypting the password I have no clue of how I would do this as the encryption was given to me as a template by my teacher.<br />
<br />
Here is some of the code for the email function if it helps<br />
</p>
<div>Set db = CurrentDb<br />
Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Member", dbOpenDynaset)</div>
<div>rs.FindFirst ("Email = '" &amp; Me.TextEmail.Value &amp; "'")<br />
If rs.NoMatch Then<br />
MsgBox ("Sorry, Email not registered")<br />
Else</div>
<div>If Me.TextEmail.Value = rs.Fields("Email") Then<br />
EmailT = Me.TextEmail.Value<br />
EmailSub = "Password"<br />
EmailText = "" <strong>&amp; rs("Password").Value &amp; ""</strong></div>
<div>Set outMail = outApp.CreateItem(olMailItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outMail.To = EmailT<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outMail.Subject = EmailSub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outMail.Body = EmailText<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outMail.Send</div>

<p>Hi Oldhasbeen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed information. I did some test and research on my side. I found that the “Bot” tab has been renamed as “App” in the latest version of Microsoft Teams. According to the screenshot you posted, you have already enabled this feature successfully.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello. The best place to get the battery and cover is online unless you have a Samsung service center nearby. Just google for it and you will find several sources. Shipping to India would be the only concern. They have some extended batteries on ebay.in:

            Thank you very much for your very prompt reply. In the end, it proved to be a simple problem with my internet access- I was downloading from the internet at my local library. Although no statement was made I suspect that the service thought that the file
 was a virus and refused to authorise it. It often does that. Anyway, I moved to a local supermarket which provides internet access, and all went well. Windows Preview now installed and apparently working well.

<p>Using Access 2007 SP2 on Windows XP SP3. When designing a form or a report, the "Insert Chart" button is always greyed out. Don't know what else to add, except that I've searched multiple forums and can't find any answers. Any help or hints would be greatly
 appreciated. Thanks,&nbsp;Ryan.</p>
<p>An additional bit of info, which so far hasn't helped me find the answer, but it appears as though this only occurs if i am working on an ADP. If I use an MDB file, the button appears fine.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 640xl windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Since upgrading to window 10 on my Lumia 640XL I have had power issues. It taking forever to charge and once charged my battery drains within 3 to 4 hours. This basically makes my phone unusable. Have removed my sim plus wifi connection to determine whether
 battery is poor or the windows operation system is draining the battery. Diagnosis points to Windows 10&nbsp;is draining my battery. On what was an excellent phone with windows 8.1 it has now turned into an unusable phone. Would like to revert to windows 8.1 but
 phone doesn't give the option. Microsoft any ideas?
