<h2>            Why can I no longer send a OneNote page inline&#63;</h2>
                    Up until two days ago, I was able to click E-mail Page from OneNote, and the entire page would be copied into an HTML email in Outlook. &nbsp;Now, a plain text email is opened (My email default is still HTML), and there may or may not be an attached .mht file,
 depending on some random process I can't determine. The phrase '<span>Click the .mht attachment to view the notes as a Web page.' is included in the email, regardless of whether the .mht file is
 actually attached.</span>

<h2>            How to &#34;sync&#34; Outlook 2013 calendar appointments to outlook.com calendar</h2>
                    <p>Environment:&nbsp; 1,000 + users of Office 2013.&nbsp; Office 2013 is installed locally on desktops.&nbsp;Appointments and meeting reservations are scheduled by staff in their Office 2013 Outlook Calendar.&nbsp; We have been unable to "sync" these appointments and meeting reservations&nbsp;with
 their Outlook.com calendar.&nbsp; The desired outcome is that the Outlook.com calendar shows the same meetings and appointments as the&nbsp;local Office 2013 OL Calendar.&nbsp; If I open my Outlook.com calendar, click on Import, I have the option&nbsp;to Import&nbsp;into a new calendar
 or Import into an existing calendar HOWEVER, selecting either option requires staff to "browse" to a file to&nbsp;import. This suggests&nbsp;that users of&nbsp;&nbsp;Office 2013 Outlook Calendar&nbsp;who have&nbsp;&nbsp;appointments and meeting reservations&nbsp;in Office 2013 Outlook Calendar must
 "export" those&nbsp;&nbsp;appointments and meeting reservations&nbsp;from Office 2013 Outlook Calendar to a file&nbsp;then "import" that file into Outlook.com Calendar.&nbsp; Surely not!&nbsp; This would require staff to repeatedly export from Office 2013 Outlook Calendar and import to
 Outlook.com calendar.</p>
<p>What is the secret here?&nbsp; Surely MS did not fail to include the functionality which would allow these two calendars to sync.

            <p>Hi DBARTLE,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to sync Outlook.com to Outlook 2013, let me assist you with this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that you can sync your Outlook.com calendar to Outlook 2013. But first you need to add
<span>Outlook</span>.com to <span>Outlook</span> 2013. To do that just follow these steps:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the ribbon, tap or click <span><strong>File</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Add Account</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter your name, <span>Outlook</span>.com email address. and password, and then click
<span><strong>Next</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Outlook</span> does the rest. When it’s done, click <span><strong>Finish</strong></span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you want to know more about Outlook.com, just check out the link below:</p>

            <p>That's not at all what I was asking.&nbsp; Adding Outlook.com to Outlook 2013 is a no brainer.&nbsp; After several hours of recon, exporting the Outlook 2013 calendar appointments and meetings then attempting to import them to the Outlook.com calendar...the import
 fails each time.&nbsp; What I have been able to do is add the Outlook.com calendar as an additional calendar in Outlook 2013, and each time I create an appointment or meeting in my Outlook 2013 calendar, drag that appointment or meeting in my Outlook.com calendar.&nbsp;
 That is the only solution I have come up with to keep the appointment and calendar events consistent between OL 2013 and Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, get your act together and create the functionality which by default, links and syncs appointment or meeting events added to an Outlook 2013 calendar to&nbsp;a person's Outlook .com calendar.&nbsp;

<p>Please be informed that when you sync an account in Outlook 2013. All information in your Outlook.com account should be synced already, meaning you don't actually need to export information out of Outlook 2013 to import it&nbsp;to your Outlook.com account.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to clarify, when syncing your account in Outlook 2013 did you received any error message that may have been the culprit of your issue right now?

<div>I'd be intersted in know what's the best way to support this. I have an IMAP account attached to Outlook 2013, along with an Outlook.com account. The IMAP account is for work email, and my calendar invites/requests are with that account. I'm looking for
 a way to populate those events into my outlook.com calendar automatically, and not the default "Calendar (This computer only" calendar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does that possibility exist? As mentioned by another person, you can do it manually by dragging/copying the event from one calendar to another.</div>
<div><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm happy to help you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to populate your Outlook.com account's calendar with the events from your IMAP account, kindly subscribe or import the calendar from&nbsp;your IMAP account to your Outlook.com calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly&nbsp;contact the email provider of your IMAP account so they could assist you with regard to producing the&nbsp;calendar link that you can use to subscribe and import the calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already have the&nbsp;calendar link&nbsp;from your IMAP account, please refer to this article on how to add a calendar in Outlook.com</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that doesn't help. I'm not sure if you really understood my request.</p>

<p>Imagine this scenario. I have an IMAP account, say *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and an outlook account, say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<p>I get a meeting request from an ABC co-worker. Email is sent to me and upon accepting the invitation, I want it to be stored in my outlook.com calendar, not the local imap calendar.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? Unfortunately, I don't think Microsoft Office supports this, so I'm looking at 3rd party products that will do the sync for me, e.g., CompanionLink.</p>

            <p>Hello TheElohim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us. It appears that what you want to happen is when your&nbsp;work account that is set up in Outlook 2013 receives a meeting request and then you accept the invitation, you want the said event to be stored in the Outlook.com calendar
 of your Outlook.com account that is also configured in the mail client instead of the local calendar of your work account. Please be informed this is not possible since by design, the calendar events would only populate the calendar of the account where the
 calendar invites have been sent and accepted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can do is to set up your Outlook.com account to receive the same calendar invites as your work account so when you accept the request, you'd be able to see the same event in your Outlook.com calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have further questions, please let us know.</p>

<p>Neither Nokia nor a Nokia reseller will replace/exchange models, as far as I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A network operator (carrier) might give you a new/different model if/when you make or renew a contract with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, sell the old one and then buy a new one with the money you get (+ whatever extra you need). You may need to wait with the selling, if you don't have the difference yet, and need to save up for that.</p>

            Nokia does not offer any exchange of its devices as far as I know. All you can do is to sell your phone and add an extra amount to get yourself a new phone.

    <title>N79 Message flash light effect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rabsi---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N79 Message flash light effect</h2>
                    
<p>I have just upgraded from a Nokia 6300 to an N79, which on the whole I like.&nbsp; However, there is one feature that I miss terribly and that is the little blue flashing light that alerts me when I have received a text or missed a call.&nbsp; I cannot find anything
 like this on the N79 to either activate or to download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way to get this facility on an N79 please?</p>

<p>this should work to turn off/on the 'breathing' option<br />

Menu - Tools - Settings - General - Navi Wheel - Breathing<br />
<br />
and select off/on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>this would be your indicator on the n79 its called 'breathing'</p>

            Thanks, but the navi wheel "breathing" effect works all of the time when in sleep mode (and not really bright enough to notice when you have a protective cover on the phone).&nbsp; What I am looking for is the same sort of&nbsp;light effect that the 6300 has, i.e.
 it<strong> only</strong> flashes when there is a new unread message or missed call and stops when read.&nbsp; The 6300 had a very clever side lit flash.

            yes i realize that it is not exatcly what you might have been looking for, but this is the only way your n79 responds to missed calls and new messages, it speeds up the blinking and once you read the message or look at the missed calls it goes back to
 'normal' slower mode

<p>Well, on the N86, there are two options for the breathing light. - Standby br. light and Notification light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned off the "standby breathing light" and activated only the "notification light" i.e Missed Calls/Emails/SMS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that way, the breathing light doesn't blink on standby mode! May be its the same on the N79!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Office 365 keeps losing preferences</h2>
                    <p>Greetings all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the latest version of Office 365 and have an issue with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have things set up to keep the various "groups" collapsed so there is less clutter on my screen.&nbsp; It seems that periodically Outlook "forgets" the setting and opens all the groups back up, making me go back to "View, Expand/Collapse, and re-click Collapse
 All Groups".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in awhile I can understand this happening, but it seems to be a constant thing.&nbsp; It's been happening the entire time I've been using Office 365 which has been since 365 first came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Brian Prinner</p>

            <p><span>Hi Brian,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know what type of account you have configured in Outlook.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or an Exchange account).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Let us press Windows+r on the keyboard (simultaneously) the Run appears.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type outlook.exe /cleanviews (Leave a space after Outlook.exe)-&gt; Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: There is a space between Outlook and ‘/’. The above mentioned command restores Outlook to default view settings and all the custom views that you created will be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane (Leave a space after Outlook.exe) -&gt; Click OK.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, try repairing Office from the control panel and check.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also try opening Outlook in administrator mode, by right clicking on the Outlook icon and choose “Run as administrator.” And then try settings the preferences and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps you. Please let us know if you need additional information.</span></p>

<h2>            turning &#34;keep me logged on&#34; off</h2>
                    I asked how to do the above action - and got the log-on screen.&nbsp; I then entered my address and passed word leaving the "keep me logged on box" unchecked.&nbsp; This brought me to this point, where I'm entering this message.<br />
<br />
Have I turned off the permanent log-on or not?&nbsp; Will see if this is the case after sending this.&nbsp; If still logged on, will look forward to a message.<br />
<br />
(Why isn't there a way to do this under Settings options???)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">bh51</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. It's my pleasure helping you on how to get the complete message source of an email in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can still get the complete message header in Outlook.com. There are three ways to get the complete message header in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st step: In Outlook.com Inbox; without opening the email, right click the email and then select
<strong>View message source</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd step: Open the email and then right click in the email and select <strong>
View source</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd step: Open the email and then click the ellipsis (<strong>...</strong>) at the top and select
<strong>View message source</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have other concern or question, don't hesitate to inform us and we'll be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Calling Subscription giving &#39;high volume calls&#39; error message.</h2>
                    I pay for a skype call subscription where I can make&nbsp; unlimited phone calls via skype for $2.99 a month.&nbsp; The problem is I get an error message a lot more lately&nbsp; that says "this number has been associated with high volume calls".&nbsp; In many cases I had
 not call a particular number maybe over a week or more when I get this message and the call does not go thru.&nbsp; My play says it's for&nbsp; unlimited calling so I do not understand why i'm not able to call some people on my list? And why skype doesn't offer live
 support for paying customers.&nbsp; Is there a way to get live support?

            1. You should turn on your caller ID to solve this problem,

            Thats probably because you are using the modern Skype app, why you are not seeing the caller ID option. Try switching to the Classic version:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype. 
<br />
<br />    Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com</a>
<br />      Click on Downloads
<br />    Click on the dropdown from the blue button:
<br />
<br />    Click on Get classic Skype. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Sign in to your account.
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account</a>
<br />In the Manage features section, click Caller ID.
<br />Select your country from the drop-down list.
<br />Enter your mobile number in the text box and click Verify number.
<br />You will receive an SMS text message on your phone containing a confirmation code. Enter this code in the field displayed.
<br /> Click Verify.
<br />If you entered the code correctly, you will see a confirmation message, and your Caller ID will be activated in 24 hours.

<p>
</p><p>My OneDrive application says that all of my files are synced but I am missing a folder. When I log into SharePoint from a web browser, the folder is there. Can someone please help me troubleshoot this? I have tried to uninstall and re-install the app already.
 I have also paused the syncing and then resumed.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft account deleted, what happens to Office licenses tied to that account</h2>
                    <p>Since Office 2013 MS required Office activations to be tied to a Microsoft account.&nbsp; So we had to make MS accounts for our clients so we could activate office.&nbsp; That's all the MS account was used for, nothing else.&nbsp; Now when we try to sign back in the MS
 account we created for our client it's saying that the account has been deleted.&nbsp; Not by us but by Microsoft for inactivity.&nbsp; WTF!?&nbsp; We have Office licenses tied that account that you just deleted.&nbsp; You forced us to associate every install with an account
 and then delete the account on us.&nbsp; This has happened to us with at least 3 clients, and they've lost access to their licenses that they paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get these licenses back, how do I get access to the product keys?&nbsp; I need to reinstall Office but I can't because Microsoft deleted the account they forced us to create because we didn't use it for anything besides activating office licenses when
 needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where MS says they delete accounts for inactivity (Step 4)</p>

<h2>            The text fields on contact edits are too small</h2>
                    For example the phone number fiels is limited to 16 characters even though the actual field on the phone is bigger. &nbsp;The full information seems to be obtained from the phone and stored but it's truncated to 16 characters on the edit page. &nbsp;I haven't tested
 the limits on non-phone number fields, but the text boxes for edit should display and allow of the full length of the underlying data field.&nbsp;

            It sounds like a bug/design defect, but since the MyPhone team hasn't provided for a way to report bugs on Connect (that I am aware of), you should probably report this by adding to the suggestions thread:<br />

            A lot of double talk when you could only say "It only works on".............. and give the names.&nbsp; Or maybe let people know if it will be part of the new replacement.&nbsp; You talk tooo much and get no where.&nbsp; I don't work for Microsoft and I don't need to
 be totally educated in what you know.&nbsp; Simple answers would be better.

<h2>            Charged full price when trying to upgrade from Office personal to Office Home 365</h2>
                    <p>I have been an office 365 customer for a number of years and renewed my current subs in Jan this year.&nbsp; As I wanted to add a family member to the plan I selected an option to upgrade to Home 365 9£20 extra).&nbsp; I expected to pay an extra £20 only.&nbsp; However,
 they have now charged me the full price for the new annual 365 subscription.&nbsp; Therefore I have effectively paid for 2 subscriptions from now until January 2020.&nbsp; Is this correct?&nbsp; Can I get a partial refund on my unused personal 365 subscription?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option in my account is to cancel the new subscription and not my old personal one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>On the MS Office 365 FAQ page they say this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-office-for-home-and-school-faq#coreui-contentrichblock-olk1p8j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Switch-to-a-different-Office-365-for-home-subscription-3fcc1efc-2722-427f-8efa-db94b9b0a36b</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes, you will be credited for the amount of time you had remaining on your previous subscription. For example, let’s say that you have 6 months remaining on your current Office 365 Personal subscription and you pay for 12 months of Office 365 Home. In this
 case, you’ll have 18 months of time credited to your new Office 365 Home subscription.</p>
<p>Subscriptions can be extended up to a maximum of 5 years.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as I said, in your case, you should have 1 Office 365 Home subscription that Expires in Jan 2021.

<p>It is not a problem.&nbsp; There is no discounted "upgrade", so you are buying a full 1 year 365 Home subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to what I've read it is supposed to convert you from a Personal to Home subscription, AND to add 12 months to your remaining Personal subscription time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the account "Services &amp; Subscriptions" page: https://account.microsoft.com/services/
</p>
<p>This should show you exactly what Office subscriptions are current active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please log in to the myAccount site and check the new expiry date: <span>
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/</a></span></p>
<p>Sign in</p>
<p>Click on the Payment &amp; Billing tab to see your order history</p>
<p>The site should show that you have 1 365 Home subscription that ends Jan 2021.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please let us know what you actually see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have 2 subscriptions, instead of the extended single subscription then you should contact MS Support to fix the problem.

    <title>Enterprise Enrollment DNS Record - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enterprise Enrollment DNS Record</h2>
                    In doing a general health check on my hybrid environment, I noticed that the enterpriseenrollment record in my DNS provider is wrong. It points to manage.microsoft.com when it should point to enterpriseenrollment.manage.microsoft.com. I'm assuming this
 means I'm seeing some issues that I think of as normal behavior. What behavior will this DNS entry govern and what changes can I expect when I change it?

            Specifically what do you want to learn?<br />
<br />
Try any bookstore or computer training company.&nbsp; MS stopped providing user manuals early in the conversion to Windows.<br />
<br />
There are many books, but they usually focus on one specific Office app rather than the whole suite. Any book that covers "all of Office" will be very general. Look for a book in the "Dummies" series.<br />
<br />
There are also lots of online resources you can download and print.<br />
<br />
This site has a bunch of books for Word and Excel http://store.tips.net/C0894_WordTips_E-books.html<br />
