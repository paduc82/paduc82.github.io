<h2>            SD storage cards not getting detected error Code 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 SD storage issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought an Asus Transformer T100TA Tablet running Windows 8.1 and I am having issues with my MicroSD card slot.<br />
<br />
I have 2 MicroSD cards: an 8 GB Sandisk SDHC and a 64GB Sandisk Ultra SDXC.<br />
<br />
Both cards are only recognized after restarting the tablet. &nbsp;When recognized, transfer speed is unreliable and slow. &nbsp;After properly ejecting either card, neither card is recognized when inserted. &nbsp;Device manager shows a code 10 error in the SD Storage Class
 Controller that is created. &nbsp;The error reads 'The I/O device reported an I/O error'.<br />
<br />
I have tried the 'Hardware Troubleshooting' wizard and there are no driver updates for the SD Storage Class Controller. &nbsp;I have also ensured the Intel SD Host Controller driver is up-to-date and properly functioning.<br />
<br />
The ONLY way to force Windows to start the SD Storage Class Controller properly is to reinstall the Intel SD Host Controller driver. &nbsp;I do not feel this is the issue, however, because installing the generic 'SDA Standard Compliant SD Host Controller' driver
 instead presents the same slow speeds and SD Storage Class Controller issues.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</p>

<h2>            Visual Studio Community 2017 Java Tutorial</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do realise this is the wrong forum, but the right one doesn't appear to exist.&nbsp; Please feel free to move this question to the correct forum (any notify me) if there is one - I couldn't find a Visual Studio forum anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just downloaded this program and would like to start learning to program in it.&nbsp; There appears to be tutorials for C# and C++, but I'd like to learn to program for tablets and android.&nbsp; I can find Java programming tutorials and I can find Studio Tutorials
 for other languages, but not Java.&nbsp; I read that Java is the best language to learn for mobile devices, and would prefer to start with that language rather than restart my programming learning curve again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have did learn to program in Visual Basic for Access years ago, so I do understand object oriented programming, Intellisence etc at an amateur beginner level.&nbsp; I wrote an interactive database program, but I've probably forgotten a great deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I find a tutorial that meets my needs if there is one.&nbsp; If not, how do I go about learning Java for Visual Studio?&nbsp; Do I go through the tutorials for other languages just to learn how Visual Studio works, then do some non-microsoft Java programming
 tutorial?&nbsp; Or the other way around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, have I installed all the workloads I need?&nbsp; I have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Windows Platform Development</li><li>.Net Desktop Development</li><li>Desktop Development with C++</li><li>Mobile Development with JavaScript</li><li>Mobile Development with C++</li><li>Game Development with C++</li></ul>
<p>I'm a beginner, so do I need "Azure" or "Unity"to make simple programs?&nbsp; Would either of these help to have it for the learning process?&nbsp; What else do I need?&nbsp; Is Apache Cordova included in my install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I found this, <a href="https://www.codementor.io/robertpeterson0/cross-platform-app-with-visual-studio-du1084lyj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.codementor.io/robertpeterson0/cross-platform-app-with-visual-studio-du1084lyj</a> which mentioned Visual Studio Ionic Templates.&nbsp; The video is older than 2017.&nbsp; Should I get those?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find this type of basic information for beginners anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Windows could not complete the insallation after running recovery disc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows could not complete the insallation after running recovery disc from Acer Aspire all in one</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was wondering if someone could help me. Last weekend after a thunderstorm and 3-4 quick power on off, I restarted my computer and it was working fine.
</p>
<p>Later it went into a Windows continus windows reboot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I had an:&nbsp; &nbsp;Unmountable_Boot_Volume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have run some fixes and was no longer getting the message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had made some Recover Disk when I first got the computer, so after all other options from safe mode to last known good configuration I ran the Recovery disks, total of 3.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything seemed to be going fine until it tried to run windows install. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got these messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows could not configure Windows to run on this computers hardware. </li><li>Windows could not complete the installation.&nbsp; To install Windows on this computer, restart installation.</li></ol>
<p>I have an:</p>
<p>Acer Aspire Z3101-u4062</p>
<p>Windows Premium&nbsp; 64 Bit</p>
<p>21.5" Monitor Multi Media Touch</p>
<p>4Gb DDR3 Memory</p>
<p>Amd Anthlon&nbsp; II x2 240 e dual core processor</p>
<p>1 Tb- HD</p>
<p>HDD: P0-WDC&nbsp; WD10EAR</p>
<p>SATA &nbsp;Speed 3.0&nbsp; Gbps&nbsp;</p>
<p>NCQ: Supported</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have an istallation disk as it came preloaded.</p>
<p>I made back up installation disks when I made the Recovery disks, but as I found out now that the computer is down that my
</p>
<p>grand-kids that live with me got into them and they are ruined of course!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to finish the process of the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a disk with the Application Drivers but the setup never asked for it.
</p>
<p>I am not worried about the files on the computer or applications as I have&nbsp;these personal files backed up on Carbonite!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Help Please!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Lane</p>

<p><span>I have a Netrome Blackbox NS840.&nbsp; And I have recently realized they are out of business.&nbsp; My problem is I cannot see the live feed.&nbsp; I do not have the cameras on "hide" (an option in the setup screen).&nbsp; And they are recording
 so I can playback the live feed after a few seconds but when I go to the screen that has the live feed each box is black!&nbsp; I saw an answer on here from about a month ago talking about User Accounts on Vista and deleting it...but I have no idea how to do that.&nbsp;
 I'm not real computer savvy and need some basic instruction.&nbsp; Thank you so much!&nbsp; Linda<br />

<p><span>I&nbsp;have tried everything there is to try to resolve this problem and have come to a final conclusion that Netrome has gone out of business
 and has left us in the dark, by changing the downloaded files needed to run the Blackbox program&nbsp;so that they can't be used. This is disturbing because&nbsp;I still have a warranty on my product that will never be fulfilled. I feel that this was very underhand
 and deceiving without any regards to the consumer. I feel there is no need to look at Netrome for a solution, updates or anything else for that matter; they took that to the grave they crawled in. The only thing that can&nbsp;or need&nbsp;&nbsp;to be done at this point&nbsp;is
 a class action law suit against Netrome. This is simply my opinion.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Lindajoy618,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Were you able to view the live feed properly earlier?<br />

<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>Also if you want, you may check if you face the same issue in different user account or new administrator account.<span>&nbsp;</span>You may create a new user account on your

<p>I WAS able to see the live feed until about 3-4 months ago. And them it just went away.&nbsp; But like I said...it is still recording on all four cameras...I just cannot see the live feed!&nbsp; Thank you for your suggestions...I will try those and let you know.&nbsp;
 Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp; Others have said the same thing happened to them and possibly done on purpose by Netrome??&nbsp; I don;t know!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again...</p>

            I may have a solution for you.&nbsp; I had the same kind of problems when I upgraded the NS840 Security Blackbox Main Program from 2.0.0 to 3.0.1.&nbsp; From reading in other places I really don't think the 3.0.1 software works at all as far as being able to connect
 to your system remotely.&nbsp; Something about the engineers sabotaging the software before they went out of business.&nbsp; Luckily I still have the 2.0.0 software that I downloaded last year.&nbsp; So I uninstalled the 3.0.1 and installed the old 2.0.0 and guess what?&nbsp;
 It works as advertised!&nbsp; You'll need to download and unzip the program installation file here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/389704/ns840_2.0.0_setup.rar

<p>I'm also having the same problem viewing the cameras. The blackbox program recognizes the cameras &amp; can record video to the dvr but it will not show up on the screen, you just see a blank grey box.&nbsp; What is weird is you can view the camera recordings on
 the dvr by going into the "search &amp; record" screen.&nbsp; I tried everything on this page so far.&nbsp; I downloaded &amp; installed ver 2.0 &amp; it didn't work. Created another account w/ admin. privileges, no good.&nbsp; Updated to 3.0.14 n/g.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Ok, got it working!</strong></span></em>.&nbsp; I disabled user account controls for the ID &amp; rebooted, thats it. After 2 days of working on this...........</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This problem has plagued me for months, yet I can find no soulition. Playready update pops up stopping me from wathcing live tv in WMC. The only soulition I have found online is to del ehome folder, but I still have to do the live tv setup again, and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This behavior is unacceptable.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do not use these 'features' nor do I install them, so I fail to understand how a 'feature' I havent installed needs to 'update'?? This problem persists about every 1-2 days. I have missed things I wanted to watch because I have to setup my tuner again,
 and again.</p>

            <p>Hello James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is Playready showing under Programs and feature?</li><li>Did you make any recent changes on your computer?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PlayReady is a Digital Rights Management from Microsoft for portable devices. PlayReady can be ported to any kind of portable device, even if it uses non-Microsoft technology (OS, codecs, media player). PlayReady is backwards compatible with Windows Media
 DRM 10 content, meaning that content encrypted with WM DRM 10 (for instance, content for PlaysForSure devices) will play on a PlayReady terminal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft PlayReady technology is optimized for the mobile industry to support the growth of online content services, and includes features designed to make it easier than ever for consumers to enjoy mobile digital entertainment. This runtime allows PC based
 applications to access PlayReady content using the PlayReady.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the below mentioned methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to rename the <strong>Playready</strong> folder from the location mentioned below and test the issue:</p>
<p><strong>C:\ProgramData\MIcrosoft\Playready (</strong>Rename the<strong> Playready
</strong>folder to<strong> Playready.old)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persists try to update Playready based on the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">version/architecture of the Windows</a>
</span></strong>you are running.</p>
<p>

            Hi francois
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you are using a Microsoft Account to sign in, go to another computer and see if you can retrieve it.
<br />
<br />It might be stored in your Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Sign in <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices</a>
<br />
<br />Under your device, click 'Get Bitlocker Recovery Keys'
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />As an initial recommendation, we suggest that you disable the driver signature enforcement by following these steps:
<br />Click Start.
<br />
<br />Click the Power button.
<br />
<br />Hold the Shift key and click Restart.
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />Click Restart again.
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement. Your computer will now restart automatically.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists after disabling the driver signature verification, disable Secure Boot temporarily in your computer's UEFI/BIOS. You can contact your computer's manufacturer or check the device manual for the steps on how to do this.
<br />
<br />Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.‚ÄØ
<br />
<br />If you can't find the toggle to disable Secure Boot, a firmware update for the UEFI/BIOS may be required. This can usually be found in the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />After disabling Secure Boot, boot normally into Windows and check if you can install the programs. If you're successful, boot back into the UEFI/BIOS and re-enable Secure Boot since this is an important security feature.

<h2>            My computer suddenly won&#39;t hibernate</h2>
                    I have an old computer. Intel D845WN with a 2.6GHz Pentium 4 and 1.25GB of RAM. I had 2GB of RAM, but the 1GB chip failed, and I had only a 256 to replace it with. I'm running Windows 7 Pro 32-bit. I had no trouble hibernating until yesterday, when my
 screen started to go dark for a moment and then come back. I searched the Web and these forums, but there are no solutions. I see that a great many people are having this problem. I turned off everything that could wake my computer up, both in Power Options
 and Device Manager. No drivers changed recently. Any ideas anyone?

<h2>            Mouse won&#39;t move when typing or using keyboard</h2>
                    <p>So I am playing a game on this brand new HP Laptop I just got, and a nice one too. But I notice that, when I try and move my mouse when inputting commands via keyboard or typing the mouse is in a frozen position and cannot move. I have seen numerous "fixes"
 to this issue but even when turning off this setting it is still frozen while typing and has a short 1 second delay after typing. This is a very annoying issue that I would like to fix(current settings)</p>

            Hi Trey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello stevenmcmonagle,</p>
<p>You might try compatibility mode:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under
<span>Programs</span>, click<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If that doesn't work then you might want to consider Virtualization software:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</span></a>)
 and execute your software in Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>This keeps bothering me, a lot. Why remove an advanced feature that is useful and nearly all "savvy" Windows users relied upon? The status bar had to manually be turned on so this whole efford of visual simplification is moot point.<br />

I want my basic feature back!</p>

    <title>Solution to slow Windows at last - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cviclark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solution to slow Windows at last</h2>
                    <p>For years I have been watching the thread "Why is Windows so Slow".&nbsp; I have tried all the recommendations other than a complete reload of all programmes.&nbsp; My PC is a Lenovo Edge E520 which started life on Win 7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Performance was so bad that I ended up buying
 an Android Tab for all but my old Legacy programmes some of which keep record back over 20 years.&nbsp; MS Office and Money, Adobe Photoshop, Acrinos, all were expensive essentials and took time to learn.&nbsp; Some are no longer available, many do the job better than
 any APP.&nbsp; I still do not use any, cloud services and back up monthly. Old habits die hard and I past new tricks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;At last things are now working well.</p>
<p>My PC is running WIN10 and is fast and stable.&nbsp; It still takes a couple of mins to boot up from cold but once up it is like a new PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magic bullet?&nbsp; An EVO 860 mSATA 500GB SSD (was already at the max 8GB RAM).</p>
<p>As it fitted into the empty slot in my E520 installation could not have been easier. All the software Downloads, Magic and Migration worked without a hitch. Quick trip to BIOS to change the boot order and it is like a new machine (better than the original).</p>
<p>I am aware that it should boot faster, but I have cleared out the startup, checked the BIOS, cleared out all the junk, stopped (and started) fast boot but it still takes about 1min 10secs. That's fine as once loaded it is stable and quick for the first time
 in years. Even better now the old mechanical drive is removed Battery life is over 6 hours.&nbsp; This is at a cost that is at a fraction of a new PC .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Locked User Profile in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, my wife's computer was installing a Windows update and then it had some problem. It was that her user profile was locked. I eventually set up a new profile but all of her personal info is gone, photoshop, itunes, windows mail folders, you name it she
 is with nothing. I have seen many articles on how to copy over from a corrupted profile - i can see many of the lost data files - but the files are locked and I can't actually copy them even though I am logged in as the administrator which seems strange. I
 bought my Windows 7 when I visited Canada last summer but Microsoft tells me they cannot validate my string for some reason? If anbody has a suggestion it would be appreciated. Thanks,

<h2>            Showing incorrect Date and Time settings in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Date and Time settings</p>
<p>Using a Surface Pro 3 running Win 10 that is up to date according to update in Settings. Time is set to Set time automatically, set time zone automatically and adjust for daylight savings time automatically. In the grayed time zone selection box, the zone
 is Eastern (US and Canada) - UTC - 5:00, which is where I am. The time is always 1 hour earlier than the current time (that is, with EST at 8 am, the computer now reports that it is 7 am). This is a very recent problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unselect automatically set time zone and manually select US and Canada Eastern - and the time remains 1 hour early. The only way I can get the time set properly is to unselect all of the automatic choices and manually set the time. So the work around is
 OK. But what is going on? Has Microsoft set its Eastern time adjustment improperly? It reports the correct UTC offset (5 hours) but seems to be offsetting by 6 hours. It isn't the automatic DST setting - that would make the time one more hour earlier than
 it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to get a correct time reported if I deselect all of the auto settings and manually set the time. If I then return time settings to auto everything, and the systems preserves the correct time until sleep or restart. On wake or restart, the time
 returns to 1 hour earlier than it should be.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 for VM</h2>
                    <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in a bit of a pickle...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the rundown: I have VirtualBox and I want to do stuff with it using Win7, but it's a pain in the behind (you do not want the un-edited version of this) to figure out, considering since the older Windows is no longer supported, but their ISO's are
 still available by fellow users, for fellow users to emulate, of course, with a VM (Virtual Machine), but I want to emulate Win7 PRO (Considering my moms computer has Win 7 PRO), 8(.1), and 10 (whichever version floats your
<del>goat</del>&nbsp;boat)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? Unique situation? Suck it up? What say you?</p>

 2000, 3.1, etc. I am already able to Emulate WinXP (Thank you!) If you require more specifics, feel free to let me know! :)

            You can't use the product key if it's in use (if it's a retail key) and you can't use it at all if it's an OEM key.&nbsp; What you are trying to do is not emulation, btw.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to uninstall WDDM1.3 for the sake of updated AMD Catalyst drivers&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there<br />
<br />
Sorry for my english.<br />
<br />
My PC specs: Asrock motherboard, Intel Core i5 processor, AMD Radeon R9 270 graphics card, Windows 8.1 64-bit with all the updates. This is a standard PC, not a laptop etc.<br />
<br />
When I bought my graphics card (the first quater of 2014), I've installed Windows 8.1 and Catalyst Software Suite (AMD graphics card drivers). But soon after, a Windows Update appeared:<br />
<br />
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.3 - AMD Radeon R9 200 Series.<br />
<br />
So I installed it.<br />
<br />
Now I want to update the drivers to the new Catalyst 14.12 Omega, but I don't know how to do it.<br />
<br />
Until recently, my typical routine for graphics card driver update, was:<br />
- uninstall all AMD products via "AMD Catalyst Install Manager"<br />
- restart Windows<br />
- go to the "safe mode"<br />
- remove remnants using Driver Sweaper or similiar software<br />
- restart Windows<br />
- install fresh drivers<br />
And it always works.<br />
<br />
And now, since I don't have the Catalyst Software Suite, but instead the AMD Graphics Adapter WDDM1.3, I don't see any option to remove graphics card drivers.<br />
<br />
Please, help me.

</p><p>Just download it and run it... all that stuff you describe normally is not necessary...</p>
<p>It will extract to a AMD folder on your C:\ drive and install from there....</p>
<p>The installer will overwrite or remove anything that's no longer needed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to uninstall the old stuff first, you probably need to "View Installed Updates" since that is what it sounds like you installed... Then uninstall it from there....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option would be to go to the device in Device Manager and select Uninstall... When asked if you want to remove related files or whatever, select yes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... my experience is that it is best to update your Intel Graphics <strong>
before</strong> updating the AMD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't mention which version of i5 you have, but it has it's own Graphics Processor as well...</p>
<p>Even if you're not using it..&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a HD4000.. HD4600, or maybe HD3000. Just as examples.</p>

<h2>            Access to character map has gone away and I can&#39;t find it&#33;  Anywhere&#33;</h2>
                    I use character map quite a bit and suddenly it disappeared. I used to access it by calling up the start menu (press control + escape) but now it's gone. Tried search, no luck. How can I get it back.<br />
Thanks in advance, Jim A., Tucson, AZ<br />

Except I'm betting that c, –∑, and —å aren't the characters you had in mind, but rather √± (ALT+0241), √ß (ALT+0231), and √º (ALT+0252)<br />

            Ken: Thanks, at least I can find it. But now how do I get the icon on my start bar. Or at least on the desktop.&nbsp; Thanks, Jim A., Tucson, AZ<br />
p.s. I'll give your AllChars a go. Old dogs can learn new tricks. J.<br />

            In that Run dialog (Winkey + R or Start &gt; Run) type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\System32\<br />
<br />
Then scroll down the list until you get to charmap.exe, right-click and choose "Send to &gt; Desktop (create Shortcut)"<br />
<br />
You can either leave the shortcut that will appear on your desktop where it is or drag it into the Quick Start bar (after you right-click on the Task Bar and "unlock" it).<br />
