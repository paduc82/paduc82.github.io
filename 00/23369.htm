    <title>Bug in MS Word Equations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug in MS Word Equations</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'd like to just report this bug to MS, but I don't see any mechanism to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens in both Office 2010 and 2013. &nbsp; I'm using XITS Math as my default math font. &nbsp;(it has much better coverage of characters I use compared with Cambria Math, and more recognizable shapes for characters like \scriptE and \scriptF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start a new equation with alt+= and type 'exp space', it recognizes an exponential function and creates an insertion box, all in XITS Math font. Now if I move the cursor to the right of the insertion box, the font there is set to Cambria Math. &nbsp;This
 leads to me inadvertently having a jumbled mess of Cambria Math and XITS Math in my equations.</p>

            The built-in equation editor of Word 2007 and later only supports Cambria Math, as far as I know. If you use the old equation editor (Insert tab | Object | Microsoft Equation 3.0), you can customize the font, though.

            <p>Well, Word 2007 and later certainly supports other fonts to the extent that you can select another math-enabled font (if you have one installed on your system), use it in an equation, and select it as the default font for new equations.</p>

    <title>Autocorrect Breaks AutoExpand in Combo Box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter_moore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autocorrect Breaks AutoExpand in Combo Box</h2>
                    <p>Opening a discussion to report a bug with Access 2010.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If autocorrect engages during autoexpansion of a combo box on a form, the autoexpansion is disengaged on a control that is text based.&nbsp; In other words, as one is typing values that are in the list, the text following the cursor remains selected, whereas
 the text previous to the cursor is not.&nbsp; The issue is that if an autocorrection takes place as one is typing, the cursor remains in the same place, but the following text becomes deselected, thus losing the autoexpansion of the control.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Simple to reproduce:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.)&nbsp; File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing &gt; AutoCorrect Options &gt; Enable "Correct TWo INitial CApitals.<br />
</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp; Create a table with a single text field.<br />
</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp; Fill the table with the following data (NOTE the double capital letters in the first record!!!):<br />
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This fails the TEst.</span><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Good test (can be autoexpanded)</span><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This follows the failed test (can't be autoexpanded to)</span><br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Good boy (can be autoexpanded)</span><br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>3.)&nbsp; Create a form with a combo box with a data source of the table.<br />
</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp; Press the letter "t" to produce the behavior.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm sure someone will argue that this functions as designed, but in my case, the combo box has "Limit To List" set to Yes.&nbsp; Thus, in my opinion, autocorrection should not be engaging.&nbsp; At the very least, there could be a property to override autocorrection.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it was very difficult to identify what the problem was.&nbsp; In my case, the text strings all start with 1 or 2 digits, then followed by a description.&nbsp; I've been having this problem for 3 weeks now, and only just today noticed
 one of my capital letters was being changed to lowercase.&nbsp; Originally, I thought it had to do with my 3 &amp; 7 keys!&nbsp; It just so happens that both of those selections contain double capital letters (intentionally).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Buying a new nokia mobile phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goblinsly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buying a new nokia mobile phone</h2>
                    Hey everyone !<br />
<br />
Currently i own Nokia 6151. Even if its a cheap phone, i am very happy with it. But i think its time to move on. And i need help with it.<br />
<br />
In my job, i have a lot of free time. Soo i can play games on mobile phone or watch movies and stuff. This means i need a phone with enough memory and option of upgrading it, big screen with enough resolution and colour number, and maybe support for symbian.
 Also its good if its speaker is loud, soo i can listen to music when i am outside ( and music is actualy heard, on nokia 6151, if we talk, we wont hear music at all ). Good batery is good in most mobile phones, soo it allows me lots of hours watching movies.<br />
<br />
My price range is 50‚Ç¨. Dont get me wrong, for 50‚Ç¨ i get phone that normaly costs 250‚Ç¨. This is because my mobile operator, SiMobil allows their users to buy it cheaper ( but you have to use their services for 24 months after you buy the phone, or you have to
 pay the full price of the phone ).<br />
<br />
In that price range i found the following phones:<br />
<br />
- Nokia E50 with camera<br />
- Nokia 5310<br />
- Nokia 6120<br />
- Nokia 6234 live!<br />
- Nokia 6300<br />
<br />
I checked them on page and i think 6120 is the best of them for my needs. It has 16 million colours, 2 inch screen, 320x240 resolution, 30mb memory ( up to 2gb ), good batery ( up to 9 days ), its small enough yet has big screen, etc.<br />
<br />
There are more phones of other brand, but i decided i want to have Nokia, because i simply love my 6151. You can check the full list of Nokia phones on the following link.
<br />
<br />
I hope you can make my decision a little easier. 50E is the limit btw, no more.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help,<br />

            6120c is a good choice. It's the cheapest HSDPA phone from Nokia. On the other side, 6300 is also very popular and has bigger screen. If you like playing game, I think you should consider N81, N-Gage Phone! But I don't know the price with your operator..

            Cheapest i can get it is 400‚Ç¨, no operator includes it in his cheaper sales.<br />
<br />
I did compare 6120 and 6300. 6300 has better batery and more colours ( difference between 16m and 16.7m is nothing though ).<br />
<br />
To continue, 6120 has flash for camera, which might be usefull ( many the times there was dark and something interested i wanted to take picture of and i didnt have flash ), better video resolution ( great for taking videos outside ), louder speaker...<br />
<br />
I dont know, soo far i am almoast certain i want 6120.

            The 6120 classic is much better at playing video than the 6300.<br />
<br />
It may be worth waiting to see if your operator decides to sell the 5320, it's likely to be quite a low cost smartphone.<br />

            What about 5310 xpressmusic ? Does it support symbian ? This phone looks much better then 6120 and i can get it for 40‚Ç¨. But as i can see it doesnt has support for symbian. If that is soo, i have decided. I will go get my 6120 tomorrow ! Until then you
 have time to change my mind :)

            No the 5310 is just a standard series 40 phone, slightly better than the 6300. It's still not great for video.

            6151 is louder then 6120 ??<br />
<br />
I bought some good phones for 20‚Ç¨. But listening to mp3 songs is still not loud and quality of sound is bad. Seems like i cant replace my Sansa 40‚Ç¨ mp3 player with this mobile phone.<br />
<br />
Is there anything i can do to increase volume and quality of sound apart from using 160kbs+ songs, puting volume of player to max and playing with equalizer ( which doesnt improve volume much to be honest ). Maybe some better player ? Or is audio simply soo
 bad at this phone, even with phones ( i thought just the speaker was bad, didnt know its the same even if you use phones ).

                    <p>I would first like to apologize for being illiterate in anything but Microsoft Word and I have tried everything I have found online and seemly still to stupid to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 290 clients with appointments ranging from every 2 weeks to every 11 weeks.&nbsp; So I need to find an easier way than&nbsp;counting out on a&nbsp;calendar week by week when the next appointment falls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if someone has an appointment on June 30th I need to count out every&nbsp;3 weeks until December 24th.&nbsp; Can someone give me idiot directions for that or point me in the correct direction.&nbsp; Doing it my way takes about 3 days.&nbsp; Thank you</p>

<h2>            Design View Unavailable</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have been using a union query and cross tab query to organize some data.&nbsp; It seems that when I originate a query with an inner join in SQL, I am unable to switch to Design View in Access 2010.&nbsp; The reason why I would like to open Design View is so that I
 can make a table.&nbsp; My over arching question is can a table be made from a query when Design View is not available?<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read and respond to this question.<br />

            Create a make table query in design view and then view the SQL so you understand how to convert the SQL view of your query into a make table query. You can't do this with a crosstab without creating and saving the crosstab and then using it as the source
 for a make table query.

            <p>Yes, but it is rarely advisable. Queries are essentially a virtual table. Why make it concrete?</p>

The answer to your question is that as an Access newbie I have been unable to (1) change/edit field titles in a query and (2) unable to export a query from one file to another in Access.&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to the latter, I always get an error message indicating
 that Access can't find the exported item.<br />

                    Hello! May be someone know keyboard shortcut to switch between word documents in Macbook? At my work i always need about 5 open word documents and it takes time to go to word menu for choosing doc which I need.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, in Windows I always use ALT+Tab to switch between all windows including Word docs. In Mac I use Command+Tab to switch between different programs but it doesn't work for Word or Excel docs.</div>

<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            The standard Mac shortcut for switching between open windows of an application is CMD-` (accent grave - on a standard US keyboard it's the key above Tab that contains a [shifted] tilde, ~)

<h2>            Blu Win HD LTE does not detect UIM 2 SIM 2 when JIO sim is inserted in SIM slot 1, and APN set to JIONET</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my Blu Win HD LTE to Windows 10 OS Build 10.0.14393.576.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I power on the device with a Jio 4G Sim inserted in SIM slot 1, and another Cellular Service Provider's 4G SIM in slot 2, the Jio sim registers on the Jio network, but not the other provider's SIM, i.e. a message pops saying UIM could not be detected,
 and says modify some "Global" settings in Network Settings... I don't see any such settings on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything........ switching SIMS, switching data roaming options, switching automatic network search to manual and then selecting the CSP manually in the list, but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manually set the APN to jionet and set it to be the default connection for data, i.e. only SIM 1 would be used for data connection, and when I did that, that is precisely when the Global setting need to be changed message pops up, except I do not see
 anything called Global settings on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This peculiar behavior only happens when Jio sim is inserted, any other sim works perfectly well on 1G, 2G,3G and 4G, so I know my phone's network&nbsp; module is not at hardware fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know that 4G coverage is available for my SIM 2 provider perfectly well at all times as I've tested the SIM 2 several times both in the same phone and in other phones with full strength available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Jio's VoLTE app is not available for Windows Phones 10, I rely on the data connection to stay current, but no voice service is available on that chip, as there is no VoLTE&nbsp;app yet available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone&nbsp;is kind enough to&nbsp;research&nbsp;a solution my windows &nbsp;phone will be eternally grateful! ;)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Ian Sal...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did not own a Jio SIM prior to the Windows 10 update but I did have two AirTel UIM 4G SIMS that were in SIM slot 1 and 2, and they worked perfectly fine, never interfering with one another on my Blu Win HD LTE x150e with the original firmware and Windows
 8.1 GDR Update 2.</p>
<p>I don't want to downgrade back to Windows 8.1 using WDRT, so if a solution is possible within Windows 10, it'd be most welcome.</p>

<h2>            email logon to ISP intermittent</h2>
                    Just got the Touch and set up my email with my provider (Telus).&nbsp; It automatically found the settings, albeit incorrectly (POP vs my IMAP).&nbsp; Nevertheless, it downloaded my emails for about an hour.&nbsp; Then it inexplicably stopped doing so...each time requiring
 that I confirm my ID and password, which it then continued to not accept.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, it worked again.&nbsp; And then stopped.&nbsp; This morning it worked once after I turned on my phone, but has since stopped.&nbsp; Rebooting phone does not help.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

<p>this does indicate that probably your e-mail account is intermitted down....otherwise it wouldn't ask for your password again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try a soft reset too</p>
<p>or a hard reset (bring the device back in the original manufacturer state)</p>

Thanks for the info. Yes, the History indicates it's Trojan:JS/Medfos.B.&nbsp; So will one of those scanners get rid of it, or are those just more scanning tools?&nbsp; Sounds like the Eset Online Scanner might be the easiest? As far as not having to use flash drives
 and all that, anyway. Please let me know what the simplest and most effective way to get rid of the virus might be. Thanks again for your time...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p>its bad enough I literally don't download a lot of stuff and depend on my pc since I'm on oxygen...I got a huge pop up that showed four virus's, one was a Trojan and I panicked as this is a new pc and the only one I have....cost me 59.99 to have them clean
 my pc........then I learned it was a scam so I called my credit card company, they zero'd out what I paid and I'll be dogged if they didn't hammer me again.....I think I have most removed but I do think they have a file in my registry or hard drive......any
 body know what I'm to look for so I can delete these guys? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After having a pc for so long I feel like a total idiot......and I heard that....I don't need more , I'm self abusing myself as I type LOL.......</p>

            Hi!
<div><br />
<div>Maybe i can help you out on this one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way, what is your computer's operating system? Here's a simple thing that you can do to remove that program bugging your computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Just download Hitman Pro on the compromised computer. Here's the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro/</a></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Just run that program and follow the instructions. There will come a time that you have to enter your email address for the activation but you have nothing to worry about that.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate with the issue, please let us know.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you trying to rollback to the previous operating system?</li></ol>
<p>In Windows 10 Technical Preview most recovery options will not revert to their previous version of
<br />
Windows. You will need to perform a clean install of their previous version of Windows from recovery or installation media that came with their PC, or from a USB recovery drive that they would need to have created prior to installing Windows 10 Technical Preview.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance, we'll be glad to help you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I see that the domain used to send the email is&nbsp;"@segwaymaui.com", therefore, it is a custom domain.&nbsp;If yes, then I would recommend you to contact your ISP and check if they&nbsp;can help you with the issue.&nbsp;Your emails are being&nbsp;considered as Spam therefore
 being rejected by Outlook.com server. In this case, your ISP can&nbsp;provide you better assistance regarding&nbsp;the issue.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Change a cell&#39;s fill color based on a non-numeric character within numeric string.</h2>
                    Most cells in a column have numeric characters and there fill color changes based on certain ranges. However, some cells may have 1 dash withinh the numeric string and this fill color needs to change when that condition occurs. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, this
 rules out the conditional formatting option which tests only for numeric values. Does anyone have a&nbsp;solution?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional formatting can colour cells with - appearing.&nbsp; Select the first cell (say cell B2) and go to Format &gt; Conditional Formatting.&nbsp; Click on Formula Is and in the formula box there, enter this formula</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=ISNUMBER(SEARCH("-",B2))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on Format and select any colour.&nbsp; Click on OK.&nbsp; Now copy this cell, select the range of data and&nbsp;press Alt+E+S+T (Edit &gt; Paste Special &gt; Formats)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi epenn,
<br />You would need to either use a macro or a 3rd party utility to BCC addresses.    Do you want to BCC every message to the same address? 
<br />
<br />I have a macro sample at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/code-samples/mark-mail-merge-messages-as-urgent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/code-sample...</a>  that can add fields, attachments etc to merged messages.

<h2>            Is there a limit on the number of texts that it will sync up&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Treo 800w (sprint) now I have read where some people have stated they are not able to save texts @ all on this phone but mine actually did sync but it only did 25.. In my inbox on my phone there's 77 and the sent folder has over 5k drafts had
 1. On the Myphone site it's showing a total of 25. <br />
I tried to deselect all of the other options and resync it and the only thing it did was update the deletion of the file from the drafts folder (which I deleted on the website).<br />
<br />
Is there a limit on how many texts will download? <br />
Should I just be happy for the 25 that did dld since some people with Treo800w's aren't able to sync any?
<br />
Or is there something else I need to do to get the rest of them to sync on the site?

<h2>            Outlook 2010 email folder converted to Shared Calendar</h2>
                    Has anyone ever seen an email folder in Outlook converted to a shared calendar? &nbsp;I have a user who was missing an email folder, and after conducting Advanced Search to locate the folder path, we discovered that the folder had somehow been converted to
 a shared calendar folder and was on her calendar. &nbsp; Any idea what might have happened? &nbsp;Thanks.

            <p>Yes, I have tried another browser too, can't remember it's name but had an orange squirrel. Ah, it was the UC browser!</p>
<p>And yes I have also tried the YouTube app, but none of the above worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, It's been around 60 days since my problem got fixed by itself and is still fixed. Meaning, I can view youtube videos from IE (default app).</p>
<p>But, I do take some precautionary steps in order to prevent this from happening again:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I delete my browser's history/cookies at least once per 3 days.</li><li>I never search a YouTube video via a search engine (like google/yahoo etc)</li><li>Instead I always search videos directly from m.youtube.com</li></ul>
<p>And I am problem free. Almost.</p>
<p>Twice I got a problem again, I was tapping to view a video and got no response.</p>
<p>The only way I found to fix this was to simply reboot my mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for replying here.</p>
<p>I realise you must be pretty busy. Keep up the good work &amp; more importantly be well man.</p>

<h2>            PC Sync - Notes to Phone works ok for a period then stops syncing</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Interested to see if anyone else is experiencing this problem.<br />
<br />
Windows XP machines with SP2<br />
Lotus Notes calendar sychronisation from Notes to Phone only.<br />
PC Suite version 6.4 (I know this is not the latest version)<br />
IR connection on Laptops<br />
<br />
Setup sync between Notes and phone for calendar entries only. This works without a problem for a period of time, however I have a few users who have reported the same problem.<br />
After a while, the phone stops syncing entries from the Notes Calendar. The sync process continues to work without error but no entries are updated to the phone. This happens with various models of phones too.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experienced this problem before? Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Mark

            Try updating to PC Suite 6.81.13, which is available from <a href="http://www.nokia.com/pcsuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PC Suite web pages </a>. At least I haven't have any problems in Notes synchronization with Outlook.<br />
<br />
Note, that Series 40 phones usually support only limited amount of Notes in the phone, for example 30 Notes. If you have lots of Notes in Outlook, all will not fit to phone. Then you should use S60 phones, which have support for larger amount of Notes.

                    <p>My "Main Identity" and the others that are dated 2011 and 2014s (even the time machine) backups apparently stopped keeping data from Oct 2014. This morning 1/29/16 when I opened Outlook 2011. The identities box came up (weird) and I choose "main" all my
 important emails for 2015 and 2016 are gone now, only Oct 2014 are there. I've been on the phone with the most incompetent Microsoft techs and people for over 5 hours. They cant transfer me to a supervisor or wont.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've re selected many identities&nbsp; but they are all not the current one.&nbsp; My emails are POP and I clear them off my server so they are gone.

            I discovered a similar problem this morning after I'd updated to El Capitan 10.11.3.&nbsp; None of the Outlook identities work and no accounts are stored and none of my folders appear.&nbsp; I have been in contact with an MS Answer Tech and, although MS seem to
 know how to resolve the problem, they want me to sign up to a service agreement, which will last 30 days.&nbsp; Otherwise, they won't fix it.&nbsp; I think this is outrageous.&nbsp; I don't think I've got any choice but to pay the money, as I need my folders to be visible,
 but when I do have them back, I will copy the contents elsewhere, as this is the second major problem I've had with Office (Outlook) for Mac 2011.&nbsp;

            <p>I spent 5 hours cycling around with Microsoft and enraged and determined I finally got remote assist with a supervisor to find out what I already knew. My data from the past year and a half was destroyed and gone, and the backups from Time machine only had
 from 2104.&nbsp; The backups never copied any new data from Oct 12th 2014 on.</p>
<p>Its a big loss this last years of data that I needed badly and I will always now copy important emails off outlook for now on. I never use the calendar either from Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech created a New Identity and deleted all the corrupt ones. He did get the folders and contacts moved over of what I had from Oct 12th 2014 and we set up my email accounts. Its working but who knows if the data is keeping current. I will back up with
 time machine the new identity as normal and he told me to delete the backs up of the identity every few months in Outlooks Identities. When you open Outlook on a Mac&nbsp; hold alt/option key to get the identities window. Choose the identity and it will create
 a backup but I find this odd to have to do that.</p>
<p>I was going to get Outlook 2016 with office suite but reading about the horrors going on with El Capitan and the supervisor tech telling me its not working and has extreme issues stopped me from upgrading.</p>
<p>Oh and I did not have to pay a penny for this help but 5 hours to get it!!!</p>

            Also this is an Apple issue El Capitan 10.11.3 delivered&nbsp; a poison pill to Outlook 2011. I didn't think to call them as well and they should also be notified.

            This is a follow-up to my previous mail.&nbsp; I was fortunate in locating the problem myself, with the help of some information online.&nbsp; Basically, when I was invited to choose an identity (this is the first time I'd ever seen that option - and only after
 upgrading El Capitan) I didn't select them properly.&nbsp; I'd simply double-clicked on an identity and the program rebuilt the database.&nbsp; When booted Outlook there was no data or accounts set-up.&nbsp; I tried the same with other identities but again, no luck.&nbsp; Looking
 online, I read that you have to highlight an identity and then set it to Default.&nbsp; With that done, the identity will be used.&nbsp; I then tried all the identities shown and one of them worked, with all my folders and accounts in place as before.&nbsp; That was obviously
 a relief, but I was not impressed with the Microsoft Answer Tech, as this should have been a simple and two-minute fix for him but, although he had taken remote control of my Mac, he wouldn't actually do anything unless I paid at least ¬£65 for support.&nbsp; I'm
 glad I managed to do it myself, but really not happy with Microsoft.&nbsp; As this is the second time I had a 'serious' problem with Outlook, I will investigate using either Apple Mail or web-based email systems.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Steve; So you have to backup those identities within Outlook. So with outlook closed (im sure you know by now)&nbsp; hold the opt/alt key launch Outlook&nbsp; and you will see the identities The supervisor tech told me to rebuild to create a copy of the current
 identity monthly and back that up with whatever back up you do. Yes selecting&nbsp; the main or default Identity and delete or remove some of the older backups. Which is absurd to have to do this now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another issue when I launched outlook this morning so Im outlining all of it again here for others to and so Microsoft gets their sh*t together...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac OS X El Capitan Ver. 10.11.3 Its worse now, the current patch in Outlook 2011 14.6.0 has destroyed my identity. I have 14.6.0 and lost all my emails from Oct 2014 today Jan 29th, 2016 without warning, I backup however my identity on Outlook-2011 was
 not updating from Oct 12th 2014 so all the backups were not current. I lost major valuable emails, contacts and legal ease. I was on the phone with Microsofts complete cycle of circle jerks from 11am to 5pm until finally after all these transfers I got ONE
 supervisor who connected to my computer and attempted to find out whats going on. (I already knew because I went though all the steps already on my own) All he did in the end is create a new Identity and delete the old ones. This morning 1/31/2016 I opened
 Outlook 2011 to empty folders again. The identity jumped to one the tech created but was now blank. I had saved my newer identity so that one was there. The identities are deleting themselves. There is fatal errors here that must be repaired. This is utterly
 unacceptable. Oh and the tech supervisor form Microsoft talked me out of buying Office Outlook 2016 because of all the problems they are dealing with that are as of now still unresolved. Microsoft worst customer service ever....</p>

            <p>Hi Darin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that you have experienced more problems than I.&nbsp; I am also running El Capitan V10.11.3 and Outlook V14.6.0, and now that I've managed to get my old identity back, all seems to be working as it was before I updated El Capitan to the version I now
 have.&nbsp; I fear that problems with Office - and especially Outlook - could get worse when Microsoft stop supporting Office for Mac 2011, so I may resort to Apple Mail.&nbsp; I may also look into using a webmail service.&nbsp; I am with Virgin Media and they have their
 own webmail service which seems to be okay.&nbsp; My problem with either of these two options is that I won't simply be able to copy and paste my Outlook folders and their email contents into folders created in either Mail or a web version.&nbsp; It will thus mean starting
 again, which I would rather not do but feel there's no option if Outlook is flaky.&nbsp; I can't risk losing all the data in my Outlook folders.&nbsp; Fortunately, I haven't lost anything so far, but don't feel too confident about the future.&nbsp;

                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am doing some word automation, is there a way to capture the event when a user tries to delete custom properties in Word 2003.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            Jack, as Doug Robbins said in the first reply to this thread, document <b>variables
</b>can be set, modified, or deleted only through VBA. That's one of the advantages they have over document
<b>properties</b>: users can't mess with them. But it also says that you can't use the properties window to do anything to document variables.<br />
<br />
If you want users to be able to change the values of document variables but not be able to delete them, you must provide a VBA-driven dialog (a
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/create_employ_userform.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">userform</a>) that can accept the new value and verify that it isn't blank before it sets the value in the file. (Setting the value of a document variable to the empty string deletes
 that variable from the file.)<br />
<br />
To answer the other part of your question, you can't assign an object to a document variable. The value of a document variable must be a string. If you assign a number, that number will be implicitly converted to a string by VBA.<br />
<br />
In your example, what you would have to do is<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Variables("Greenland").Value = "100"<br />
<br />
or, equivalently,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Variables("Greenland").Value = 100<br />
<br />
If the object you have in mind has other properties besides a name and a (string) value, you would have to create a separate document variable for each one, like<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Variables("Greenland_Area").Value = "2166086"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Variables("Greenland_Population").Value = "56370"<br />
<br />
This becomes manageable if you keep a convention about how the variables are named, for example<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim country As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country = "Greenland"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Fields.Add Selection.Range, wdFieldDocVariable, country &amp; "_Population"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country = "Iceland"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Fields.Add Selection.Range, wdFieldDocVariable, country &amp; "_Population"<br />
<br />

    <title>Attachment drop down in data type field in Access table design - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameslaliberte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attachment drop down in data type field in Access table design</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a few discussion threads involving people with the identical issue, but still do not understand how to resolve it. I am an amateur database builder at best. I have created an access database to manage my rental properties and want to add a attachment
 field to my expense table so that I may attach pdf scans of receipts to my record. The "attachment" field is not a choice in the data type drop down when modifying the table in design view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that saving the database as an ACCDB will resolve this issue. But I thought this was the default database type for Access 2013, and have attempted to "save as" to change to this database type but it is not an option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer a solution to an lower level access user? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Most serious developers would NOT use an Attachment for such images. An Access database is strictly limited to 2GByte (2048 MByte) in size, and it doesn't take too many megabyte and larger PDF files to exceed this limit; and when you exceed it, your database
 is toasted and may not be recoverable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just store the PDF files in a dedicated directory, as external files, and store the path and filename in a field (or two fields, for path and for filename) in your table.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Did not know of the database size limitation and I had not given much thought to attachment file sizes. Not sure I would qualify as a serious database developer as most people IT people I have worked with don't consider Access a serious developers tool.
 But I have used it for many years in my home office and some corporate environments&nbsp; and continue to try and improve my skills. Your suggestion is a good one and I think I will give it a shot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My curiosity is still there about why my database does not allow that data type and how to remedy that issue. Is is an issue with mdb vs. accdb? Is the default database type not accdb?

<p>
</p><p>What is the full filename? If it is an mdb then that is the reason the type is there. An accdb is the default if you are creating a new database in 2013.</p>

            Take a look at Images.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This includes a number of examples, of varying degrees of complexity, illustrating how to manage images by storing the path to each image file in a text column in a table.&nbsp; The basic Images.accdb file should fit the bill for what you want.&nbsp; In the bound form
 images are identified by title in a list box and multiple images can be selected for viewing by Ctrl- or Shift-clicking&nbsp; in the usual way.&nbsp; The images are displayed in a separate form and loaded on demand by means of a hyperlink.&nbsp; A variation on the same form
 is used to add an image in relation to the current record.<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; If you have only one receipt per record see the even more basic Images_Simple.accdb<br />

            <p>Thanks Ken. Have looked at your images database example and it is fantastic. Not sure if I could duplicate it in my own database as I don't think I have the expertise or understanding of DB structure and design. I was somewhat better when working in the
 corporate world, but my use of Access is now for my own small property management/investment business, and no IT people to ask questions.
