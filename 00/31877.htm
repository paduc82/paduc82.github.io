<h2>            Games with gold doesn&#39;t launch anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>I've downloaded many games with Gold (free game of the month). It used to work fine, but recently I cannot launch the games. Everytime, I get this message "Looks like you need to renew a membership, such as EA access or Xbox Live Gold (0x803f8003).</p><p><br /></p><p>But I do have Gold. I share my console with my roommate who has gold. It has been always like this and we never had the problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, when he tried to launch the game on his own console, he gets the same error message.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, if I sign in to his account on my console, I can play. Then I can sign out and switch to my profile and continue to play.</p><p><br /></p><p>This problem occurs with game such as Rayman, AC Black Flag and TWD Tales game. All games I downloaded for free with gold.</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyone had this problem and knows how to fix it?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for your help!</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            W2K &#38; Flash Installer - SetDllDirectoryW could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll.</h2>
                    fully patched W2000-SP4 - trying to install or update adobe flash gives "The procedure entry point SetDllDirectoryW could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.dll." it says ths for both FF and IE versions of the flash installer... this has
 just started recently... at least since the beginning of 2012... no mcafee or norton stuff has ever been near this box... this is (currrently) only limited to installing or updating flash...<br />
<br />
NOTE: had to choose "Other/Unknown" for the windows version option in these forums because some bright spark removed the "Windows 2000" option :? :(<br />

            adobe evidently messed up because i had a version 11.something that kept trying to autoupdate to the latest... while the one above may be the last official supported version, they did release another that installed just fine...<br />
<br />
since i wrote the above, i've dug deeper and deeper into the problem... specifically it stems from the
<br />
my digging finally lead me to a thread in adobe's forums and a bug entry in their bug tracker... someone there found a wrapper or two which wrap the kernel32.dll file and provide missing functions... i grabbed one and was easily able to install the FF/Other
 and IE/AX flavors of flash player 11.2.202.233 released on Apr 15th, 2012 if i'm reading
<a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a> correctly...<br />
<br />
the problem with sticking only with older versions is the bugs and security holes in them that are exploited daily with no obvious indication that anything is going on... thanks but no thanks ;)<br />

<p>Given that Windows 2000 went out of support and hasn't had any security updates from Microsoft&nbsp;since July 2010, I'm puzzled about why people are so concerned about having an up to date Flash Player. Any exploits are likely to be totally confused.</p>

</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, it looks like you'd like to use your keyboard on the Xbox One to message your friends on rocket league. In regards to this I do have some great and amazing news!
<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/09/25/mouse-and-keyboard-support-for-xbox-one-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Keyboard and Mouse Support is coming to the Xbox One</a>. Warframe will be one of the first games to support this great feature. I hope this information was helpful in resolving the issue.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if we are talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Windows 10 Xbox App on my PC (and stream my Xbox to it) and in the past I used to be able to use my keyboard ON MY PC when typing of text is required.&nbsp; I can't seem to get this working again.</p>

<p>Hey Schalk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What type of keyboard are you using? From my experience, High end keyboards need updated drivers, and it is better to update them manually then using the automatic updating feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I double checked all settings on the app to make sure there was no way to disable keyboards as well. hope this helps, be sure to come back to let us know which keyboard you are using.</p>

            Not quite the same issue but I have a sporadic issue with the app on iOS not letting me type to my system from my phone for messages or error reports. Tapping on my phone just registers as button inputs instead of bringing up a virtual keyboard. Really
 annoying and unfixed bug. Maybe the same for the PC app and regular keyboards?

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Sidewinder X6 keyboard, so I trust Microsoft keep their own keyboard's driver up to date :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you actively using the application to stream from your Xbox? Does your application recognize text input and allow your keyboard to be used?</p>

</p><p>Maybe try that?&nbsp; I don't know how to permanent fix it :(</p>

<h2>            EA Access Hub Can&#39;t Be Downloaded</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was attempting to download Anthem this afternoon through the EA Access Hub app.&nbsp; Whenever I tried to open the app it would stall for a while, before reporting an error message to me.&nbsp; When trying to troubleshoot this issue I ended up uninstalling the EA
 Access Hub and trying to re-download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the store page to try to download the EA Access Hub and click on the "Get" button, I'm now shown an error message instead of the app downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8f3bd90-98de-423d-968d-eb6b245a61de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8f3bd90-98de-423d-968d-eb6b245a61de?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there currently an outage or issue with Anthem and/or EA Access?</p>

                    <p>The link to transfer credit (https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA345/how-do-i-transfer-skype-credit-from-one-skype-account-to-another-skype-account?q=transfer+Skype+credit) says "Sign into the account you want to send credit to".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the link&nbsp;https://secure.skype.com/send-credit it asks "Who would you like to send credit to"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried both - it says the old account I'm sending from (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">live:92022a6e05a0dd55)&nbsp;</span>has no credit, which is not true; the new account (live:

<p>The bugcheck indicates you are experiencing memory corruption. This could be faulty hardware such as RAM, or a buggy driver. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;In these
 cases, it can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier...&nbsp;start-&gt;run-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings-&gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way
 out of the dialog.</span></p>
<span>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem.&nbsp; In the event that the system does not boot completely after
 enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.

Wait for a bugcheck to occur (or try to cause one by inserting a disc in the drive) after enabling verifier as described, and then upload it to your

<h2>            Windows 10 new PC build, BSOD  DPC Watchdog Violation on Ryzen</h2>
                    <p>Here is my build:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>It says "for intel platform" on Amazon, but I've seen countless other Ryzen platform builds perform well with these.</p>
<p>I randomly get the blue screen of death with DPC Watchdog Violation. Is it the RAM or the M.2 or both??</p>
<p>I have updated all drivers and especially so for the drive controller. I've never had this error before, coming from a windows 8.1 laptop though.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)

    <title>Windows 10 Startup Folder Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djc1963  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Startup Folder Failure</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers using Windows 10 with nothing on them but my kiosk program. When I turn the computer on, I want it to start that program up. Seems simple, but not</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program works fine if I click the shortcut</p>
<p>I only have one user on the computer</p>
<p>I have tried to put the shortcut in shell:startup and shell:Common startup</p>
<p>No matter what I do, it will not launch automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to make sure all the permissions were set to full control.</p>
<p>I tried to have the shortcut in both folders at the same time and just one or the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am baffled as to what could be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have an answer for you, but wanted you to know that there have been changes in Win 8\8.1\10 that actually block some things from launching from the Startup folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even Windows own Taskmanager won't launch through a Startup folder...</p>
<p>I have several other programs with the same issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might try is to create a Scheduled Task that launches at startup or logon..</p>
<p>I haven't had much luck with that either...</p>

            HI,<br />
<br />
The security of Assigned Access has changed some in Windows 10. There may<br />
be a required setting in secpol.msc.<br />
<br />
Check with those in the TechNet and MSDN Forums where they use Kiosk Mode<br />
on a more frequent basis.<br />

Your welcome!<br />

Apple&nbsp;makes good hardware however overall Mac OS&nbsp;has the same issues <br />
that Windows does with more limitations. Of course many Mac owners are<br />
running Windows these days. Having antivirus/security/malware programs</p>
<p>are becoming an important issue of them.<br />

<h2>            Windows Server 2008 R2 BSOD Dump file</h2>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need some help ASAP, I am running Windows Server 2008 R2 and recently it has thrown some BSOD and when I retrieve the Dump File I see that it is being caused by the hal.dll and the "Crash Address" is ntoskrnl.exe, what I need help with is the following,
 I am wondering what the +129ef after the hal.dll and the +a44a0 after the ntoskrnl.exe means. I am trying to narrow the hardware piece down so I might replace it without having to replace the whole server. I am attaching the exact info from bluescreenview
 dump log.... I am looking for an explanation on the BOLD TEXT after the "Caused by address" &amp; "Crash address"</p>

            <p>Greetings. I have the same problem. <br />
1.When I start to play Battlefield 3 <strong>via internet</strong> after less than minute in map my PC crashes and whole screen is
<strong>pure red (nothing to read)</strong> and I have to restart PC.<br />
2. Error shows <strong>only in two games</strong> - Battlefield 3 and Riders of Icarus. In second game red screen starts around 5 minutes after logging into game and playing. (aslo multiplayer game).<br />
3. In both cases I get <strong>only red screen and there is nothing to read.</strong><br />
4.I uninstall and install graphic driver, than updated it. Also used "Driver talent" program and it found some missing updates and folders so I downloaded it with the program and installed it but after PC restart games still crash.</p>
<p>So everything is <strong>up to date</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry for grammar, I´m not english man.</p>
<p>Hope we will solve this </p>
<p>Mike</p>

                    <p>My windows 10 will not update automatically, so I downloaded windows 10 update assistant. It is now stuck at 99%. Note: I already have a windows 10 system, just trying to update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I just stop the update assistant at this point and do a system restore. I can't keep trying to update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue with Windows Update can be caused by corrupted download and system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To confirm the issue with Windows Update Assistant, we'd like to know how long it has been stuck at 99% and if it's already showing any error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, updates can take too much time (usually takes 60-90 minutes or less to be completed) depending on the device specifications and subsets.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to cancel and restart the update, it will reset its progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for Windows Update</a></strong> and see if the issue will persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</p>

 I start up my laptop now, the Windows 10 logo pops up and it comes up again with the message "Preparing automatic repair." Then goes to "Diagnosing your PC." And after it stucks at&nbsp;</span>"Repairing disk errors. This might take over an hour to complete." Though
 i waited for HOURS, it still wouldn't start. I've got some Serious PRECIOUS Files of Work on my computer that i cannot find anywhere else and not being able to access them KILLS ME. I may not be able to find them ever again if my pc doesn't turn on eventually.
 I'm really anxious and stressed. Can someone help me? I tried searching my problem in the Microsoft Community but nothing was really helpful. I have no problem getting a new pc, but am i able to somehow get the files and put them into my new pc? I'm so confused.
 ANY Help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;Windows 10 is in&nbsp;repair loop, I would suggest you to <strong>run bootrec commands in the command prompt from Windows recovery environment&nbsp;</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>If you have installation media for Windows, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings
 so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer"</strong> to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an op</strong>tion" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>command prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In the command prompt, type the following commands one by one and press Enter after each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec /fixmbr</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, perform a repair upgrade which will keep your files intact.
</p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I’ll try my best to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have some issues with the sound on the computer. It seems to be fixed when you run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter; however the issue reoccurs again after sometime and is looking for a permanent fix on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know –</p>
<p>1) Did you check the troubleshooting report after running the Hardware Troubleshooter? If yes, what exactly does it shows in the report?</p>
<p>2) Did you try installing the latest audio card drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website?</p>
<p>3) With which speaker, do you face this issue? Is it with the external or inbuilt speaker?</p>
<p>4) If this has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you haven’t checked the troubleshooting report, then please check it and share the details with us in your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to run the “<strong><em>Playing Audio</em></strong>” Troubleshooter and check if that helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Run the Playing Audio Troubleshooter</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Playing Audio Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the audio devices connected to the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</p>
<p>d) Click on “<strong><em>Playing Audio</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: No sound in Windows</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to refer to the Microsoft Help article given below and try the suggestions given in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/no-sound-help#no-sound=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">No sound in Windows</a></em></strong></p>

<div>Many thanks for your reply and assistance.</div>
<div>The following is answers to your questions-</div>
<div>1) Hardware Troubleshooting Report -</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;A) The troubleshooter made some changes to your system. Try attempting the task you were trying to do before.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;B) Problems Found - Hardware changes might not have been detected.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;C) Issues Found - Hardware changes might not have been detected. &nbsp;.........Detected</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Scan for recent hardware changes. ....................................Completed</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;D)Potential issues that were checked - Windows update configured never to instal drivers. ...........Issue not present.</div>
<div>2) I checked for driver updates and "the best driver is already installed" for both Realtek High Definition Audio and Intel(R) Display Audio.</div>
<div>3) Both internal and external speakers are affected.</div>
<div>4) Changes - the only changes that I can think of are by the automatic Windows updater.</div>
<div>5) "Playing Audio" - Could not identify the problem. For all of the items in the report............Issue not present.</div>
<div>
<p>6) No sound in &nbsp;Windows - See No. 2 above. Also both the Realtek and Intel(R) are "working properly".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re 5 &amp; 6 - the problem still exists.</p>
<div>I hope that the answers are helpful and assist you in resolving the problem.</div>
<div>Regards,</div>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for replying with the additional information regarding this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple laptop model under the <strong><em><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/searchResults?product=5273500&amp;tmp_qt=drivers&amp;tmp_product=Compaq+Presario+CQ58-a10NR+Notebook+PC&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Compaq

<strong><em><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/pfinder?tmp_product=Compaq+Presario+CQ58&amp;tmp_qt=drivers&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=5287590&amp;tmp_searchExperience=0#N51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compaq Presario CQ58 Series Laptop Models</a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try uninstalling and reinstalling the latest Audio Drivers from the Compaq/HP website and check if that helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Device Drivers</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on “<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>” from that list.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Search for the Sound Card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this device</em></strong>”
 you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, please open the <strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the “<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>” button. Check if Windows 8 detects the Sound Card device and installs an appropriate driver
 automatically. If the issue still persists, then try the next step. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Check Windows Updates for the latest drivers.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” from the search result.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the “<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>” window, click on the link: “<strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8 driver, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 3: Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Visit </span>Compaq/HP website and search for the correct Windows 8 compatible drivers for your laptop model and then install them on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to find the correct drivers, then please get back to us with the exact model number of your laptop and we’ll be able to help you to find the correct drivers for your laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this is helpful.</span>

</p><p>For four days now I have had sound/audio WITHOUT problems. STRANGE!!!! I have not tried any remedial action and checked both Windows and HP updates going back to 01/08/2014 and nothing appears relating to sound/audio.</p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for getting back to us with the updates on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a great new and seems to be very strange that the sound started working on the computer without performing any troubleshooting steps or any Windows/HP updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you remember making any recent changes on the computer (uninstalling or disabling any programs or services) prior to this happening? If yes, what is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be either due to any recent changes that you have made to the computer or the Audio Drivers might have started working automatically when the computer was restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyways, we are glad to know this update and now, let us wait and see if this issue happens again.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ethernet Cable does not have a valid IP Configuration</h2>
                    I have legitimately tried everything to resolve this, other than actually diving into my modem. I use the following ethernet cable (Intel(R) 82567LM Gigabit Network Connection) and it keeps saying identifying, unidentified network, no internet access.
 Wireless works fine and I have tried all sorts of command prompt techniques, none have been successful, I need some other way before diving into my modem. I have tried setting the IPV4 manually and set it to auto configure and whenever I troubleshoot, it tells
 me to restart my modem, wait 30 seconds, then plug it back in and wait another 30 seconds for me to plug it in. I tried this and it didn't work. No problems that I know of from my ISP and i think it has something to do with the ethernet cable or driver. I
 have tried uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling them, but got the same results. Haven't tried another ethernet cable yet, but this one is in top shape, with almost no hardware problems. I have even tried going into my connectio

<p>I also have access to flushing the DHCP from my connection hub. Just unsure if I should do that. I have used this USB antenna thingy which is supposed to give me a stronger wifi signal, but still gives me lag. I also used the Fn + F5 command to get to AcFnF5.exe
 connection manager and whenever I request for an IP address there, it says the DHCP server timed our and/or didn't reposond so i end up with the .169.254.79.228 ip address which is basically no ip address at all. I don't know what the problem is, but again
 all and any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following questions as completely as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; What edition of Windows 7 do you have (e.g., Home Premium, etc.) and is it a 32-bit or 64-bit system?&nbsp; If you're not sure, click Start, right-click "Computer" and select "Properties"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Are you using a different computer to ask your question here?&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>If so, is that second computer connected to your Sagemcom 2864?
<ul>
<li>If yes, by Ethernet or wifi?
<ul>
<li>If by Ethernet, to what port is it connected?
<ul>
<li>Have you tried connected the "problem computer" to that port?</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Were you ever able to connect the "problem computer" to your modem/router using an Ethernet cable and access the Internet?</p>
<ul>
<li>If so, what happened to your system shortly before the problem started?&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">For example, did you install software or a Windows Update; have malware; use a registry cleaner or system tune-up utility; etc.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Although your initial question relates to connecting your computer&nbsp; using an Ethernet cable, you also mention a "USB antenna thingy" but complain that your wifi has "lag."</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to connect the "problem computer" to your modem/router via wifi and access the Internet?&nbsp;
</li><li>Have you ever been able to connect this computer via wifi?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; How have you determined that your Ethernet cable has "almost no hardware problems"?&nbsp; A defective Ethernet cable is one of the more likely causes of your issue.&nbsp; If you are using a different Ethernet cable to connect the computer that you're using to
 ask your question here, you should try using that Ethernet cable with the "problem computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; You noted that a system log says that "bytes have been sent from the ethernet ports 1 and 2."&nbsp; Have you tried connect the Ethernet cable to ports 3 or 4?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; Assuming that you are using a second computer to ask your question here, please do the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a.&nbsp; On the "problem computer," open a Command Prompt window (click Start, type cmd.exe and press Enter)</p>
<ul>
<li>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig/all &gt; "%userprofile%\Desktop\ipinfo.txt"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b.&nbsp; Connect a USB flash drive ("thumb drive") to the problem computer and copy the file named "ipinfo.txt" (it may show just as ipinfo) from the Desktop of the computer to the flash drive.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect the flash drive to the computer that you are using to ask your question here and double-click ipinfo.txt to open it in Notepad
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">d.&nbsp; Copy the contents of ipinfo.txt and Paste into your next Reply here</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">e.&nbsp; You can delete ipinfo.txt from the USB flash drive and the Desktop of the "problem computer"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

<p>I am using the problem computer. It has wireless, but it turns out the DHCP is taking too long to respond and assign an ip address to my computer. It then assigns me the windows default ip address and then I don't have internet access. I am using Windows
 7 Professional and it is a 64-bit Operating system. Again, I can use wireless on the problem computer and only the ethernet doesn't work. I am using the problem computer right now to send this btw. This problem started about yesterday around mid day and before
 that the ethernet cable was working perfectly fine. I was in the middle of a game of League of Legends, and I do use this application called Haste which optimizes connections and minimizes ping/lag. That application had a major update. I think it was the night
 before and also the night of the problem where there were 2 windows updates that took place once I had shut the computer down. The problem computer works perfectly fine through Wifi, it just the antenna thingy is made to give you a stronger connection through
 wireless. The antenna thingy really has nothing to do with it, I just thought it would be safe to mention everything about the whole scenario. I am sure that this ethernet cable has minimal to no hardware issues. I haven't tried to use another ethernet cable
 yet. I am connecting the ethernet cable to ports 3 and 4 of the modem as we speak. It still gives me the same problem. As I said the problem computer's wifi/wireless works completely fine, only the ethernet has problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***JUST TO CLARIFY the ethernet connection I use is the same as the one of my WiFi****</p>

<p>I have tried this and nothing happened. I just tested the ethernet cable with another laptop and it worked out fine, ruling out any possibilities of hardware malfunction or problems in the router and cord. I think the it is the DHCP error; It won't assign
 my computer an IP address when it is requested and it times out whenever one is requested. I am now thinking about resetting my Computer so that all settings have gone back to default because too much has been tinkered with. Any suggestions before I do that?
 Thanks.</p>
<p>Any and all help is appreciated and thank you so much!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've got the same problem. AMD Drivers causing error on Witcher. See https://community.amd.com/thread/223397</p>
<p>Use previous driver <span><span><span><span>17.11.4 or wait for a fixed AMD Driver. 17.12.1 and 17.12.2 won't work.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter&#58; How to force the output - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter&#58; How to force the output resolution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter (MWDA) connected to a projector which has a native resolution of 1280 x 800.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect with the MWDA with my Surface Pro 3 (SP3). I've set the resolution of the SP3 to 1280 x 800, but still the MWDA outputs 1920 x 1080 (1080p). This causes the projector to rescale, which results in a slightly blurred image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the MWDA to output 1280 x 800 (the native resolution of the projector). Can that be done?</p>

<p>Sorry, I don't believe you can specify the target resolution as it is a negotiated protocol; does your projected support any other resolutions?</p>

http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/support/contact-us</a> - suggest you contact them. AFAIK, Miracast negotiates the highest screen resolution that the target display can handle. Ask official support if there is a work around.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>same problem here, can't but need to force the Wireless Display Adapter to 1080p!</p>
<p>I tried on a Samsung 4K Monitor and especially with a Hitachi CP-WU8440 WUXGA (1920x1200) Projector - both are definitely capable of 1080p but somehow the Adapter is not recognizing it so i falls back to 1280x720!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's impossible to work like this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The App for the Adapter reads that it has the current firmware installed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft make it possible to or set as default 1080p ´like other HDMI devices do so!</p>

<p>do you have any Bluetooth devices paired? there is an issue on the SP3 where BT devices cause low resolution. not sure if this is your issue or not.

<div>1. the best you will see out of the MWDA is 1920 x 1080</div>
<div>2. that is the highest resolution your Vizio TV supports</div>
<div>3. so I would expect the SP3 to lower to 1920 x 1080</div>
<div>4. if you are seeing 1280 x720, do you have any Bluetooth devices</div>
<div>connected/nearby OTHER than the SP3 pen? The Intel Video driver lowers</div>
<div>resolution when Bluetooth is in use. </div>

<p>
</p><p>Have you installed the MWDA firmware update? You WILL need to find a friend with a TV that works properly to get it installed as the install uses a Modern App to perform the upgrade.

<h2>            Is there anyway I can reinstall Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 with the free upgrade. I was not aware of two things - 1/ that I had to activate Windows 10 by using the product key from my Windows 7 system; 2/ that the ability to go back to Windows 7 would disappear after 30 days and that it
 would wipe my Windows 7 information off the computer. I now am running Windows 10, but it is not activated so it will not update and not all features work with it. It is also very difficult for my computer to boot. I spent over 45 minutes yesterday online
 with Microsoft tech support via instant messaging and I was told that I created a "clean installation". I just followed instructions but as it is now over 30 days since I upgraded to Windows 10, all previous product information for Windows 7 has been wiped
 from my computer (I read online yesterday after my session with Microsoft Tech Support that a "disk clean up" is run and that eliminates everything), so that must have been what made it look like a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a boot disk and I can restore Windows 7. However, as my operating system is now Windows 10, will I have trouble running my programs as they currently are? I only want to reinstall Windows 7. I want to keep my personal files and programs as is ...
 and I want them running properly when Windows 7 is reinstalled.&nbsp; If I reinstall Windows 7, will Microsoft provide a free upgrade to Windows 10 again? I cannot run a backup with my Lenovo Rescue and Recovery software as it is not booting and operating with
 Windows 10 now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do not reinstall Windows 7, is there anyway I can get a re-do of the Windows 10 free download that I received in August?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really a non-technical person so I do not able to do anything too complicated to get my laptop working well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there is a simple solution to this problem. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install Windows 7 with genuine/licensed one then you can upgrade to Windows 10. But when you do installation of Windows 7 from Windows 10 it will be a Clean install. So, I suggest you to take the back up of the data to avoid the data loss.
</p>

<p>Since we do not have confirmation if you received any update from Windows Live Essentials and because you may have a corrupted directory of this program, this is what we recommend you to try to resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>Please follow below instructions to run DISM Restore Health </p>
<p>It is always a good idea to back up your data beforehand.</p>
<p>If you are on win 8 (and up) you should also run DISM whether SFC found errors or not.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>In search bar, type in <strong>CMD</strong>, then right click and <strong>
run as Administrator</strong>. (called an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check the health (You would use /CheckHealth to only check whether the image has been flagged as corrupted)run Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth<br />
<br />
To scan the health use /ScanHealth to scan the image for component store corruption. This option does not fix any corruption. Run Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
<br />
Restore health by performing this: From the Command Prompt (Admin) screen type,&nbsp; <strong>
DISM /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong> (please note the space after "dism", &amp; "online" &amp; "image")<br />
<br />
After running DISM, it's best to re-run SFC /scannow to ensure all issues were fixed.<br />
<br />
If you get an error message "cannot find source files" you'll need to have an ISO file mounted and need to specify where it is located with the below command:<br />
</p>
The ISO must be exactly the same version as the running OS.&nbsp; An ISO of 10586.0 will not repair a running system of 10586.35 because it has additional updates and files.<br />
<p>
</p><p>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:WIM:X:\Sources\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess&nbsp; Where "X" is the drive letter where the ISO is located.&nbsp; Simply change the "X" to the correct drive letter<br />
</p>
<p>If you do not have an ISO you can make one.&nbsp; The instructions are <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>

            Which Antivirus utility do you have installed? Have you tried uninstalling then reinstall it?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

            Can rollback to your previous version of Windows 10?
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<p>I am only a novice computer person. I have a lot of software and apps loaded and am a bit nervous about loosing any of it. This is the computer I work with on a daily basis so let me see if I can get a computer geek friend who is more computer savvy to help
 with the downgrade and advise me on the consequences of that action. I hate the thought of having to reinstall all of the software I have on my computer if that is what is required. I will get back with you. Thanks you so much for your help.</p>

            Only software you installed since upgrading to Windows 10 1709 would be removed.
