            <p>Hi jagadeesh_873,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I understand you're having issues with a prepaid voucher for music.&nbsp; In order to get a better idea of what to do next, there are a few things I'd like to go over with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are you trying to redeem this prepaid code?&nbsp; Is it through PC, or phone?&nbsp; Are you trying to redeem it through the Zune Software, or the xbox.com website?</li><li>What is this actual voucher for?&nbsp; Is it for a subscription, or a credit towards your account to buy music?</li><li>What region are you currently in?</li><li>Where did you obtain this code?&nbsp; Who gave you this voucher?</li></ul>
<p>I also want to take this time to remind you, please do not post your voucher code in this forum as this is a public forum.&nbsp; Feel free to get back to us when you can and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

<h2>            Treo 750 battery life &#38; more...</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My battery life has gone down considerably in the last week.&nbsp; It's a new phone so I doubt it's the actual battery.&nbsp; I've checked my sync to be sure it's not constantly syncing and it's not.&nbsp; Any other ideas on settings I might have running that are decreasing
 my battery life?&nbsp; As of right now, I pretty much keep it on the charger unless I'm out and about since the battery is draining fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another, and less pressing question, can I play music through my Bluetooth and not the speakers?&nbsp; I've looked through the settings and if I'm able to do it, I must have missed it somewhere.</p>

<p>This almost sounds like a 3rd party app that keeps connecting to the network (IM client possibly). Have you installed any 3rd party apps lately?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How often do you have your Treo check for new mail? Shorter time frames will cause a faster battery drain.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have the Beam function turned off? Bluetooth? etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would look for programs that need to connect to the network and check their settings.</p>

<p>WXBOSS is giving some good advice there 2workigo.&nbsp; The biggest cause for drain are the radios so turning them off when not in use can save a lot of battery energy.&nbsp; But if in fact you can not determine what is draining the device, I certainly
 would consider doing a Hard Reset and test it out with NO NEW PROGRAMS installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If in fact life returns and battery power is returned to normal then you know it was something that was running and I would expect you could figure it out by slowly adding what you had.&nbsp;

<p>Got my 750 on Friday. Was not aware of the battery issue (dumb) and it was dead when I needed to call home.</p>
<p>On Saturday,&nbsp;I read the battery news about this device on the web. Not a pretty picture unless you don't use e-mail or the phone.</p>
<p>Last night, I charged up the battery to 100%, stopped all programs including the wireless, and unplugged at 23:15.</p>
<p>At 7:00 this morning, I turned the device on, and the battery was at 78%, a 22% loss while presumably doing nothing.</p>
<p>(Also, note that I my e-mail synchronization settings go off at 10 pm.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO got his last Thursday, was fully charged yesterday at 7:00&nbsp;and by 11:30, he was out of battery. (he does a lot of phoning &amp; e-mail). I have order the larger (2400 mAh)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We both had the 650 before and it was nothing like this. (Do we blame Windows?)</p>

<p>I have found that my ATT Treo 750&nbsp;battery lasts longer&nbsp;if I limit the programs running in background.&nbsp;&nbsp;To check programs running in the background, turn on the screen, and press and hold the OK button until the Running Programs List comes up.&nbsp; Select and
 stop those that you're not currently using, and see if you get more time between recharges.&nbsp; When I did this, I was shocked to see how many programs I had used and quit, but Windows Mobile had left running in the background</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heavy PDA use also sucks up battery power, similar to operating a laptop.&nbsp; I think that the Treo 750 PDA uses more power than a stand-alone Palm PDA (my Tungsten E2, for example), because it runs under the Windows&nbsp;OS.&nbsp; Leaving the phone on standby
 (i.e. on, but not in-use) uses less power than most folks imagine, but if your Bluetooth function is always on, it will also use more power, even if it is not connected to another device.</p>

<p>I do not experience that at all.&nbsp; It will lose power over night but not enough that it has an effect on my daily operation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually I will charge it overnight and unplug in the morning.&nbsp; It will last all day with usually plenty of power to spare.&nbsp; However, if I do have heavy internet use, it will eat it up and if I am driving I will charge it with a DC charger just
 to make sure I have power.</p>

<p>I've had my ATT 750 a month.&nbsp; Initially I had the same battery drain issue.&nbsp; In addition to the suggestions listed here, disabling the PUSH feature was recommended.&nbsp; I did those things and battery life improved.&nbsp;
 Actually, it continued to improve over the first 2 weeks with no other changes.&nbsp; Now I keep unnecessary radios off but have not experienced a similar drain even with increased use.</p>

<p>What are the numbers that you&nbsp;experience? I started at 100% at 11 pm and was at 78% at 7 am the next morning.</p>
<p>Everything that I can turn off is off, no bluetooth (ever), phone is off, all programs are off.</p>

<p>I upgraded to Mobil 6.0 and experienced some poor battery life at first but
</p>
<p>once I had things set it worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Treo 750 is GSM only you do have to be aware of areas with poor or no gignal coverage.&nbsp; If I turn off my phone my 750 will go about 5 days on a charge, with using the</p>
<p>planners and such regularly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if I go into some of our R &amp; D area where there is no signal, and the phone is on, I will
</p>
<p>run the battery down to about 20% in 10 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually with the phone on but minimal calls I get 2-3 days on a charge.</p>
<p>This is less but similar to my Treo 650.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this what others are seeing?</p>

            <p>Hi Inge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>how are you? I hope that you are doing well. I'm Wayne from Microsoft Support and I'll be assisting you on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read your post and I understand that you are having issues composing in Outlook.com from the Google Chrome browser but working fine using Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of the isolation process, I strongly suggest you to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Sign in to your account in <a href="http://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Outlook.com</strong></a> using a different Chrome in a different device.</p>
<p>-Try signing in with a different account in Outlook.com in the affected device where you are having the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I would also want to know if you are receiving the error when attaching file/s in Outlook.com from Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's working fine in Internet Explorer, I suggest using this browser but if you wanted to continue using Google Chrome, then I strongly suggest that you download the latest version of it and check if the issue would persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please come back to us with the needed information if the issue would persist. We'll be just here waiting for your response.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Graphics card drivers not working</h2>
                    I have a HP pavilion dv9500 that I upgraded to windows technical preview. &nbsp;I did a scan on the NVIDIA website that told me I have the&nbsp;<span>GeForce 7150M / nForce 630M graphics card and I can't find drivers that will work.
 &nbsp;where can I find some?</span>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for showing interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Windows 10 Technical Preview is a testing environment, so there will be no drivers available for this Windows. As far your computer model HP pavilion dv9500 is concerned, HP has not released any higher version of drivers apart from Windows&nbsp;Vista
 and lower versions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For Drivers availability refer to below link.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>The Graphics card drivers on your computer is a Legacy product i.e. nForce 6 Series - nForce 630i/GeForce 7150 and is only available for Windows 7 and lower versions.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>However I would suggest you to first download the graphics card drivers from the following website and then install them in Windows 7 compatibility mode.</span></span></p>

            The vertical scroll should be visible when you enter a folder e.g. the moment you open your Inbox.&nbsp; Movement between the
<strong>beta Preview </strong>and the <strong>old Outlook</strong> is simply a procedure of sliding the slider (toggle)&nbsp;from an&nbsp;<strong>On</strong> position to an&nbsp;<strong>Off</strong> one.&nbsp; The slider is&nbsp;located below the main Outlook&nbsp;ribbon when you are in&nbsp;your
 main screen view.

            You need to enable Different Odd and Even in the mail merge main document before performing the merge. Add a second page temporarily if necessary in order to format the headers and page numbers. If the merge is a Letter merge, each letter will be a separate
 section, and numbering will be restarted. If that's not what you need, then perhaps what you need is a Directory merge instead.

<p>Hi Heidi, <br />
<br />
The things you are trying to change are Section properties. In a completed merge, each record from the merge will be a new section not connected to the previous one with page numbers starting over.
<br />
<br />
You can change the headers/footers to different even/odd and that will be reflected in the entire document, but you will not have content in your even page header/footer unless you had it in your primary merge document.
<br />
<br />
Here is my Add-In that can give you continuous page numbering in your merge result document (or any multi-section document that has changes in page numbering).</p>

<p><br />
I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />

<h2>            Is this new Outlook.com ready or not&#63; ON mulitple computers can&#39;t email a contact using the TO box&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using, Windows 10</p>
<p>Edge.</p>
<p>I am a computer tech by trade FYI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had read that the new Outlook.com was out of Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see we still have the BETA switch though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was talking up the new version to a friend and even convinced them to move over to it. To my immediate dismay, when I try to show them how to email someone.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I click the "new message" link</li><li>type in the first letter of a persons name and it does not list everyone who's name starts with "A".</li><li>I then type in the entire first name, NOTHING comes up. But it DOES exist in Contacts</li><li>But then there is no way to get to contact list. I click the TO button and it says "my contacts" just below it. I click that and nothing.</li></ol>
<p>I sign in and out of multiple accounts to test this. Same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It even does the same thing on someone elses computer using Chrome, I was using Edge on mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is basic functionality here, am I missing something? Please help. One would think that when I type in the first letter of a persons name EVERYONE with that letter would appear and it would allow me to keep typing to finally narrow it down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats up? See photo below, I click "my contacts" AFTER clicking "TO" in an attempt to bring up the list;&nbsp; and nothing happens!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the dumbed down mail app gets this right, very confused and a bad start to what's supposed to be an easy transition for my friend, REALLY bad first impression.</p>

<p>Hi, on every computer and every account I see this is what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have MANY customers that are experiencing the same behavior, although some ARE able to simply type in a name and have the entire list appear without the need to click on TO:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every email system has the ability to click the TO: button. The old WinLIveMail, todays Gmail, Yahoo, the Window Mail App, ALL of them, except the new Outlook.com. This cannot be by design, it cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This video will first show the old Outlook.com and how it works, and then the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IS THIS BY DESIGN? I find that almost impossible to believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets say it is by design, then my problem remains, that when I start typing a name, not all of my names appear as an option. I am missing many names in the list that pops up, even thought they ARE in the address book.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the reply however you did not let me know if the behavior I am experiencing is unusual or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I supposed to be able to click the TO: button and have my address book pop up or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, am I able to speak directly with Microsoft Help in this forum or is there another forum where I can actually speak with someone that can get something done? I have posted many times in these forums before and am not used to not getting an answer. This
 is not a Uservoice or suggestion box issue. It is malfunction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will call them this time, but I find this entire fact finding mission to be strange, where are the MVP's?</p>

<p>That is amusing. Color me jaded, but I have been in these forums and using Microsoft Products for over 30 yrs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you told me to go to the "?" mark to find a solution I laughed first, and then came up with what I expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sad to say this is pretty typical from the current help sections of many Microsoft offerings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is AI in action I wonder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't take any of this stuff seriously. And its sad. For example you go the Mail App in Windows 10 and click help there, and it goes to a website with absolutely no search box to try to get an answer. Sad state of affairs for consumers these
 days.</p>
<p>

<p>That's where the support is. Yes, Microsoft is using more AI for their help, but what do you expect with a consumer quality "free" service? If you want dedicated support upgrade to Office 365 Business. Then you can talk to someone directly.</p>

<p>The only thing that really astonishes me, is that over 400 million folks are about to be switched over to the "new" Outlook.com; and on every single screen I have seen so far, and that is many many many; one can still not click the TO: button to bring up
 the address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it worked before, and this is how it works on every single other email platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to be inundated with calls from people on this very issue pretty soon, they are already starting. I am trying to get an answer on this issue not just for me but for everyone that follows.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Change skype output volume while not changing general volume of the system.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.<br />
<br />
I was using 'classical' version of the skype from the moment when 'updated' version came out for one reason - I was able to change skype output volume by using CMD+Alt+Up/Down.<br />
<br />
Today skype force-updated to new version. Link to download classical version disappeared from the main page and the problem is still here, when I'm changing volume in skype settings by using slider - it changes the general volume of my system.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way to enable that feature in new version? Or how to download 'classical' version of skype again and disable force updates?<br />
<br />
If it's impossible, I think I'll say goodbye to skype and use something that doesn't force me to use something I don't want to.<br />
</p>

            Unfortunately, you won't be able to do it like the classic version.
<br />
<br />See if you can still download the classic version:
<br />
<br />Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com</a>
<br />Click on Downloads
<br />Click on the dropdown from the blue button:
<br />
<br />Click on Get classic Skype.

            Thanks for response, Andre. <br />
<br />
But sadly, there is no "Get classic Skype" for me. When I click "Download Skype" it downloads recent (8.24) version.<br />
When I go to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Downloads" section</a>&nbsp;from nav menu it takes me to the page where dropdown is available, but there is only options for different OS.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm leaving Skype then. It's really sad to see how microsoft kills every good product that it touches/acquires.

    <title>Try the all-new Messaging Skype Beta application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> argmarovski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Try the all-new Messaging Skype Beta application</h2>
                    <p>I just learnt that there is a new&nbsp;Messaging Skype Beta for Windows 10 Mobile application that aims to become the default messaging solution the way iMessage is for iPhones and Google Hangouts for Androids. The application is supposed to be able to handle
 sending SMS or Skype chats seamlessly. When you install it there would be two apps on the all apps list: one is named Messaging &amp; duplicates the original Messaging app (but you have them both listed) &amp; the other one is called Skype video preview. I was able
 to try the messaging one, but the Skype video preview crashed after the "Just a moment" message every time I tried to launch it. It might be that the phone I am testing Windows 10 is pretty low on the specs side (Lumia 532). So here is the link to install
 it on your Windows 10 Preview phone:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/messaging-skype-beta/9wzdncrdtbtq#app-details" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Messaging Skype Beta</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that you must be an Insider &amp; use a Windows 10 phone preview.</p>

            <p>Just a quick edit: Skype video preview is now working correctly on build 10536. There are some users that lost their Messaging app after resetting their phones, so installing this one would restore it in most of the cases. If this did not help, copy &amp; paste
 the following code in your phone's Edge browser, without the quotes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"ms-windows-store:pdp?pfn=Microsoft.Messaging_8wekyb3d8bbwe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would trigger Store to open &amp; you will be able to reinstall the original Messaging app.</p>

    <title>Automatically Moving Calendar Appointments From Default Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris little  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically Moving Calendar Appointments From Default Account Calendar To Shared Account Calendar</h2>
                    
<p>Just wondering if anyone can help me with a situation that I have.</p>
<p><br />
In my organisation, we all have our default Office 365 accounts and another account that is added to our all of Outlook's which is named 'shared@xxxx'.</p>
<p><br />
The end goal is to be able to add appointments into our personal calendars and then have the appointments automatically move over to the 'shared@xxxx' accounts calendar so that everyone can see the required day's schedule. Ideally, these appointments would
 be copied across with a desired colour category for organizational purposes.</p>
<p>Is there anyway that this can be achieved? I have been searching and testing throughout the week without any success.</p>
<p><br />
I feel that this could be a common feature that people use.</p>
<p><br />
Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>hi chris,</p>
<p>to make appointments automatically move over to the 'shared@xxxx' accounts calendar, you can refer to the workaround below. but, there’s some limitation about this workaround. it can only move the appointments you receive/create from meeting request emails
 to the shared account. however, the appointments which you create yourself and won’t be send to any other person can’t be automatically move to the shared account.</p>
<p>for you reference: <br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=941eef4b-1192-4a53-b3dc-d94e9e2141ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d941eef4b-1192-4a53-b3dc-d94e9e2141ff" /></a></p>
<p>it’s a transport rule which&nbsp;need to be created by admin in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
exchange admin center</a>. the rule will add the shared account address to the to box when the email is a meeting request. “<em>x-ms-exchange-messagesentrepresentingtype: 1</em>” means that if the email message header’s “<em>x-ms-exchange-messagesentrepresentingtype</em>”
 value is “<em>1</em>”, this email is a meeting request.</p>
<p>if this does not meet your goal, please provide detailed information of your requirement, such as an example.</p>
<p>about “<em>these appointments would be copied across with a desired colour category for organizational purposes</em>”, it’s not feasible. i understand your concern. therefore, i suggest you submit feedback about the feature via

    <title>Cannot unshare workbook - Excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jars121  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot unshare workbook - Excel 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a workbook (that has several VBA scripts) that needs to be shared on a network for multiple users to access at once. When I enable sharing, the macros work perfectly. However, if I want to alter the VBA code, I need to first unshare the workbook,
 which I am not able to do. I go to Review &gt; Share Workbook, then uncheck the 'Allow multiple users...' checkbox. I get the prompt asking whether I want to make the workbook exclusive, and click Yes. The workbook remains Shared, will not become Unshared, even
 if I quit and reopen. As such, I cannot access the VBA code...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Workbook/Worksheets isn't/aren't protected, so I don't have the option of unprotecting them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do? I've tried several workarounds (eg: copying all the sheets to a new, macro-enabled workbook) to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>I've spent the last couple of hours trying to sort this out, and I've found more anomalies. For some reason the workbook is in the .xls (pre-2007) format. My default file format is set as .xlsx, so I have no idea why it's in this format. When I try and save
 the workbook as .xlsx or .xlsm, I get an error within Excel upon trying to open it, claiming that the file format or file extension is invalid...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm totally at a loss here, but I feel that this file format querk is in some way to blame for the sharing issues I'm experiencing.</p>

<p>Possible Cause:</p>
<p>An unauthorized HTTP communication or protocol was used.</p>
<p>- OR -</p>
<p>Unable to connect to sync server due to authentication failure. Check your connection configuration.</p>
<p>- OR -</p>
<p>Access was denied. Check your server username and password in ActiveSync Options.</p>
<p><br />
Possible Resolution:</p>
<p>The credentials provided to access the server are incorrect or you are not enabled for synchronization or your password has expired.</p>
<p><br />
User Action: <br />
1. On the device, go to ActiveSync, Tools, Server, verify that the server name is correct.
<br />
2. Click on Advanced and verify the username, password and domain information. <br />
3. Please contact your administrator and make sure that you are enabled for synchronization.</p>

<p>I am trying to set up my university email account on my Nokia X6, but seem unable to do it. It is an OWA type account, and have tried almost everything but having no luck. Would be grateful if anyone could help, or give me some advise!</p>

<h2>            Issue with Domain Controllers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running into issues for two separate tenants:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tenant 1: Trying to migrate mailboxes using powershell and getting a message that "an error caused a change in the current set of domain controllers" and is failing to migrate mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tenant 2: running a script to get mailbox folder permissions for the calendar in a global tenant (so a series of cmdlets are ran to get the name of the folder for the calendar, getting permissions for that folder, etc.) and getting a couple errors:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The domain controller 'DM3PR16A001DC06.NAMPR16A001.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM' is not available for use at the moment. Please<br />
try again</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Active Directory error 0x51 occurred when trying to check the suitability of server 'DM3PR16A001DC06.NAMPR16A001.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM'. Error: Active directory response: The LDAP server is unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither tenant is in a terribly urgent state at the moment, but the service health in office 365 does not include anything about azure active directory or domain controllers.</p>

            <p>Hi Rae,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.From the two error messages in Tenant 1 and Tenant 2, the issues are related to your Domain Controllers. I notice that the directory synchronization service health in Office 365 is fine. Does the DirSync Status show fine in Office 365 tenant? Could you
 please share with us a screenshot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Did you try to move the mailbox from on-premise to cloud or from cloud to on-premise?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.For the mailbox whose calendar you tried to get folder permission for, is it hosted on-premise?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Please also let us know how you check the suitability of the AD server. I’d like to know if the operation has no relations with Office 365 tenants and is purely relevant to AD server.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Do the two Office 365 tenants share the same DC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

            <p>Not even close to helpful.&nbsp; At no point am I running any commands in Windows Azure Active Directory powershell module that queries my on-prem domain controllers.&nbsp; these are for two separate tenants.&nbsp; and the server DM3PR16A001DC06.NAMPR16A001.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM
 is very clearly a microsoft server, not an on-prem server.&nbsp; the tenants are not related to each other.&nbsp; They are two entirely separate tenants that do not have the same on-prem environment and yet they are both have issues with Azure Active Directory.&nbsp; note
 that i said AZURE Active Directory because those are the domain controllers being queried in the commands.&nbsp; using the domain controller parameter isn't even an option because it is not an on-prem command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to know if there was an issue with AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY DOMAIN CONTROLLERS because I had at least two customers reporting powershell commands erroring over domain controllers in their O365 TENANT, not their on-prem environment.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We haven’t received reports regarding the Azure AD DC (Domain Controller) except for the thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before identifying whether there’s an issue with the Azure AD Domain, could you please share with us the entire scripts that the Tenant1 and Tenant 2 run when the issue occurred? We also appreciate it if could share with us screenshot of the complete
 error message respectively. We’d like to have a clear understanding of the issue.

            <p>nope i surely can't provide that information.&nbsp; PowerShell has since been closed and I have moved on to other things. I can provide one of the scripts (Tenant 2):</p>
<p>$users = (get-mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited).UserPrincipalName<br />
foreach ($user in $users)<br />
{<br />
Write-Host $user<br />
$calendarPath = Get-Mailbox $user | Get-MailboxFolderStatistics | where foldertype -eq Calendar | select FolderPath<br />
$calendarName = $calendarPath.FolderPath.substring(1)<br />
$folderName = $user + ":\" + $calendarName<br />
Get-MailboxFolderPermission $folderName | ? User -LIKE "ExchangePublishedUser*" | fl Identity,User,AccessRights<br />
Get-MailboxCalendarFolder $folderName | ? PublishEnabled -EQ "True" | fl Identity,DetailLevel<br />
} </p>
<p>
</p><p>but I cannot provide a screen shot of the error message.&nbsp; I did however, provide the text of the error message in my original post.&nbsp; I would get the error while trying to get $calendarPath, which would cause an error with $calendarName ($calendarPath would
 be $null because of the error), and i would have cascading errors.&nbsp; this started about 200-300 users in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, I no longer care as the mailboxes for tenant 1 have been migrated and I no longer need the information for tenant 2.</p>

            <p>Hi Rae,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the scripts. I ran the scripts but didn’t get the similar issue as you. There’s no need to further troubleshoot the issue as mailboxes for tenant 1 have been migrated and you don’t need the information for tenant 2.</p>

    <title>Internet explorer cannot display webpage, connection issues&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gretchen, ma.it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet explorer cannot display webpage, connection issues&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have numerous networked computers all running Windows XP Pro,&nbsp; IE 8, broadband through Suddenlink.&nbsp; We continually are getting the 'Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage' error and the button to diagnose connection problems.&nbsp; We have 5 wireless
 computers and 5 wired computers, a modem, wireless router and a hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we click the button to diagnose connection problems, it brings up a pop-up that will run a connection 'wizard' to fix the problem.&nbsp; Sometimes just bringing up the pop-up will fix the problem?&nbsp; Other times we have to run the 'wizard' and that fixed it,
 other times it says 'Windows cannot find a problem" and you have to run it again before it corrects itself.&nbsp; And once it is fixed, it happens again if you open a new tab or window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other programs that need internet access have no problems, such as Norton and Mal-Ware Bytes.&nbsp; This happens on both wireless and wired computers, on IE8 and FireFox.</p>
<p>I have read other threads and have tried disk clean up, checked site compatibility, have ran virus and malware programs (which are clean), and Microsoft Update are all current.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does seem to "work itself out" after a while, but it is very frustrating to have to correct this problem over and over, everyday, on numerous computers.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to have a reliable web?</p>

    <title>Concatenate Excel Function - Removing decimal place - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicola munro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Concatenate Excel Function - Removing decimal place</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My spreadsheet contains two tabs, one tab pulls information from another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My formula is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=CONCATENATE(Information!D7," mg/mL")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that if for example 7.0 is put in the cell 'information!D7' only 7 is pulled back. This does not happen if there is a value other than 0 after the decimal point. &nbsp;I need it to pull the true value of 7.0 for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

 form close simultaneously.</p>

<h2>            Autotext greyed out ...</h2>
                    Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
We have a small word/vba application based on a number of templates (.dot, now .dotx) which contain form fields where data is entered and then "harvested".&nbsp; This all worked fine in 2003 and also mostly works fine in 2010.<br />
<br />
But we have just one irritation ...<br />
<br />
In a blank document (.docx) all our Autotext lists are freely available (in 2010 as in 2003).&nbsp; But when we apply our templates with a range of protected and unprotected zones and numberous data-entry fields "Autotext Selection" is greyed out (in 2010).&nbsp; We
 find however that, by clicking on "Insert / Quickparts / Building block organizer" we can select from our Building-block/Autotext list and insert the selection into the document showing that the base functionality does work.<br />
<br />
It is rather strange that this is the case:&nbsp; We can type into the area (where we want to insert Autotext) and we can select Building-blocks (but only via "Building-block organizer") but we cannot directly select with Autotext selection.&nbsp; Why is this the case?&nbsp;
 Does it have something to do with the fact that the original template is rigged for data entry?&nbsp; (even though the particular location that we want to write to is obviously not protected).<br />
<br />
The problem for us here is that the users are familiar with selecting from the Building-blocks with short-cut keys (in order to save time) and with the greying out of "Autotext Selection" the shortcut keys also seem to be disabled.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions here?&nbsp; Are there rules governing when Autotext is available and when not?&nbsp; If I knew this, then maybe I could diagnose our problem.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any tips you can give.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />

            I confirm your finding. However, the AutoTextList field and the F3 key both do work in the unprotected section. If you have a particular spot in your document where you insert text from AutoText you could put an AutoTextList field with appropriate text
 and tooltip.<br />
<br />
You could even put one or more AutoTextList fields in AutoText with easily remembered names that could be inserted using the F3 key.<br />

<h2>            Activation code</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I bought my windows phone,I have not been able to download any app from the store just because of the activation code required when creating Microsoft</p>
<p>account. I was given some steps, I followed and now I have 3 different accounts. I have contact Microsoft and still nothing good. I had a chat with the virtual assistance and gave me nothing useful. Is it going to be a good idea if I switch to android phones
 instead and throw this phone somewhere?</p>

            Try it now. Every time I can't sign in in Solitaire, I also can't sign in to the Xbox app but have no problem with my MS sign in&nbsp;on my PC. Last night I could not get into either (Solitaire &amp; Xbox), this morning I can get in both. I have not experienced
 being able to get in one but not the other at the same time.
