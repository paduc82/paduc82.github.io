<h2>            Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>An up update started at 3 AM this morning, September 22, 2016. It is now 10 AM and all I have are a circle of dots going round and round on a blank screen. There is no apparent activity on the PC hard drive and no internet activity. I assume the update is
 the new W10 version update.</p>
<p>It has been 7 hours now. I need a working computer. What can I do?</p>

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>thanks for reply. &nbsp;Perhaps my original wording was not precise. MS started an update at 3AM, it is now 2 PM and all I have is a circle of dots going around on the screen. When the update started it said do not turn off computer until update is done. In the
 current comdition it appears the computer is still loading the update. Therefore shutting it down could screwup the update. I have no way of knowing if the update is stalled and unable to complete or just needs mor time.</p>
<p>The information you request is not possible to get since the PC is not accessible. If I turn the PC off and try start I run risk of not getting a working OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo T520i. I have been running W10 for over a year. This update I think is the version update that was coming out.</p>
<p>So, are you telling me that I should turn off the PC and try a restart?</p>
<p>Tom</p>

</p><p><em><strong>So, are you telling me that I should turn off the PC and try a restart?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You are not being asked to turn off your computer. The way to restart is to right click the Start icon and move the cursor to
<strong>Shut down or sign out </strong>and then follow the &gt; to <strong>Restart.</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;Perhaps if you read all of my reply you would have understood why I asked that question.</p>
<p>I cannot acess the normal shutdown process because the PC is in an apparent loop trying to load Windows 10 version 1607 update. I thought I was clear on that.</p>
<p>Lasr night I eventually decided to force a shutdown using th power button. It was the only mean I had to shutdown th PC. &nbsp;The PC was able to recover the earlier version of W10. &nbsp;The PC then started to down load the update again. I did not let is upload th
 update at that time. &nbsp;About two have hours ago I started the update by pressing Restart. &nbsp;My PC is now at the same point as it was yesterday after 12 hours of running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: I have never had any update take this long. How long should this update take?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Does the community help even know what is going on with Window10 version 1607 update?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If if I sound frustrat d it is because I Am!</p>

            <p>I have the same, but I was on the road at a store and tried to connect to wifi to send an email. It was updating and shut down. When I got back home it tried to do the recovery to previous version and now it pops up on a blue screen "Recovery" "Your PC/Device

<p>Needs recovery tools??? Where can I get recovery tools?</p>

            <p>Do not know if this will help but my PC got the update "pushed" the night before last but thankfully it updated OK (except now I cannot launch Quickbooks but that is another issue). I restored it back to version 1511 to get my quickbooks working again (after
 a failed attempt to get MS support). I then tried to install the build 1607 manually by going to Microsoft and downloading it. It installed perfectly again and quickbooks failed to launch again so I again reverted back to Build 1511.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;What I am getting at is I had all the previous available 1511 updates installed before the 1607 push. Maybe you need to go back to the 1511 build........install all available security, OS, ect......1511 updates untill there are no more and THEN try the
 1607 build. There may be some files in the 1511 updates that are required for the 1607 to load correctly. Maybe?

<p>Update: Apparently, the first time I force a shutdown of the PC using the power button, while the PC is in the loop it will try to recover the update. The result for me is that the PC goes right back into the loop (circle of dots on blank screen).
</p>
<p>The second time I force a shutdown the PC tries to restore the previous version 1511of W10.</p>
<p>After this last attempt I have checked the "Defer Updates" so the PC will not try to update to version 1607 for awhile at least.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates are all up to date. (except for version 1607.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read other users with similar problems.&nbsp; Some have installed update only to find that existing apps no longer work. Some have said the update loaded after they turned off antivirus program. I understand that unlike Apple, Windows users run on all
 sorts of PC's with a broad range of third party apps.&nbsp; However, this is no excuse for forcing upgrades that MS knows will ultimately inconvenience millions of customers.&nbsp; We collectively spend thousands of hours of our time cleaning up the mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded the files you requested to onedrive. I have never used onedrive before so I hope the link below works.</p>

<h2>            Where are advanced preferences&#47;settings in Skype 8.12 for mac&#63; What port number is Skype using</h2>
                    <p>Skype is eating up all my bandwidth. I can do nothing else when I am skyping and this problem has slowed me down terribly for months. I foinally found a solution using a program called entonnoir to limit the bandwidth used by Skype. It implied going to advanced
 settings to find out which port Skype was using (see&nbsp;http://blog.duklabs.com/how-to-throttle-skype-so-it-doesnt-use-so-much-bandwidth/ - it used to be port 54891) and then setting a limit for this port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I installed the new Skype, the problem has reappeared and advanced preferences have disappeared...</p>
<p>By the way, I am on optical fiber, then wifi, but performance of the connection is very high (download 78 Mbps, upload 63 Mbps)...</p>
<p>THANKS TO ANYBODY WHO CAN HELP. THIS PROBLEM IS POISONING MY LIFE.</p>

</p><p>can anyone with a surface 2 RT tell me in the regedit system what HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx\PackageRoot , i need to know what is under the Package root tab for the data. I tried to save my apps to a sd card (stupid
 I know) and erased the c:\ location without saving it. so now everytime i try and download a new app i get an error code. but all my exciting apps still work just fine.
</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying Anusha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with downloading apps started when I changed the Package Root from the C:\something\something To a secondary drive, which was a micro sd card (D:\) I changed the package root without saving the original location. the apps will download until
 the very end where it stops, </p>
<p>the error code is: 0x80070057As long as the surface 2 is up to date the registery key should all be the same under the Package Root correct?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Synaptics touchpad isn&#39;t working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathant800  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics touchpad isn&#39;t working</h2>
                    <p>I'm on an HP Pavilion dv4 and about year ago (I think I had windows 7 running at the time), my touchpad just stopped working one day. I have been using an external Logitech mouse, but I would really like the use of the touchpad back. I've tried just about
 everything I can think of. I've uninstalled the touchpad and restarted, downloaded multiple new drivers from the Synaptics website (the Setup.exe won't run for some reason), attempted to update the original driver, and yet it still doesn't work! I'm really
 annoyed about this. And now (since I got the W10 Creators Update) when I try to go into the old control panel, it shuts down the whole Windows Explorer! I've intensely researched the problem and still can't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that someone can help me fix this as soon as possible. I would appreciate any information that helps. :)</p>

<p>Hi There's a good chance your touch pad is bad. They also are bad about the connection getting loose. It seems you tried every thing. Here's support for your PC. I'm sure you have already been here. Get a driver from here!

<p>What is the old control panel. If you type 'Control panel' in search, it should take you to the control panel. Sorry don't understand 'old control panel'</p>

            The "old" control panel I'm referring to is the regular control panel (that's the one that crashes windows explorer). I refer to it as old because it was the primary settings of Windows 7.

<p>Hi I have no clue why it would crash windows explorer. The only thing coming to my mind at the moment would be a in-place- repair. The only thing you lose are a few windows updates.</p>

            When it's all said and done, will this update you're suggesting change my Windows Edition? Or will basically nothing be different (except for the hopefully fixed programs). Because right now I have Windows 10 Home (I wouldn't mind W10 Pro but, you know,
 familiarity reasons).

            I don't think I feel comfortable doing an in-place repair. It just feels sketchy. Is there any other way you can think of? I haven't tried deleting the driver yet. Should I try that?

<p>I have already uninstalled it multiple times and that didn't work, so this time I uninstalled it and also checked the box that deleted the driver. Now (I don't think I should be surprised), I don't see Synaptics touchpad anywhere. I have downloaded a driver

            <p>I don't think i've made any changes before this happened, but i've resetted my computer like 2-3 after this started to begin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I have not checked my power supply yet, but I feel like the only option I have left is to replace my current power supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there anything else inside the computer that could cause this problem?</p>

            <p>So I updated everything and there was only 1 thing that wasn't fully updated. After that I checked if it still crashed.. And it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I checked the power supply and everything seems to be fine there.</p>

</p><p>I don't know if this helps but it doesn't crash when im on the desktop, only when im on the internet or playing any game.<br />

<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 performs a clean install again
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience (OOBE)
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next
<br />
<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows

<h2>            Sony Handycam DCR-HC96 firewire connection to Windows 7 not recognized</h2>
                    I connect the DCR-HC96 via firewire in Windows 7and get the DVin/iLINK message on the camcorder, but windows doesn't ever show the camera. Windows will show the camera if I connect via USB; however, you can not stream USB video in windows 7. &nbsp;I have changed
 cables, installed a new firewire card to make sure it wasn't a bad port, and still nothing. The Sony site says the drivers are built into Windows 7. Any suggestions on getting windows to recognize the camcorder do that I can get the miniDV movies off of it?

<div>Thanks,</div>

<h2>            Not enough memory to copy .PES files</h2>
                    <p>We use Embird files with .pes extension.&nbsp; This afternoon, I can no longer copy the files to a USB which is used to transfer files to my Destiny embroidery machine.&nbsp; The file size is 51KB yet we get a message that says "There is not enough memory to complete
 this operation " USB Disk Space free 3.72 GB&nbsp; total size 3.72 GB&nbsp; which coincidentally is the size available on the 4 GB USB drive.&nbsp; We have tried 3 other USB drives of various sizes and get similar messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is recent.&nbsp; We tried to system&nbsp; restore to the last point it worked and we also uninstalled the last two updates and neither worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are at a loss because we can no longer copy these files and place them on a USB drive.&nbsp; How can we fix this?</p>

<p>Voilà je vous explique mon problème j'ai une Xbox one première génération acheté à Noël en&nbsp;2013 elle marche encore bien sauf quand je lance un jeu comme FIFA ou STEEP elle s'éteint et il faut que je débranche le câble d'alimentation et que je le rebranche
 pour qu'elle se rallume. Elle fonctionne très bien quand je regarde canal et Netflix ce n'est que lorsque je lance un jeu avec le disque ou sans disque qu'elle s'éteint ! Un peu frustrant pour une console de jeu. J'ai déjà essayé toutes les astuces que donnent
 le forum xbox le stockage persistant les test avec mes branchements j'ai même netoyé ma Xbox de l'intérieur car il y avait pas mal de poussière dedans. Sans réussite c'est pourquoi je viens vers vous.</p>
<p>Help me please ?!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cordialement Xavier.</p>

<p><span>Peut-être que vous devez acheter une nouvelle console. La version slim, ou Scorpio lorsque Microsoft finit par le sortir plus tard cette année. J'ai le jour 1 édition Xbox 1 avec Kinect, et ça va toujours bien pour moi. Certains consoles ont du mal
 à durer 1 an, d'autres ont la chance de durer un couple ou même plusieurs années. En outre, vous ne devriez pas ouvrir votre console non plus, il va annuler votre garantie et je trouve qu'il est moralement mauvais, sauf si vous aimez faire chirurgie sur votre
 console. Utilisez un chiffon pour éliminer la poussière de votre console ou un aspirateur réglé sur le mode de faible puissance d'aspiration que vous ne voulez pas un vide avec trop de puissance d'aspiration que les internes de votre console sont fragiles.<br />

Ok pourquoi ai-je écrire cela en français? Parce que c'est semaine de la langue lol. Je rigole. Juste aider ce mec français ou poussin.

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro crashing after waking from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, this is my first post and I hope someone can help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desktop is running Windows 8 Pro and randomly crashes after waking from sleep. I've searched the forum and it appears that each machine that is encountering this problem is unique so I haven't found a fix. I'm including the&nbsp;minidump files for review and
 I appreciate any help provided. Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s unfortunate that the computer crashes after waking from sleep.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Install optional updates and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. At the Start screen, type Windows Update.
<br />
b. Click or tap Settings on the right side of the screen, and then select Install optional updates from the left results
<br />
c. When the Windows Update control panel opens, click on “Check for Updates” on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Scan the computer using Windows Defender and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to scan the system for malware using Windows Defender or Antivirus software installed
 on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to scan using Windows Defender:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the start screen, type
<b>Defender</b>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Tap or click
<b>Defender</b> from the results. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To the right, change the Scan options to
<b>Full</b>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Tap or click
<b>Scan now. </b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If any infections are found you will be asked to remove or quarantine the item. Follow the instructions on the screen for removing the infected
 items. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While performing scan on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning
 tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Update graphic card drivers and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the latest graphic card and motherboard chipset drivers and check if that fixes the issue.
 Visit the manufacturer’s website and install the drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Run the Power troubleshooter and check.</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + W</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<b>troubleshooter</b> in the search box and then press
<b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “<b>Find and fix problems</b>” option from the list appeared
 in the left side.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under System and Security, click Improve power usage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may try to remove the current power plan and create a new one and check.<span><br />

<h2>            update from Win7 to Win10 fails - code 800700a1-2000a</h2>
                    <p>Trying to upgrade to Win10 from Win7. It gets all the way to booting the first time, then crashes and recovers back to Win7 with error code 800700a1-2000a. All help is appreciated. I've run chkdsk, clean up all old files, uninstalled all extra 3P apps and
 disabled all services using the msconfig cmd. Don't know what to do now. </p>

            <p><span>Hello,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest on Windows 10.<br />
I can understand the inconvenience that you are facing. We are glad you help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me know this:</span></p>
<p><span>Are you trying to upgrade through the Windows update or from the ISO?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to reset Windows update components and then try to upgrade to Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates. Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components manually:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. </span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>a. <strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>b. <strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>c. <strong>net stop bits</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>d. <strong>net stop msiserver</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Now rename the<strong> SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>
Catroot2</strong> folder. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
a</span><span><strong>. ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
</strong>b. <strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
</span><span><strong>a. net start wuauserv<br />
b. net start cryptSvc<br />
c.<span>&nbsp; </span>net start bits<br />
d.<span>&nbsp; </span>net start msiserver</strong><br />
5. Type <strong>Exi</strong>t in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disable Antivirus and security-related products, if you have any Antivirus installed for (Free) uninstall it, if not then disable the Antivirus, try again to update and check if issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Completely Freezing&#59; Requires restart. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tedclark72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Completely Freezing&#59; Requires restart.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AMD FX-6300 3.5 GHz</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>MSI 970A-G46 Motherboard</li><li>Gigabyte Radeon 7790HD</li><li>500W PSU</li><li>Not overclocked</li><li>Custom built</li></ul>
<p><strong>Description of problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had windows 8 and my computer ran fine, but when I upgraded to Windows 10, my computer will randomly freeze. Mouse/keyboard input does nothing, and I must hold the power button and reset. I have tried to wait out the freeze, but it lasts for 45 minutes
 or greater. It occurs every few hours or less, but inconsistently.&nbsp;Rarely, I will get a freeze, and after about 10 minutes, a blue screen that says DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION. Also rarely, it will freeze for about 5 minutes and then return to how it was with the
 message "display driver stopped responding and has recovered."&nbsp;It happens most frequently when gaming or when my computer is under heavy load. It has been happening since release. I thought the November Update would fix it, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Attempts to diagnose or fix problem.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>memtest86. RAM passed test</li><li>Updated all drivers/ran display driver in compatibility mode</li><li>Fresh install of 10. Same problem.</li><li>Cleaning inside of PC/reseating parts. Problem persisted</li><li>Event viewer shows no major problems when searched after a freeze.</li><li>Changing CPU Voltage. I went into the BiOS and changed the CPU voltage to about 1.3. This seemed to work, but my computer would get too hot and the freezing would persist after a long while. Right now all the voltages in the BiOS are set to auto, but if
 anyone knows default/safe voltages that I should set them to, that'd be great. I don't plan on overclocking my build.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to get frustrated as I can never know when a freeze will happen, and I sometimes lose progress when doing schoolwork or playing video games. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ted,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for updating us. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a work around, I suggest you to perform clean boot in safe mode and check if there are any third party software or program causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Start computer in safe mode</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift</strong> key when clicking the <strong>Restart</strong> button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>StartupSettings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p>
 Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean
 boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a> </span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>"
 to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, install all the pending updates and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the issue will be resolved. If you need any further assistance, please feel free to contact us again. We will be happy to assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>recover photos in clipboard in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sim_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            recover photos in clipboard in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to copy photos from my iPhone 5s to an external hard drive (WD My Passport Ultra).</p>
<p>The iPhone was connected through one USB port and the drive was connected through a second USB port.</p>
<p>I had two file explorer windows open, one for the folder in WD and one for the iPhone photos folder.
</p>
<p>I copied the photos from the iPhone and pasted into the WD folder. All worked well.</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;I went back to the file explorer window of the iPhone and started deleting some of the photos. I think I deleted about 50 of them and it included one that I wanted to keep on the iPhone so I clicked ctrl+z out of habit, even though I know that command
 doesn't work on the iPhone photo folder. Unfortunately nothing happened and I clicked ctrl+z again.&nbsp;I then realized that the undo was doing things on the file explorer for the WD drive. I went into the file explorer for the WD drive and the ctrl+z had undone
 the paste and had undone the creation of the new folder where I had placed those photos. I clicked ctrl+y, but that only created the new folder again (unnamed), but it was empty and my next ctrl+y pasted 20 of the original 450 photos pasted from the iPhone
 and gave me a message of some failure happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequent attempts to paste (ctrl+v) brought up a message window saying: "there is already a file with the same name in this location" the message window also gives me two options: "copy and replace" or "don't copy" and gives a checkbox for: "Do this for
 the next 450 conflicts"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select copy and replace and check the box the message window disappears, but no files are pasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done any other copy action, so I can still get this message window every time I paste into that folder (doesn't work in any other folder for some reason).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise if there is a way to get those photo files to paste properly? Is there a clipboard or temporary folder I can extract them from? The recycle&nbsp;bin does not&nbsp;contain those photo files. Not sure if the external hard drive would have some recovery
 options, given that those photos were successfully pasted in it to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciating any assistance with this!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Sim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the clipboard was cleared or replaced by another item, you cannot recover the files from it. With that being said, what you can do is to focus more on recovering the files from the storage itself. To do that, you might need to use 3rd party applications
 like Recuva. I have used it before and it was effective for me, I should say. Kindly visit the link provided below:</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not clear the clipboard, nor did I copy anything since. So the photos should still be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know where/how I can access them?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t do anything &#40;black screen for Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    I did a complete reset of Windows 10. It was at the 90% range of reinstalling Windows and then it went to a black screen. I don't know if Windows 10 ever fully reinstalled. I thought it was something minor so I turned off the computer to see if it would
 fix it. When I turn on the computer the ASUS screen shows up and shows that I can press DEL or F2 to enter UEFI BIOS setting. Then the Windows logo shows up and displays a spinning loading icon underneath it. After than it goes to a black screen. I can't see
 my mouse cursor and my keyboard doesn't work at all. The same black screen shows up when I press DEL or F2 to enter UEFI BIOS setting. I've tried to fix this by putting Windows 10 on a USB. The problem is the USB won't boot when I start the computer and I
 can't get into UEFI BIOS setting to make the USB boot when I start the computer because it only goes to a black screen just like when I normally start the computer. I've looked all over and I can't find a topic exactly like mine.

            My computer tells me to press either DEL or F2 to enter UEFI BIOS. Once I press either of those buttons the screen turns black and my mouse and keyboard don't work.

<h2>            Windows Cannot Access &#92;&#92;PC</h2>
                    I have seven Windows 10 pro computers on a home network.&nbsp; All computers have been accessible on the network via explorer since Windows 10 came out until March 2019.&nbsp; One computer now cannot be accessed and gives the error message 0x080070035 Windows cannot
 access this PC when network explorer is used on another computer on the network to access it.&nbsp; The computer is shown in the Network folder but I get the error when I try to open it. I have reviewed and tried all recommendations I could find without success.&nbsp;
 Any new suggestions would be appreciated.

<p>Thanks for your rapid response Andre, I have worked through all of the recommendations that you have made and still get the same error message. Interesting that I use this PC as my Plex server and I can still access all my shared content on the subject computer
 via Plex from the networked computers.&nbsp; The shared folders all show up when clicking on the computer icon in the network group on the subject computer but not from any other computer.&nbsp; However when I try to access the shared folders using the IP address on
 the subject computer, I get the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also seems strange that it is just on this one computer as the other 6 computers on the network are all up to date with the latest MS updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where to go from here.</p>

<p>I have a sewing friend who wants to install a program for her Bernina sewing machine on her laptop. It installed fine on her 32-bit laptop running Windows 7, but now she has a 64-bit Dell running Win7&nbsp;Ultimate, and it does not install. When I tried to do

<p>I tried installing it a variety of ways--the attempt shown was from a flash drive, but I got the same error no matter what I did.</p>
<p>I took the flash drive to work and was able to install the software on my 64-bit desktop machine without a wimper, so I know it works on the Win7 Ultimate 64-bit version. (And of course, I didn't log the 882 event.) Even though she has Ultimate, BitLocker
 is not installed, although it is on my desktop.</p>
<p>Is anyone familiar with this event? If I could just figure out what policy is invoked and change it, I am sure this would install fine for her.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi MochaB,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Software Restriction Policy Notification displays a message to&nbsp;the user and writes an event to the event log
 when the user attempts to run a program<br />
that is not allowed by the policy. If the software restriction policy is enforced on all users, then messages will be displayed to both standard users and administrators. If the policy is enforced on all users except local administrators, then users logged
 on with administrative credentials will not be notified<br />
as the policy will not apply to the programs that they run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the policy is enforced on all users and the Basic User default security level is selected, local administrators
 may not be able to run programs that require administrative credentials unless those programs are specifically excluded from the rule.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Right click on the software installation file and click on “Run as administrator”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn’t help, then follow these steps:<br />
1. Click on start and then click control Panel.<br />
2. Open Administrative Tools.<br />
3. Open Local Security Settings. <br />
4. Click Software Restriction Policies. <br />
5. If no software restrictions are defined, right click the Software Restriction Policies node and select New Software Restriction Policy<br />
6. Double click Enforcement <br />
7. Select "All users except local administrators" <br />
8. Click OK <br />
9. Reboot the computer.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, your question is that when using other apps, Skype for Business pops up suddenly. If anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>To isolate the issue from sever and the client, I’d like to confirm the following details:<br />
1.Do you encounter any issue when login to Skype for Business?<br />
2.Do you get any error when you communicate with other users?</p>
<p>If the answers are no, the root cause could be related to the client, I suggest you turn to our

This seems to indicate an invalid email address...<br />
